24 May 2017,joshbarton15,2," So many dick jokes...
","It's fair to say that Baywatch was never a great television show. Sure, it was popular but for reasons very different to it actually being a quality show. It was trashy as hell and combined slow-motion with a number of scantily clad supermodels running down the beach in bathing suits so no surprises at all that it attracted viewers.

28 May 2017,seanmitchelmore,8," Really depends on what you're looking for..
","Baywatch is super cheesy, low brow, campy, ridiculous, etc, etc.....but you know what? That's enjoyable sometimes! You don't knowingly buy a ticket to a movie like this and then go write a review afterwards complaining about plot, teenage boy humour, and character development. hahaha. I had low expectations, shut my brain off at the door, and enjoyed this movie for what it was.",/review/rw3721341/?ref_=tt_urv

26 May 2017,bkrauser-81-311064,6," Baywatch is Awash in Suck
","It's a warm, beautiful day on the beach. The pristine waves crash gently against the sand as the sun-kissed folk of Southern Florida come out to play. Lifeguard Post 1 stands like a sentinel - its windows permanently cocked forward towards the horizon. There's a change in the wind. A wind surfer looses control of his sail and is catapulted upward towards the sky before plummeting, head first into a coral reef. He's knocked unconscious...all seems lost. Then Mitch Buchannon (Johnson) appears on the scene.",/review/rw3721341/?ref_=tt_urv

22 May 2017,CANpatbuck3664,8," Baywatch is Uneven and Silly but It's Also Funny and Entertaining
","*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Mitch Buchannon (Dwayne Johnson) is the head lifeguard and public face of Baywatch. He takes his job seriously and he not only saves lives but he's also beloved by everyone on the beach. The story picks up on a day where new recruits are trying out to enter Baywatch's training program. We meet a few of the possible finalists, they range from the enthusiastic Summer Quinn (Alexandra Daddario) to underdog Ronnie Greenbaum (John Bass). He's a regular on the beach but he spends his time drooling over lifeguard CJ Parker (Kelly Rohrback). Another potential lifeguard, Matt Brody (Zach Efron) is a former 2 time Olympic gold- medallist who has fallen on hard times. The head of the Baywatch program; Captain Thorpe (Rob Huebel) is shoving Brody down Buchannon's throat as he's only available to them through Brody's community service. Adding to Buchannon's troubles is business mogul Victoria Leeds (Priyanka Chopra). She's swiftly gaining more power in the Bay area through her newly purchased club. Will Mitch be able to properly indoctrinate his chosen recruits and get to the bottom of Victoria's shady behaviour? ",/review/rw3721341/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2017,phanthinga,9," Well i laugh a lot
","Baywatch is a action comedy movie about a bunch of bad ass lifeguard at the beach saving people life while kicking drug dealer ass staring Dwayne Johnson A.K.A The Rock one of the most likable action hero of this generation with a cast full of young hot actors that always show up with close up slow mo boobs bouncing and muscle flexing plus a ton of dick joke enough to make you chuckle through out the movie so i need to ask you guys a question:How the hell you not like it?.Seriously i'm may not grew up with the TV series but going to this movie knowing it a super terrible cheesy 90s fest based on the trailer and i get all that so why all the fuss here?The movie is god damn entertaining from start to finish,the cast is energetic and have well chemistry with each other,the comic relief guys played by Jon Bass used to be the most annoying part of this kind of movie but i find him surprisingly good at.It a fun summer guilty pleasure movie in the core",/review/rw3721341/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2017,trublu215,1," Much like the show it's based on, this is STUPID!
","A little over 20 years ago, the world was introduced to Baywatch the TV show. This was an awesome show for any pre-pubescent boy or middle aged pervert who liked to watch Pamela Anderson run in slow-mo. Much like the TV show, the film is all brawn and beauty and doesn't have a brain cell to its name. Starring Zac Efron, Alexandra Daddario and Dwayne Johnson, the cast can't even save this atrocious excuse for a film. It is far from the comedic romp that was promised in the trailers. The film takes itself seriously and then other times it knows it is a parody. The only problem is, the filmmakers and writers can't decide on a tone. This really killed the film in more ways than one. Those who are expecting another Neighbors will be sorely disappointed and those of you wanting to see Dwayne Johnson kick some ass, you get to see that a little bit but there is much MUCH more to this film that could have been. I normally would go into a longer review and really talk about the film itself but I stopped myself short of this because any longer than this and it would simply be a waste of time, much like this film.",/review/rw3721341/?ref_=tt_urv

25 May 2017,dave-mcclain,1," Almost everything in ""Baywatch"" is ridiculous and unfunny.
","Fun fact: The original TV show ""Baywatch"" was cancelled after only one season. True story. Ratings for NBC's skin-tastic lifeguards-save-L.A. action-drama placed it in 73rd place out of 103 shows for the 1989-1990 television seasonÂ… and its studio (GTG) went out of business. But, as Norm McDonald used to remind us from the desk of SNL's Weekend Update, ""Germans LOVE David Hasselhoff."" (And people in lots of other countries do too!) Keeping the show from becoming a footnote in TV history, series star David Hasselhoff brought it to first-run syndication, where it ran from 1991-1999. Having become an international sensation, it then continued in a new setting, with a mostly new cast and under a new name, ""Baywatch Hawaii"", for two more seasons. Along the way, the show became a major part of the careers of Hasselhoff, Pamela Anderson, Alexandra Paul, Yasmine Bleeth, Carmen Electra, Brooke Burns, Parker Stevenson and many others. Given the show's small screen stamina and enduring popularity, it seems natural that the TV show ""Baywatch"" would eventually become the movie ""Baywatch"" (R, 1:56), much like ""CHiPs"" earlier in 2017. Unfortunately, much like ""CHiPs"", the big screen ""Baywatch"" sucks.",/review/rw3721341/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2017,bunsen2019,8," Great looking and funny cast. Plot is secondary but that's not the point anyway....
","Mitch and his crew protect a crime ridden beach, encountering murder, drug dealing, blackmail and romance. Brody is perfectly cast and played by Zac Efron, as washed up ""vomit comet"" Olympic swimmer (Ryan Lochte esque) who blows his career by vomiting in the pool during the Olympic relay. Now he finds himself down on his luck, offered a job on a reluctant Mitch's lifeguard crew. Mitch challenges young Brody with inventive belittling nicknames and endurance course antics. It is an amazing thing to see the fitness challenge between the equally impressive Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron. Somehow, I really believe they could carry two refrigerators on their shoulders. Ronnie is a new character actor, and is incredibly funny as the ""IT"" lifeguard recruit and love interest of ""slow mo"" hot girl with daddy issues CJ. Priyanka Chopra does not quite hit the mark as the gorgeous villain who is buying up beachfront and running a drug empire. Still, the cast appear to have had great fun and good chemistry in the filming of this movie. The theatre I attended was full and there was plenty of spontaneous laughing throughout. I love this kind of humour, no it's not high brow and the plot has holes but it's so much fun to watch. Recommend!",/review/rw3721341/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2017,TheLittleSongbird,1," Should be thrown into the bay and never watched again
","Okay, that sounds rather harsh but to me 'Baywatch' really was that bad. The original series was not exactly great, was very silly and can be easily criticised, but it at least was from memory sort of fun and had some campy charm.",/review/rw3721341/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2017,wotsonurmind,2," Writers are under-aged morons who have no clue about comedy
","When will Hollywood comedies of this decade hire writers who at least have a clue of comedy? Why hire immature morons who think the idea of a dick is funny and can replace a good script. Hollywood seems to be obsessed with male nudity and full frontal at that in this decade.If it is in the right context it could be funny but haven't seen one this decade. What happened to the writers of 40-year old virgin,knocked up,etc? This movie is a pathetic excuse for a comedy and is particularly sad since there was an opening for a new franchise which has been firmly grounded. Avoid if you are lucky and watch 'Central Intelligence' if you want to see the Rock in a good comedy!",/review/rw3721341/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2017,cruise01,7," All fun until the jokes are repetitive and a lifeless plot.
","Baywatch is in all a fun summer blockbuster action comedy with no brains and no plot. Based on a campy TV series, which I was once a fan of. Baywatch tries to be a little too much like 21 Jump Street, all stupid humor and a thin plot about drugs being smuggled in its concept. In this case, about lifeguards trying to solve the case and stop drugs from washing up on their beach. Sure, there is plenty of eye candy for men and ladies; you get the ladies in bikinis running in slow mo and than you have Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron shirtless if the female audiences find them to be eye candy.

28 May 2017,jon.h.ochiai,7," Beauty doesn't conquer Stupid
","In ""Baywatch"" beauty doesn't conquer stupid. It ends up a tie at best, on points. People Magazine's 2017 Sexiest Man Alive Dwayne Johnson, ""The Rock"", stars as iconic lifeguard Mitch Buchannon in Director Seth Gordon's ""Baywatch""â€”his recreation and homage to the worldwide TV syndication phenom. All the lifeguards, sans one by narrative, are stunningly beautiful. In reassuring self-mockery Gordon vividly recreates the classic ""slow-mo"" running shots of his stars in homage to the original series. In the introductory beach sequence, wannabe life guard Ronnie, played by charming soft-bodied geek Jon Bass, gazes longingly at the crush of his life C.J. Parker, played by beautiful, sweet former Sports Illustrated Model Kelly Rohrbach, as she runs emerging from the ocean. ",/review/rw3721341/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'm a giant fan of Kelly Rohrbach. I met her three times and at the latest time I asked her about her role on Baywatch. She said she was nervous about it, I told her she would do well and I'd be there in the theaters to watch her film debut. Fast forward a year, and this has happened. Kelly was so great and unbelievably sexy in the film which is great. That's really not all though. I'm not gonna lie I had a bit of a blast watching this film.

23 May 2017,Ramascreen,4," Unlimited supply of sex appeal
","Here's my review of #Baywatch movie and the reason why I don't hate the film as much as someone who probably over analyzes it is that I wasn't expecting this to be any better than the long-running cheesy TV series that I did grow up watching. If you recalled, the show was basically just about attractive people in swimsuits patrolling a beach and it had the occasional soap opera romance. It produced such hot babes as Pamela Anderson, Brooke Burns, and Yasmine Bleeth. Teenage boys watched it religiously whenever they can't get their hands on a copy of the latest Playboy magazine.",/review/rw3721341/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2017,Xenopickles,7," Not a single f#@! was given!
","I don't review movies too often, but when I saw all the horrible reviews for this movie, I felt the need to write my own. I have a feeling that most of the people who rated this movie poorly haven't seen the movie at all (like a lot of ratings on IMDb) or just have no sense of humor at all. Is this movie action-packed? Yes! Does the movie include a lot of dick jokes, bouncing boobs and swearing? Yes! Did I enjoy the movie? Oh yeah! Will it be an Oscar winner? Of course not! It's not that kind of movie. People take things too seriously.",/review/rw3721341/?ref_=tt_urv

","Who wrote the expletive filled script? A 15 Yr old boy high on something? Appalling language throughout, teenage style sex jokes, just embarrassingly awful, the only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is for the slow mo scenes which are plain funny and the beach scenes, makes me realise how much better Australian beaches are.",/review/rw3721341/?ref_=tt_urv

","Baywatch is an elite team of lifeguards patrolling the beaches of Emerald Bay. They are led by their leader Mitch Buchannon (Dwayne Johnson), second-in-command Stephanie Holden (Ilfenesh Hadera), and goddess CJ Parker (Kelly Rohrbach). Ronnie Greenbaum (Jon Bass) is in love with CJ. He and Summer Quinn (Alexandra Daddario) are two of the new recruits competing for a place on the team. Matt Brody (Zac Efron) is an arrogant Olympian who is forced on Mitch. Despite being only lifeguards, Mitch is constantly on the lookout for anything endangering his beloved beach.

4 June 2017,subxerogravity,5," This was actually a mistake.
","That's saying a lot cause The Rock is in it, and I mean you can't go wrong with the Rock and the Rock can do no wrong. He was funny as the head of the lifeguards who seems to take his job more serious than needed. Plus Zac Efron was funny too, as his foil, a hot shot Olympic champion who does not understand why the lifeguards are acting like cops. Plus I love Alexandra Daddario, such a beautiful woman, but a surprise to me that I found the women they got to play Pamela Anderson's part in the film more stunning, but she had an unfair advantage being next to Jon Bass who plays the lifeguard who looks nothing like the other beautiful people but had some funny bits that she got to tag along in, which made her look better.",/review/rw3721341/?ref_=tt_urv
