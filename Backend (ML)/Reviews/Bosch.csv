28 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," Can't say enough about how great this show is!
","Bosch has to be one of the best, most underrated crime dramas on tv. The writing and acting is what makes this show so special. It tells the story of a former special forces officer named Harry Bosch (Titus Welliver), who's now a homicide detective in Hollywood. He inspects suspicious deaths and is absolutely relentless in his pursuit of the truth. Titus Welliver is absolutely perfect as Harry Bosch! It went on for seven incredible seasons and the fans loved it so much that they brought it back already with Bosch: Legacy, which is just as good. I can't say enough great things about this amazing show so just go watch for yourself, you won't be disappointed.",/review/rw2967823/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2020,Supermanfan-13,9," Highly Recommended!
","Bosch is one of the best police dramas there is and that's saying something considering there are about a thousand to choose from! It's a gritty, suspenseful drama where the acting is terrific! Titus Welliver is absolutely perfect as Harry Bosch! It's sucks that this incredible show is ending after Season 7 but I guess it's better to go out on top than hang on too long. If you haven't seen this amazing show yet I highly recommend that you make the time to do so!",/review/rw2967823/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2021,deloudelouvain,8," Quality detective series.
","Bosch is one of those detective series you get hooked on. A lot of people will be sad to see this one ending. Seven seasons might seem long but every season has new cases and so it doesn't feel repetitive. It could have been going on for much more seasons if you ask me as the quality of the seasons remained equal. I have to say it's not the easiest show to follow. For that there is sometimes too much going on, which is not necessarily a bad thing but you have to be very attentive all the time. Also the use of slang and police lingo isn't always the easiest thing to understand if you're not familiar with it. That said Bosch is just quality. The cast is just perfect, all actors are very believable in their roles, the stories are addictive to follow, so yes I'm sad Bosch is finished. I guess they stopped because of the so-called pandemic, I can't see no other reason, as this show was always entertaining, even in the end.",/review/rw2967823/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2020,Fargomoviecritic,9," Maddie - Thank God for a Daughter Character that isn't a B.
","I just want to comment on Madison Lintz- who plays Maddie, not too hard to remember. She is the first daughter character I have seen in any Amazon Or Netflix show who isn't a serious B. She is thoughtful, nice and isn't overly dramatic (see Ozark and Bordertown for OVERLY DRAMATIC AND SERIOUS Bs). She actually cares about her father and mother but still acts like a teenager.
Thank you Bosch writers for developing a great young women who represents teens who aren't clueless and air heads which seem to be the easy way to stereotype teenage girls.",/review/rw2967823/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2014,face-819-933726,9," One LA detective who just wants to do the job, and a great team behind him.
","Nice start. This is a very solid drama with a great cast. Still dealing with a situation from a case 2 years earlier Bosch the hard boiled, but seemingly very together homicide detective spends every free minute he can get back on the job whether he is allowed to or not. The pilot is very good, it has a Low Winter sun vibe, but less dirty cop-ish, and all LA. The supporting cast are mostly veterans, and even some child actors you may recognize. All in I found that I Enjoyed this first take, and hope that the show continues right where it is, I can see very little that could need improving. I recommend this to anyone who likes the realistic shows like True Detective, and Banshee. Not so much action, but the heart is there.",/review/rw2967823/?ref_=tt_urv

1 April 2016,deloudelouvain,8," Quality mystery detective series.
","My wife reads a lot of books from Michael Connelly and if the books are as good as this series then I might consider reading them as well. Because Bosch is really a quality show. Detective series with a couple of mysteries are most of the time entertaining when they are well made. This one is for sure one of the better ones. Easy to follow, with good actors, and with an excellent storyline. There are enough twists and turns to keep you interested for a whole season. Titus Welliver as harry Bosch is a delight to watch. I honestly hope there will be a lot more seasons. I just saw the first two complete seasons in a week time and I can't wait for the next season. Quality!",/review/rw2967823/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2022,amkn75,8," Not the fancy stuff like other shows, and that's a good thing

6 October 2022,saemlb,10," Did not like it at first...
","I tried Bosch when it first started to air and didn't care for it. I recently gave it another try and was hooked. It is one of the finest TV shows I have ever watched. The cast is simply amazing. Of course Welliver makes the perfect Bosch. I have read all the books and he does about a perfect job. What makes it a great series is that the rest of the cast is just as good. Crate and Barrel provide so much fun to the show. Hector is a perfect fit for J Edger. I cannot say that Reddick is my.favorite cast member, but he is so good in the role of Irving that I would watch the show simply for his performances. Aquino adds so much realism and support. I do miss Calderon as Jimmy though.",/review/rw2967823/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2022,Ed-Shullivan,8," Bosch Vs Ray Donovan and Bosch winds hands down. No Contest
","Mrs. Shullivan and I blitzed both TV crime series starting first with Ray Donovan and then moving on to watch Bosch. Thank goodness we watched them in that order as we enjoyed every single episode of Bosch and the much stronger and varying story lines. Unlike many TV crime series where the lead actors are some twenty-something studs and beauty queens, Bosch is lead by the middle aged actor Titus Welliver who walks with a gimpy leg and lives by a set of internal rules that do not include framing criminals or hiding and/or creating false evidence.",/review/rw2967823/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2022,edmiller-16400,9," One of the best police shows ever!
","Really love this show which I discovered on Prime by accident just a few weeks ago while I was searching for the next thing to watch. I can't believe how underrated this show is - nobody I know has ever ever mentioned it. It's not Breaking Bad or The Wire (hence just nine stars), but it sure is awesome and highly addictive. I got hooked to it from the very first episode. Started watching it during my European holiday and instead of enjoying beautiful sunny weather by the sea drinking my Pepsi Max, I missed some great tanning opportunities to watch this - and didn't regret it!ðŸ˜€ What also helped was to see several prominent characters from The Wire here as well - most notably, Lance Reddick (former Lt Daniels) and Jaime Hector (former Marlo Stanfield) in a different role here.",/review/rw2967823/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2021,Blumanowar,10," Wow, what a great series... just what I've been looking for
","I've just watched the first two seasons in two weeks but I had to go on and post a review... this is a great old fashioned cop show; however, it's several levels above my old favorite 'cop shows' like Hill Street Blues, etc ( and that dates me a bit lol) but that's a series that had similar style but is so inferior to Bosch.",/review/rw2967823/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2020,wandernn1-81-683274,9," Gotta Love The Hollywood Precinct!!!!

28 October 2016,Hitchcoc,9," Could Have a Real Upside
","I first remember Titus Welliver from a docudrama on the day Lincoln was shot. I believe he played a Booth conspirator. From then on he has played many heavies. He has that angry look about him that works well for villains. In the first episode, the Michael Connelly policeman is chasing a serial killer. When the man pulls a gun on him (or appears to) he shoots him. Now, a couple years later, he finds himself under investigation. He is seen as a loose cannon because five people have died at his hand. This, however, is the first time he has been questioned about the validity. Being the guy he is, he ignores the order to stay away from any LAPD cases. When a child's bone is found on a hill, he can't help himself. We are made privy to Bosch's childhood and get some hints as to why this case is so important to him. Of course, he is riding into trouble. Police work for him is his whole life and he is risking it all. His bosses would love to be rid of him as well. Welliver really does a number on his role. I've read a few of the books and think this could work very well.",/review/rw2967823/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is a well acted, well written and well casted show. Most all of the scenarios were believable, except for his undercover episode in the dessert..
I hope in the follow up show with Bosch, he finds a way to get chief Irivne fired!!",/review/rw2967823/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2020,mgwilcox,9," Better with each season
","Best police drama in decades and improves with each season . Lots of insights into law enforcement good and bad
But above all fair.
Another possitive is that this his show assumes its view is fairly intelligent sure like all shows they have to do a few magic tricks to make the story move forward at more than a snails pace but they do so in a way that is not insulting to the viewer .
Great show looking forward to a season 7 .",/review/rw2967823/?ref_=tt_urv

30 June 2021,jeffpsy,10," The Failure of Season 7
","Bosch is a fine series. I have heartily enjoyed virtually all of its 68 episodes since it premiered in Feb, 2014. That said, I have to call out the show for the manner in which it insulted its audience in the Season 7 finale. Consider the scenario: An arson has been committed and a 10 year old girl has died. The person ultimately responsible for the arson is under FBI protection, because the FBI has bigger fish to fry. A disgruntled Harry Bosch disagrees with this FBI decision, feeling that justice will not be served in the case of the arson. So in essence he decides to kidnap the individual under FBI protection. The manner in which he does this is so unbelievable as to resemble a comic book. Further, for his efforts all Bosch does is get two people killed in the process. Bosch's attempt to undermine an ongoing FBI operation is absurd, poorly thought out, devastating in its consequences, and probably criminal in nature. However it's clear that the show wants us to regard Harry's actions as those of a great moral crusader. The notion that Harry could just walk away from causing the death of two individuals without facing criminal charges insults our intelligence. A better ending would have been to have the FBI operation go through successfully, but still leave Harry so frustrated and morally outraged that he turns in his badge. That would've made far more sense, and still would have legitimately set him up as a private detective for the upcoming spinoff IMDB series. The Bosch writers missed the boat on this one.",/review/rw2967823/?ref_=tt_urv

23 July 2020,rafa-a-t-silva,9," What can I say about this series?
","Characters so humanized and with real problems that make you identify with them.
Intertwined stories and plots that make you learn a lot about how the judicial, police and government systems work, with all their bureaucracies and facets.
And a very good soundtrack that influenced me in a good way listen to Jazz.
I recommend this series without reservations.",/review/rw2967823/?ref_=tt_urv

12 February 2014,c_l_costa,10," More please!
","As a huge fan of Michael Connelly's Bosch books, I was looking forward to seeing this pilot and I wasn't disappointed. Titus Welliver is the perfect Bosch, the rest of the cast are just as brilliant and the writing and production are both spot on. The story line is in fact two Bosch books woven into one and it has been done very cleverly. Bosch fans have been waiting for twenty years for this character to be put onto film but for me, it was worth the wait. I would dearly love to see this made into a complete series. Titus Welliver is as brilliant as always and has the tormented look behind his eyes that any Bosch fan would expect to see. He may not physically resemble Harry but that is soon forgotten.

17 February 2014,BumbleBoo,10," Go Bosch
","Just loved this gritty start adapting Michael Connolly's crime series with Harry Bosch as the central character. Acting is great and can't wait to see his characters and stories transferred to the silver screen. Titus Welliver, who plays an LAPD homicide detective, is just the right choice of actor that one imagines when reading Connelly's books, he could have stepped right off the page! The scene settings around LA make me want to go back and visit all the places i missed on my holiday there! My only criticism of this pilot is that stories from 3 books were used to weave into one story about a serial killer. One book can stand on its own but I understand the logic of immediately trying to capture the audience in this pilot. I really recommend this series to viewers who enjoy a good who ""dunnit!""",/review/rw2967823/?ref_=tt_urv
