26 August 2021,yusufpiskin,9," Adrien Brody King
",Finally someone who understands the spirit of the Stephen King books has arrived. I was very happy when I saw the name Adrien Brody as an actor in this project. My impatience increased when I found out that he was the producer. The quality of Adrien Brody shows itself in the first two episodes.,/review/rw7284851/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2021,chaakar,9," Atmospheric, potent.
","On episode 4 (but IMDb won't let me rate it yet for some reason) where it seems the show begins to really pick up. Haven't ever read any Stephen King, and I've liked some of his previous TV adaptations, some not so much. In this one, so far, things have been layered on to the drama/mystery very nicely, creating a very dark cool & creepy atmosphere.",/review/rw7284851/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2021,paul_haakonsen,9," Phenomenal show...
","When I stumbled upon the 2021 TV series ""Chapelwaite"", I must admit that I was immediately interested in watching it. Why? Well, I read that it was based on Stephen King's ""Jerusalem's Lot"" and also it had Adrien Brody on the cast list.",/review/rw7284851/?ref_=tt_urv

","As soon as I heard this show was based on the short story ""Jerusalem's Lot"" by Stephen King, I knew I had to see it. In the 'writing for TV' room for Amazon Prime Video's ""Chapelwaite"" sat Jason and Peter Filardi along with Scott Kosar and Declan De Barra. They adapted the book well for the small screen.",/review/rw7284851/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2021,Almost_Soldout,10," Dark and promising, worth to watch!
","Usually I am not into darker historical series but this one looks very interesting. Intriguing from the first episode. Some twists looks awkward but will see where that take us. Recommended if you are into dark, moody, scary and mystery shows.",/review/rw7284851/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2021,scootmandu-662-305600,8," Classic gothic horror makes a comeback.
","After seeing the first 4 episodes, I am happy to report that ""Chapelwaite"" is one of the most satisfying gothic horror series I have seen in some time.",/review/rw7284851/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2021,baharuka,7," Missed this type of horror
","If you're looking for classic horror and you're not a fan of scare scenes like me, you can give this one a try. I like Adrian Brody, haven't watched him in a long while and I enjoyed it. A good actor is a good actor! The show has this beautiful gothic atmosphere. The story is cliché and could definitely be much better, and the pace is pretty slow but I did watch the whole ten episodes in the end. I missed this kind of show, got tired of horror that tries to shake you and get you almost sick. There are still many gore scenes in this, beware, but nothing that made me want to turn my screen off. Halfway into the show, there's a revelation which I didn't expect but liked, and the ending was pretty good and interesting to me, part of it reminded me of an older show that I liked. Maybe better casting for some of the characters could have been done but it was still good.",/review/rw7284851/?ref_=tt_urv

28 October 2021,anthonyjlangford,7," Six episodes stretched to ten
","There's plenty said already about this series' negative and positive aspects so rather than repeating them for the sake of sharing my own views, I'll simply add that there's barely enough story to cover 6 episodes, let alone 10.",/review/rw7284851/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2022,Dr_Coulardeau,10," It might become a classic
","This series is adapted from Stephen King's short story ""Jerusalem's Lot,"" the first short story of the first collection of short stories by Stephen King, Night Shift (1975-1978). That was also the first short story or novel or story about vampires. It is the root story for the later novel Jerusalem's Lot (first published as an illustrated book in 1975) and as a novel under the title Salem's Lot in 1975 too.",/review/rw7284851/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2022,compmend,4," Textbook example of Presentism
","The show is beautifully shot, the locations exquisite and the music topnotch. The show fails miserably due to Presentism, where modern cultural ideas are transposed over a story from the 1850's creating a cringe woke-filled dialogue that is not authentic to the period and is eye-roll inducing and not entertaining...",/review/rw7284851/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2021,SnoopyStyle,6," brooding
","It's 1817 Massachusetts. A boy named Charles Boone barely escapes his father's murderous rage about the Worm. 33 years later, Captain Charles Boone (Adrien Brody) has his three children who have lived all their lives on his whaling ship. On her death bed, his wife pleads for their children to settle down and find a home on land. Charles receives an inheritance after his cousin's death. It's the mansion Chapelwaite and a saw mill in the small town of Preacher's Corners, Maine. There is a darkness there and the Boone family is hated by the locals. Rebecca Morgan (Emily Hampshire) is hired as the children's governess but she's secretly writing an expose on the family. There be worms.",/review/rw7284851/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2021,spasticfreakshow,3," poor writing, production, direction = waste of story + cast
","I love King, Emily Hampshire, Adrien Brody and period pieces, so this seemed like a sure thing. But...no. The uber-talented stars underwhelm, and it could be, at least in part, down to awful script and horrific direction, but the flaws in this go even deeper. Yes - the script is unsalvageable; you want to travel back in time to help them rewrite it in every scene. Yes - it drags on and not just in the first few episodes; it never suddenly gets better. The costumes are lovely, but as others have said, they look freshly starched and crisp, even when under attack or when digging in the dirt. There is actually no saving grace to this production. Save your time and watch something else.",/review/rw7284851/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2021,coex23,3," full of tropes, bad writing
","Honestly, I could care less about the changes in the story. It's a damn near 50 year old short story; how else would you stretch it into a lengthy television series other than major overhaul? No biggie.",/review/rw7284851/?ref_=tt_urv

30 August 2021,elliott78212,9," Eerie Chilling Gothic Thriller
",19 minutes in you can already feel the atmosphere sucking you into another world filled with smoke and shadows. The pacing is near perfect giving you time to absorb it all from the period costumes to the well made sets pieces. Adrien Brody delivers one if his finest performances as a widowed father with 3 children to raise. The darkness just below the surface in every scene is palpable. Considering the source material is thin and mainly a series of letters. The writers and Producers have done an excellent and believable job creating Preachers Corner and its inhabitants. This a true and faithful Stephen King adaptation. It feels like him and if you watch the original Mini-Series from 1979 of Salems Lot of which this is a prequel the both have that same pace and tone. Be prepared have your popcorn and blanket. As of August 27 there are 4 episodes available on demand. This may be the best mini series to date by EPIX.,/review/rw7284851/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2021,dk777,1," Chapelwaite : Missed Opportunity
",A series that unfortunately did not fulfill its potential and set off right at the beginning towards the predictable path of mediocrity and clichés typical of today's film production.,/review/rw7284851/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2021,pranay_misra,8," Good, but not great, yet...
","I have read Jerusalems lot and salems lot both and was eagerly waiting for this series. While it takes the basic premise from the short story, lots of diffrnt characters are introduced here. Now the setting is good, atmosphere is also fine. There is mysterios illness in the town and everyone suspects Boone for it although the present family has just arrived and the previos ones died an year ago.",/review/rw7284851/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2021,jegd-847-631407,2," It's not scary and the charcaters make stupid decisions.
","Here we had an opportunity to borrow from Stephen King and then do whatever we wanted with it. I really wish the writers of Chapelwaite had watched the 1975 Salem's Lot, the two-part miniseries that aired on CBS. It was a little cheesy in some parts and sure it's dated, but damn if those vampires didn't scare the crap out of me... The creepy boy floating outside his friend's window. The caretaker sitting in that rocking chair. The non-verbal big bad crashing through the window. I wish I had a copy of the original, because it was actual horror. There isn't one thing terrifying about the Chapelwaite series. Most of the action happens during the day. A cloudy day where the tall bad hair cut vampire walks around giving speeches. There's other vampires with minimal makeup and cheap fake teeth, but they're waltzing around doing dialogue like they're eagerly waiting for an Amazon delivery. It's also very slow paced, without an ounce of suspense, and dumb people making really stupid decisions. ""Hey, these vamps want this book I found in a cemetery they can't enter ... hmm, let's strap the book to my chest and go home with it."" A child would recognize how stupid this is, but *heck* we gotta setup an ending somehow. Ugh.",/review/rw7284851/?ref_=tt_urv

6 October 2021,elizrug,7," Enjoyable except for one thing
","Apple Girl was played by an actress that would be better off in Sharknado. Her looks and mannerisms don't fit the story at all. Everyone else looks like they could be from that era, while Apple Girl gives me plastic vibes, like is the actress the girlfriend of one of the producers? And she had eye makeup on. Come on. Way to ruin the ambiance with her closeups.",/review/rw7284851/?ref_=tt_urv

",I wasn't taken with this to start with. The characters and acting are pretty uninspired. Adrian Brody is no exception here. I might have kept watching it for a while to see if it got better but it set in such low lighting that I got tired of straining my eyes.,/review/rw7284851/?ref_=tt_urv
