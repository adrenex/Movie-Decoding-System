10 January 2022,TxMike,," A Hallmark movie in another universe.
","This is a novel concept for a story, when you die you remain in a type of limbo until you find a real soul mate among the other dead ""single"" people. The problem is the script, it is written by an amateur who has little imagination for interesting dialog. As a result he frequently tosses in disingenuous dialog and vulgar language as if that would make it seem edgy.",/review/rw7934963/?ref_=tt_urv

29 January 2022,jennifer626,5," Interesting concept, mediocre execution
","The plotline was promising and novel: a dysfunctional bachelor must find his soulmate after he's already died. Production values were surprisingly high for this low-budget film. The biggest problem was an amateurish script that was intermittently predictable, redundant and woefully inadequate. The movie would also have benefitted from a male lead with more charisma and authenticity. Christina Ricci was fine.",/review/rw7934963/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2021,julie-130-418956,3," Almost good...
","This movie had potential to be a really good film but it never hit the marks. Dialog, acting and humor was just off the entire time. If it was just a little better at every turn it would have been a great movie but it just fell short the entire way through. Too many bad choices with direction, lines etc. Just not a great film at all. Watchable if you are extremely bored with nothing else on, but not worth your time otherwise. Bummer because it had potential.",/review/rw7934963/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2021,quabalah69,7," Thought provoking 6.75/10
","I enjoyed this movie, it posed questions thst made you think and feel in a new way, always a good thing. The writing was a little off, some things didnt tie up and the end seemed a little confused, I would never have guessed it was an indie film, however overal it was well filmed and acted and generally a good watch.",/review/rw7934963/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2022,info-90701,3," Proof of a few things . . .
","1 - That Actors (Writers and Filmmakers) constantly do stories about, well Actors and themselves. They are way too impressed with themselves and think they are interesting enough for the rest of us to care about these endless expressions of being, well, Actors.",/review/rw7934963/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2021,A_Different_Drummer,5," An honest review from an IMDB Top Reviewer
","10/10? Not a chance. The film starts with a 4 minute monologue from the protagonist Michael (played by Andy Karl) as he sets up his backstory to the audience. This is a critical component of the film, almost a litmus test, because you need to decide right away if your idea of entertainment is having Karl's voice in your ear for the next 2 hours. If not, stop right there. If you are OK with it, then writer/director Harry Greenberger will offer a film which looks and feels more like a stageplay; and, if you get to the end, will offer you some insights on the real nature of LOVE. The entire production screams LOW BUDGET INDIE, suggesting that ""Hereafter"" (orig. Released as ""Faraway Eyes"") is more of a watch-on-an-overseas-flight film than anything else. Only Ricci shines -- she literally never gives an uninteresting performance. Those fake 10/10 reviews are demeaning to the production and the audience both.",/review/rw7934963/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2022,sjschluet,3," Cliche, and trying too hard
","The writing, the music, the trying-to-be-dramatic scenes-- they just did not feel genuine. There were a few good moments, but overall it dragged on. The portrayal of what romance or falling in love is was disappointing, and the characters' behavior and choices toward the end of the movie will leave you mumbling at the screen ""why don't you just...""",/review/rw7934963/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2021,imdb-45281,8," Funny, quirky, Indie allegory for modern love
","A funny, quirky, Indie allegory for modern love in the city. If you can accept the tongue-in-cheek premise that you must have a soul mate to pass into the afterlife, you'll get the analogy of what it so often feels like to be single in the modern world.",/review/rw7934963/?ref_=tt_urv

21 June 2021,juanmuscle,10," I thought this was really nice...
","I really enjoyed it and the concept and the actors and the directing. I really liked the main guy , thought he was kinda funny. I heard someone say that it vexed him to have to open the movie with a big ol' monologue from him but I found it to be very telling and funny! What I didn't understand was the ending, so what happens to the bad guy , where does he go , does he need to find a psyciopathic ""SOUL"" - mate as well? I don't know but I also don't know why Christina Ricci was being such a duplicitous witch at the end, I mean why couldn't she just say , hey come with me we have a surprise , go into the other room problem solved. I also found it disturbing how ol' boy down there is just about to fall in love and he has to get sucked up into a void of nothingness , like really? But my favorite cameo in all the world had to be Mike Bocchetti , chilling on a park-bench reading but he got no lines, damnz! But all in all, I thought this was cute fun neat story , I would highly recommend and say good job people!",/review/rw7934963/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2021,johnpmoseley,6," I wish it was better
","Its premise is very accurate about how it feels to find or not find love - like the universe itself is welcoming or rejecting you. A couple of the reviews here call it offensive, the idea that you have to find your soulmate to get to heaven. I think they're shooting the messenger. It isn't fair and that's just like life, if not death.",/review/rw7934963/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2021,warren-87235,7," Needed more polish, but pretty good, overall
","I actually rather enjoyed Faraway Eyes. It's got an interesting premise, and it manages pretty well on a clearly low budget. The acting from the two leads is good, and Christina Ricci is suitably 'otherworldly' in her limited role.",/review/rw7934963/?ref_=tt_urv

14 March 2022,soraderyu,2," Wasted Potential
","It was a gross disappointment with a limit viewpoint and weak, contradictive script. With its depressing perspective of how both life and the ""hear after"" it gives a grim view of the writers interpretation of the afterlife. They spend the entire movie telling you it ""doesn't work that way"" only to change their minds at the end. The characters were dull and it was difficult to find yourself invested their success. It lacks passion and hope. But the most disappointing aspect was the shallow nature of the plot implying the pointlessness of it all. It could have been so much more.",/review/rw7934963/?ref_=tt_urv

18 June 2021,deefabulous,9," ethereal and unique
","I'm a huge Christina Ricci fan so I automatically love anything she's in, but this movie caught me off guard in a good way. It's really different, it makes you think about life and love in an honest, realistic way. It's not like any other movie I've seen, uniquely strange and beautiful. The french actress that plays Honeybee is so stunning, I can't keep my eyes off of her, and she's also an amazing actress. And of course, Ricci never disappoints. Michael is also a lovable, imperfect character, very funny and full of life. It's a visually stunning love letter to New York too, I love the production design and cinematography.",/review/rw7934963/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2021,supermellowcali,3," Unimaginative romance
","As if written by a young child, this is a straight up romance without any surprises or creativity. Christina Ricci is great but (yawn) if you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie. The premise, btw -- find your soul mate or cease to exist -- is not only thoughtless but maybe even objectionable.",/review/rw7934963/?ref_=tt_urv

22 June 2021,tue-67683,10," The perfect fantasy Rom-Com full of insight
","I have waited a long time to find a smart, imaginative ""rom com"" with plenty of fantasy. I would include this film in the same league as ""the science of sleep"", which I loved very much. The writer & director is able to capture universal truths associated with love & loss. After a pandemic year of isolation in which we all faced our own mortality, there's something to be said for films that take a beloved and often easily digestible genre like romantic comedies, & twist them into something that can be moving, inspiring, transporting, fresh, & funny. This film is able to execute this wonderfully. It is as cute as it is poignant, exploratory as it is accessible, & unafraid to move through classic conflicts of morality, attachment, love, loss, & beyond while maintaining its wit & whimsy. This film dips into our nostalgia & desire without feeling forced or inauthentic. The acting was also fantastic & the chemistry between the actors makes for easy viewing. Bravo. I love this film so much & hope for more of this kind. It really spoke to me and the overwhelming thoughts so many of us have had to face in our search for meaning this past year. Highly recommend this film!",/review/rw7934963/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2022,Nevergivea10,5," Low budget ""Ghost"".
",Basically a similar story to Ghost. The actors did an alright job with the material they were given. You'll see a lot of little mistakes (e.g. Smoking in a New York restaurant in 2020). The average 5 rating is pretty accurate. It's definitely a chick flick though.,/review/rw7934963/?ref_=tt_urv
