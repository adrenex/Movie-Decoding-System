25 March 2021,dominicsibz,10," One of the best series you will ever watch
","Ivar the Boneless and Ragner are by far the best characters in this series but the story and journey of Ivar ""King"" The Boneless is by far the best. Season 6 really gave us a good ending, however I would have loved to see Ubber also moaning the death of Ivar. But from season 1 to 6, I was never disappointed but filled with emotion and unpredictable up until the very last.",/review/rw7785245/?ref_=tt_urv
