",Based on a true story it's a good film with the two main stars carrying the story well. Exciting and leads up to the surprise ending which was a little rushed imo.,/review/rw6408993/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2020,Phil_M_A_Kerr,9," Above Suspicion - classic 90's style thriller helmed by master
","Let's get the pun out of the way - this film is not above suspicion: small(relatively) budget, no huge action sequences, no special fx, no CGI dragons. OK, that's the pun out of the way.
In my hazy recollection, this type of thriller was popular in the 90's. The fact that this is a true story is frightening and it adds to the film's impact.
Emilia Clarke is really good. I've only seen her in Solo, Last Christmas, and Terminator Genisys. Sorry, haven't seen GoT yet. She's researched her character disturbingly well.
Phillip Noyce is a master wizard who chooses the right lenses and framing. He only amplifies the natural lighting. He understands how to pace a story. He knows the best ways to make a smaller film seem 'cinematic'.
The supporting cast are very good and cover a 'delightful' range of characters. Johnny Knoxville won't be nominated for an Oscar but he has an undeniable screen presence.
It's not a cinema classic, but there's plenty good in this modest production.
IF you can keep your expectations in check, you'll be rewarded.",/review/rw6408993/?ref_=tt_urv

8 September 2021,s-andra-1957,9," Great performances
","Emilia Clark is riveting in this true story tale. She really has a way with making you care about her character. Johnny Knox is very credible as her abusive ex and Jack Huston performance as the perfect promised life rounded out this very gritty story! The performances were great, and yes truth is weirder sometimes than fiction.",/review/rw6408993/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2020,monyalsaher-178-750847,8," Emilia Clarke was great

22 March 2020,alanl06-662-77020,10," Excellent Movie . Emilia Clarke et al SUPERB
","I cannot understand how ANYONE could rate this any lower than 8 . Great movie with deep human exploration of society and good and bad , combined with an intertwined love story and the morality of "" Good v Evil "" and the difficulties of distinguishing the two . Emelia Clarkes portrayal is riveting.. Echos of Saorsie Ronan in THE LOVELY BONES",/review/rw6408993/?ref_=tt_urv

14 July 2020,princedlungwane,7," The title is solid ⭐7
","A Sexy Stong Emotional ride. Really a story about her, the victim as she points out right on the outset, the FBI agent not so much. Sad that this story is true. Respect for the FBI agent though, sad none the less the avoidable consequences. Clear how easy it was for it to happen, according to the movie one really can not help but desire (Emilia) who does a very good job with all those emotions, also putting you in the agents shoes compassionately even for a minute. Watch it, experience it.",/review/rw6408993/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2020,Leofwine_draca,4," Aimless
","ABOVE SUSPICION is the usual cheap, greyed out, digitally shot FBI movie based on a true historical story which didn't really need to be told. It has a tame, TV movie of the week feel to it and is really only of interest to see GAME OF THRONES starlet Emilia Clarke playing against type with a southern accent. She's pretty effective and very different from Daenerys, which is the obvious intention, but the film surrounding that character is frankly dull. Jack Huston struggles with an underwritten lead role, director Phillip Noyce shows none of the talent for suspense he brought to the likes of DEAD CALM, and the whole thing just feels more than a little aimless.",/review/rw6408993/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2020,omendata,3," Cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear
","Why do they make these god awful ""true"" movies?
The story is minimal, mundane and holds zero interest.
Some of the male reviewers are giving this overly high marks just
because Emilia Clarke is in it - Really? Is that how we review movies these days?
Emilia Clarke does well but the rest of the cast are forgettable as is the movie!",/review/rw6408993/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2020,princedlungwane,7," Sexy Strong Emotional. ⭐ 7 (silent ⭐8 because if Emilias contribution)
","Definitely captured the lure with this actress, very seductive and attractive. Sad that it's a true story. I love true stories, this really delivered the feelings of all that happened as best it could for sure concerning the victim. The FBI agent not so much but yes. Don't miss out. Watch it.",/review/rw6408993/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2020,AntiFakeReviews,5," Emilia Clarke has proved she really got talent in a versatile way
","For the movie itself, it's just okay. The only shine in it is Emilia Clarke, who has miraculously changed her British accent to a Kentucky lowlife woman's twirling accent. It's not an easy to change the British accent to an American southern one, at least James Stewart or Matthew McConaughey could never did it. Her transformation in this movie is not just her accent, but her whole image has also completely adapted into a souther dame. It proved that she was a serious actor who could really put her heart into whatever the role she played.",/review/rw6408993/?ref_=tt_urv

",Above Suspicion is a factual 2019 drama starring The Longest Ride actor Jack Huston and Me Before You star Emilia Clarke (sporting a southern accent).

15 November 2020,Anna_Korol,3," it's not what it seems to be
","I didn't like the way this movie distorted the reality and true personalities of Mark Putnam (who wasn't that honest at all) and poor Susan. I searched some information about this story after i watched this movie (because it didn't reveal the background as much as it could have done) and was pretty shocked about the real events. This movie made me think that he was just an honest man who made a mistake and failed to fix it (and had a courage to make a confession) and she wasn't a reliable person who most likely lied about her pregnancy and would be killed anyway (if not by Mark then by anybody else). But it is quite the opposte in fact, so it would be better to search for facts than to watch this movie.",/review/rw6408993/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2020,Gordon-11,," Misleading title
","I keep waiting for action or thrill, but it just never came. The film is about a man who happens to be an agent, rather than a story about the agency. The title is misleading too. There's nothing to suspect in the story.",/review/rw6408993/?ref_=tt_urv
