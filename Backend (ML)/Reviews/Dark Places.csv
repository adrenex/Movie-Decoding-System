","""Wild Rose"" is perhaps a little formulaic, but I really liked the message it lands on at the end, which is that life is a series of compromises, and while few of us will ultimately achieve our dreams (if we have any to begin with), the alternative is not necessarily a life of dullness and misery.",/review/rw6778454/?ref_=tt_urv

",I've struggled to conjure sufficient praiseworthy adjectives to describe this movie but ultimately they would all relate to the sublime Jessie Buckley who provides us with a 'to die for' performance that takes your breath away and leaves you absolutely astounded and in awe that such talent exists - absolutely outstanding!,/review/rw6778454/?ref_=tt_urv

1 August 2019,ThomasDrufke,9," Three Chords and the Truth
","For a long time I always said that crime thrillers were my favorite genre, but it's becoming increasingly clear that music based movies have overtaken that genre with the new release of Wild Rose. A movie that will inevitably (but unfairly) be compared to 2018's A Star is Born because of the subject matter, but it tells a different story about a musicians dream to be a star. Starring the up and comer Jessie Buckley, Wild Rose is a hard edge but sweetly rounded coming of age tale of a single mother who dreams of leaving Glasgow for Nashville, because she believes it's the only place where she can become a country music star. For someone who doesn't like country music (and that's being kind), I was instantly entranced by Buckley's voice and the catchy but emotionally resonant songs throughout the feature. And much like her work in last year's 'Beast', Buckley proves she is someone to be reckoned with, and through her performance as Rose, that there's simply no place like home.",/review/rw6778454/?ref_=tt_urv

19 March 2019,muamba_eats_toast,8," Full of heart
",The whole story was excellently portrayed. Buckley excels both vocally and portraying the problems of so many in similar positions. It has ups and downs and doesn't shy away from challenging issues nor glorify them. Julie Walters alongside Buckley was perfect also. Although their greatness on set did outshine most of the supporting cast who had a daytime cheap tv drama feel about them although this did not take to much away. Also anything involving whispering Bob Harris has to be worth seeing. A feel good romp of a film.,/review/rw6778454/?ref_=tt_urv

","All the cast are great but Jessie Buckley is superb, portrayed a character which at times you could sympathise with, shake your head in disbelief and at the same time be urging her from the seat of your armchair to go for it! ""Peace in this house"" had me sobbing, the notes that Jessie hits, her tone beautiful. Dried my eyes and composed myself for the rest of the film and then left wiping my eyes again at the end of the last long; ""Glasgow (no place like home)"". Just wow!",/review/rw6778454/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2019,sbweightman,8," A funny and sad drama with some truly great acting performances full of passion and emotion.
","The story isn't that original in concept and has some minor pacing issues, but it also has a lot of depth as it shows the struggle to balance your dreams with your responsibilities. It has plenty of heart and toe tapping country music which keeps it entertaining and enjoyable throughout, although I felt a bit more could have been done with Glasgow and Nashville's cultures and settings.",/review/rw6778454/?ref_=tt_urv

","Rose-Lyn Harlan is an unpleasant woman who had 2 kids (whom she neglects horribly) before she was 18, who dreams of going to Nashville to be a 'country music star', and who resembles, both physically and musically (though not emotionally), Suzi Quatro, the 1970's pop singer. She also has a lot of good luck (and sponsors), otherwise this film would have no point. Her voice is good (not exceptional), but the music is very dated indeed.",/review/rw6778454/?ref_=tt_urv

It is more than a decent movie don't get me wrong, but it reminded me of how good the Bradley Cooper directed movie was - sorry is!

30 June 2020,blott2319-1,6," Great music with a decent story
","I've definitely tired of the glut of films about a recording artist who lets fame ruin them, so I guess I have to hand it to Wild Rose, because it takes a somewhat different path. Instead of watching her career drive her to drugs, alcohol, and irresponsibility, she starts out hooked on all that stuff. That's right, she is already a frustrating character that you kind of dislike from the first scene (when she's being released from jail.) Needless to say her career takes a somewhat different path as she seeks a career as a country singer, which isn't exactly the most common genre of music in Scotland. It took a long time for this movie to get me on the side of Rose, which I think is a problem when you're trying to center the entire film on her life. Even when she starts to get things right, it seems she is still misguided and making terrible decisions.",/review/rw6778454/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2020,pforrest-2,7," Worth a watch for Jessie Buckley's bravura performance
","The main character is a foul-mouthed impulsive hard-drinking ex-con neglectful mother of two with delusions of making it big in Nashville. She somehow is also a sympathetic character, and is beautifully played by Jessie Buckley. You might need subtitles occasionally to catch the full Glaswegian abuse and humour she manages to spout out. Other standouts are her two little children - remarkable performances by both - and a pretty impressive bit of character acting by Julie Walters as her despairing mum - complete with what sounded a decent accent, if a Sassenach can judge that.
As for the music and the plot.... it does the job but for me only occasionally hit the real emotional spot.",/review/rw6778454/?ref_=tt_urv

17 April 2019,Pairic,9," Storming Musical Drama
","Wild Rose: A storming film about Rose-Lynn (Jessie Buckley) an aspiring Glasgow Country singer. And it's definitely Country, she'll get annoyed if mention Country & Western. Rose-lynn is not someone to annoy or make angry, we meet after she is released from prison, electronically tagged. She swiftly assaults the singer who has replaced her in the Glasgow Grand Ole Opry and throws a drink over the manager. Rose is more than just feisty, she is talented but violent when she doesn't get her way. Her mother Marion (Julie Walters) has looked after Rose's children and still has to pick up the pieces when Rose inevitably breaks promises to them through getting drunk or practising singing. Rose's unreliability is as central to the film as is her aspiration to sing in the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. Rose works as a cleaner for Susannah (Sophie Okonedo) who through contacts arranges for her to meet the Country DJ Bob Harris (himself). She almost blows that by drinking on the train to London and losing her coat and bags.",/review/rw6778454/?ref_=tt_urv

4 October 2019,westsideschl,9," Buckley A Talent
","Many of the low star reviews were for either lack of subtitles or understanding the dialect. Buckley is Irish playing Scottish singing American Country. Of all the English dialects & accents around the world hers was exceptionally clear to N. American ears. There are some regional ones in the U.K. that are difficult, but not hers. Oh, this DVD did have subtitles.
What a talent Irish born Jessie Buckley is to not only sing, but act. And, in her many film/series appearances to portray/convey a range of characters with different national languages.
Plot: Overcoming personal problems; trying to be a mother & connecting w/her kids; joining multitudes in striving for a career as a singer. Feel good ending was nice,
but...
Liked her shoutout to Emmylou Harris & Gram Parsons (his death & consequent events might be an interesting backdrop).",/review/rw6778454/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2019,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7," The yellow-brick road doesn't go through Glasgow.
","'Wild Rose (2019)' is not so much 'rags to riches' as 'finding your voice', which is one of the things that gives it an edge over its competition. The other, I suppose, is its protagonist and her unique life circumstances. Sure, we've seen this kind of wannabe famous 'wild child' trope before but we haven't really seen it paired with a young mother contemplating the place of her dreams amongst those of her kids (which is, incidentally, something we've not seen that often at all). This is an interesting, gentle and nuanced contrast that's perhaps more satisfying in theory than in practice. That's because, while all the themes are quite unique and well-presented, the final result isn't much more than a rock-solid entry in its genre. I just mean that the sum of its parts is, perhaps, ever-so-slightly more than the whole. This is, of course, going to come entirely down to personal preference, more so than with most pictures. There's pretty much no denying that every aspect of the piece is pretty much spot-on, so your overall enjoyment will just come down to how much the experience impacts you on an emotional level. Since the film does, essentially, all it can, how much you're moved is down to you. This creates an odd feeling - at least, it does for me - that you should like it far more than you, perhaps, actually do. If it doesn't put a foot wrong, then why isn't it truly great? Well, maybe it's because it doesn't take those big risks that could've, at some point, gone wrong. Most of it does feel by-the-numbers, with just its themes and characters being somewhat elevated. Only a couple of the latter really stand out (and even they have their archetypes), aside from the protagonist, of course. She's rather great and she's played to perfection by Buckly. Both acting and singing seem second nature to her, which is a good thing when she's on the screen and in the soundtrack for most of the run-time. That soundtrack is also quite good, especially the couple of original songs - which include an accomplished book-ending piece that really is heartfelt. Overall, the flick doesn't engage me emotionally as much as it perhaps ought to, despite being enjoyable. It strangely feels more like this is down to me than to it, even if that's somewhat of a fallacy. The bottom-line is this, though: it's an absolutely solid movie. I can totally see why someone would love it, but I just like it. 7/10",/review/rw6778454/?ref_=tt_urv
