","I'm shocked to see this movie with a rating below 7.  As a big Disney fan, I'll go out on a limb and say this is one Disney's top 5.  There isn't a Disney movie out there with wit as sharp as this one's with much of it probably lost on the audience guessing by the rating given to this movie. ",/review/rw3395162/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2009,TheLittleSongbird,7," Enjoyable, but not Disney's best!
","First of all, there are a lot of things I like about this movie. The animation, in general, is very nice to look at, and Charlton Heston's narration is very satisfying. And it is one of the funnier Disney movies with a witty and funny script. More pluses are a genius turn from Danny DeVito as the hilarious Phil, and a wonderfully sleazy James Woods as the hot-headed villain Hades( a great villain, might I add?)Rip Torn also has fun as Zeus, especially when his statue came to life. The incidental music is lovely as well. However, there are a few negatives. Hercules himself, both child and adult, is a little bland, but Meg manages to establish herself as one of the best female Disney characters. Also, there isn't much of a story. The prove-you're- a-hero formula was a little unoriginal for me. The biggest minus was the rather dull songs by Alan Menken. The songs, especially ""Zero to Hero"" were a real disappointment, as Menken had so much better work before this, namely Beauty and the Beast. However, Michael Bolton's rendition of Go the Distance(the only song I had no problem with)was a joy to behold, as was ""I won't say I'm in love"". It wasn't a good idea turning gospel, should've stayed with the classical. However, despite the flaws, I did enjoy Hercules, which is a 7/10. Bethany Cox",/review/rw3395162/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2002,Lady Jasmine,," The last of the new classics
","Although I know I have heaped praise on several other Disney films...Hercules stands out as my favourite among them all. After this movie the Disney features once again seemed to slip downhill. However I can watch this movie again and again, it has a spectacular Greek chorus, gospel type score, which will ring in your head for days (and you will like it!). The characters are all likeable, even the villain and it is absolutely hilarious!",/review/rw3395162/?ref_=tt_urv

21 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," the best animation film of disney
","One of, if not, the best Disney films ever made. The vocal talents of James Woods, Danny DeVito, Tate Donovan, and Rip Torn are all spot on. The music isn't the best work Disney has put out, but the movie itself is downright amazing. The tale of a son trying to regain his heroism to return home is one that has been told before. However, the way this one is told just feels fresh and new. James Woods as Hades is perfect casting. It is on the level as James Earl Jones as Darth Vader. I can't imagine anyone else playing the role of Hades. Great job Disney on this perfection. If anyone likes Greek mythology then this is a great, kid friendly, version of it.",/review/rw3395162/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2008,LeonStyloroy,10," An Olympian achievement

17 July 2000,Polar Bear,9," God-like
","""Hercules"" is a cracking Disney film and for once it's not just for the kids. The animation is more like the ""old-school"" Disney, before the cute, big-eye syndrome and the characters are hugely entertaining. It has sly humour and in-jokes, but what sets it apart are the songs; soul, RNB, jazz and not a drippy sugar-song in sight. Quality entertainment!",/review/rw3395162/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2020,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7," Zeus! Your son has returned.
","Though 'Hercules (1997)' struggles to provide even one truly great song, the film is a colourful and enjoyable adaptation of Greek mythology. Its highlight is probably Hades, the easily enraged god of the underworld who's brilliantly voiced by a fast-talking and scene-chewing James Woods. The movie is mostly light-hearted entertainment; it has an underlying message, but it isn't as focused upon as in some of Disney's other fare. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, though. Sometimes, you just want your animated musicals to be fun. After a somewhat slow start, the movie picks up the pace and is engaging right until its finish. It also features a few well-achieved and, even, exciting set-pieces. It's a solid entry in the Disney archives. 7/10",/review/rw3395162/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 1999,Judith-4,," A great villain
","I don't usually like villains, even in Disney movies, because they're too scary, but I loved James Woods as Hades.  He was so funny.  I loved the way he called Megara ""my little nutmeg.""  I also loved the way they depicted Thebes like New York and they called it ""the big olive.""  I loved Meg's cynical and sarcastic attitude.  Hercules himself was rather bland.  I loved the song ""Go the Distance.""  Paul Wylie skated to it and showed how powerful the song is.  I really enjoyed this movie and I don't care if it departs from Greek mythology.  It was really about our time anyway.  I'd watch it again in a Pelopenisian minute.",/review/rw3395162/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 1999,Indy-52,9," the best since Aladdin!
","wow! This movie was really a pleasant surprise! I went to the theater expecting another below-par Disney film (like Pocahontas and Hunchback), but it turned out to be the most funny and enjoyable one since Aladdin (The Lion King was good, but there's just no contest between Timon & Pumbaa and the Genie )! And a good laugh from a Disney cartoon is just what i needed. You just must see this movie!",/review/rw3395162/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2004,rapier7,8," Hey mythology lovers, get a grip!
","I have seen many Disney movies, animated and not, and this one has more action than most, has no cute animals and is more humorous (ala Aladdin) than a typical Disney movie--Pixar films not included. This one also has a male lead (no princesses). If you are looking for typical Disney fare, then you may not appreciate this one. We enjoyed it thoroughly--from 4 to 40 years of age, male and female.",/review/rw3395162/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 1999,Spleen,9," Pretty damned good - but there is this ONE problem ...
","The Ancient Greeks and Romans were twisting the Hercules legend out of shape long before Disney got hold of it.  So I'll skip the usual complaints about Hercules being Hera's son, there being a demon named `Panic' and so on.  I can understand people objecting on these grounds; I think such objections are often justified, but misguided in this particular case; but there are arguments on both sides I would need to present if I were to discuss the case here - and so I won't.  Let me just stipulate that fiddling around with classical mythology does not, in this case, matter.  If you disagree - well, you disagree.",/review/rw3395162/?ref_=tt_urv

14 April 2018,Kirpianuscus,," seductive
","After two decades, it remains one of the most seductive and provocative Disney film. for the humor for adults. for the adventures for kids. for the flavvor of ""40-""50 musicals. for Hades . and, especially, for Megara. sure, the classic Greek mythology is the lead victim. but, after 20 years of innovation and so many blockbursters ignoring the accuracy of tradition, maybe, that is not a real significant sin. one of motifs - it has the innocence who is rare in present animation. it has the right dose of fun and challenge, a not complex story but one who preserves the flavor of old fashion fairy tales. and that is a profound good aspect. because it gives the right state of joy. and unique childhood emotion.",/review/rw3395162/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2022,questl-18592,8," Hercules Hercules Hercules!
","I always feel like this is part of this small window of Disney animated movies that gets dropped from the public consciousness. There's that golden age of Lion King and Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast etc. Those early 90s movies that have earned legendary status. Pocahontas is problematic but then in comes Toy Story and the birth of Pixar and maybe that's what derailed these. But I just watched this and another from the same period and they're amazing and really going in fun new ways and I appreciate it. Meg is an amazing Disney ""Princess"" though that feels like the wrong thing for her. She's fiery and strong and I Loved it about her. Woods as Hades? Awesome. The music is great. The story about what it means to be a good person, to act in charity and not in hopes of reward is poignant and likely forever relevant.",/review/rw3395162/?ref_=tt_urv

2 April 2009,dwpollar,4," OK Disney animated feature...
","1st watched 3/28/2009 – 4 out of 10 (Dir-John Musker & Ron Clements): OK Disney animated feature about the son of the great Zeus and his silly adventures. This a kind of wannabe A-list Disney movie with it's attempts at songs, sidekicks and silly romances but it just doesn't quite hit the mark despite James Woods doing a good job with the Hades role. The movie is about the birth of the young boy to Zeus and his wife, his loss of his godly position at the hands of Hades, and his attempt to become a mortal hero to win back his spot with the other Gods at Olympus. His road to hero-dom isn't easy as he's a pretty clumsy goof at first, but he's given a hero trainer voiced by Danny Devito who's kind of a short devil-like character(why he trained hero's I don't know??). He becomes a hero but supposedly still misses the heart necessary to get back to Olympia. This is gained, of course, because he goes googly-eyed over a women who is one of Hades's helpers and does stuff to get her out of his clutches(yeah I know, this doesn't make sense but it's Disney not Shakespeare). The movie is narrated by a 60's like Gospel group, who end every song with ""the gospel truth."" I'm sure this didn't make the religious right very happy about this movie(but they never really made movies for them anyway—but don't tell 'em). All in all, the movie is watchable but not the kind of Disney fare that we've come to expect from them. The same formula just not executed as well as some of their other movies.",/review/rw3395162/?ref_=tt_urv

10 June 2007,planktonrules,6," It all depends on your perspective,...
","Whether or not you like this movie really depends on your perspective. For the casual viewer, it's an entertaining film, though few would place it among Disney's best. For obsessive history teachers like myself, the film is so problematic that enjoying the film is next to impossible, as the film bears very little similarity to the Hercules myths. In fact, when the film debuted, I remember hearing about protests in Greece because many felt that Disney's ""fast and loose"" attitude towards the source material was cultural offensive. I can understand and appreciate this, though frankly, sometimes I wish I weren't as well-versed with history and could just turn off my brain and enjoy the film from a completely mindless perspective. Sorry, but if historical accuracy means anything stay away,...but at least the films are better than the Steve Reeves films or the god-awful Trans-lux cartoons of the 1960s!",/review/rw3395162/?ref_=tt_urv

9 November 2018,BoydudeReviews,10," An energetic, visually amazing, animated film.
","Ok! Not only is this my favoute Disney film ever, but it is also one of my favourite movies of all time. I rememver the day when my parents got me the VHS of this film. I was about 6, so it was around 2003 when I first saw this and I put it in the VCR and I was hooked instantly. What got my attention was the very colourful and stylistic art style if the characters and that amazing gospel soundtrack. This film soundtrack is defiantly my favoute Disney soundtrack. All the songs are catchy, fun, energetic, sweet and just hear-warming. I absolutely love all thr characters, their voice actors and their designs. Hades is one of,if not the besr disney's villans. When he gers angry, my gosh, he's angry. There is one scene where hades is so angry that certain characters annoy him and woe, it's just terryfying to watch. Even 16 years later, it still gives me goose bumps. The comedy is just so good and I crack up everythimg watching it. But it also has alot of heart. I really relate to Hercules. Not being acknowledged at the start of the film really resonates with me. I don't want to reveal too much of the plot. Just watch it for yourself. I 100% recommend this film, especially on Blu-ray aa the anination, after 21 years is still breathtaking. 😁👍🏾",/review/rw3395162/?ref_=tt_urv

14 January 2016,utgard14,5," ""So did they give you a name along with all those rippling pectorals?""
","Lackluster Disney movie that tells the story of Hercules. The whole thing lacks creativity, calculatedly following the Disney formula to the letter. We have stupid comic relief sidekicks, cheesy songs, a clichéd story, and lots of dumb in-jokes and references. It's moderately well-made for what it is but 'what it is' is the problem. I thought the voice work was fine and the animation not bad (but nothing terribly impressive). The songs are really lame, including the insufferably corny ""Go the Distance."" Of the films that came out during Disney's Renaissance period, this is one of the worst. Not a terrible watch when viewed in a bubble but, if you've seen even a few Disney animated films before, this will seem very tired and unoriginal. The worst part of it all is that, despite all the action and comedy, it's incredibly dull.",/review/rw3395162/?ref_=tt_urv
