20 November 2006,OldeSkool,," Lighten Up, Will Ya!
","After reading several negative reviews analyzing this and other stoner movies as being stupid, mindless and lacking in plot. HELLO!!! This is a stoner movie about stoners getting stoned. Who cares about plot or social messages or that other deep crap. You want depth go see a Bergman or a Fellini film, lighten up and smoke a joint. I'm glad to see stoner comedies back in fashion after suffering through pretentious, preachy, boring 80s anti-drug dramas that are never truly grounded in reality and where the characters always either predictably OD or just simplistically kick their addiction. So rent this movie (or watch it currently on cable), fire up one and enjoy",/review/rw0455493/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 1999,Quinoa1984,9," The Funniest Film on Marijuana since Up in Smoke
","Half Baked is funny for all the wrong reasons.  We laugh at the antics of pot smoking dumb asses because they are doing all the wrong things.  But, it is hilarious nevertheless.  Especially with the funny acting of Jim Breuer, Dave Chappelle and Harland Williams.  Even the cameos are humorous- including Jon Stewart, Snoop Doggy Dogg, Willie Nelson, and Tommy Chong (Chong is perfect as a small role in the movie).  The plot seems kind of basic, but its spiced up for laughs and for people who know what being a dope head is like.  Hilarious all around.  A+",/review/rw0455493/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2006,PersianPlaya408,9," A great comedy, Chapelle is hilarious
","Half baked is hilarious movie to me. Its a pothead manifestation film that doesn't take it self seriously and is pretty hilarious throughout. Dave Chapelle is very funny in the lead and to me is a better lead comedy actor than the likes of Martin Lawrence and even Chris Rock. Guillermo Diaz is also very good as Scarface. Rachel True provides good eye candy and decent performance as the female lead. This is not an Oscar film, but hilarious to watch with buddies and after watching it 3 times it doesn't get old. Its a funny screenplay, decent comedic direction and good performances, worth a look for any fan of comedy, pot or cinema.. 9/10",/review/rw0455493/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2001,sick_boy420xxx,," THE 90's stoner flick
","Hilarious...or is it?...flick concerning an apartment full of pot-smokers who get themselves in trouble with the law and end up going on a series of the most funny adventures ever put to celluloid.  This is a gas for the ""in"" crowd.  Others probably won't get all the jokes, but it is still damn entertaining.  I know people who worship this movie...of course, they've more than ""smoked themselves retarded."" If you're ""feelin it,"" then you'll laugh your @ss off, I guarantee.",/review/rw0455493/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2005,slate_77,8," You don't have to be under 25 nor a pothead to enjoy this movie. Maybe having familiarity with drug culture would help though.
","I had never heard of this movie 'Half Baked' until I was channel surfing cable this afternoon and came across it. While I had heard the name Dave Chapelle because of the television show recently airing, I was not familiar with two of the other three main characters. The guy playing the character in jail I have seen before. In other words, I am not up on who these people are/were. I am of the Chech and Chong 'Up in Smoke' generation of drug themed flicks. Saw them all back in the day. However, I found this movie much funnier than those ever were. Much funnier. The Scarface character was hilarious, but I found the Brian and Thurgood parts funnier and quite believable in an over-abundant way. I have read here many stating the cameo parts were the film's highlight. Not in my opinion. The main characters owned this one. As an aside from a 40 something, it is nice to see that this country(USA)has come along the road far enough whereby having a couple white guys, a black dude and a Cuban sharing a habitat together doesn't come across as contrived. The stoner parts all looked familiar to me. Funny movie.",/review/rw0455493/?ref_=tt_urv

18 January 2011,gigan-92,10," ""First of all, to understand Killer, you gotta understand who Killer the Dog was.""
","This film is one of my all time favorites. It's a real stand out comedy with damn good performances for what it is. most comedy today is pathetically predictable and just un-funny. From dismal family comedy flicks to the terrible ill amusing escapades of the date comedy. For me, their just way too formulaic. Is this story whole-heartedly original,no, not by far, but it's treatment is gloriously funny and pure escapist fun. The performances are better than you'd expect, giving off the feeling these guys are real close. Dave Chappelle is a riot,a real comedic genius. Guillermo Díaz is Scarface, Harland Willaims was terrific but the the performance I enjoyed almost even more than Chappelle's was that of Jim Breuer as Brian. If you've seen this movie then you know why I say this. Rachel True does as well as needed, but I found the tragic story of Killer by far more memorable (lol).",/review/rw0455493/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2000,Joey-106,," You don't have to be stoned to enjoy it
","My friend, (a known pothead), lent me this film and said it was funny, i was sceptical, a. becasue he is always stoned and once had a laughing fit at a commercial, b. because he thinks WWF wrestling is the best thing on t.v, but i watched it anyway, i'm glad i did, it was hilarious, i'd highly recommend this film to anyone, unless they are specifically looking for a good plot or if they are dead against drugs, i've read some of the comments on here and they haven't been that good, maybe you have to know someone like the people in this movie to get it. 8/10",/review/rw0455493/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 1999,Wizard-8,," Not as bad as you might think...
","The trailer for this movie looked really dumb, so I didn't see it in theaters. Then I heard about Bob Saget's cameo (and what he says), and just wanting to hear Saget say that made me rent the movie. Surprisingly, it's not a bad movie. Oh, it's dumb. It's sloppy. It's *obsessed* with marijuana. But I laughed several times in the movie, and the characters are very likable. Best watched with a group of friends who don't mind drug humor.",/review/rw0455493/?ref_=tt_urv

22 November 2007,tenthousandtattoos,6," I don't even know nobody named Ol' James!
","Tamra Davis is a g*damned genius, i swear. She manages to get a pumping little message across while delivering the laughs by the bucketload. And Dave Chapelle, gangly, weird but extremely funny in that unpredictable, zany way, easily delivers the funniest line when he says ""Do I look like someone that would smoke...*whispers* mari-juana?"" Trust me, when u see him say that line the irony is nothing short of hilarious.",/review/rw0455493/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2001,Crowbot-2,," Wasted comedy at its finest
","This movie is hilarious.  Extremely stupid, but still hilarious. And even as unbelievable as it is, there are people actually like this, heck I know several of them.  The thing that makes it so funny is the fact that a bunch of funny parts in the film actually happen.  So if you want to see funny realism mixed with over the top fantasy, this is your film.",/review/rw0455493/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2006,marimbadaddy,7," Ya don't have to be a stoner to enjoy this film
","Very funny movie. Of the recent 'stoner' flicks, this is probably one of the best. (Probably second in my book to Dude Where's My car?) Ejoyable, entertaining, and weird characters. Dave Chappell is hilarious as always. There are a ton of cameos by great and well known comedians throughout the piece, all paying their homage to the great herb.",/review/rw0455493/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2005,Derek237,6," Features the funniest cameos ever
","The highlight of Half Baked is clearly the hilarious cameos, in particular the cameo by Bob Saget. It was a while since Full House went off the air, and people started to wonder, 'where's Bob?' Well, we found him, and in the unlikeliest of places, too. His all-American, wholesome, great dad image is completely torn apart in just a matter of seconds. His line, ""I used to suck d**k for coke"" echoes in eternity for great moments in contemporary comedy.",/review/rw0455493/?ref_=tt_urv

26 November 2000,stu-22,," stupified genius
","Only a true pothead could have thought up the script for HALF BAKED.  Tamra Davis is an underrated director, with other cool movies like BEST MEN and his other retarded comedy masterpiece, BILLY MADISON. Dave Chapelle, Jim Breuer, Guillermo Diaz, and Harland Williams all give incredible, insane performances. The spoofs on other films like JERRY MCGUIRE, DEAD PRESIDENTS, SUPERMAN, as well as the old ""Batman"" show, are perfectly weaved in. There are numerous cameos by tons of varied people: Snoop Dogg, Jon Stewart, Janeane Garafalo, Willie Nelson, Stephen Baldwin, Clarence Williams 3, Tommy Chong, Bob Saget, and others, they're all funny in their own ways. The Guy on the Couch was the most interesting character, for mysterious reasons.",/review/rw0455493/?ref_=tt_urv

","I still manage to be in a terrible mood, but ""Half Baked"" is one of those laugh at your stupid life movies that helps you be chill, way more than others. For that I give it ten stars but underneath the infectious good humor that is Dave Chapelle, there is a fully functional screenplay at work with ingenious creative devices that impress because they never get hackneyed. In addition ""Half Baked"" reminds you you should probably be getting high.",/review/rw0455493/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2010,moviemaniac008,4," Makes you forget about the world around you for a while
","Viewed this movie on: January 13, 2010 Half Baked is a movie that really entertains you. Of course it's a dumb movie, and I think that to enjoy it, you need to switch your brain to off for the time this movie lasts. I viewed this film during a time when I had many problems: School-like and relationship problems, but let me tell you that one school night I watched this movie because my friend had lent it to me and I literally forgot all about these problems. Thankfully all those problems are solved now, but that is not the point. I read on an IMDb board that someone compared Half Baked to Pineapple Express, but that's something I don't understand because Half Baked is a much different movie than PE who has a bigger budget, thus better cinematography, leads, etc...",/review/rw0455493/?ref_=tt_urv

14 June 2019,deloudelouvain,7," A classic stoner movie.
","You don't have to be a stoner to appreciate this comedy but it helps. You don't have to appreciate the wacky tabacky to understand all jokes but it sure does help. Some scenes are so so recognizable if you're or once were a stoner. Everybody got the munchies, or had short term memory loss, or had hilarious laughs, if you lived like a stoner. So most of the jokes in Half Baked are Ganja related and it does help to fully appreciate the humor in this movie if you ever abused of the green herb. And it's even better to watch while getting stoned, that's what I did, and will do again when I'll watch it again as this humor doesn't get old.",/review/rw0455493/?ref_=tt_urv

2 July 2002,snafu801,," Seriously one of the Funniest Movies You'll Ever See
","This is by far one of the funniest movies you will ever see...that is if your a burnt out stoner who can relate to the motivationless potheads in this movie. Thankfully I can and that is why I love this movie so so much. I bought this movie previously viewed for 3 dollars and that was by far the best 3 dollars I've ever spent in my entire life. I have watched this movie about 10 times since I bought it and that was only about a month ago. It is really that funny. It has so many hilarious lines. I laugh and laugh when I hear Jon Stewart describing the back of a twenty dollar bill on weed...""Theres a guy in the bushes, does he have a gun..I dont know? Whats that? Red team go, Red team go!"" Its fu**ing hilarious. Youll know what I mean once you see this movie. And No you dont have to be a stoner to love this movie it makes me laugh and I am far from one. So please take my advice and rent this movie.",/review/rw0455493/?ref_=tt_urv
