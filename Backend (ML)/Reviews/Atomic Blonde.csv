21 January 2023,Top_Dawg_Critic,6," It flopped in the last 15 minutes.
","It started off as a decent Aussie crime-drama film, but the last 15 minutes ruined it, and I attribute that to lazy writing. Actor and co-star Matt Nable makes his directorial debut with this film, as well as being his fourth writing credit. His rookie mistakes were evident and somewhat forgivable in his directing; the monotonic theme, the lack of any real urgency in most scenes, and the overall look and feel to this film. His writing was generic and predictable with boiler-plate set-ups and follow throughs to the narrative. At least it was all cohesive and had continuity, that's until the last 15 minutes, when Nable's character goes off the rails and attacks his fellow soldier for no reason explained whatsoever. It was just ridiculous lazy and convoluted writing, and made what decent narrative had occurred prior to that point feel insignificant. Nevertheless, the cinematography was excellent, as the score was decent, and the casting and performances on point, especially Nable and Worthington, and the beautiful Phoebe Tonkin was certainly easy to watch. But they weren't enough to boost the lack of energy, action and suspense this film needed. The pacing was too slow and there were many scenes that could've and should've been trimmed down or cut out. There just wasn't enough narrative to comfortable fill in the 106 min runtime. Had the last 15 mins been better written, I'd say it's a decent one-time watch, but the way it went off the rails, I feel like I wasted my time watching this.",/review/rw8826584/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2023,heno-45762,4," Slow & boring
","Acting is on cue , the scenery is very beautiful, but one thing I can't really get my head around is Why this movie is going back-and-forth all the time through the whole movie at different time zones. It's very slow hard to figure out (what this movie is actually about) and what is the point? This movie was so overhyped on the radio and previews and it was just one big waste of time with to many sub plots.(Maybe as a mini series could of worked out). Thank you Stan you have done it again wasting good actors on a very poor script and didn't want to spend a lot of money. This movie could've been a lot better as the actual shots and action sequences that are rare in the movie were actually really good.",/review/rw8826584/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2023,miy66,8," Decent Aussie Flick
","This falls into the class of 'people story' and these do need to be done at a certain pace. Dad Sam having lost his wife in tragic circumstances is now attempting to raise his son while dealing with the trauma. A former Special Ops mate factors in and things get messy. This is not a fast paced action movie, and it's refreshing that it isn't as the story wouldn't work properly if it was. However, there is a lot happening and it certainly kept our interest. Relationship between Dad and son is great to watch. If you love a good people story and like relationship tales, then this is a good watch and we really enjoyed it.",/review/rw8826584/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2023,stylishboy004,7," A good movie.
","People don't understand movies and they are reviewing this. It's supposed to be slow and boring at times. But it's very nice. The story is something we have all seen before, with a little of twist here and there.",/review/rw8826584/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2023,rhawdon-297-344030,6," Serious movie with flawed ending.
",A well acted and moving account of a loving family torn apart by a tragic accident. Explores what effect this can have on a father and son in particular. However I found the violent ending somewhat mystifying and unsatisfactory. It was as though the writer wasn't quite sure how to finish the story. Would have been better with an ultimate.redemption for both parent and child.,/review/rw8826584/?ref_=tt_urv

23 January 2023,drgmusicgordon,9," Great Movie!
","This is a great movie.. well worth watching. Great performance by Sam an all the other actors..Lots of action and drama.. With the bad reviews that we saw we weren't expecting much but as we sat an watched it we were captivated and really got into it.. my wife and I were on the edge of our seat for the whole movie...... I really appreciated the acting especially by the young boy .. the son.. who did a great job ... I know a lot of people will take the reviews and just not watch it, but they really should because they will be very surprised to find out that it is a lot better than they are giving credit for..",/review/rw8826584/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2023,philipfhayes,8," Slow in Places, overall enjoyable
","While parts of the film can be slow at times and some scenes drag on for a little too long, it is enjoyable. Well from my end anyway, you may or may not like it and it may not be your favourite type of movie or with the actors you're used to seeing, but the producers gave it one hell of a go",/review/rw8826584/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2023,clementgermain-67862,2," How to bore one to death instead of shooting them
","I really tried, really .... The start of the movie immediately showed 2 things : the quality is a B movie instead of a movie with a star like Worthington : pale colours and most irritating continuing monotone background music. After 15 mintutes, the movie did not showed anything but a boring,; boring, boring kid and his boring father that acts boring towards his boring pregnant wife ... I do not understand why Mr Worthington accept to play in this kind of boring movies, except if you want to help people suffering insomnia ...
Anyway, i did one good thing : I did not watch the movie till the end and I'm happy not to have wasted the full.106 minutes of my life.",/review/rw8826584/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2023,karlpeak,10," Unlimited Depth.
","The depth of this film is incredible, the amount of effort applied to each character feels almost unlimited, I couldn't imagine anyone else but Sam Worthington playing Ryan, every movement, facial expression and word was perfectly timed and on point.",/review/rw8826584/?ref_=tt_urv

",I really tried with this movie. But the slow boring pace it just isn't it. I mean come on we are 36 minutes into the movie and we have one action scene??!!

21 January 2023,bwilson-99135,3," Cheap or stupid
","So the special forces get to have flashlights strapped to their rifles, so they can have a big bullseye on their chest. To cheap for night vision or just ignorant? . Then the guy shows his son how to not sharpen a knife- backwards. Whats with the writers , ignorant or just don't care? Acting just ok . Turned the movie half way through. Gave myself enough time to know it was going to be a waste of my movie time. If you're going to have to spend an hour and 45 minutes watching a movie - drama, action, thriller, at least they could start out with something kind of believable. I got a bad taste in the first 5 minutes and never got rid of it!",/review/rw8826584/?ref_=tt_urv

22 January 2023,R0lf3,7," Good, very good
","Here I am thinking, good movies are still being made, as opposed to Hollywood blockbuster money makers, and Australian good movies at that (i.e., the dry, danger close, snow town etc.) and then I come back and read the comments ""where's the action?"" - are you daft!!?? Wtf?? Clearly there's a disconnect between good movies and what to expect... but poor reviews (sub-5), really? And this movie isn't without its flaws, but it resonated with me, really liked it, I've no doubt it might be received poorly, but keep it up movie makers. There is an audience who appreciates good story telling. Loved it, thanks.",/review/rw8826584/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2023,emcebe,8," Emotional rollercoaster
","Surprised at the bad reviews and low ratings as we thought this a great study into veteran inner conflict, compounded by personal tragedy and the inability to find stability in ongoing employment- problems faced by so many returning vets from all wars even without the then loss of family at home. We did not need to see the deeds of war, the story was set in the aftermath .The performances were great, Matt Nable displaying brilliantly the characteristics of those vets unable to leave the battlefields behind, Sam Worthington trying to do so but visibly feeling failure in raising his son alone while the voice off his wife is his conscience, drifting from job to job - then to crime - a lost soul really. And the son, at each stage, trying to understand too while dealing with his own loss and lack of direction. The fight scenes were well choreographed , violent and well executed and overall reminded of the type of films we have seen following all theatres of war where returning soldiers are damaged yet receive minimal support. Ignore the naysayers, watch this and decide for yourself.",/review/rw8826584/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2023,nogodnomasters,4," Don't Test Me.
",This is another Australian feature. Johnny (Matt Nable) and Ryan Logan (Sam Worthington) fought in Iraq together. Ryan was a sniper and killed a bunch of people. Later at home his wife is pregnant and he has a young son Billy. A car accident kills his wife although we discover later it was his choice. They both needed blood and Ryan was the only donor available and he had to choose who would live and die. He opted to keep his son alive which he was beginning to regret when he became a teen problem. Ryan bounced from job to job. Neither one was doing well in life until Johnny pops back into his life. He is a second story man who needs a partner.,/review/rw8826584/?ref_=tt_urv

21 January 2023,karwan49,1," Australian movies so boring
","The first 10 minutes. I felt I am watching some foreign movies that I don't understand. And then I jumped on IMDB to check the reviews. Thanks to viewers they told me to not waste my time . The problem of aussie movies you can tell from very first beginning that they are not Hollywood. Even they tried so hard but feels like you are watching Indian movies. Even the aussie actors when they act under Hollywood directors they are pretty good . But when they play in their own country. They act to lame . Just like they have no experience at all . Maybe they pay is not good that's why they don't really care , anyway what a waste of my 10 minutes times.",/review/rw8826584/?ref_=tt_urv

23 January 2023,thomaswsmith-72061,2," Average at best...
","The movie plays in random segments instead from start to finish, which is completely unnecessary. It was slow and boring yet now also mildly confusing to follow. The story is average at best. I didn't even finish the film... and I never stop a film before it's actually finished. For some reason aswell I seem to be one of the few people who think Sam Worthington is a less than average actor. I did not believe any of his acting in this film. He didn't seem like he was ex-military and his PTSD/anger issues seemed over acted and hard to believe. I did try though. It feels like people assume Sam Worthington is a good actor just because Avatar was the highest grossing film ever...",/review/rw8826584/?ref_=tt_urv
