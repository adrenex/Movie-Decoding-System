6 October 2021,Rob_Taylor,4," About as much fun as getting stuck in a tarpit yourself...
","I was prepared to give this a chance. The first episode was pretty lame, but I said to myself ""It can only get better, right?""",/review/rw7507863/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2021,Xavier_Stone,2," Underwhelming
",I admit I looked forward to another show about time travel and such and was hoping for something decent. It's not going to be Lost but it still could be watchable.,/review/rw7507863/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2021,grlym-46849,5," Mediocre at wandering no where at a very slow pace

14 October 2021,lusciousmuffins,3," I gave it a chance, but... No
","I really like Natalie Zea as an actress, so I was looking forward to this.",/review/rw7507863/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2021,Top_Dawg_Critic,5," The sub-plots are annoyingly dragged out and boring.
","The writing was all over the place in the first episode, but I was still intrigued. By the end of the second episode, I'm getting frustratingly bored. The sub-plots are annoyingly dragged out and seem pointless as all that filler. I hope the writers haven't cramped already. The melodramatics are cringe, and I also really haven't cared about any of the characters in the hole. So far, the above-ground story is more interesting. For now, 5/10. Will give a few more episodes a chance.",/review/rw7507863/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2021,bheadher,3," I have serious heartburn with this one, but I did give it an honest try...
","Several square blocks of LA fall into a huge deep dark sinkhole, taking about a thousand vehicles and numerous buildings with it...yet when they wake up the people are uninjured and only about twenty vehicles are with them...no vehicle has a scratch on it, although one bus is overturned but undamaged, and only one collapsed building in sight. Forget the thousands of people, they aren't there, only about fifteen at the little grouping of survivors...",/review/rw7507863/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2021,knedb,5," Poorly written dialogue
","Truly listen to the dialogue each episode. You will see it all sucks... every line. That said, I do enjoy the plot of the show. It has a great sci fi idea. But these generic blah lines without good character development just won't cut it for a season two. No doubt this show is cancelled after one season. Find better/smarter writers!!!",/review/rw7507863/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2021,Tweetienator,3," Wasted
","An interesting and funny sounding idea wasted by totally incompetent (or lazy or both) writing. Production and acting are soso, but that terrible script destroyed everything. To endure one episode is enough for my mind, my heart, my soul - and last but not least my nerves just say: no.",/review/rw7507863/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2021,jaimemedina-36288,1," The worst humanity has to offer
",I made it 14 mins in and I just couldn't take it anymore. It is without a doubt the stupidest thing I've seen in a while. The idiocy of the plot is matched only the assorted cast of dim wits trying to act.,/review/rw7507863/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2021,aelthric,2," Getting more annoying by the episode.
","When I first heard about La Brea I was cautiously optimistic that maybe we would get a decent scifi show, the first episode held promise though. That went downhill fast and my interest starting evaporating away.",/review/rw7507863/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2021,mls4182,1," No more originality in Hollywood
","I don't know what is worse, having to rely on the boring La Brea tar pits as a story line or the really cartoonist CGI. This is so bad it doesn't even have camp value.",/review/rw7507863/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2021,npvarley,2," Simply awful!
","I am loathe to write shows off as 'bad' after just one episode, but this show is just awful. I cannot think of one redeeming feature. Not one.",/review/rw7507863/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2021,mcgooganz,3," Monumentally Bad Writing
","The first sentence in this teleplay:. Stuck squarely in traffic the driver says to her children ""Why is driving such a difficult concept in this city?."" What follows is equally meaningless, a world where even gravity has lost its mind.",/review/rw7507863/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2022,bangel3322,7," Decent show
","Wasn't so sure about this when I started watching it....it had an air of predictability about it. However I was surprised by it as it didn't pan out as I was expecting. A lot of twists and turns along the way with a mostly solid cast. I would have preferred to have seen some other people cast in certain roles, also I would have liked it to be a little darker; something along the lines of LOST. It's a little too PG for me and with this storyline, a little more of an edge is needed. Nevertheless I thoroughly enjoyed it and can't wait for season 2.",/review/rw7507863/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2021,random-70778,," Yawing mah of sinkhole as an unintentionally ironic metaphor for the show
",You are going to feel like you are traveling in time all right -- the cheap CGI is going to take you back three or four decades right way!,/review/rw7507863/?ref_=tt_urv

20 October 2021,vintagegeek,2," Still Lost
",Running away from more animals. Sick people still sick. Foods run out. Whining around campfire. Lots of dialogue that means nothing. People up top have developed a plan. Whoopee.,/review/rw7507863/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2021,davidjdoyle-140-892335,," Great concept killed by helicopter mommy
","Poorly written, horridly acted with painfully low-budget special effects... the Asylum Studios has productions better than this drivel. Even the ScFy Channel has produced better content than this. You can't blame anything this bad on the Pandemic.",/review/rw7507863/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2021,myronlearn,2," La Crap
",More LA garbage not worth anyone's time. Overpaid executives actually think this crap up while others green light it? No wonder network television is in the shape it's in.,/review/rw7507863/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2021,russian_mr_do_you_speak_it,3," $70 million just evaporated, only junk left
",So this show is the reason that Natalie Zea left Unicorn and Nicholas Gonzalez left The Good Doctor.,/review/rw7507863/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2021,Craig-fikes,3," Sci Fi Channel programming
","Not a bad premise but atrocious writing and Sharknado levels of CGI. I tried making a drinking game from this show, every time someone said something ridiculous I took a drink, I was just discharged from the hospital with alcohol poisoning.",/review/rw7507863/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2021,podein,2," Another embarrassing NBC pile of crap...
",NBC hires 12 year olds again to write another show for them. Absolutely pathetic writing. Awful casting with horrible acting. Full of cancelled series actors. Embarrassing CGI. And the same old greedy NBC crap riddled with 4 minute commercial breaks every 5 minutes.,/review/rw7507863/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2021,TxMike,," New series, I gave it a chance.
","I found the premise interesting but quit watching after the 3rd episode, falling into the tar pit and going back to 10,000 BC is interesting but not enough for me to watch beyond that. It isn't a very exciting show and sort of plods along.",/review/rw7507863/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2021,paulig-gr,6," Sometimes, I'm in the mood for some NBC trash.
","Classic dorky network TV show, with bad VFX, pretty actors that wear perfect outfits, makeup and hairstyles even when teleported 10000 BC and living in the woods without shower. Laughable drama, dumb jokes, tropy camera work, plot that moves from commercial break to commercial break, dramatic music, unnecessary flirting, this TV show has it all. It's like a relic from 2006.",/review/rw7507863/?ref_=tt_urv
