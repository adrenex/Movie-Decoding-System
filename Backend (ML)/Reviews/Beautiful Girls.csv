1 January 2016,pyrocitor,10," Gary - you're free
","The Smashing Pumpkins may have mused that 'The End is the Beginning is the End,' but Edgar Wright knew better. He knew that for his beloved 'Cornetto Trilogy,' he would need an ending that could somehow tie up all of its strains of manic, voracious genre pastiche, savage wit and silliness, and, most importantly, its symphony to the reluctant aging of the schlubby, post- Shaun adult male. He knew he needed to do something special.",/review/rw4059063/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2014,bob the moo,," Not wholly successful but has good elements
","When you're the third film in an unofficial trilogy that includes Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz then there is a lot of pressure on you to maintain that quality and unfortunately this film doesn't do that. There are good aspects to this comedy but not enough of it really comes together well enough to make it stand up to the previous two films. The plot here sees Gary King trying to reclaim happiness by convincing a group of his friends to revisit the ""good old days"" by going on a pub crawl they attempted when their lives lay ahead of them and they felt full of potential. However, when they do return to their home they feel like they have changed too much and should never have come back – but they are only half right, because they should not have come back, although it isn't them that has changed.",/review/rw4059063/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2013,CalRhys,," The End Of The Trilogy Is Nigh
","So last night from 7.30pm through 2am. I sat through the Cornetto trilogy at the Vue cinema in my hometown, Worcester. Watching 'Shaun Of The Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz' again really boosted the hype for what was to follow, come midnight... 'The World's End' began! ",/review/rw4059063/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2013,nesfilmreviews,8," Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Edgar Wright has been one of the biggest success stories of British cinema of the past decade.
","The movie-making team of Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Edgar Wright has been one of the biggest success stories of British cinema of the past decade. With ""Shaun of the Dead"" (2004) and ""Hot Fuzz"" (2007), the trio demonstrated originality, ingenuity, and most significantly, capable of drawing a large, appreciative audience. Now they're back with the long-awaited third movie of what's become unofficially known as the ""Cornetto trilogy."" Like it's predecessors, director Edgar Wright loves paying homage to American cinema; ""Shaun"" pays its respects to George Romero, ""Fuzz"" nods its head to over the top action, buddy flicks, and ""World's End"" takes a page from our classic American sci-fi films.",/review/rw4059063/?ref_=tt_urv

13 February 2018,Sleepin_Dragon,8," Outrageously huge fun.
","I must start by admitting to have reviewed this previously and removed it, last time round I must have been in a bad mood, I criticised it for going off the boil, however in recent times I've gotten so into it, it's meant to be bonkers, outrageous and utterly over the top and it sure is. I think there's something incredibly British about the humour, the world could come to an end, but there's still time for nostalgia, and more importantly there's still time for a pint. It's still perhaps my least favourite of The Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy, but the other two are that good, and hard acts to follow. It is clever, it's witty, and which of us doesn't know a Gary? If only it didn't have to be a trilogy, would have loved more from this successful group, it's an underrated gem.",/review/rw4059063/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2013,asda-man,9," Last orders, the end of a terrific trilogy
","Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz are two of the best British comedies ever made. Shaun of the Dead is obviously the best (although I may be biased due to being a horror hound) but Hot Fuzz is also brilliantly funny with a clever screenplay full of colourful and memorable characters. So you can imagine my excitement when The World's End was announced. And it top it off the final instalment of a consistently hilarious trilogy didn't disappoint. The World's End doesn't quite reach the heights of Shaun of the Dead, but I'd probably put it on par with Hot Fuzz. There is no greater mixture than Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Cornetto. It wins every time!",/review/rw4059063/?ref_=tt_urv

14 February 2016,Tweekums,7," The final film in the 'Cornetto Trilogy'
","When Gary King was nineteen he and four friends; Peter, Oliver, Steven and Andy, attempted an epic twelve pub crawl through their home town of Newton Haven; they didn't make it but it was still the best night of Gary's life. Now, twenty odd years later he decides to get his friends together and complete the crawl. They aren't too keen as they have all got on with their lives but eventually he talks them round and they return to their old home town. Not surprisingly it has changed somewhat; the pubs are now near-identical; part of a homogenised chain there is something else odd; something they can't quite put their fingers on. In the second pub they are joined by Oliver's sister Sam; who Gary manages to offend. They continue their crawl until the four pub when everything is turned upside down Gary gets in a fight in the toilet and is more than a little shocked to find his opponent is a robot! It soon emerges that most of the town have been replaced and if Gary and his friends aren't to be next they will have to be careful and that means completing the crawl!",/review/rw4059063/?ref_=tt_urv

","I thought this movie was mediocre at best. I laughed out loud a few times--as did the rest of the audience, but other than that I found it boring and actually nodded off twice. One of the girls sitting in front of me stated, ""well it wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't that good either"", which I thought summed it up pretty well. The biggest shock was that it had a 7.9 IMDb rating which normally indicates a potentially ""great"" movie in any category--especially a comedy. (anything above a 7 tends to consistently be what I consider a GOOD movie).I give it a 5.5 or maybe 6. THere were several other movies in the same theater with lower IMDb ratings that, in retrospect, I wished I had spent my time and money on.",/review/rw4059063/?ref_=tt_urv

He's the one who couldn't move on from that night; couldn't get a job like them, or get married like them.

25 August 2013,ikiru71-220-566499,8," Another funny, clever, and wild one from Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright
","If you seen the other two movies in the so-called Cornetto Trilogy (""Shaun of the Dead"" & ""Hot Fuzz"") then you already know what to expect from ""The World's End"". Like the others it is funny and full of unexpected and crazy twists and turns. The story follows five friends who decide to reunite and finish the pub crawl they were not able to complete 20 years ago. Everything is going fine and then all hell breaks loose. You know you're probably in for a wild and fun ride and that is exactly what you get. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost kind of switch roles from their previous movies, Frost is the one that has it together and Pegg doesn't. It works well and they still maintain their great humor and wit. The supporting cast is equally funny with Eddie Marsan being a highlight. The movie if full of great one liners and some absolutely hilarious moment. If you liked ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" or if you just like wild and fun movies then you'll like ""The World's End"". It is funny, clever, and a hell of a ride.",/review/rw4059063/?ref_=tt_urv

19 July 2013,ollie1939-97-957994,9," A fantastic conclusion to the Cornetto trilogy.
","I didn't think this trilogy could get any better. However it somehow exceeded by expectations. With fantastic direction from Edgar Wright,smart writing from Wright and Simon Pegg and hilarious performances from Pegg, Nick Frost and everyone else the World's end is a great way to end the trilogy. The story focuses on a group of childhood friends who go back to their hometown in order to repeat a legendary pub crawl that ends with a pub known as the World's End. However they realize that their whole town has been taken over by robots and it's up to them to stop them from taking over the world. I will admit that my only criticism of the film is that it does start off a little slowly. The jokes felt a little stiff at times with their execution and most of the humor was coming from Pegg's character. However once the robots come in the movie does pick up the pace and lives up to Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz The performances are very funny with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost actually switching roles. Pegg is more of the bumbling idiot whereas Frost is the straight man. The other performance are also good with Martin Freeman,Paddy Considine, Rosamund Pike and Eddie Marsan. I also loved the ending which has probably the best ending out of any of the Cornetto trilogy movies Overall the movie is incredibly funny despite having a slow start. It's a perfect mix of comedy and science fiction. I hope there's more to come from these very funny and talented guys.",/review/rw4059063/?ref_=tt_urv

15 September 2013,moviexclusive,8," Mixing equal parts of laugh-out-loud comic action and sublime introspection, ""The World's End"" is a thoroughly enjoyable take on the issues of adulthood and friendship
","Five friends, 12 pubs, one night: the famed ""Golden Mile"" is a pub crawl consisting of hopping from one bar to the next downing pints, and Gary King (Simon Pegg, star and co-writer) is determined to complete it with his best buddies after failing to do so 20 years ago. That's the basic premise for ""The World's End"", also the name of the final pub in the crawl. Director and co-writer Edgar Wright's British sci-fi comedy is the third installment of the ""Three Flavours Cornetto"" trilogy, rounding up 2004's ""Shaun of the Dead"" and 2007's ""Hot Fuzz"".",/review/rw4059063/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2014,Quinoa1984,10," Whole lotta WTF
","The World's End is a film about the end of the world, a film about getting f***ed up, and most of all (and it's best at) an acidic satire (at times just a full-on drama) on growing up, being asses, and male camaraderie. Add to this robots-that-aren't-technically-robots-but-they-are, and an alien intelligence right out of Douglas Adams. And all the while it's a maturing for these writers, and an embrace of the 'Body Snatcher' formula to a wonderful extent.",/review/rw4059063/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2013,AdultAudienceMember,5," Just not funny.
","I kept waiting for it to be funny. What you get is St. Elmo's fire with robots, 4 grown up friends and 1 stuck in the past, and the end of the world as we know it....except not entirely. As a buddy movie, it barely connects. As science fiction it's not imaginative. It wasn't a complete loss, though. Because I saw it at Cinemark and I had purchased the refillable cups and popcorn tubs earlier this year, the wife and I got two large drinks and two med popcorns for a total of $6. Sadly, that was the highlight of the film. Just as I waited for The Butler to even remotely connected to reality, for Two Guns to be anything other that an insulting caricature of Texans, and Gangster Squad to be anything other than gun play, I waited in vain for The World's End to get really funny. It didn't even get more than slightly humorous.",/review/rw4059063/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2013,chas_newport,4," Wished it Would End
","Here's the thing about expectations. I loved Hot Fuzz and have watched it five or six times with different people, enjoying it anew through their reactions. The dream team are back together with some stellar additions and the entire plot premise is based around that staple of adolescence, the pub crawl. The trailer is fabulous and even gives a nod to the collapsing fence gag but done by Pegg this time... What could go wrong?",/review/rw4059063/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2013,planktonrules,6," It's okay....
","""The World's End"" is a very uneven film that I really, really wanted to like since I'd enjoyed the previous two films in this unofficial trilogy--""Sean of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"". However, despite some wonderful twists, the film seemed like the script had some good ideas but needed to be cleaned up a bit more. After all, some of the characters behaved oddly--and I am talking about long before the film was supposed to get odd.",/review/rw4059063/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2018,Bored_Dragon,9," The best one in trilogy
","According to IMDb, Shaun is the best, and then the trilogy goes downhill. My impression is just the opposite. Shaun of the Dead was an experimental attempt, and then the same team, motivated by its success, continued in the same style and achieved better results, crowned with The World's End. Perhaps this SF horror action comedy is not so much better than its predecessors as I liked it more for the characters I can identify with, because under the mask of fantasy, horror and crazy action hides a very realistic human drama. This movie criticizes globalization and a modern society in which it is desirable that each individual be just a well-oiled gear in the mechanism, alienation and loneliness of unadjusted, as well as self-deception of those who live seemingly perfect lives. Anyway, this movie has delighted me and I am eager to see if Wright and Pegg can overcome themselves again.",/review/rw4059063/?ref_=tt_urv
