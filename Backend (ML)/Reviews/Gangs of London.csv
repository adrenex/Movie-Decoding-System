31 October 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," Season 1 was fantastic!
","Even though it wasn't very believable, Season 1 of Gangs of London was just a flat out awesome show! The quality in season 2 is just not quite as good so far. It's about a war between powerful gangs in London that all go into chaos when the head of the most powerful gang is assassinated. Some people don't like it because of how brutal and violent it gets but I don't get what they were expecting from a show about gangs? It is so much more than just some action show too...it's a very intense drama that will keep you at the edge of your seat throughout the series. Some people want to compare it to Peaky Blinders and while it's not quite as good as that it's still a really good show. The writing and acting is what makes this show so special. I highly recommend this to anyone who like a good action drama.",/review/rw7773643/?ref_=tt_urv

15 December 2020,Abdulxoxo,6," Gangs of London
","This show started matured with solid storyline and multifaceted characters, but after the first two or so episodes it started to fall in the predictable zone, and the plotline gets worse as it goes on. The characters do things conveniently with no real-life consequences, be it killing people in broad daylight, or taking down an entire building, and the police or authority in GOL-universe don't seem bat an eyelash to any of it. Now the action scenes are entertaining no doubt, but the grotesque violence serves no real purpose at times, it isn't used to illustrate a point about the nature of the world or anything, and they would've been more enjoyable if they had the story go along with it. There's also pacing issues, at times, it's longer than it needed to be and drags out with the only purpose is to show us more violence.",/review/rw7773643/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2020,arrmeen,8," If you like Garth Evan's , you'll love this.. plus more
","I don't know what's wrong with people here who are commenting this show has action and gore so they don't like it. Also some nit wits here say this show doesn't have a story,I mean are high while seeing this? What else do you want from a show that has good drama, great action scenes. If you want something less action oriented then go somewhere else watch a silly Kardashian show. This show is everything what a good show about Gang's should be about. Give it a go don't listen to the haters",/review/rw7773643/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2020,terrorfirmer-ie,6," Massively entertaining but has problems
",I can't deny the show is massively entertaining with some great characters and really amazing action scenes. I enjoyed it.,/review/rw7773643/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2022,craig-70-347684,6," Slick and violent
","Consistent violence masks an inconsistent plot filled with holes and flawed logic. Despite being in the guise of a tough gritty gangster drama, in reality it's a soppy dull melodrama almost saved by the distraction of gruesome action sequences. The cadence of silliness interspersed with violence is not quite rapid enough to help you forget the flimsy premise this show is built around.",/review/rw7773643/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2022,nqsferatuslair,8," Season 2 takes a massive dive in quality.
","Sure, season 1 had its issues. Unbelievable scenarios, undercooked characters and weird pacing with it peaking at the halfway point, and then lumbering onwards. So yeah, you had to turn a significant portion of grey matter off to enjoy it, but man, it was worth it for the fights/shootouts choreography, editing and brutality. And if you could suspend the huge amount of disbelief and shark jumping, it was pretty entertaining with how over the top it ended up being.",/review/rw7773643/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2022,allanmichael30,6," action packed-but unrealistic
","Like watching jackie chan comedy and full of violence and unrealistic acting. Its movie style of violence might make it popular, but this just copies the fighting scenes from a marvell movie and that's just not making this what it advertises. I supose this a story told by people and thus the real poor fight stories are just made up. Their was one fight scene where character would have broken his back, yet five minutes later he is just walking away. The same character gets stabbed too. The series is just cashing in on gangster sterotypes and does not add anything new, that has not been seen before.",/review/rw7773643/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2020,jonnybrutal-350-25526,8," Bloody and Violent
","I dont think that the producers set out to make a realistic portrayal of gang life in London. This was created for entertainment purposes and needs to be viewed as such. Gareth Evans forte is extreme action sequences and this is undoubtedly where this series excels. The action set pieces are truly intense and very over the top. People don't just get killed on this show. they are butchered and the concept of less is more is left on the floor as teams of machine gun wielding mercenaries do battle with crazed criminal families and drug kingpins in seemingly never ending gunfights. The police never seem to hear all this gunplay and the criminals are able to ""clean up"". Now, i find all this totally acceptable ...as I said this is not an in depth of portrayal of gang culture in London it is a series made in the spirit of entertainment for those of us who like their action as stylised as a Kung Fu movie with a side order of extra tomato sauce ...by the bucket load!!",/review/rw7773643/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2020,wmcq-25947,10," The Most Brutal Violent TV Show Of All Time 9/10
","Wow just wow, the violence on show must be seen to be believed in some scenes. I have never seen anything like it. Some of the episodes are truly fantastic, episode 5 is some of the best TV you will see on that barnsite.",/review/rw7773643/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2020,roxmewild,5," Average
","I am bemused by the high ratings this show has received I mean seriously this does NOT compare in quality' to the Superb Peaky Blinders so how people have scored a 10/10 seems crazy to me!
The first episode did not grip me in the slightest there is lots of room for improvement and for me it was very average.
Unlike many I do not rate a show on the amount of graphic violence don't get me wrong I am not opposed to it but it only works if the script and story are good enough that is why PB is so excellent. This show is not and so far the story is not gripping I will continue to watch to see if it improves but for now average show.",/review/rw7773643/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2020,normanemailer,7," There are problems ...
","... and the lead actor, Joe Cole, is one of them. He's not a strong enough actor to play a role like this. Think Bob Hoskins in The Long Good Friday. Cole is too lightweight. He was okay in Peaky Blinders because his character was different in that he was second fiddle to Cillan Murphy. And the violence seems to be gratuitous. The storyline is a well worn cliche. Compare with Gangs of New York.",/review/rw7773643/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2022,arnab_911,8," You'll have to see it to believe it!
","Everything about this series is at par with each other. The acting, directing, script writing all feels like made for each other. There is a lot of storytelling in this series which can't go down well with everybody, let alone the carnage. Oh! The carnage, how can I forget the carnage. If you ain't the lover of gun violence or any violence for that matter then this ain't your cup of tea, and there's a lot of it! One negative point I'd like to point out is all the body armour protection in gun fight is okay but without any protection everyone is acting like John rambo or Wilson fisk is a little too much. Other than that the whole thing is flawless.",/review/rw7773643/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2020,Dan_Finn,10," Utter Carnage!!
","If you have ever watched The Raid you will know what I mean, a high octane, ultra violent, thrill ride, with some Incredible fight scenes. All rammed down your throat for the main course and then a slice of ""what have I just watched"" for desert.",/review/rw7773643/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2020,andy742,6," Too many 10 reviews here, the show is ok but lets calm down
","I've never seen so many 10/10 reviews - either people are on lockdown and have nothing better to do or there are a certain number of fakes here.
The show is ok, it's not great, it's ok.
It got a bit weird half way thru and the story seemed to jump without reason.
It's violent but it's not the most violent thing ever seen on tv by any means.
It was an ok watch but I was expecting more.",/review/rw7773643/?ref_=tt_urv

23 October 2022,sumtim3s00n,3," Season 2 Quality Drops Like A Rock
","I do not know whether they replaced the writers but season 2 is basically unwatchable. The story meanders left and right and is unnecessarily convoluted. Not to mention boring and all the characters completely unlikeable. The whole season doesnt really move anywhere or are there any interesting developments, nothing but a repeated betrayal left and right, all covered with lots and lots of bloodshed. And of course Elliot, who it seems came over from MCU where he got a proper big dose of super soldier serum because he has no problem going against small armies by himself repeatedly with ease.",/review/rw7773643/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2022,expatrickdale,3," Good first series, weak second series
","The first series of Gangs of London was a tight, gripping thriller. The second series was a convoluted mess full of disjointed scenes, a messy storyline, lots of gangsters giving each other hard stares, monosyllabic dialogue, and a lot of very weird characters who contributed nothing to the plot. Even the violence is tedious.",/review/rw7773643/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2022,mwsmbngsimon,6," What happened to season 2? Season was magnificent
","Gangs of london season 1 is one those tv shows which are so good but doesnt have enough popularity and recognition. It was neatly written, characters were likeable, their development was convincing and the direction of the plot was purely justifiable. The action scenes were intellegently merged in the storyline
Season 2 felt suddenly very bad! I watched the first episode and i was completely disappointed. It felt like they changed the writers and directors. Its only the nolstagia of season 1 that kept me watching it expecting it to get better but it didnt. I am going to review it in the following aspects; plot, cinematography, acting and the action scenes, characters, dialogue. The plot was okay but the way it unfolds was poorly written, so basically its about gang power dynamics n balance shift after the fall of the wallace family. The scenes seemed rushed, and alot of stories just mashed together to give a watcher a certain idea of what was goingon. The direction the plot took at some points was unjustifiable and it suffered from alot of plotholes. Eg. Assif brought koba to secure desclipline amongst the gangs but it seemed like koba had more power than Assif without any levarage, there was no point in ressuructing Sean Wallace who suffered a headshot in the first season, so many unjustifiable betrayals literally everybody is betraying everyone, whoever released Sean from prison didnt seem existent and couldnt elicit any form of control over him, its only justified if Sean was actually motivated to kill Elliot who tried to kill him in the first season. In season finale, Elliot fights and beats Sean and gets a seat on the table, what was he worthy to other gang members, he didn't have connections, infrastructures or any leverage The cinematrography maybe is the only good thing about season 2, the colour tone and the camera angles were okay. The acting was okay too as in nothing seemed cringy and forced but there was alittle bit too much unjustified blood shed and gore! I get we liked the same action scenes in the first season but back then they weren't overdone, and were intelligently mixed that a person actually missed them. The characters were easily forgettable and unlikable, there was little or poor character develpment and only few characters had justifiable motivation. Eg. Seam Wallace at first he appeared as person who was on the revenge mission for who plotted to kill him, then he was about power, then about family trying to save his brother within a very thin chemistry between the characters. The characters appeared out of nowhere for the convinience of the story eg the madam drug dealer Sean/ Koba went to see in Paris. The wasn't enough reason to push Alex Dumani to commit suicide, he just didn't look that cornered. His father Ed Dumani, his character seemed principled and powerful in the first season but it is so badly written is season 2 that it doesn't have any edges, he seems floating everywhere, his actual power and inclusiveness in the gangs seems non existent. Finally the dialogue, well the only thing you can say about it is that it was non existent and uninteresting.",/review/rw7773643/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2020,stewdmx,9," It is solid.
","Solid show. Yes it is violent as some of the reviewers seem to be upset about. Just wondering... What were you expecting? The show's title is ""Gangs of London"". How do you not expect violence?",/review/rw7773643/?ref_=tt_urv

30 October 2022,rammohanyada,10," rating just for first season
","In the first season I've seen one of the amazing and unforgettable action scenes, but i don't understand what happened in second season, although they did good with story and acting is okay but I'm disappointed with action scene it's became so ordinary like other drama, i was hoping that second season will have mind blowing action like first season but there is nothing like that and it's feel like someone take your excitement and make your life dull and plain. I've waited for second season for so long, I'm disappointed. Please please if gonna make third season, make sure we get same excitement.",/review/rw7773643/?ref_=tt_urv
