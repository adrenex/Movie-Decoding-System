6 November 2005,lavatch,7," Worth Watching For One Reason: Dustin Hoffman
","I enjoyed the sequel ""Meet the Fockers"" more than the original ""Meet the Parents"" for one reason: the performance of Dustin Hoffman. Overall, it was a fine ensemble cast and good scripting of the jokes and situations surrounding the irrepressible ex-CIA agent and family patriarch Jack Byrnes (Robert DeNiro). But Hoffman's character Bernie Focker, an attorney who retired to become a full-time dad to his son Greg (Ben Stiller), grounds this comedy in solid human values that raise the film beyond the level of nutty comedy.",/review/rw1014202/?ref_=tt_urv

","In Meet The Parents Ben Stiller had to win the trust of Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner the parents of his girl friend Teri Polo, that famed 'circle of trust' in the Byrnes family. Now the whole family is going to Florida where Stiller's parents the Fockers have a palatial estate and ideas that definitely run counter to those espoused by DeNiro.",/review/rw1014202/?ref_=tt_urv

","Just as good the original, in my opinion. Any sequel-slack was ironed out with Dustin Hoffman's sidesplitting performance. I'm really surprised to see so many people find this an unworthy sequel... it's more of what made the original funny with just enough additions to keep it fresh.",/review/rw1014202/?ref_=tt_urv

With no further excuses, Greg and Dina join Pam and Jack as they take their RV down to Florida to meet the Focker family. With an eye very much on his bloodline, Jack is keen to judge his future son-in-law by his parents, which spells problems when he finds himself living with two very liberal and touchy-feely Fockers.",/review/rw1014202/?ref_=tt_urv

","In this very hilarious sequel, Gaylord Myron Focker (Ben Stiller), his pregnant fiancée Pamela Byrnes (Teri Polo), his future father-in-law and retired CIA agent Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro) and his future mother-in-law Dina Byrnes (Blythe Danner) travel to Florida to visit Greg's parents, Bernie Focker (Dustin Hoffman) and the sex-therapist Roz Focker (Barbra Streisand). The dispute between the ""Focker-ized"" and very ""Zen"" family and the rigid and paranoid Jack Byrnes made me burst in a ""non-stop laughing"" mode not only along the movie, but also after, recalling the funny scenes and gags. The talent of Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro as comedians is very well-known by the audiences, but Dustin Hoffman surprised me how funny he is. Barbra Streisand is also excellent, and the jokes with the English word ""Focker"" are great. For my surprise, there are IMDb users that hated this movie, probably bitter people without sense of humor that unfortunately we stumble in our lives. If the reader of my simple review wants to laugh, see this movie. My vote is eight.",/review/rw1014202/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Meet the Fockers"" sounds like ""Meet the f-u-u-"". Oops! Can't say that because of FCC guidelines. Just the same, the title pretty much describes the level of the humor in this Ben Stiller comedy. But that's redundant because it IS a Ben Stiller movie. Clearly my expectations for this movie were not high and, maybe because of that, I found ""Meet the Fockers"" quite funny.",/review/rw1014202/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2016,deloudelouvain,8," A good sequel with the right amount of humor
","I was so thrilled when I heard they were making a sequel to Meet The parents because I loved that movie. And even though most of the times you get disappointed with sequels with this one I wasn't. It was totally in the line of its predecessor. Maybe not as good but still way better the thousands of other wannabe comedies. This time it's about meeting the parents of Gaylord Focker and if you know Jack Byrnes you know there will be problems when he meets the Fockers. The lifestyle of Bernie and Rozalie Focker (played by Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand) is quite the opposite of Jack Byrnes' lifestyle and vision and so it has to clash. Again the funniest moments are between De Niro and Stiller, even though I thought Hoffman was very funny too in some parts. A good sequel if you liked the first one. If you don't like Ben Stiller and his comedy then just skip the movie because that's all you are going to get.",/review/rw1014202/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2020,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7," His first word...
","'Meet The Fockers (2004)' may be similar in premise to its predecessor, but it feels distinct enough to work as a sequel and is the natural extension of the series' core concept. Pitting in-laws against in-laws is a solid idea, especially when you have a cast as good as this. I mean, who doesn't want to see De Niro get body slammed by Hoffman? The picture is a good time throughout. It amps up the slapstick ever-so-slightly but it still remains relatively grounded and relatable. It's properly funny, too; it may actually be funnier than the first flick. Overall, it's a solid comedy with memorable characters and classic comedic beats. It's really enjoyable. 7/10",/review/rw1014202/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2004,max-217,8," Not as good as the original, but its' still a satisfying sequel!
","MEET THE FOCKERS made me laugh a lot. It probably has more laughs than the original, but the laughs aren't as big or as fresh or as subtle. And as sequels go, it contains many scenes that are mere variations of the original: the dinner gone wrong, the sports competition gone wrong, the pet gone wrong, the Owen Wilson cameo, the ""focker"" puns, etc. But many of the variations are quite inspired. Thanks to the terrific cast. De Niro, Stiller, Hoffman and Streisand all look like they're having a great time. Each is given a scene or two to really shine; De Niro and Hoffman fare the best. A child actor's also been added to the cast, and he's a scene-stealer. I just wish Blythe Danner (Mrs. Byrnes) and Teri Polo (Pam Focker) were given more to do. But, as entertaining as I thought the movie was, expect many critics to be turned off or pretend to be turned off by the numerous toilet jokes. I say, flock 'em!",/review/rw1014202/?ref_=tt_urv

19 February 2005,warnerclassic,1," Focking Awful
","Meeting the Parents of your girlfriend can be stressful enough. But having her parents meet yours can sometimes be a recipe for disaster, something Greg Focker finds to his peril; when both sets of parents meet on the eve of his wedding. Made after the success of Meet the Parents, Meet the Fockers carries on where the last film left off, with Greg delivering babies while his stuffy future father in laws delivers ultimatums, both with memorable results. Of course Greg is now finally in ""The Circle of Trust"" a circle that is headed by Jack, Greg's uptight future father in law, retired from the CIA, yet still firmly attached to his former profession. Meanwhile Greg's own parents are laid back and free with their emotions, his mother being a sex therapist and his father a house husband. Knowing Jack's conservative ways Greg is delighted but terrified at his fiancés news that they are going to have a baby. Worried of Jacks reaction, things get worse when Greg's old teenage crush reappears, along with a 15 year old son who is a dead ringer for Greg and, as far as Jack's concerned, a prime contender for a DNA test . Meet the Fockers is based purely in the realm of a one joke movie (i.e. the family's name) and so has the longevity of one (i.e. very short) The main problems with the film is the heartbreaking (from a film fans point of view) sight of Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand all participating in a film that Benny Hill would have passed at. Streisand, the powerhouse all singing and acting legend, is here reduced to teaching senior citizens how to have better sex, something I could have lived without seeing. Hoffman is clearly having fun, although quite unaware that the audience isn't. His scenes with De Niro have a chemistry, but the scenes themselves do little to their reputations. One scene with Hoffman sitting on a toilet and De Niro in the shower waiting for him to ""finish"" really felt like an all time low, and when Hoffman flushed I hoped their careers wasn't going down with it. One high point is the appearance of Owen Wilson (Stiller's Hutch to his Starsky) who shows up at the end, but by that time I was too busy sawing through my wrists. Meet the Fockers has an incredible waste of exceptional talent, and that my friends is no laughing matter.",/review/rw1014202/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2004,the-movie-guy,8," One hilarious movie
","In this sequel to 'Meet the Parents,' Gaylord Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) has finally invited his fiancée's parents, ex-CIA agent Jack Byrnes and his wife (Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner) to meet his parents. Jack wants to know if Greg came from a good gene pool. Jack discovers that the Fockers are very strange. The Dad (Dustin Hoffman) is a hippie and retired lawyer, and the Mom (Barbara Streisand) is an open sex therapist. Jack begins to thinks this is not a good family for his daughter to marry into. Greg's parents are so proud of Greg that they have a wall of honor with Greg's ninth and tenth place sports awards. The two families try to become one family. This was one hilarious movie, which I laughed from beginning to end. This is proof of the old adage, that actors don't like to work with children and animals, because they stole the movie. The child spoke with sign language and had some of the best comedy scenes of the movie. The toilet scene with the cat and dog was just so funny.

","I beg to disagree with most of the critics on this one. I actually liked this movie a little better than 'Meet the Parents', and it is very rare for me to prefer a sequel to the original. There was some good acting in this movie, which is no wonder given the caliber of the cast. Make no mistake, this was definitely not a masterpiece, the script could have been better and the last 20 minutes of the film are a little overdone and cheesy, but all in all a decent, entertaining movie.",/review/rw1014202/?ref_=tt_urv

","Witless follow-up to ""Meet the Parents"" is full of slapstick chaos with poor continuity, strained gags, pets used as vulgar visual jesters, and a screaming toddler. Worse than that, the film has some of the worst writing, directing, and cinematography I've seen all year. Ben Stiller, his lipsticked-mouth always open in surprise and his eyes rimmed in black like a raccoon, makes certain his overly-pancaked face is in close-up at all available times; this must have been contagious, because the cameraman plasters the screen with everybody's mug, which wouldn't be so bad except that their confusion over the stupidity of the plot is magnified. Jokes are flayed around desperately in the hopes of hitting a target (even the end-credits joke-reel fails). Loud instead of funny, everything is underlined and then milked for a chuckle. There are terrible sequences and running jokes in this movie, jokes that are even out of character (like Robert De Niro and the strap-on breast). It doesn't work. As for that bawling infant, who also gets his fair share of close-ups: he learns to talk dirty, which really cracked up the audience I saw ""Meet the Fockers"" with. *1/2 from ****",/review/rw1014202/?ref_=tt_urv

","Like virtually all mainstream releases, *Meet the Fockers* is, of course, really too awful to warrant an amateur review: only the professionals should be forced to deal with the dreary task. But a movie whose cast includes Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, and Barbra Streisand would SEEM to invite discussion. Thirty years ago, such a cast would have indicated a Major Motion Picture. In 2005, I'm sorry to report that these living-legend actors have been inducted -- however profitably to themselves -- in the ongoing mission to Keep DreamWorks Afloat. The Stiller/De Niro ""franchise"" has officially joined the *Shrek* series as an anomalous money-maker for the studio. The creative bankruptcy of Messrs. Spielberg, Geffen, and Katzenberg resulted in the demise of both the TV and music units of the company; and as for the movie-wing of the operation, that creative bankruptcy has never been more clearly demonstrated than with *Meet the Fockers*.",/review/rw1014202/?ref_=tt_urv

","Great sequel---I didn't care for the original very much. It was too negative, too many of the 'jokes' revolved around frustration, mishaps, and pain. Not my scene! But this second one was VERY good! I was especially surprised, and pleasantly, by Barbara Streisand's performance. I actually liked her. A LOT. The rest of the cast was outstanding as well. 'Meet the Fockers' had lots of jokes, but wasn't the 'madcap' zany freak-fest the first tried (and failed, ultimately) to be. This was more of a sustained wit. It also has charm, grace, and warmth. I found that surprising, because it is marketed (at least here in the UK) more as a slapstick job.",/review/rw1014202/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is an incredibly funny movie. I can't believe the lackluster reviews that this film has received. It's one of the most consistently funny films to come out in recent memory. I (and the rest of the audience for that matter) laughed hardily throughout. Dustin Hoffman, Robert Deniro and Ben Stiller are great. The female characters aren't given much to do, but give adequate performances. Not being a Streisand fan, I was a little apprehensive about her casting, but am pleased to say that she is very good in the role and stands toe-to-toe with hubby Hoffman. The movie is quickly paced and provides very little ""down time"" where the comedy bogs down. It's a great mix of slap-stick, witty banter, strong comedic performances, crude humor and even cutesy fowl mouthed toddlers. To me all these high brow critics need to lighten up. Comedies should be judged by whether or not they are funny and that's it. The bottom line with this film is that it's hilarious.

","Despite the reviews being lukewarm, I went to see this movie on a recent afternoon because I had a couple of hours between holiday visits to friends. It was the only film that fit my schedule. It was not my first, second or third choice and if I had absolutely anything else to do and if the weather had been any more cooperative, I would have run - not walked out of the theater. I decided that since it remained at the top of the box office for another week, maybe, just maybe there was something redeeming about it. There isn't. Nothing. And the audience agreed. There were probably 20 of us and not one person - not one - laughed at any point in this movie. It is one of the most pathetic wastes of talent since - since - since I don't know what.

18 January 2005,indy-39,1," Geat idea for another sequel...
","Just saw MTF and got a great idea for a sequel... the Fockers and the Ryans go on vacation to Europe where they run into all kinds of zany characters... Kenneth Branagh as a schizo prince...maybe Gary Oldman as a excessively flatulent cab driver...what a pity George C. Scott has passed on, in drag he could have been the perfect Grandma Focker. Seriously folks, the people who paired Deniro and Hoffman are to be praised...just think if they had been around long ago perhaps they could have gotten Shakespeare and Oscar Wilde to write together... perhaps they could have written dirty jokes or, even better, subway graffiti. Anyone who doesn't see this movie for the disgrace that it is has no business writing about film. To take two actors of this caliber and waste them on a souped up TV sitcom... well lets just say the producers should never be allowed to ATTEND another film much less make one. Marlon Brando left Hollywood, stopped making films, retreated to a desert island, gained 500 pounds and pretty much made a joke out of himself when his acting career essentially was over... too bad Robert Deniro couldn't have done the same. An embarrassment for everyone involved...except Ben Stiller...for him this film represents the high point of his career.

I watched Finding Neverland and Fockers back to back in two evenings, in that order. In watching Neverland, I couldn't help having my eyes moist, even just a little.
