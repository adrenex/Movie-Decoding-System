23 April 2015,bbewnylorac,7," Interesting and heartfelt
","This series is clunky in many ways. It's true that sometimes it comes across like an army recruitment ad. Sometimes the script, acting and plot are too clich√©d and the English countryside is an unconvincing stand-in for Afghanistan. But it's fantastic to see a drama revolving around a young cockney woman, Molly Dawes, who in London has a pretty bleak and insular life with few options in the future, and so tries a different tack and joins the army. The army opens up her life, and while she's not sophisticated at all, she does go on a journey that holds your interest. Lacey Turner is very convincing as the, at first, tough London teenager who becomes a scared, out of her depth, bullied, but brave and determined soldier. Too often, British dramas depict cockney girls as tarty losers always at the pub. This series was made with a good heart and I'm enjoying it.",/review/rw4214588/?ref_=tt_urv

20 June 2018,mahirehman,4," What is going on with the series?????
","I've been watching Our Girl when it first aired with Lacey Turner as Molly Dawes, and it was a great piece of British Drama until watching last nights episode (Belize) where Captain James declares his 'feelings' for Michelle Keegan's character Georgie. Since the introduction of Michelle Keegan's character I can easily see a decrease in the ratings. Its obvious that the source of why the ratings are dropping is because the the writer is primarily focused on forcing or creating love-matches. The story is OUR GIRL not LOVE ISLAND, focus on the premise of the WAR ASPECTS and the consequences of war and how we can better people if we showed compassion and a chance for reformation. That was literally the foundation of the show. BBC GET YOURSELF A NEW WRITER!",/review/rw4214588/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2019,svtcobra331,6," Series One = 10 stars
","Series One is film making to perfection. Well, it's a character-development story, so we can excuse the lame combat scenes with actors forming a nice target while their guns are inadvertently pointing at each other.
Molly Dawes is the underdog we all want to succeed, and this movie sets MD in a perfectly human situation: Loser BF, loser role models, she thinks she's smarter than she is (aren't we all guilty of this?) and she's an adult clinging to childhood.",/review/rw4214588/?ref_=tt_urv

","Our Girl - pure drama? They've even introduced swearing to make it more ""realistic"". Really???",/review/rw4214588/?ref_=tt_urv

",Please...please...no matter what you thought of season 1 and the film...DON'T treat this too seriously.,/review/rw4214588/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2021,mikemcbride97016,10," Stop at season 1
","This rating is for season 1 only. Do yourself a favor and don't watch any further than that. They replace the main character, Molly, in season 2 and proceed to totally spit in her face later on. As far as I'm concerned ""Our Girl"" only has one season.",/review/rw4214588/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2019,emuir-1,7," Good pilot, but quickly went downhill with improbable romance
","As I joined up in 1959, I really enjoyed watching the pilot episode where the young girl from a very dysfunctional low class family joined the army on a whim. Many of the experiences mirrored my own, the pleasant recruiting sergeant laying on the charm - we got a ride to the railway station when going for our induction, but returning after signing on were told to make our own way to the station and carry our own bags! The big difference between then and now was that women were a separate branch and did not train for combat, so I was spared the route marches, extreme physical training, cross country runs, etc. and going to a war zone.",/review/rw4214588/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2015,AndyMassard,6," It's not the worst I have seen.
","This review does contain spoilers. As a member of a western military, there are a few things about this that does make me cringe. It is not the worst series I have seen and there are periods where the plot, characters, scenery, and action are quite good. 1. There is no way a Corporal would stand for back chat from a recruit. 2. There is no way they would be allowed their mobile phones by their bed during recruit training. 3. If I was the platoon commander I would have ditched her half way through episode two as she is a liability. Never do you just wander off on a patrol. Never do you allow local civilians to walk straight up to you, regardless of age. 4. Not one of them has any form of eye protection. As a veteran of Afghanistan you are issued with ballistic glasses with changeable lenses. Tinted for day, clear or yellow for night. Every time you step outside the wire, they are on. This does not include the ballistic goggles on your helmet. 5. The closest distance any reasonable soldier would be to a suicide vest is 100 to 200 meters. There is a cordon and everyone inside is evacuated. As for the lovers tiff in front of an IED, that's something else.",/review/rw4214588/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2019,david-hawkridge,3," Load of rubbish
","Being ex services I try not to watch this type of drama, unfortunately I don't have sole domain over the remote, this load of rubbish re-enforces my decision to avoid it like the plague, the acting is wooden, the characters unbelievable, add to that the total lack of knowledge of how the military is run, the interaction between the officer ranks and lower ranks just would not happen, on top of that the military structure as depicted in this so called drama is so far off kilter its a joke. Thats it I can get back to my kindle while she who must be obeyed finishes watching what I hope is the last of what I hope is the last series",/review/rw4214588/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2017,peteingram,4," Seasons 1 & 2 were great. Season 3, not so much
","As my title says, I very much enjoyed the first two seasons. With season 3, the acting is just as good and the sets are great too. However the plot or story line is just rubbish. Some of the dialogues are simply banal. It is a shame because the concept is unique. I probably shall not watch the rest of this season.",/review/rw4214588/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2014,stuartbell-116-486587,8," Great Episode 1
","Great start to this series. Realistic (so far as I know) and really brings home to you more than just the difficulties of the situation. The soldiers are normal, ordinary guys learning their trade. They are highly efficient but show all the nerves, the horrors of the war, the humanity and frailties. ",/review/rw4214588/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2020,akicork,10," I wish I could pin this review at the top, the way these women deserve it. (admin?)
","""Our Girl"" is a dramatised, fictionalised conflation (and extension) of the exploits of the first two women to be awarded the Military Cross, Private Michelle Norris (RAMC) attached to The Princess of Wales Royal Regiment, for her actions in Iraq, and AB Kate Nesbitt (RN), a Medical Assistant attached to 1 Rifles, 3 Commando Brigade, for her actions in Afghanistan. These selfless women deserve to have their actions memorialised and preserved for the respect of future generations: honour attaches to them and if the public is entertained at the same time, so much the better!",/review/rw4214588/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2018,qui_j,1," Utter rubbish
","The first episode should have served as a warning sign that worse was to come. It was filled with characters who appeared out of the blue, a lot of shouting and chaos by a bunch of scroungers. However, I decided to give it a chance. Gave up midway through season 1. Each episode is filled with silly plots and predictable outcomes. If you want to watch a bit of TV before bedtime, this will certainly put you to sleep faster than any pill on the market!",/review/rw4214588/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2020,Firestorhm77,7," Season One is great! Season Two? Meh...

1 July 2018,GrandoFernando,1," Atrocious
","If you watch coronation street, emmerdale and eastenders, then this should be about your level. Useless actors playing unrealistic characters acting out unbelievable plots. This epitomises the BBC these days. God knows what kind of people are running the BBC, but I have an idea.",/review/rw4214588/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2014,kevinmaclellan0,10," Good British TV
",I have been watching British TV over the past couple of years and came across this series by fluke. In North America we do not have anywhere near some of the good British series available. Perhaps the NA plots will add more character in the future but today we watch a series centered on a plot and we know it will end in usually a good way. That is not to say there is not some good NA TV because there are some super series available. The Brits add more depth with character and less with the plot and inane action of killing a dozen people every show. Anyway my wife is Brit and she likes the British shows so I am along for the ride.,/review/rw4214588/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2015,kenfran,5," As a series with an Army theme it was more liked Dad's Army
",It is a quality series in many ways and I especially enjoyed the first half of this series. I loved the main star Molly and for the first few episodes could not wait for the next week's episode. Then the writer must of gone on holiday and for me the series took a dive down as a Dad's army version of the army took over.,/review/rw4214588/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2020,Chrispearce2,6," Going down hill
",In my opinion this is going down hill. On Nepal Tour episode 3 and it's turned into EastEnders with guns.,/review/rw4214588/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2019,dromasca,4," military soap opera
","I trusted the ARTE TV channel which usually brings good quality TV series from Europe, but this was one of the occasions when they really abused my trust. 'Our Girl', the story of a British young woman, lost in life and recovered by the British Army to be sent to serve in Afghanistan as a combat medic, is quite an unfortunate combination between a soap opera and a military series. I am no big fan of any of the two genres, and the combination did not make me change my opinions.",/review/rw4214588/?ref_=tt_urv

5 May 2017,amymytsang,5," If you love the pilot and the first full series ... you will be disappointed
","This is not a bad sequel, but it is not the excellent drama that was produced in the pilot and the first full length series. It contained far too many crowd pleasers to try and keep the die hard fans of those such as Ben Aldridge.",/review/rw4214588/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2019,brushwood_darren,8," Series 1 is excellent but 2 is just ok
","I really enjoyed series 1 of Our Girl. The Pilot was excellent and I was glad they did a series. Ok some of it was a little far fetched but the action was brilliant. I personally felt they made a mistake not keeping Molly (Lacey Turner). Series 2 and onwards is ok, just not as good.",/review/rw4214588/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2016,chris-palmeri,3," Series 2 - Contrived, predictable and boring
","Summary says it all. Where is the tension and suspense, the twists and turns? Did anyone really look forward to the next episode or just watch it because it was on after the bake off? ",/review/rw4214588/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2018,ikanboy,6," A soap in Afghanistan
","It starts off in a dysfunctional cockney family in London, where our heroine is busy living La Vida Loca. Once she sobers up she decides to join the Army as a medic and despite showing little or no aptitude she ends up in Afghanistan with Ramsay Bolton (kinder of John?) and proceeds to dis him in favor of much more handsome Captain Charles. A mouthy cockney she seems never to shut up and saves her most strident comments while on maneuvers, and her ""romance is in the air"" comments while in a fire fight. Oblivious to local customs she stirs up a Taliban hornet's nest and spends the last 2 episodes apologizing. But no fear her Captain has a beautiful manse in Bath and that's where our story part 1 ends.",/review/rw4214588/?ref_=tt_urv
