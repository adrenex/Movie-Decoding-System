","""The Life of David Gale"" is a terrific thriller and is one of the best of 2003. Despite going to this movie through the worst date of my life... shudder, I still have nightmares, this movie was the silver lining. I was very excited to see this movie because it has such an awesome actor, obviously Kevin Spacey and then a great actress Kate Winslet.",/review/rw7636780/?ref_=tt_urv

16 April 2009,Dr_Coulardeau,9," Machiavelli is still alive and kicking, in death row.
","You may think this film is a thriller about the death penalty, but it is not. It looks like it, true, but the end reveals it is something completely different. It is about the way the media can be manipulated in any direction, provided you are intelligent. Once a brilliant university professor was confronted in a TV debate to the governor of Texas about the death penalty. The governor asked him to give the name of one executed person that was innocent and could be proved so. The professor could not answer such a question for the simple reason that there is no post mortem investigation in the case of an execution, except And the professor started, with his main assistant in his fight against the death penalty, to think of how to prove that point. In the mean time he is tricked by some dumb girl student into doing exactly what he should never have done: have sex with her. She sue him for rape, even if later she will drop the charge. The damage is done. He is kicked out of academia. His wife takes his son away and gets a divorce. She sells the house. He cannot even get a job as the manager of a technical store. He is reduced to nothing, to being a rapist forever. But he does not want to move. His main assistant in his fight is going to die of leukemia. When he learns that, the plan to trap the governor germinates in their minds and they put it through. He is going to be accused of the murder of his assistant though it is not a murder. The evidence it is not is a tape, the recording of what really happened. But it will come in three pieces. The man will be sentenced to death. Three days before his execution he asks a famous journalist from New York to come and take the first and last interview he is going to give her in six hours spread out over the three days before his execution. The first excerpt of the tape we have mentioned will turn up in the journalist's motel room on the second day, before execution, too short and a copy. Worthless. Then after some adventure the journalist manages to recuperate what she thinks is the whole tape that proves what she was thinking, after some personal experimentation, is right: the woman killed herself, but who worked the camera? A man that is seen at the end of the tape, a man the journalist has seen here and there and in whose shack she has found the tape. But that too is too short though not worthless. It creates havoc and it proves an innocent man can be sentenced to death. During that time the $500,000 for the interview travel to Mexico and the ex-wife for the son. The father had been vindicated in the mean time. But the journalist finally receives the last excerpt of the tape, the end of the suicidal demonstrative séance and there the professor is shown coming at this very moment, just after the death of the woman, just as if he had been behind the camera all the time and he turns that camera off, after checking the woman is dead. The media had been manipulated about the guilt of the man and about the fairness and justice of the death penalty, then about the man's innocence and the suicide of the woman, and yet the truth was that the death had been planned in such a way that the execution would demonstrate how an innocent person can be sentenced to death. Manipulation all along by a woman who wanted to make her natural death useful for the cause she advocated and by a man who did not have the courage to move on and start a new life after having been destroyed by an unscrupulous student and by his own dumbness: students are out of reach as long as they are within grading distance. He preferred to make his death (which becomes a very special suicide) useful for the cause he advocated and for his own son. But the film is short because two men helped the woman and staged her death and the man lied all along the way of his confession and ordeal. The media are so naïve that they believe anything provided it smells slightly sulfurous or sulfuric.",/review/rw7636780/?ref_=tt_urv

21 June 2004,claudio_carvalho,10," Excellent Dramatic Thriller: Alan Parker's Trademark
","The journalist Bitsey Bloom (Kate Winslet) is invited by the former professor and director of the philosophy section at Austin University convicted to death David Gale (Kevin Spacey) to have a private and exclusive interview with him for her newspaper for the fees of US$ 500,000.00. David Gale was accused of rape and murder of his colleague and friend Constance Harraway (Laura Linney). They both were activists of the movement against death penalty in Texas called the Deathwatch. Bitsey goes to Texas with the intern Zack Stemmons (Gabriel Mann) and along the three days of close contact with David, she finds the truth behind the whole accusation. This movie is another excellent dramatic thriller of Alan Parker. Having a great screenplay full of plot points and having Kate Winslet, Kevin Spacey and Laura Linney leading a wonderful cast, it is a must-see film. The surprising end is stunning. My vote is ten.",/review/rw7636780/?ref_=tt_urv

I'm not David Gale, I'm a murderer and a rapist, four days shy of his execution,' exclaims Gale (Kevin Spacey) to reporter Bitsey Bloom (Kate Winslet) on one of his last few days of life.  While Gale might be right, no one who looks at The Life of David Gale on the silver screen sees a movie, they see a work of art.  This isn't The Life of David Gale, this is one of the most meaningful and insightful films created in years.

","Here's a movie that starts out OK. Unfortunately as it goes on, I started to feel less and less interested in the film, which is often the case these days. Spacey is undoubtedly a better supporting actor than lead. He's a pretty good actor, but throughout the movie, he's bland, low-key - probably more a poor choice of direction. Kate Winslet is watchable, but more a Nancy Drew than reporter......implausibilities? plenty - how about the bank issuing $500k cash on the same day and then various characters parading it around everywhere even to other countries, or college professor/administrators drinking and partying publicly with their classes?

12 April 2014,A_Different_Drummer,6," Like the script itself, a film not what it pretends to be...
","You look at the cast. An award-winning cast in front of and behind the camera. You look at the genre. Crime drama. Sounds promising? You look at the length. At over 2 hours running time, you possibly have some doubts, since so few films in the history of the medium have managed to sustain interest at that length, but, you tell yourself, with such credentials, how can you go wrong? Well, the answer is, it is easier than it looks, for this is a very flawed film, with major timing, casting, and writing problems, that succeeds (ie, remains reasonably entertaining and suspenseful) in spite of itself. And painfully so. Interestingly, the film itself is a throwback to an era a few decades earlier (the 80s) when ""trick endings"" or ""messing with the audience's head"" was more popular. There is a reason that kind of film died. Ironically, for a story which itself is about opposing capital punishment, the production of this specific film is proof that these sorts of twisty-turny stories really should be euthanized before film is ever loaded in the camera. The first 20 minutes of the film (literally) is one movie by itself, full of great acting, dialog, and promise. Then, at the 20 min mark, Kevin Spacey's character comes onboard and immediately there are issues. It is not so much that he does a bad job, as it is the casting. The role is the antithesis of the type of role Spacey usually plays (meek and innocent as opposed to powerful and evil) and this creates a ""disconnect"" with the viewer that becomes progressively more uncomfortable as the film winds down the overlong road it has chosen. The killer (of the film, not of the script) is the last 20 minutes, where (effectively) a third movie starts, completely different from the first two. By this stage the audience feels on a subliminal level like a chicken being plucked and headed for the pot. Clearly, there is something going on here, the dialog and action reveals, but you won't know what until the very end, until the Big Reveal.",/review/rw7636780/?ref_=tt_urv

26 March 2007,pfgpowell-1,8," So good it can take a few quibbles
","There are films you dislike and will pick on every petty unimportant failing to slag it off. There are other films you like so much, you are willing to forgive everything. Then there are films like The Life Of David Gale which are such a cut above the rest of Hollywood fare that you will be extraordinarily picky merely because you wish an excellent film and been flawless. So what follows is merely a list of petty complaints (and may contain spoilers). The reader should take it as read that this film is worth every penny and then some of the price of the cinema ticket or bought DVD. Spacey, as always, is impeccable. He has that knack of acting well without apparently acting at all. Kate Winslet, too, was excellent. But now for my list of complaints: as this was a thriller Alan Parkers obviously tried to keep the tension up. But often he did so by adding elements which otherwise make no sense. For example, our first glimpse of Dusty, the mysterious cowboy, was when Bitsey and Zac stop because of engine trouble. But wait a minute: this can neither be coincidence (why would Dusty stop suspiciously on the off-chance that here he has come across the car of two New York reporters come to cover Gale's execution? But nor can it be the case that Dusty was able to follow the rental car all the way to the rest stop. And why would he stop anyway? The answer is, of course, that Parker wants to heighten tension. And why not? you ask. Well, of course he can  but it is not organically part of the film. Another example: Why involve Bitsey in the first place? Why not simply write a letter of explanation and send it to her with the complete tape of Constance's suicide once the execution has take place? She could still be enlisted to write a piece about how innocent people are executed. But of course in that way  well, you haven't got a film. As for the half million dollars: did I miss something? Why was it part of the film? Why was it required by Bitsey and Zac? Why was it sent to Gale's ex-wife? Similarly with Dusty's love of opera: this seemed particularly gratuitous, an element added simply for the sake of effect. But back to my original comments: these are essentially minor quibbles and it is, ironically, a mark of just how good this film is compared to so much other dross that I make them.",/review/rw7636780/?ref_=tt_urv

19 January 2009,antoniotierno,6," absolutely nothing special
","Well, the problem is not with the cast, since ""American Beauty's"" Kevin Spacey's is almost flawless; the flaw on the contrary lies in the script, rather than in his or Kate Winslet's performances. Tiatanic's stars does what she can and she has to (in spite of a cliché part) but it's hard to see how anyone could have salvaged the part. Surprises are not lacking but the film's ending/solution is a little dishonest. Due to the gimmick (and unlike the great ""Dead Man Walking, this is a movie that death penalty opponents are unlikely to embrace). In fact the point of the flick appears to be that the debate can't be won on logic or morality and so what is requested is just shock but it's a point uneasy to keep. ""The Life of David Gale"" is well acted as said (Laura Linney is good too) but ends up failing in the most fundamental way because it's a bad drama and worse politics.",/review/rw7636780/?ref_=tt_urv
