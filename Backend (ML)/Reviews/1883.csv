","I'm way biased here. This is now my favorite Vacation movie after binge watching all 4 from a BluRay box set. I'm biased because I'm a Vegas fanatic and it's hard to watch how they get Vegas wrong in so many movies. Here, they actually shot in so many of the locations and the views from their rooms made sense. Too many times, including the most recent Paul Blart Mall Cop 2, do they just make up sh|t as they go along and hope no one's ever been to Sin City. I digress. I know this isn't everyone's favorite, and some scenes made me cringe, like Clark climbing the Hoover Dam, but I found myself laughing more in this installment than the previous three. Mostly with Cousin Eddie, again, the gambling – specifically the off-strip casino and Marty the Devil Dealer and the luck of Rusty. Am not ashamed, despite my obsession with Vegas, to say, this is my favorite Vacationso far.",/review/rw1650576/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2004,CurtMan@LVCM.com,," The Griswalds Parade In Vegas
","""Vegas Vacation"" makes no pretenses to be a good, hearty, intelligent piece of cinema: it features many critical, inexcusable flaws, such as: trafficking in mindless frivolity, some occasionally cheesy dialogue, and even wavers constantly from scene to scene without any means of resolution or connection. Yet, if you can ignore its many irksome qualities, the latest outing with the Griswalds is simply an outrageous, hilarious, and pleasurable romp of a movie. If you laugh at something senseless and absurd, such as Cousing Eddie babbling on about his worthless, pathetic existence, or Clark Griswald finding himself at the edge of the Hoover Dam, or even a busload of tourists crashing into the estate of ""Mr. Las Vegas"", Wayne Newton, so what? Where logic and reasoning are scarce behind the odds of the scenarios the Griswalds encounter, laughs are aplenty to make this one gleeful, jovial outing full of some really effective comedy. The idea of the dysfunctional Griswalds venturing to Vegas for yet another ""family vacation"" and finding themselves experiencing the whims of the city of entertainment in their own individual ways, with Clark being a hapless, compulsive gambler, Ellen having somewhat of an affair with Wayne Newton, Rusty hitting it rich at the casinos and masquerading as a ""playboy"", and Audrey aspiring to be an exotic dancer, how hilarious can it get? Couple this with the outrageous imbecilic likes of Cousin Eddie continuing to plague Clark's existence, and ""Vegas Vacation"" succeeds in delivering a royal flush of laughs. If it's silly and inane, if scenarios are too illogical for words, and if not everything really comes together by the end, at least you have plenty of funny material to laugh away at, and that makes for a jolly good outing, when you find yourself laughing consistently throughout the film, which warrants a solid recommendation for ""Vegas Vacation"". Hilarious! *** out of ****",/review/rw1650576/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2003,jbels,," Have to admit after 20th viewing that it is good
","I saw this movie when it was first released in the theatres, and thought it was one of the worst films ever made.  Since then, whenever this movie comes on TV, I cannot turn it off.  What was once like watching a car wreck has become an enjoyable viewing experience that is a very funny experience. Still can't figure out how the daughter grew up Latina but Marisol Nichols is so cute, who cares?  Sinatra imitator very funny, as is the seemingly five minutes of silence they hold on the Quaid/Newton bit.  Also funny, the server in the buffet ""oh you're right, this is chicken WANT SOME!""  and Chevy Chase butt-ugly costume.",/review/rw1650576/?ref_=tt_urv

","The original is obviously the best one.
European & Christmas ones have some funny moments.
But on the whole this movie is funny & great.
Rusty as mister Papageorgio (?) and the escapades with Clark and cousin Eddie are hilarious.",/review/rw1650576/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2004,tvandagriff,9," What's not to like? This movie is a classic like the first.
","I've read many comments about the Vacation movies. Most people give the original ""Vacation"" high marks, but trash the others. I think a lot of people just like to be pick on Chevy Chase. ""Vacation"" is the best, but I liked the sequels and ""Vegas Vacation"" is my favorite of them. My kids just love to watch ""Vegas Vacation"". You can't pop in the DVD expecting to watch a movie that will be thought provoking or life altering. It was made to make people laugh and it accomplishes that very well. Chevy Chase and cast are very funny in this movie. The Wayne Newton bit was great. I love going to Vegas, and I love this movie. When my wife and I fly to Vegas, we always kid about going to the bathroom to join ""the club"" like Clark and Ellen. Numerous other things remind us of the movie when we are in Vegas, and it has made those trips even more enjoyable. Just wish Chevy would do another ""Vacation"" movie.",/review/rw1650576/?ref_=tt_urv

4 April 2011,inkblot11,8," My favorite of the vacation films, go ahead, laugh yourself silly
","Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) arrives at his home in Chicago, one day, in very high spirits. His wife, Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) and two kids, Audrey (Marisol Nichols) and Rusty (Ethan Embry) are called to a family meeting. In short order, Clark announces that his new formula for food preservation has garnered a big bonus and he is taking them all to Las Vegas. No one is very excited but they have little choice but to go along. When they arrive in town, the Griswolds take a limo to their hotel, although poor Audrey gets stuck in the moonroof, thanks to her dad. Before long, cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) shows up, for Ellen has called her cousin, Eddie's wife Catherine, to announce their visit. Eddie promptly watches Clark lose a whopping $300 bucks at the blackjack table, much to the joy of the sadistic dealer, Marty (Wallace Shawn). After the loss, Eddie invites everyone to his house north of Vegas, where the government has given him some lovely, parched, radioactive land. From there, its on to Hoover Dam and to a bunch of shows, including Sigfried & Roy and Wayne Newton. Newton, in fact, makes a play for Ellen in front of the audience, although Clark thinks its part of the act. While Ellen gets invited to have cocktails with Wayne, Clark goes on gambling and the kids, under age, get fake identifications so they can likewise play the tables (Rusty) and try out exotic dancing (Audrey). They even have an encounter with an old, old gambler (Sid Caesar). How will their great adventure end? This is the best of the vacation films, my opinion, even though all are enjoyable. The script is lively and inventive and so, so funny. The cast, too, is excellent, with the main folks reprising their long established roles, and Newton, Embry, Nichols, Shawn, and especially Caesar, adding greatly to the merriment. The scenery is the best of the strip, Eddie's abode notwithstanding, and the costumes and direction are topnotch, also. Do you, personally, need a vacation from the norm? VV is the cure for the anytime blues.",/review/rw1650576/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2021,kosmasp,6," All about the ... family/money?
","What happens in Vegas ... well does not quite stay there. Multiple puns intended. If you are going on a vacation with the Griswolds, anything can happen. Like Randy Quaid popping in for some unknown reason - apart from the script and probably the audience demanding it. The beloved and hated cousin is back again.",/review/rw1650576/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2016,sol-,5," What Happens in Vegas...
","Mayhem ensues when the Griswolds go to Las Vegas in this fourth film in the 'Vacation' franchise. Chevy Chase is solid as always and Wallace Shawn has a fun extended cameo this time round as a condescending croupier, but with minimal road trip elements here, the dynamic is not quite as juicy as the first or even second film. The plot basically consists of each member of the Griswold clan having their own individual Vegas experiences, and while there is quite a bit of oddball humour in how Rusty makes it as a gambling king, there is not a lot of interest in Audrey becoming a Vegas dancer, Ellen being seduced by Wayne Netwon or Clark's gambling debt woes (Shawn's role in the matter aside). The recasting of the kids (yet again) also works against the film; while Marisol Nichols and Ethan Embry are both older than the characters they are playing, they don't look it, while Chase - with grey hair now - looks older than ever. Randy Quaid also has far too much screen time for his own good as the abrasive cousin Eddie and it is hard to know what to make of a scene in which Quaid and Chase visit an outskirts casino with ""what number am I thinking of"" gambling games. The solution to Chase's gambling woes comes a little too easily too. There are, however, enough scattered good moments here to make the film possibly worth a look. The return of the blonde in a convertible (from the first film) is a nice touch, some dam wordplay surprisingly works well, a sun-roof incident is quite funny and what a way the film depicts to obtain a fake ID!",/review/rw1650576/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2009,ODDBear,6," Gets the number three spot
","Well, Clark Griswold has so far botched a road trip, a European vacation and (most memorably) a Christmas vacation; so why does he continue to make his family go through hell on his endless quest for a fun vacation? That's easy; it's pretty enjoyable for us to watch :)",/review/rw1650576/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2021,mark.waltz,4," Too much Randy Quaid destroys the Griswold's.
","After ""Christmas Vacation"", the producers decided that what the next entry needed was more cousin Eddie. Unfortunately what they give us is too much cousin eddie. in your original vacation, he only had limited footage, and in Christmas vacation, he was surrounded by a huge ensemble of popular character actors. Certainly, he is funny and small doses, but he's on-screen way too much here and that spoils the buffet.",/review/rw1650576/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is the best out of all of the Vacation movies! Hands down! Chevy Chase is laugh out loud funny. Randy Quaid is amazing. The whole Hoover dam scene was the funniest thing ever! Whenever my family and i go to Vegas, we quote this movie so much! Its one of the best movies ever! Even though the kids keep changing in the movies, its is noted in this one. Whats not to like about this movie? Its amazing and hilarious. It basically shows what happens in Vegas the first time for any family. Except Wayne Newton doesn't fall in love with your mom and they don't let the kids roam around freely! This movie deserves an 11 out of 10.

","This is the weakest of the Chevy Chase movies in the ""National Lampoon's Vacaction"" movies. That being said, don't get me wrong here, because it is not a bad movie.

15 December 2014,eric262003,7," Funny But Formulaic
","The final installment to the Griswald family's madcap misadventures, they're just as funny as the other three outrageous film before this one, as Clark, Ellen, Audrey and Rusty are out to stir trouble for themselves and everyone else surrounding them only this time the stakes are higher in the 1997 film ""Vegas Vacation."" The laughs are gut- bursting, and the hot Nevada desert is the perfect resort to capture just how zany and outrageous the Griswalds can be. Sure it's good to watch one in a blue moon, after seeing the same gags over and over again, it does loses its flavour like a piece of chewing gum and you can easily become bored after a while.

","In the fourth vacation film, we see the Griswolds visiting Las Vegas. This is definitely a better installment than European Vacation, more laughter and more family friendly.

","I thought that this one was the one of the best movies from the ""Vacation"" series.  It's really funny, and it was pretty cool to see Audrey and Rusty all grown up!  I loved the characters, especially Shae D'Lyn's character, Vicki, the Vegas stripper, who Audrey hangs out with, and when Randy ends up as professional gambler and Vegas icon, Nick Papagorgio.  Ellen, played by Beverly Dangelo, ends up being lured by Wayne Newton, while Clark becomes seduced by the thought of BIG fortune.  Also, you have old friends like Randy Quaid's totally gross, but funny Eddie and his wife, Catherine, and many more!  A great movie for laughs! :o)",/review/rw1650576/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2014,videorama-759-859391,5," Not the brightest of Vacations
","I'm glad we got to see one more of these Vacation films. I admit, I am a big fan of them, only this time it's a saggy one, where too many gags misfire on the account of them not riding on much, or being really feeble or just unfunny bits, where I dare say, lazy writing was involved. Clark now looks older and again, his kids are replaced by two more actors, the daughter, a really cute Audrey. This time they're off to Vegas, and you know what that means, if you know Clark. We're reunited with cousin Eddy, (Quaid) who provides some relief in the laughter department (almost every scene of his is funny) and too, Wayne Newton, is making the moves on Ellen. Would you believe too, Christie Brinkley returns as that hottie in a sports car + baby. Rusty ends up working as a mobster, while Audrey's introduced to cage dancing. When Clark, turned around his misfortune at the end, picketing that raffle tickle off the floor, after that old codger bought, had me rolling my eyes. This Vacation was sloppy, where as I said, too many gags misfire, where may'be this Vacation came too late. It was just weak on the whole, and I mean it's city of preference, Vegas. I'm with the kid's despondent looks. The return of that original track, Holiday Road, didn't sit well either, with the Griswald's trip to the Hoover Dam. They should of done an Aussie Vaction. Just think of all the damage Clark would of done there.",/review/rw1650576/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2004,ajwebb,8," Vegas Vacation 8/10
","I truly believe this was a great addition to the Vacation Series. The quirky comments is what makes this movie a winner. It's a great movie to watch, especially due to all of the glitz and glamour of Las Vegas that appears in this movie. Due to the fact that they shot this movie on location, it give it a different ""look"" and ""feel"". I'm not really crazy about their choice for the Griswold kids, but it's still an excellent movie. For some reason I can't turn it off each time it comes on, I have watched this movie over 50 times. If you give it a chance, you will enjoy it too. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a little comedy. The whole vacation series is a great one to watch.",/review/rw1650576/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Vegas Vacation"" is a very funny movie. I remember when I saw it in the theater (Bayside, NY) I was a little nervous while I watched Clark drive home during the opening credits. It seemed that I was in for a long night. I wasn't. ""Vegas Vacation"" is a very funny movie. The opening credits and the Hoover Dam scene aren't so hot but the rest of the movie is very funny. I'm happy to see that after all these years (20+) ""Vegas Vacation"" is still on cable television. That means, after all these years, people still enjoy this very funny movie.",/review/rw1650576/?ref_=tt_urv

6 May 2007,moonspinner55,2," What went wrong??
","Completely lackluster comedy, the fourth (and hopefully the last) in the financially successful ""Vacation"" pantheon has Chevy Chase back as goofy dad Clark Griswold, taking his family on another adventure, leaving the suburbs for the lights of Las Vegas. A couple of big laughs--and a game attempt to keep it afloat by Chase, still working very well with Beverly D'Angelo--but the direction is limp, the gags are blown time after time, and a sub-plot involving trailer-trash cousin Randy Quaid is painfully gratuitous. This movie series needs a permanent vacation! Nice (if obvious) cameos by Siegfried & Roy and, in the movie's best bit, Christie Brinkley. * from ****",/review/rw1650576/?ref_=tt_urv
