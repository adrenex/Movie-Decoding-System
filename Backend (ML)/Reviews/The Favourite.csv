21 February 2020,UniqueParticle,9," A true gem
",Such a delightful comedy with amazing characters and great fun throughout! Christopher Reid is such a glorious actor to watch for anyone to enjoy. The best thing ever about House Party is how things constantly work out in different variations and the soundtrack is so much fun! Definitely among one of the best party films around even the sequels are enjoyable too.,/review/rw1585386/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2005,vertigo_14,7," Crank up the bass on this house party! (spoilers)
","Oddly serving as the thesis film for director Reginald Hudlin while a student at Harvard, 'House Party' is one of my favorite teen comedies. Although, clearly most of the cast (especially Martin Lawrence and the members of Full Force) who were clearly somewhere in their late 20s, if not early 30s. However, this is one all-black teen comedy which did things with just the right amount of spunk, and the characters were not so obnoxious and not so stereotypical that you couldn't enjoy their (mis)adventures.",/review/rw1585386/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2012,oneguyrambling,6," Because we can't be serious all the time.
","House Party was an unexpected low budget hit upon release in 1990, something about the bright colours and an 'urban movie' without a single drive by tapped directly into the consciousness of a teen market wanting desperately to embrace hip-hop culture without getting a gold tooth.",/review/rw1585386/?ref_=tt_urv

13 December 2021,kevin_robbins,8," The magic of the storyline and characters creates a high rewatch value in an Animal House kind of way
","House Party (1990) is a movie I recently watched again for the first time in a long time on Netflix. The storyline focuses on a group of best friends in high school that plan on throwing a house party. They will need to thwart some school bullies, parents and other challenges if they hope to throw a legendary process and attract the hunnies...",/review/rw1585386/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2019,jadavix,8," A classic, and one of the best hip hop movies

26 August 2004,IrockGswift,," An all time classic
","The kid'n'play dance was the thing back in the late 80s early 90s. The new jack swing was at its peak and this movie sums it up. It became a break-through for then young actors Martin Lawrence and Tisha Campbell. This reminds me of the time when I was a teenager who wanted to sneak out to go to a party and later got caught. I was in the 10th grade when this movie was released and I had a lot of fun during that time with not too much fighting at parties. The bullies played by the R&B group Full Force made the movie more funny with its slapstick humor and the memorable Robin Harris with his witty punchlines. It's sad to see him leave this earth at an early age,and comedian Bernie Mac reminds me of him. I remember he died the weekend of this movie and this was a shock. He could have been one of the funniest comedians in the 90s but his life was put to a halt and made way for several comedians who are now today's superstars (namely from Def Comedy Jam). House Party also remind me of how fun hip-hop was,and back then hip-hop was political,educational,radical,and uplifting. This movie can go down in history as how African-Americans can enjoy themselves with no use of drugs and unprotected sex.",/review/rw1585386/?ref_=tt_urv

","If you want to have a party in your mind, where just drift far far away. Than look no further, because writer/director Reginald Hudlin has made not only one of the best Afro-Americans based film. But also one of the most copied haircuts in recent history.",/review/rw1585386/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2005,Sargebri,," The Black Beach Party
","This had to be one of the funnier comedies of the early 1990's. It helped to create more positive images of young black teens rather than showing the more negative aspects. Most of the films about young blacks up until then had been about them either being in gangs or on drugs. At least in this film you see the kids getting into mischief without getting into any real trouble. However, the only negative thing I have to say about the film is not about the film itself, but about the seemingly endless series of sequels that seemed to follow. To me the only the first film should be seen and not the sequels because they pretty much undermined the quality of the first film. Also, the series almost seemed to become an African-American version of the ""Beach Party"" films, where there pretty much was no plot and just gave the actors an excuse to party. Other than that, this is still a good film.",/review/rw1585386/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2010,StevePulaski,8," The Party is Definitely More than Meets the Eye
","House Party predates the iconic and memorable start of the Friday franchise five years and is also one of the many, hilarious African American Comedies out there. We don't get many of these classic, retro, 80's and 90's style black movies anymore like we used too. The latest one that crosses my mind at the moment is the recent Lottery Ticket that, judging from the film's trailer, has the style, humor, and looks of a Friday film (with Ice Cube not as Craig) and some other similarities I won't dig into at this time. Though it undoubtedly wont surpass the humor brought by Ice Cube and Chris Tucker in the 1995 Comedy, it will most likely bring cute one liners and have an essence of the feeling while being it's own thing.",/review/rw1585386/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2018,OllieSuave-007,6," Wacky little flick.
","This is a wacky little flick that I saw during 7th grade in class. Lots of forced comedy and wild dialog, but entertaining at certain points. Plenty of my classmates loved it, but I thought it was pretty average though. ",/review/rw1585386/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2002,DunnDeeDaGreat,9," One of the funniest urban comedies ever made
",House Party is sort of like a urban take on Risky Business in the sense that boy has party when parents go out of town for the weekend but the comparison end there. Kid and Play make one of the first hip hop films of the nineties which had a plot. Many young black comedic actors got their start in this film like Martin Lawerence and AJ Johnson. But the true comedic talent in the film is the late Robin Harris. The world only knows what Harris could have done. The script is smart and the direction by Regiland Hudlin is good.,/review/rw1585386/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2007,ptb-8,6," House Party to Party Monster in one decade
","Released in 99% white Australia at the height of the warehouse dance party wave, this hilarious all black hip hop indie rang true to us neon shirted whities who could have our own moment of 'rock around the clock style new wave dance madness' by actually dancing in the aisles of the cinema. And what a crummy cinema it was....the Mandolin in Sydney was the mangy red velvet 60s beatnik cinema that was a converted 1930s radio theater. Perfect! I think that night we went to the movies and saw Kid'n'Play's HOUSE PARTY and appropriately went to an all night dance party in a warehouse nearby with 5000 others who secretly knew it was on (yes 5000 others) and like in HOUSE PARTY, you had to know it was on in there.... so we got to see the movie and cross/culture/shift and relive the experience to the same music. HOUSE PARTY like that night is a moment in time, part of the hilarious reckless nights we have all had in the late 80s (see the great tiny1982 indie Oz pic GOING DOWN for proof) ... to new music with hilarious friends and dance tracks that allowed you to dance with 15 different people. I know there were sequels but by then the time had gone and the dance parties were full of bad drugs and bonehead behavior. HOUSE PARTY is the bookend to PARTY MONSTER.. the incredible lavish and absolutely bullseye moment of the 90s captured on film in 2003 with Macauley Culkin and Seth Green. It would be horrifying fun to see these films together in one sitting to identify the night it started and the night it stopped. I suppose it is the same idea wondering how we got from ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" to ""When I Think Of You I Touch Myself"". Yes HOUSE PARTY is the innocent side of the coke chopping razor and PARTY MONSTER is the harsh sunlight of next morning.",/review/rw1585386/?ref_=tt_urv

","very funny, energetic film with a great dance sequence and a really funny song in the prison. Kid and Play are a  great double act and the writing is high quality. I saw a bit of this other Kid and Play film called Class Act and it wasn't half as good because all the jokes were predictable. You can't help but be cheered up by seeing House Party: the ancient, unused condom- how true.",/review/rw1585386/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2001,PAT22286,," They tore the roof off with this movie
","I saw this movie when I was like 6 years old and still am in love with this movie its great and very funny.It stars rappers Kid 'N' Play who were very famous back in the late 80's and 90's.This story is actually about Kid he lives with his Father who he calls ""Pops"".One Day Kid asks can he go to his friends Play's house for a party(since Play's parents is gone out of town but Pops doesn't know that).He let's him go until he gets a letter from school that Kid was involved in a fight so he reconsiders and grounds him.Kid then decides to sneak out the house since the party was going to be big and his friends were going to be there.But what he doesn't know is what dangers he's going to find when he gets back home.This Movie is rated R but this is more like a Teenager movie since the setting of the movie finds all the charcacters in this story in High School.It's a excellent movie and great storyline and very Hilarious.This Movie gets 5 out of 5 stars.",/review/rw1585386/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2018,MJL_Uncensored,10," The Dopest Teen Comedy Ever
","When I was growing up, John Hughes created some of the more notable coming-of-age films in cinematic history. Classics like Ferris Bueller, The Breakfast Club, and the wildly inappropriate Weird Science (we will cover that at another time) were fun to watch over and over again. However, I remember thinking how few teen movies there were with people of color. Of course, there was Cooley High in the 70's, but after that, there wasn't much that resonated like those films. Luckily, the Hudlin brothers-along with candy-coated rap sensations Kid 'n Play--an instant classic is born. ",/review/rw1585386/?ref_=tt_urv

","Another older movie I should've kept in the memory banks, it was so much better there. Now that I have watched it again I can't believe how wack it was. Kid n' Play cannot act and the plot was lousy. Furthermore, it wasn't a good showcase of the talents of Robin Harris, John Witherspoon, and Martin Lawrence.",/review/rw1585386/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2006,film-critic,5," Wave your hands in the air, everybody!
","I am not ashamed to say that this was not a horrible film. Upon finishing this film, I did a bit of research on it and discovered that this pioneer film (prior to the sequels) was actually a favorite among Sundance goers in 1990. Apparently it racked up quite a bit of awards in the ""drama"" category. While I must say that it was enjoyable to go back to this type of cinema, you know, the parents are away so the kids will play scenario, but I didn't think this was the best this genre had to offer. Director Reginald Hudlin created this film for his thesis at Harvard as well as a benchmark for DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Price, so how did he finally end up with Kid & Play? While I did think that Kid did a decent job with his character, which couldn't have been too far from himself, Play offered nothing new to the film. Martin Lawrence continued to be the most annoying character in the film, while the love interests were clichéd from the start. The music was fun, the dancing was laughable, and the police officers were racist  so does that make for Sundance winning cinema? Personally, there were elements that needed tightened and some that were great the way they were. It wasn't the best film, but House Party did provide for an hour and a half of dusty memories.",/review/rw1585386/?ref_=tt_urv

28 January 2007,JonTMarin816,9," The ultimate house party
","Fresh off the success of their 1988 debut album 2 Hype, Kid N Play was seen as marketable to mainstream America while hip hop was also burgeoning into mainstream. The former back up dancers turned hip hop superstars was casted as leads for two then unknown directors going by the name The Hudlin Bros. The rest is history. 1990's hip hop teen comedy House Party was an indie success and left footprints forever in the evolution of hip hop. Kid is still trying to get over the death of his mom and lives with his widower father (Robin Harris). He gets into a scuffle at school with bullies (Full Force) and when his father finds out, he is grounded. Being that he was grounded, it was preventing him from going to the ""party of the year"" being held by his friend Play. He decides to sneak out and go to the party. These events will lead to one crazy night. House Party is hilarious. Like one of the greatest comedies you'll ever see hilarious. Not only is it hilarious, but it captures the essence of early 90s hip hop culture. Positive lyrics, the flat top, jheri curls, the door knocker earrings, loud colors, Air Jordans, and who could ever forget the Kid N Play toe tap dance? House Party is the ultimate hip hop film that offer laughs even almost 20 years into its existence. House Party would go on to create a career for a unknown comedian named Martin Lawrence, spawn 2 sequels, a Kid N Play cartoon and its one liners are forever remembered by hip hop enthusiasts worldwide. House Party is definitely one of the greatest comedies I've seen and one of my favorite films of all time.",/review/rw1585386/?ref_=tt_urv
