14 January 2002,K-Slicer,," Funnier than I ever anticipated
",I once hated this show but I decided to give it a chance.  I love it because of how much deep thought Danny Antonucci and his cohorts had to put into this.  This is a satirical commentary on the lives of kids who are between the ages of 10 and 13.  At least one area in every big city has to have kids like this.  Every kid in America has at one point has tried to scam money out of someone.  Every kid in America has at one point been a bully to the weak or been bullied themselves by the weak.  Every kid in America has shown hypocritical to their personality.,/review/rw7241658/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2001,marshall89,," This show rules man!
",Question: Why does everyone hate this show? Answer: I don't know. This has got to be one of the greatest shows known to man. The animation is far more unique than any other style of animation I've ever seen. And you've just got to love these characters!,/review/rw7241658/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2003,griffin84,," Don't they remind you of someone?
","My favorite part of Ed, Edd, and Eddy is that no matter how old you are or where you grew up, the characters of this hilarious show remind us all of those we grew up with.  Look at it this way:",/review/rw7241658/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2000,plok253,9," What's not to like?
","Ed Edd n Eddy is one of Cartoon Network's most popular cartoons, despite all of the critics out there who may not think too highly of it.  I find a very entertaining cartoon that, like many other cartoons, illustrates what it's like not being ""cool"" or ""popular.""  Ed is always happy, and tries to help (although he makes mistakes a lot.)  Edd is very smart and is also aware of the consequences of their actions ahead of time (unlike Ed and Eddy.)  Eddy is the one who tries to do what's popular, yet it always backfires on him.  As if that wasn't enough, there are many other colorful characters as well.  There's Sara, the annoying sister of Ed, Jimmy, the crybaby kid who's always afraid, Johnny, the loner who's best friend is a piece of wood, Kevin, who's motto is probably ""it's my way or the highway,"" Rolf, the foreign boy who finds many of the Ed's actions unusual, Nazz, the pretty one who's Kevin's girlfriend, and the Kankar Sisters, the annoying girls who are in love with the Eds.  It's a very funny show, because of the colorful characters, inspired settings and problems, and because of the things in the show that make absolutely no sense.  For example, when Ed is spinning around a telephone post, it makes a busy signal sound.  Another example is how it makes the noise of a car driving by when Ed is slipping through some lard (I think it was lard, I haven't seen that episode until a while.)  Overall, I recommend everyone give this show a try.  You may not like it right away, just give it some time.",/review/rw7241658/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2005,policy134,," hilarious spoof of adolescence but also cheap jokes in between
","Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy has made me laugh time and time again. There is also something appealing about the universe which the characters inhabit with no adult supervision, at least not visible to the audience. If I was a parent to these kids I would send them to a nut house (that goes for all the characters.",/review/rw7241658/?ref_=tt_urv

19 August 2017,randyfromscream,10," Way better then those new CN shows
",I have a bunch of nostalgia about this show. Like this is the best Cartoon Network show of all time. I hate Teen Titain Go like that show is a major letdown compared to the original one. This a great show like I'd love to watch this a lot as a kid like I'm a big fan of it and it's still my favorite show to date. Screw TTG this stand the best.,/review/rw7241658/?ref_=tt_urv

10 February 2020,Bhomiq,8," Nostalgic much?
",Literally most of my childhood right here. Recently watched this from start to finish again and I remember why I used to love it so much. Its funny and goofy all at the same time! It's kinda sad how quick the years go by but I can feel like a kid again when watching this silly but impeccable show. I love it to bits and always will! Double D will always be my love lol.,/review/rw7241658/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is no doubt my favorite show ever. Ever since I was a child, I always loved a good episode of this show. I watched this all day on some days. I'm always in the mood to watch this show, and it can always put me in a good mood, and make me happy no matter what.",/review/rw7241658/?ref_=tt_urv

13 August 2010,wwe7961,10," Cartoon Network's best
","Some of my best young childhood memories were of me sitting in front of the TV on a summer day watching ""Cartoon Network"". There was so many good shows on the channel, but the best was ""Ed, Edd, n Eddy"" This show contains some of the best characters ever on a TV show. The characters are easy to relate to, and probably remind you of friends of your own. That is what makes the show so good. You relate to the characters so much you feel like your watching your own childhood. I love all the characters, but my favorite is Eddy. He reminds me a lot of myself. All the episodes are great, but the best for me has to be the last episode ""Ed, Edd, n Eddy's Big Picture Show"". It is everything I could ask for as a big fan. The comedy is hilarious, the characters are still very good, it visits different moments from the series, it brings back good memories, and it is surprisingly deep. Eddy has to except that without Double D or Ed he would be nothing. While he figures this out he breaks out in crying which I never expected. This may be the end for the Eds, but they went out with a big bang. Now that the Eds are gone Cartoon Network has officially became a hollow shell of it's former self. All the classic cartoon's I grew up with watching Cartoon Network are gone, and have been replaced by shows that will just be canceled after one season. At least I still have the memories. Goodbye Cartoon Network. (sob)",/review/rw7241658/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2003,bandcrsh,," WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!!!!
","""Ed, Edd n Eddy"" is the greatest show of all time. I pretend it is a sitcom like ""Father Knows Best""(1954-1963). I watched the very first episode on January 4th, 1999(actually, I fell asleep and I watched an encore of the ""pilot"" on January 8th, 1999. Last year, I read that the creator of the show(Danny Antounucci) announced that they were no longer producing anymore episodes, I felt terrible, I give ""The Ed, Edd n Eddy"" show **** out of ****.",/review/rw7241658/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2003,jlennon314,," A brilliant and surprisingly original modern cartoon.
","I have been watching ""The Eds"" since they first came to Cartoon Network. After recently reading a review of this show, I decided to make a comment. Many people complain about the animation quality of the show.  However, I would like to point out that this is a CARTOON.  This isn't real life, nor does it claim to portray real life.  Therefore, it may be forgiven that the art isn't up to the quality of classic cartoons (Loony Tunes, Tom and Jerry, etc.).  In truth, I really appreciate the animation of this show.  It adds to the energy that the show has.  A constant liveliness runs in every episode, just as kids are in real life.",/review/rw7241658/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2020,briancham1994,8," Bonkers
",This TV show is quite bonkers with a rough animation style and very zany characters. Each character has his own unique personality which adds to the humour. All of their adventures are very unpredictable and bizarre which means every episode is fresh.,/review/rw7241658/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2004,kos5,," ""What can you do if you live in a shoe and you ain't got no soul.""
","I'm really not a huge cartoon fan, I really didn't even want to watch Ed,Edd,and Eddy. But, one day my younger brother sat me down and told me to watch it. I was so surprised that the show had made me laugh out loud so many times. Honestly though, there is only one character that keeps me watching it whenever I see it on, Ed. Come on people, I don't know anyone who hasn't sat down and not laughed at Ed. He's stupid and he usually speaks in some sort of jumbled up riddle. Just today I walked in on an episode where he said ""What can you do if you live in a shoe and you ain't got no soul."" As I have listed above. The other characters are great, the plot lines are usually a little weak, but I don't expect much more from a cartoon. Don't be so skeptical of it because its a cartoon, or maybe you think your too old. Just watch it, you'll see.",/review/rw7241658/?ref_=tt_urv

10 October 2002,Roger Hane,8," Bittersweet memories of youth
","Though young people might enjoy this show, it can only be fully appreciated by older adults. EEnE takes us back to the carefree days of our pre-teen years. No matter which decade in which you were 12, this timeless show will resonate with you. The Eds and their friends are on perpetual summer vacation, back in the days before the internet and cable TV. They while away the aimless days creating misadventures and pre-teen power struggles. Jawbreakers really were the ultimate delicacy to strive for. Each episode recalls some aspect of those old summer vacations we had forgotten about until now. This surreal view of pre-pubescence hits home in a timeless, powerful way.",/review/rw7241658/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2021,ThunderKing6,10," Which one is Ed, Edd and Eddy?
","Ed, Edd N Eddy was a wacky show about 3 children as they adventure in the streets of children taking part in misadventure. The show was so good. One Ed was the short leader who was way more assertive than his crew. The other Edd was more like the cool, laid back Edd that had some insecurities. Eddy was the tall, dumb, strong guy of the group.",/review/rw7241658/?ref_=tt_urv
