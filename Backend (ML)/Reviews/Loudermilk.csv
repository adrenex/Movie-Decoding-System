21 February 2020,AndoMando,8," Great comedy with a stand out performance from Livingston
","Caught this on Amazon Prime only recently but I've been pleasantly surprised how good it is. Ron Livingston's performance is superb - complex, tragic, funny and heartfelt. Support is strong too and it often makes me laugh out loud. Not for people who don't like swear words.",/review/rw4360548/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2020,tm-sheehan,8," Comedy for the Misanthropics and lovers of good scriptwriting
","My Review - Season One. ""Loudermilk."" A Misanthropic Comedy
My Score 8/10. Looking forward to Season 2 and Season 3 has been approved",/review/rw4360548/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2018,AmimeIrl,9," Gritty humour
","I can't believe some of the reviews - people complaining about the language. It's supposed to be a portrayal of real life and the serious challenges people face, and guess what - they're not nice, and pretty.",/review/rw4360548/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2018,sanjin_9632,8," Authentic.. and genuinely funny.
",I'm 4 episodes in and I have to admit it's great. Haven't seen something like this in a while. It has the same feel as Casual and/or Californication (without all the sex and nudity).,/review/rw4360548/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2021,cathrynhoegg,9," A great find
","I had given up finding anything new that would hold my attention, I usually don't watch sitcoms, and this was a breath of fresh air. I gave it a shot and before I knew it I had watched 4 episodes back to back. Really good, Will is such a great addition to the cast and I found myself snorting out loud quite a bit. I am still on the first season but so far so good!",/review/rw4360548/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2021,calicut110,8," Raw, funny and a hidden gem
",I stumbled across this and was hooked from the first episode. It's a dark comedy with very real and life changing stories. The main actor was born for this type of role and some scenes will even bring tears to your eyes. Really great show I hope they make more than the 3 seasons to date.,/review/rw4360548/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2020,Deux_Vega,6," Cutter ruins it
","It's a superb series, but how the he'll did they green lighted the cutter story. Aside from the terrible cast that story line is just not funny and pure agony.
It's ruining the show. Very big contrast with the rest of the serie.",/review/rw4360548/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2021,bradapmp,10," Cant wait for season 4
","I started watching this show just thumbing around. A hidden gem. This show has it all. My wife and I think it's one of the best shows around. We have been Brian Reagan fans for years. He is awesome. But really the whole cast is great. Bravo, great show. A show with substance.",/review/rw4360548/?ref_=tt_urv

17 November 2017,rudyallan,9," A Musical Critical Review Louder than Words
","This review of Loudermilk is basically a up to date review of IMDb. As you can see by the chronological order on here, reviewers seem to need to trash great things in order to feel like they are being heard/respected. In reality, quick to the punch reviewers have dropped the critical level of IMDb down to barrel scrapping. What they need here, just like everywhere else, is a block button to fully block some people and their garble.",/review/rw4360548/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2020,Deux_Vega,6," Started great, but ...
","It started off great. Good pace, interesting characters and funny. But that started to slide down after the first half. Mostly because of cutter initially, but sadly they can't seem to pick it up any more in season 2 either. It's ok, but i've started to lose interest to continue watching. Missed opportunity, because Livingstone is at his best in roles like these and they made it really work for half a season.",/review/rw4360548/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2021,jordandavidfischer,9," Absolutely amazing.
","This series is great, comedy and feels and plot. All amazing.
Season 1 & 2 are great, but season 3 really raises the bar, I hope it can go on as long as the creator wants it too.
Amazon please don't let me down. Audience network is gone, but you're not.",/review/rw4360548/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2018,vandal-1,10," Hilarious, emotional and genuinely entertaining.
","Just finished the last episode and came on here expecting to see a high rating. Was shocked to see some of the negative reviews.
I loved the show from start to finish and can't wait for a second series. 
Acting is first rate and the humour is spot on. I always liked the Farrely's and now I remember why.
Ignore the naysayers and give the show a chance. You'll be glad you did.",/review/rw4360548/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2017,uvcoach,8," Pleasant surprise
","My take on viewing any show, is it worth my precious time? This is one hell of a series. Well written line's, and the cast is well chosen and know their craft. I enjoy the over the top sarcasm especially the common life experience that's portrayed with each character. Love the tempo of each line with it's quick humor, and response banter between each character is hilarious..",/review/rw4360548/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2021,reillylovering,10," Great show. Even better if you are in recovery.
",Wow what a great show. I have had substance and alchohal issues through my life and am coming up to a year sober. This show is helping me out a lot through it. Love Sasso and Livingston. They both do great in this show. Its the perfect balance of comedy and real issues. If you or someone you know has been in recovery this show hits harder. Highly suggest. New fave.,/review/rw4360548/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2021,cherold,6," started decently but didn't hold me
","Loudermilk is an obnoxious guy who runs a 12-step meeting. It begins as he gets stuck babysitting one 12-stepper, played by Anja Savcic, while also trying to hook up with a neighbor. It was pretty good, I liked the acting, it was generally funny.",/review/rw4360548/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2021,bmcraec,9," Smart, heartfelt human experience well-expressed
","Not your typical sitcom, and not your typical cast. This show smacks of a deep and enduring rootstock of its main themes; realizing that when things go off the rails, it can be a very long, painful and complex process of getting back together and choosing which tracks to pursue.",/review/rw4360548/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2018,LouieInLove,8," Loudermilk-ing The Comedic Teat.
",I liked this. It's engaging & funny (at times). The stories are accessible & the characters are well developed & the actors do a good job - especially the lead.,/review/rw4360548/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2018,imdb-72960,9," Rawer than most, which makes it more real somehow
",There's not that many comedy-dramas I enjoy. I find that most of them pull their punches and get predictable. ,/review/rw4360548/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2019,dale0959,10," Absolute gem
",Loved every episode. First season was brilliant the second season was even better,/review/rw4360548/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2021,abigor_82,10," i love it
",This show caught me off guard I'm very picky when comes to TV shows.. This show very fun to watch and I love sarcasm and smartass remarks.,/review/rw4360548/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2021,Gernot S.,8," Guess I'm late to the party...
","Just finished season 1. I loved Loudermilk, his story is fun, I care for him. Sure, he's an complete and utter a****, at times, but who's to judge...",/review/rw4360548/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2018,kirtil-2,7," would have been awesome
","I really liked this one. It was fresh, and different in not pulling any punches or trying to be pc. It had an unlikable main but still managed to be upbeat.",/review/rw4360548/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2020,tj_blackburn,10," Bojack Horseman but as a man
","Yes, he's a bit of a horse, but a good one. It's too subtle for idiots, that's why you should watch it.",/review/rw4360548/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2018,Bryan-,4," Lost it's edge
","It starts off as a strong comedy and transitions into a weak drama. There are some great characters in here, I particularly like the old guy in group. Even though I think the show got worse as it went, I'll check out season 2.",/review/rw4360548/?ref_=tt_urv
