","Jennifer Lopez is a singing star, Owen Wilson is a high school math teacher. Quite by accident they get married at a concert. Well, it wasn't a legal wedding but it set a few balls in motion.",/review/rw7859106/?ref_=tt_urv

",JLo and Wilson put together a surprisingly well made and adorable rom com. The storyline was perfect in its predictability. The acting was decent and the leads have chemistry.,/review/rw7859106/?ref_=tt_urv

","Why watch TV when you can watch this and get the same amount of advertising from NBCUniversal. The amount of ads in this movie is blasphemous, either for J Lo and her career or for NBC's various products they're throwing in your face.",/review/rw7859106/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2022,cliftonofun,3," Parody commercial music video
","I'm pretty sure that this was a rom-com parody. From the ridiculous caricatures to the silly plot leaps to the bizarre dialogue, this movie takes every trope and dials it up to 11. It is closer to a Jimmy Fallon commercial or music video than actual movie. I looked up who wrote the screenplay out of morbid curiosity...and it was the guy from Catwoman. Enough said.",/review/rw7859106/?ref_=tt_urv

12 February 2022,benjaminskylerhill,6," Seen the trailer? You've seen most of the movie.
","But that doesn't mean that there's nothing worth checking out here. Far from it. Despite the fact that this is a thoroughly predictable rom-com with no plot points that haven't already been seen a million times, it has just enough of a fame-and-internet-culture twist to keep it interesting.",/review/rw7859106/?ref_=tt_urv

",I have no idea why JLo still gets movie roles her movies are not good and her acting is abysmal at best. She lacks any charisma and she never has any chemistry with her actors. We gave this a shot cause my wife and I like owen but even he wasn't good in this film I have No idea how this is receiving a 6..mmmHUH??? Anyway we watched when harry met sally again and everything is right with the world again...lol pass on this one trust us.

13 February 2022,jp_91,4," Cliché!
","""Marry Me"" is a romantic comedy of which there is nothing to highlight: the plot is quite cliché, the cinematography could have been better, the performances are bad, especially Maluma's (he does not know how to act or sing). The film contains some fairly fasil comic scenes. A waste of time was the result of this hackneyed movie.",/review/rw7859106/?ref_=tt_urv

2 March 2022,iamjamalwhite,2," Hallmark movie with yuck overtones
","If you love the ""Bachelor"" and think love is a choice of shallow egos, this is for you. If you wanna see a church scene that sings about banging in the back seat, this is for you. If you think Lopez is over-rated and Hallmark should stay PG, skip this. It starts silly and ends silly with a bunch of silly in-between. Does give you a look at the shallow side of Hollywood. Funny, she plays a singer who has been married a half dozen times - type cast. In fact, funny goof, she says at one point this is her third marriage and at another it is her fifth. Of course half the cast is alphabet soup. LOL.",/review/rw7859106/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2022,Sergiodave,5," Watchable, but not great.
","Marry Me is an okay addition to the Romantic comedy genre , but unfortunately not that memorable. Jennifer Lopez is fine playing the star, OTT and completely believable. My trouble is with Owen Wilson, as in so many of his movies, he comes across as a whiner, he has an incredibly annoying way of talking which can work well in comedy, just not the romantic sort of comedy. The rom-com world needs to find it's next Tom Hanks or Hugh Grant, and fast!",/review/rw7859106/?ref_=tt_urv

6 March 2022,masonfisk,3," JLO ON AUTO PILOT...!
","JLo tries her hand in Notting Hill land w/her current release also starring Owen Wilson, singer Maluma & Sarah Silverman. When a superstar singer, JLo, plans to marry her equally popular crooner, Maluma, on stage in an advertising stunt, things go awry when JLo finds out from her manager, played by John Bradley, her man has cheated on her so what does JLo do, she agrees to marry a fan, actually a dad, Wilson, accompanying his fan daughter, played by Chloe Coleman. Once he agrees to the trumped up nuptials, Wilson soon finds himself falling in love w/JLo & she in turn starts to see life through someone else's eyes i.e. A commoner (as if she were born a superstar). Following Notting Hill's plot nearly chapter & verse (even down to the turned around partner racing to declare their love to the other at some event), the film offers no surprises, performances or moments that made the former so great while JLo, although preternaturally ageless, has done this kind of thing before (even co-starring w/Wilson on the unfortunate Anaconda, thanks to a friend who reminded me of that one) so embarking on this lay-up of an endeavor smacks of safety cones when although I had no love for Hustlers, was probably a step in the right direction for her acting career.",/review/rw7859106/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2022,li0904426,2," I still don't understand....
","I still don't understand how Hollywood wasted so much money with this commercial, ""waste of time"", poor screenplay movie??!!! Jennifer Lopes proved herself over and over that she can sing very well but not act and Owen Wilson, in my opinion, is getting paid (over and over) for being himself. This movie shouldn't even be made for teenagers, it's terrible, painful to watch. I gave 2 out of 10 because of Mr. Lopes songs and not for her performance, that's for sure.",/review/rw7859106/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2022,Before2020,1," Go away JLo
","Why would Owen be in this? Comparing this to Notting Hill, proves that 99 percent of the positive reviews are fake and romantic movies are completely dead. This is not a romantic comedy, just a Jennifer show. Everything she makes is unbearable, her hollering, like if she's the hottest woman to hit this planet ugh. A narcissist that doesn't know how to act. She needs to stop being in movies... and singing... Just go away.",/review/rw7859106/?ref_=tt_urv
