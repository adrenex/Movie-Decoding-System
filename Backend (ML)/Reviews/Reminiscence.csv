27 September 2016,noirink-12054,7," Despise it's premise it is really, really good BUT
","Once again, a thing they often manage only in British TV-Shows. When you read the premise you will eventually scratch your head. A ghost, a werewolf and a vampire sharing a flat - sounds like goofy comedy plot line. But the the show turns out to be one of the best things i've seen within the last years of TV-series. It's surprisingly heartwarming, quirky and sometimes damn dark.",/review/rw6114952/?ref_=tt_urv

15 January 2009,MrMuffinMan,9," ""The Odd Couple"" becomes the ""Odd Triple"" but in Bristol, England..
","Excellent off-beat drama about a vampire, werewolf and ghost who share a flat in suburban Bristol. The script was intelligent, with thoughtful but compelling story lines that did not treat the audience like complete idiots, was perfectly paced and matched to the main characters. The entire cast was excellent, with quality supporting performances as to be expected from Adrian Lester, Natalie Armin & others. The audience response was so good, it has now been remade by the BBC as a full series. As a whole, this was a perfect short film that deserved a lot more recognition. Sadly only one of the original main actors makes it into the remake, but hopefully the BBC won't screw up by trying to overplay their hand. If the rest of the production crew and cast have been retained this could be another classic in the making.",/review/rw6114952/?ref_=tt_urv

3 August 2012,roedyg,8," Incredibly good acting.
","The premise: a vampire, werewolf and ghost live together is about as silly as you could imagine. However the acting is so spectacularly good, you are instantly sucked in. There is some humour, (such as ageless vampire cutie moon-eyeing an aged past girlfriend), but they play it with a straight face. Russell Tovey as George the reluctant werewolf is perhaps the best actor I have ever seen in a TV series. He plays with his appearance to change from a Matt Damon clone to a complete dork to Truman Capote. He plays with his voice, ranging over every possible emotion. He is always surprising you with a new angle to his character. His screams of pain as he transforms into a werewolf are unbearable. He is completely convincing. I fell madly in love with with his character. He was just so open, with such heart, complex yet easy to understand.",/review/rw6114952/?ref_=tt_urv

","Intelligent script great acting from the three leads and a menacing performance from Eric the chief vampire. You really should give this series a go I missed the pilot so episode 1 was my first taste of this it was a slow start but interesting and has got better and better each week. I have found no-one at work who has seen this and whenever you try to tell them about it you find yourself saying "" Well its about a vampire, a werewolf and a ghost who live together "" you find them looking at you as if your mad or thinking you have discovered Rentaghost ( 70's BBC Kids series ). But the point is it is so much more than the thread of its story it deals with friendship,love,isolation and many other human emotions and it is very funny at times. Give it a go this series is original and you don't get that too often these days do you ........ Life On Mars was the last time that happened",/review/rw6114952/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2009,russellcarvell,10," A breath of new (after)life.
","I expected to hate this, yet it turns out I loved it. Great first series. Can't wait for the next one. The characters were interesting and funny, and dare I say it, you actually begin to care about them, (which is the cornerstone of any good drama). This took a tired genre and gave it a breath of new (after)life. The backdrop is very ordinary and mundane, and the characters are self-loathing. It gave it a different, quirky angle which hasn't really been explored before. I really hope the BBC have the next series lined up and ready to film. UK series are always woefully small. You just got me interested, and now I've got to wait for the next episode. Best character by far is George the dorky werewolf, who I suspect has unwittingly shacked up with a she-wolf. Mitchell is good as an on-the-wagon blood junkie. The bad guys were all nasty and loathsome, which was great. The first episode was slow, but stick with it!",/review/rw6114952/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2009,penelope-35,10," ""A ghost, a werewolf and a vampire walk into a..."" sounds like a bad joke, but it's all good!!
","""A ghost, a vampire and a werewolf walk into a..."" Okay, I'm sure you've heard it a hundred times and it sounds like the beginning of a really bad joke but it really is the beginning to some of the best spec-fic TV you'll probably ever see. George the werewolf, Annie the ghost and Mitchell the vampire are roommates in an apartment in Bristol where they try to live a ""normal"" life. But they find that life after life is complex and unforgiving. And the ""normal"" people can be as frightening as the monsters. Dealt with allegorically in the show are addictions, clinical behavioral problems and mental illness to name a few. Well-rounded characters and oddly familiar situations tinged with the supernatural keep us eager to walk the road with the series' three protagonists. Be advised...this is not Twilight. This is grown-up TV with all the blood, sex and blue language that keeps it interesting for the post-pubescent set. The writing and acting are top-notch and each ensuing episode makes you ravenous for the next. Season II can't come soon enough.",/review/rw6114952/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2009,amethystflames,10," The Greatest Thing to Come Out of Britain in Years
","When I first saw the pilot episode, I had several problems with it, all of which were fixed in episode one. It's my first foray into British television and I'll admit I'm confused by ""remakes"" and other such terms, but whatever; I don't care what they're doing as long as they keep this show on the air. It's smart, witty, funny, interesting, and manages to avoid being a tired rehash of the same monster mythology running around the entertainment industry. Lenora Crichlow is a greatly improved version of Annie, and something about her performance makes it far easier to find the character likable. Aidan Turner is an even better Mitchell than Guy, and thankfully Russell Tovey is still around; he's absolutely perfect as George. I haven't been so excited about a new show in years, and I love the way they blend the dramatic, the humorous, the mystical and the mundane. This show takes all the appeal of myth and legend and flawlessly applies it to modern life, allowing us to connect to the characters on a human level while still giving us a well-done version of the occult. No other show on the air today delivers so many forms of entertainment at once.",/review/rw6114952/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2009,CountVladDracula,10," The best thing I've seen since The Dresden Files
","I am in love with a new TV show. I don't know if it will air here in America but if it did it would likely be cut to shreds. Each episode is fifty seven or so minutes long so that's like fifteen minutes that would need to be cut from each episode to fit in an American time slot, not to mention there's a lot of gore that they wouldn't get away with showing here and a scene of someone giving the finger.",/review/rw6114952/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2011,todgourley,10," The Brits know how to do TV
","Drama, mystery, self discovery, angst and ""desperation for relief"" comedy is spattered through out this well written and acted show. In 2 very short runs (16 in all?)I care more for these unlikely group of supernatural misfits than all the seasons of ""Friends"". Annie, Mitchell, George, and Nina sit on the fence between worlds, running from what they are and leaving claw marks in their past. The third set of shows have just started and I can't wait to see my friends again. I think it is best to watch the show, if you can, as they aired on BBC. When the shows makes the crossing on the pond some of the grittiness gets watered down. On a personal note, if you have watched the SyFy version, it pales by comparison.",/review/rw6114952/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2009,Chalice_Of_Evil,9," The original (and the best) version of Being Human...
","Everyone's already commented on how a werewolf, a vampire and a ghost trying to live ""normal"" lives together sounds like the start of a bad joke...but it actually makes for great viewing. The cast helps. Unlike a lot of other shows, this show has a small regular cast. I like every one of the main characters and the close 'family' vibe that they've got going on. All 3 of the main actors are perfectly cast in their roles. I LOVE Lenora Crichlow as Annie, in large part due to Lenora's portrayal. Oftentimes, I find perky/cheery characters grate/annoying, but not so with Annie. Her upbeat personality is very endearing and she contrasts nicely against the two guys. She's funny, emotional and kicks major butt on occasion.",/review/rw6114952/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2011,rogermsmith-68-295913,4," Excellent....until season 3
","This was a 10/10 until I just watched season 3. I must say what a disappointment. Its taking a show that started with a comical perspective on some of the darker things in our minds...and ends season 3 with all the class of a cheap soap opera? The final episode was just awful! Obviously constructed off-the-cuff with no thought whatsoever. It was as if they made it up as they went. The best part was....killing an attacking werewolf with a kitchen knife?...come on...it wasn't even silver! I think reducing Mitchell to babbling fool was another mistake, he was the pivotal character in the whole series, with a depth and dimension unmatched by any other character in the story. His conflicted personality is a great touch, but to reduce a 100+ year old vampire to that level over love is to be quite honest, ridiculous. This is supposed to be a supernatural thriller, not a 'Days of Our Lives' competitor. Annie adds to the program with her illogical and irritating behavior, George and Ninas characters however just show a lack of any common sense or perspective. I can see what the writers are trying to achieve with 'monsters' trying to maintain morality, but they fail dismally as their opinions and actions lack any kind of connection with reality.",/review/rw6114952/?ref_=tt_urv

","Loved this show. Hal was the best. Wish it did not end so quickly. I never gave the US version a chance, because I know that the US often ruins things. So I stick with this UK version, and will always love it. Funny, interesting, and a good way to see parts of England that I never will. Also it does something near the middle of the series and I won't spoil it, but it has to do with characters who die, that was not done before. Now it happens in US shows, but Being Human was the first one to do this. A trendsetter.",/review/rw6114952/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2010,Growlyted,8," Fangs, friendship & fun.
","When I saw the pilot, I saw the potential for this series. Three very human ""monsters"", humour, horror. It was good, but not brilliant yet. The cast didn't have the right chemistry. Russell (George) was perfect, but I couldn't stand Mitchell and Annie was okay. I hoped for a sequel, but with certain changes. Then the wait was over - it had been recast & brushed up to perfection. I love the domestic elements and how these three misfits learn not only to trust, but to depend on each other. While I've never been a vampire fan, these vampires smile and joke. They are entertaining. The only character I don't like is Nina, who frustratingly becomes George's girlfriend. Far from being ""angel of mercy"", she's rude and controlling. George deserves so much better. The plot grows and grows with each episode building nicely on the last. By far the best is Episode 5, the finale not managing to do it justice, but good enough. The old fashioned effects with puppetry and contacts are far more impressive than CGI could be. Overall, Series 1 is a howling success. 9/10",/review/rw6114952/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2011,Mike1388,6," Being Human Season 1
","Let me make this review short and simple. First of all, I like British television, some of them are even better than US mediocre, oh and don't forget those accents, I can watch anything based on that accent only. So, when I heard about Being Human produced by BBC, I was ecstatic! The first season have 6 episodes only, with an hour long each. The first few episodes was fulfilling, the great story lines, actors and emotions were amazing! But I got irritated when the same pattern is repeated till the end of the series. I like long hours movie, I like drama and emotions, but Being Human tells story about supernatural creatures who 'try' to fit in and be as human as possible. Vampire that doesn't want to kill, a ghost that is too scared and the worst, a werewolf that whines all the time, it's unbearable. The character development is so poor and slow, and that's a shame. I promised myself I won't watch the second season, but hey! who knows things might change.",/review/rw6114952/?ref_=tt_urv

","The Amercans have some compelling dramas like Lost and Heroes, and one of the only successful British ones I had seen was Sugar Rush, that is until this fantastic series came along. Mixing fantasy, horror, comedy and drama all together, it sees three classic horror legends brought together in a present day environment. Basically werewolf George (Doctor Who's Russell Tovey, the only person from the original pilot), ghost Annie (Sugar Rush's Lenora Crichlow) and vampire Mitchell (Aidan Turner) live together and try to be like normal humans, but all have setbacks with their conditions. George is panicky (and really funny in being so) because of his transformation once a month, Annie is wanting to talk to and be seen by certain people but is invisible, and Mitchell is fighting his lust for blood as it is what has kept him alive for decades. Also starring Jason Watkins as Herrick, Dylan Brown as Seth, Annabel Scholey as Lauren, Sinead Keenan as Nina, Gregg Chillin as Owen and Sama Goldie as Janey. With fantastic performances, great writing and splendid special effects, this is definitely a series not to be missed. Very good!",/review/rw6114952/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2010,mnpollio,2," Decidedly underwhelming
","I have to admit that I am completely underwhelmed by this series. Call me old-fashioned, but I prefer my vampires, werewolves and ghosts to have some sort of scare factor going for them. Being Human reduces their existence to a particularly irritating episode of Thirtysomething. The supernatural elements seem like extraneous flourishes to a show that is basically just about a trio of whiners trying to make the best of the crappy hand that life has dealt them. I have endured five episodes of the first season and so far they are pretty much uniform in that the three leads basically spend the episode moping and whining about the unfairness of the universe. Rather than anything especially seductive or magical about any of this, they remind one of a psychotically depressed person who entered a party and then tries to bring the entire room down to their level of hopelessness. There are some fairly impressive werewolf transformation effects, but they are usually followed by the subsequently human werewolf kvetching about his sorry lot in life and how hard he has it. The acting is fairly solid, with both Aidan Turner (the vampire) and Russell Tovey (the werewolf) offering hints that they are better than the material they are handed. Some unintentionally comic elements emerge if you catch this on BBC America where the often naked Tovey has his bits blurred to protect us poor prudish Americans from being corrupted. This could have been an interesting concept if the makers offered some degree of levity, imagination or good old-fashioned entertainment value, but the final result comes off as little more than a yammering reunion of the worst relatives in the Debbie Downer family.",/review/rw6114952/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2013,Tweekums,8," Three unusual housemates: a ghost, a vampire and a werewolf
","This supernatural horror/comedy starts off with a fairly simple yet original premise; what would happen if a ghost, a vampire and a werewolf were to live together; all the time trying to hide their true nature from those around them. At first it looked as if we'd never get to find out as the series was initially cancelled after its pilot so many people took to the internet to let the BBC know how much they liked it that eventually a full series was commissioned with a few changes to the cast. Initially it follows Bristol based trio Annie, the ghost; Mitchell, the vampire; and George, the werewolf as they struggle to prevent the local vampires' plans for domination. As the series progresses they face difficulties; dealing with supernatural enemies, people who want to exterminate their kind and their own base instincts. They also move from Bristol to Barry Island and eventually the cast changes; although at its centre there is always a ghost, a vampire and a werewolf.",/review/rw6114952/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's not just the swearing, the blood and the nudity. It's the unaffected emotion at its core. Annie's abusive relationship with Owen continues after death, George emits pitiful shrieks of agony and terror as he transforms, and Mitchell's attempts to shake off his bad-boy persona lead him to make a terrible mistake. Watch the final scene with Bernie and Fleur in Ep 4 and tell me you slept well. Watch the clumsy but affectionate sex between George and Nina and tell me you didn't laugh like a drain. Mitchell's last goodbye to his old girlfriend is a real tear jerker. Watching the hospital chaplain vomit with fright, you realise that's how real people behave.
