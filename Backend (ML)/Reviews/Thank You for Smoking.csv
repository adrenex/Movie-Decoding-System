18 October 2012,cherold,8," Funniest doomed show since Better Off Ted
","I don't have much hope for the future of The Neighbors. Sure, it's wildly funny, Toks Olagundoye (who I've never seen before)is brilliant, and the show's wacky sensibility and great sight gags (like a formation of pie-carrying aliens) make it the season's best new comedy, but way too many people just don't like it. The reviews have been very poor (as opposed to the almost universal praise heaped on the terrible Ben and Kate), and the average rating on IMDb and TV.com is low. ",/review/rw2704888/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2012,russmillerwy-957-682439,8," not quite 3rd Rock, but funny
","3rd Rock from the Sun is a tough act to follow. The Neighbors does a pretty good job, but uses wit and timing instead of zaniness and slapstick comedy to get its laughs. That makes it consistently funny, just not side-splittingly funny. Naming all of the aliens after sports heroes was an inspired choice-- they'll never run out of funny names (a tot named Dick Butkus?), and the fact that the aliens are dorky doubles down on the running gag. So are all their matching outfits/uniforms that remind us of golf clothes from the 1970s. ",/review/rw2704888/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2012,giggedyguy,10," Too Good, Too Lighthearted to Last?
","I've only seen Lenny Venito once before and I was so impressed with him I knew immediately this show would shine. He's one of those guys who can be funny just standing still. And then there's Jami Gertz who displays perfect comedic timing in this show, not to mention she gets some of the best lines.",/review/rw2704888/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2012,elicatis,8," Nice series, hope it gets renewed
","This is a cute series, light hearted and fun. It treats one taken-for- granted subject of our human life per episode and it manages to turn it on all sides in a nice way...does what very well exactly what'the new normal' fails terribly: produces interesting characters that we care about, nice stories, criticize slightly some aspects of daily life that are less than ideal and reframe our daily life, while actually manage to be funny and not fall in an overly judgemental storyline. OK, it might not be the comedy of the century, but its really catching some steam lately and it deserves proper time and attention to develop. I read some awful reviews of the pilot and i totally disagree with most of them. This is a nice series, with nice and funny actors, good story and quite some laughs. Very enjoyable...let's give it some support!",/review/rw2704888/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2012,throatmotor,8," Pleasantly surprised!
","Where this show is so new I'm inclined to keep this short and sweet: I'm unsure why some are rating this show so low, as it seems to have been quite clearly written and designed for fun. I'd like to suggest more cynical viewers lower their proverbial gun barrels and take pleasure in a show that simply wants to be silly, creative and a little bit cheesy...as opposed to the barrage of deep message-laden pseudo-preachy programs that we're currently bombarded with.",/review/rw2704888/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2012,thevagusgirl,8," Worth watching. Show deserves a shot to see how it develops.
","Having been underwhelmed by the trailer, I found the pilot much funnier than I had expected. It's essentially a show about the trials and tribulations of family life, with overtones of ""The Coneheads"" and shades of ""Monty Python"". ",/review/rw2704888/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2012,kols,10," Brilliant
","Agree with all the positive reviews, couldn't disagree more with the negative reviews and it all resolves down to personal taste. Which is why all reviews should begin with ""I think . . ."" and end with ""That's my opinion.""",/review/rw2704888/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2012,pv61,10," I love it, I love it, I love it - Helen Madden
","Maybe I am weird, but I love this show from the start. I loved 3rd. Rock from the sun and since there's never enough comedies involving aliens, I was eager to see this one from the first time I heard about it. I loved the pilot and I have been enjoying it ever since, each time I like it lore and more. Last night, I was pleasantly surprised with the Thanksgiving episode, where they came up with the brilliant idea of giving Jackie two sisters (and one of them is Leslie Jordan), that was not the only hilarious thing, but the explanation they have for that!",/review/rw2704888/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2012,nocalnut,10," Writing and acting is wicked funny
","It's so nice to finally pick a show that looks like it won't be prematurely canceled or moved around until viewers loose interest. This show is written so well and really is quite funny. The cast is remarkable and for only watching three episodes, I'm hooked. My husband also likes it and it meshes well with Modern Family, The Middle, and Suburgatory. Yeah for finding a show that will last. ",/review/rw2704888/?ref_=tt_urv

",I signed up for an account with IMDb just so I could show support for this sitcom. ,/review/rw2704888/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2012,Ivkaa,10," Simple and fun :)
","When I saw the beginning of the first episode I thought ""Oh Gosh....another bad comedy-wanna-be with horrible effects"". By the time I finished the episode my mind was completely changed.",/review/rw2704888/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2013,ludy,10," Funny show worthy of a long run
","Let's hope ABC gives Neighbors and its writers a chance to further develop an already enjoyable premise. The leading parents are resourcefully cast, with Simon Templeman and Toks Olagondoye as Larry Bird and Jackie Joyner-Kersee, brilliantly funny as they are curious of the human race, (asking questions from the ridiculous to worthy of everyone's self-examination). And the absence of a laugh-track is always welcome. I know mindless critics such as Matt Roush would have a weak comeback about the laugh track, but avoid his shallowness. This regressive ranked ""The Middle"" seventh out of all shows network and non-network, while panning HBO's Newsroom, because he felt it degraded women. Much to be said here, but will leave it as a brief expression of the futility of television critics. There's plenty of room for Neighbors to draft a five-year plot line. They're already improving with each show. One suggestion: a little less howling from the Weaver kids. In TV comedies, children, when not the main focus, are not always a winning formula. One big exception was Jami Gertz's last comedy, ""Still Standing"", where the kids were a hilarious element of the show. Let them protest, but with wit. Tim Jo's character as Reggie Jackson shines; and Clara Mamet, as Amber shows promise. In our household, comedies reign, and we are discerning. Neighbors is a show we look forward to each week and hope to look forward to each year.",/review/rw2704888/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2012,eiserlois,10," Wonderful Show
","I love this show. It is the best new comedy since The Big Bang Theory. The characters are a perfect blend. I love the kids, the facial expressions the concept, I just love it all. I have watched each episode more then once because I keep showing it to people who haven't watched it yet and I laugh at the same lines all over again. I had my 19 year old grandson watch it with me and he couldn't wait to tell his friends about this show. We were both laughing so hard and enjoyed it so much. I didn't think I was going to like this show at all but now ",/review/rw2704888/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2014,SnoopyStyle,7," Loads of ridiculous fun
","The Weavers (Jami Gertz, Lenny Venito, Clara Mamet, Max Charles, Isabella Cramp) are a Jersey family who moves into a gated community. Then they find out that all the neighbors are aliens from another planet. Every one of them picked a famous sport star name. The leader is Larry Bird (Simon Templeman) with his wife Jackie Joyner-Kersee (Toks Olagundoye) and their kids Dick Butkus (Ian Patrick) and Reggie Jackson (Tim Jo).",/review/rw2704888/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2012,mongoose-maelstrom,7," Much funnier than I expected!
","As a fan of the Coneheads, this familiar premise held some hope for me, but I was prepared to be disappointed. However, within the boundaries of where a show like this is aimed, this was a very funny show. No audience laughter and no talking to the camera were welcome assets. ",/review/rw2704888/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2013,thirteenprime,9," Don't Miss This One!
","The Neighbors' pilot was a little weak, but there was something good going on inside there — enough for me to have come back the following week, and then the week after that, and so on. Now, as it closes out its first season, The Neighbors — a sitcom, for crying out loud! — has become my favorite show on television. The most recent episode, as I write this, was a musical with songs co-written by the great Alan Menken. Who else does this kind of stuff? Who else would even try?",/review/rw2704888/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2012,Luvhallmark,9," Love Love Love this show!
","While watching the pilot episode...I must admit, I did turn it off about 15 minutes in but I decided to finish watching it the next day and I'm oh so glad I did. This show is quick witted, different, amusing, quirky and so many other things. This is the show that I most look forward to each week. I'm so tired of XFactor type shows....boring! The Neighbors is so fresh and fun. I love Jamie Gertz...always have, I think she's a fantastic actor and I love the rest of the cast as well and the fact that the neighbors are all named after pro athletes is genius! Give The Neighbors a chance, the comedy moves along quickly so there's no time to get bored. Thanks goodness a program that is not reality TV or a singing competition or something even worse...honey boo boo! Keep the episodes coming, I'm completely hooked!!!",/review/rw2704888/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2012,bd7349,9," Great new show, funny and different... finally a change from all those reality TV shows and boring other night time series
","The pilot episode was hilarious and made me laugh out loud many times. It has the possibility to become great show. It's so much more different than all the other shows that seem to be airing on TV nowadays. In the end, it's a great, funny, entertaining, and genuinely new show. ",/review/rw2704888/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2012,evenik-531-538925,10," Finally something different and funny to watch
","""The Neighbors"" is a breath of fresh air if you are tired of reality shows, talent shows and the like. It takes a little stretch of your imagination and some faith to fully appreciate this show. You will be rewarded if you stay with it. Just like your first scary carnival ride: after it was over you thought ""that was fun, I want to do it again"".",/review/rw2704888/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2012,not_my_real_addy,9," So glad I gave it a second chance
","I actually started to watch the pilot when it first aired, and when it didn't grab me in the first few minutes, decided to delete it from my dvr schedule. Then during a conversation two months later, someone told me how much they liked it and I decided to give it a second chance. I found it on Hulu and watched one episode, and then another and another and found that it grew on me.",/review/rw2704888/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2013,vandyke50,9," Fun Show
","I hadn't heard about Neighbors until I read the show was being canceled so I thought I would have a look. At first I wasn't too sure about the series but by episode three I was enjoying it more and more. The cast is excellent and very funny, maybe Neighbors is not the funniest program in years but it surely isn't the worst and those others are not being canceled. For me it is a series that grows on you and it seems odd that ABC would cancel the show while flogging that dead horse ""Once Upon A Time"". The cast is funny and works well together so maybe ABC should thank the writers and keep the great cast together. Over the years some shows have taken a while to catch on, this may be one of those. I hadn't even heard of the series so maybe if ABC spent some time telling folks about The Nieghbors maybe ratings would improve. ++++ I wrote that some time ago, now I'm baffled as to why such a fine comedy would be shot down by ABC. The characters grow on you, the humor is adult the plot worth continuing. Now as of April 2014 I'm very sad to see these great characters disappear. Well done writers and cast, thanks.",/review/rw2704888/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2012,artichoke6-762-897777,10," Best new show in YEARS!
","This show is hilarious, week after week, scene after scene. Toks nails it as alien neighbor Jackie. Watch for her scenes, and pay attention for her husband Larry's quips, they are rapid fast and sometimes I go back to hear his comments a second time.",/review/rw2704888/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2013,moondancer,8," Gem of a Show
","Neighbors is a truly enjoyable sitcom with heart and a great cast, including breakout star Toks Olagundoye. We can't imagine life without ""Jackie Joyner Kersee"" now that we've met her, and sincerely hope this show gets renewed for another season ( or more! ). Not that there was anything wrong in the beginning, but the series has steadily gotten better all season long and we love the unlikely bonds forming between the characters and the show's ability to poke fun at itself. The young actors are all very unusual but they are really beginning to click now as well. And I'm sure there's endless opportunities to build given the large number of 'neighbors' we haven't really met. Carry on please Zavronians and Weavers!",/review/rw2704888/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2018,tchriste52-807-233590,9," I loved this show
","I loved this show and was sad that it lasted only 2 seasons. The characters were fresh, funny and witty without being saccharine. The acting was superb and perfectly casted.",/review/rw2704888/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2012,painterjane25,8," Cutest, funniest, family show, in years...
","The first two episodes are mindless and fun, but the show really becomes smart and hits its stride in ep 3, and onward. I must say that the main New Jersey family, and the main Alien fam, are perfectly cast and magnificent in their respective roles. Everyones' chemistry is excellent. The smaller kids, are adorable, and the teens, Amber and Reggie Jackson, are phenomenal, and so much more realistic, than most shows, currently on the air. This simple, goofy fun, takes me back to childhood, and reruns of The Munsters, Bewitched and I Dream of Jeannie. This sitcom, totally references the golden age of wacky TV, and is perfect for ages 8 to 80. Trust me, the commercials do not do this show, justice!",/review/rw2704888/?ref_=tt_urv
