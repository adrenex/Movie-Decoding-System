11 May 2008,aharmas,8," Taking control isn't that easy
",Whoever said that brains and beauty is not an explosive combination? An enterprising young woman sees a way to take control of her life and becomes a mastermind behind a society of young women whose lives are slowly shattered when they decide to use their charms to make some money.,/review/rw5666288/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2011,Buddy-51,," a complex survey of contemporary moral standards
","The well-acted indie drama ""The Babysitters"" takes what appears on the surface to be fairly salacious and distasteful material and turns it into a scathing attack on contemporary mores and values.",/review/rw5666288/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2008,uncre8tv,8," Great little indy film
","This is what I look for in independent film. Well drawn characters, competent movie making, and a pleasing ambiguity that a big studio wouldn't dare leave in, lest the audience actually decide how to feel for themselves. The guys are great - desperate, sleazy, charming, funny and sad. The girls are also portrayed fairly - scheming, sweet, sexy and innocent. Leguizamo's character is believable to me as an aging playa, chafing against middle age and lusting for Waterson's Shirley. And Shirley is the best on-screen pimp in recent memory. To be fair: things unfold a little quickly, people accept their situations a little easier than they might in real life, but this is a pretty short movie, and throwing in more angst would be overkill and overlong on screen. No one comes away clean, and no one comes away as the absolute bad guy. Moral absolutes would kill this film, and I'm glad it got made the way it did.",/review/rw5666288/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2008,siderite,8," A rather good idea with great start, but a bit of a simple ending
","I marked it high because of the original script idea and the great acting, but I have to say that the ending could have been better.",/review/rw5666288/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2007,Quentin-12,," Worth a rainy afternoon...
","Just saw this film at TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival). The director was there and participated in the Q&A. The film was entertaining, I'll give it that much, however the major problems stem from it just doesn't feel like the film-making team really knew what kind of film they wanted to make. The tone is muddled and therefore you're never really sure how to feel about most of the situations. The sex scenes are probably the most interesting of the film, and mostly because that's really the only time where we really see the characters and what they're going through. Cynthia Nixon and John Leguzamo play a married couple, and although they're both cast well and play the parts well I find it very hard to believe them as a couple at all. I think that the writing and portrayal of their characters is fine, it just doesn't fit. The director/writer seems to prefer going after internal conflict rather than external, the main problem is that in the end we never really get a sense of how this whole story has affected everyone. We're left on a very vague not that I think hurts the film more than helps it. That and it kinda/sorta felt like a newer take on 'Pizza Boy' with Patrick Dempsy (and from a marketing point MILFS are way more interesting than... oh my... FILFs?)",/review/rw5666288/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2008,theofficialmaxine,10," So much more than I expected
","Stuck at home and recovering from a viral throat infection, I was looking for a couple of nice little cheesy movies that didn't take much brain power. What I found instead, was one utter piece of dross (Black Ribbon, don't bother watching it), and this absolute gem. ",/review/rw5666288/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2013,paul_haakonsen,5," Entertaining, sure, but nothing out of the ordinary...
","The sole reason for why I picked up ""The Babysitters"" was because of John Leguizamo being in it. Having read the synopsis for the movie, and that wasn't particularly a selling point for me. So, for me, the movie was depending on John Leguizamo to carry it - and so he did.",/review/rw5666288/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2008,tomasdiaz,10," The Babysitters is original
",The Babysitters is a completely original film. What a great plot. It doesn't hurt that John Leguizamo is in this one. He's an actor that can carry a film. I though the story was hip with a dark undercurrent. A teenager turns madam after her babysitting service gets sexy. The sex was secondary to the plot. At the core it was a drama about the human condition of getting older. At one time you're in high school then you find yourself married with children looking back and wanting back those youthful days of freedom. I highly recommend The Babysitters to add to your DVD collection. Writer and Director David Ross delivers an outstanding film. One of the best I've watched recently.,/review/rw5666288/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2015,beornmatt,4," Great idea, poor execution
","I can imagine some director sitting down and going ""Hmm. I've got a great movie idea. Check this out: a high school girl recruits her friends to be call girls under the auspices of babysitting and turns into a ruthless pimp."" Good idea for an edgy movie, right? Probably so, but the execution was pretty bad here. There were so many holes in logic and obvious plot devices that it made it very difficult for me to willingly suspend my disbelief. For instance: ",/review/rw5666288/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2016,SnoopyStyle,4," no redeeming value
",High schooler Shirley Lyner (Katherine Waterston) babysits for Michael (John Leguizamo) and Gail Beltran (Cynthia Nixon). Shirley starts making out with Michael and then have sex. Michael lets out the secret to his friend and word spreads. Shirley recruits her eager friend Melissa Rowan. Next it's quiet Brenda. They start a business called The Babysitters. Brenda brings in her stepsister Nadine who starts her own competing service with other girls.,/review/rw5666288/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2013,sexybeastv6,6," Very good, yet odd.
","I loved the characters though I did wish that the movie didn't end so fast, I would have loved to see someone's wife find out. There are a lot of interesting and sleazy events taking place in this film and oddly enough you'll find yourself glued to the seat begging for more craziness to happen as the story line unfolds. This film is dramatically insane with hot romances and yet its a little disturbing once you factor in the age and lives that they lead. These girls are not your typical high school students, don't expect anything but slightly tamed adult material from this flick. This movie in my opinion is a must see, and most definitely not for people with an open mind.",/review/rw5666288/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2013,jafar-iqbal,4," Boring, predictable, and full of uninspired performances
","After she ends up having sex with one of her customers, a teenager decides to turn her babysitting job into an illicit escort agency, with herself and her friends as the call-girls. Things are great at first, but the reality of the situation she has put herself and her friends in starts to take its toll.",/review/rw5666288/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2010,Aregie,2," Yippee, more teenage boobs.
",I am incredulous at the positive reviews for this movie. The only positive thing I can say about the film is the strong performance by the lead actress.,/review/rw5666288/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2009,bill-987,8," A lot more than I expected!

27 April 2018,nogodnomasters,4," Who else needs a sitter?
","After sitting, Shirley gets paid $200 for the ride home. It isn't the destiny, but the journey. One by one her friends join her in providing sitting services fro the married men of the community, a risky business sitter's club. As always things get too big and too emotional or else there wouldn't be any conflict and all we would have to watch is teen girls having sex. ",/review/rw5666288/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2009,lastliberal,6," The money is nice, and paid fellatio isn't that much more humiliating than flipping burgers.
","OK, there is something slightly sleazy about watching a movie featuring high school girls making money providing sex to dads.",/review/rw5666288/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2021,Bethanybee33,1," Pedophile's fantasy
","I have a hard time believing any normal person actually likes this movie. Not only are the girls in high school and are literally being exploited and groomed by creepy men their fathers ages, but the main character Shirley completely changes her personality it's not even enjoyable to a normal person. First shirleys shy and all OCD and then changes to this mean greedy pimp character. But to actually like watching this type of movie, you must like seeing the sexualization of teens. I felt uneasy the whole movie and there was no justice at the end. The creepy men should've gotten caught and arrested and their wives should've found out. Like at least make the guys attractive so it's actually realistic and believable.",/review/rw5666288/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2012,TxMike,," Somewhat better than I expected, high school girls form a prostitution ring.
",This movie was available on Netflix streaming. I wanted to watch something meaningless in spare time when I had a few minutes to kill. So I saw it in 4 or 5 sittings.,/review/rw5666288/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2008,lee_eisenberg,7," sometimes it's best to stick with your original intention
","""The Babysitters"" seems like the sort of movie that could debut the Sundance Film Festival. It focuses on an anal-retentive teenage girl (Katharine Waterston, Sam's daughter) who turns her babysitting service into a prostitution business, only to have things take an unexpected turn. If the movie has any problem, it's that much of it's a little hard to follow. Seriously, it seems like the movie lets things go on for a while before clarifying the purpose. Then again, they might need time to let things develop.",/review/rw5666288/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2012,gentrypemberton,5," Misguided & Confused
","This movie is both entertaining and highly unsatisfying; as unsure of itself as the teenage girls it depicts. There does not seem to be an overall direction and there is little in terms of a climax. No pun intended, because the frequent sex scenes are among the film's most entertaining sequences.",/review/rw5666288/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2022,kosmasp,7," Babysitters ... club
","I reckon movies like this (not these - a typo or small mistake in the movie, never mind) one right here, are responsible for wives being wary of Babysitters ... especially if they are young and pretty. On the other hand, the movie only exists because there is a fantasy about that.",/review/rw5666288/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2011,lawhite3,1," Eeeew and yuck.
","The ONLY reason I watched this was to see John Leguizamo. But as an uptight, suburban white guy? No. Didn't make the cut for me. How Lauren Birkell's character went from OCD to PIMP was really ridiculous. Then she goes from nerd to violent street thug? This was a infomercial for pedophiles. Only Cynthia Nixon's uptight suburban character was plausible because she played the same role in Sex in the City. I would have been happier if Chris Hansen had a cameo role and some of the men had been caught up in a To Catch a Predator Dateline program! This was a gross film about gross people doing gross things. I'll just keep thinking of John Leguizamo as Benny Blanco; it will make this character go away and I'll feel better. . .",/review/rw5666288/?ref_=tt_urv

11 July 2013,kairingler,9," babysitting ?
","I really enjoyed this movie, first off John Leguizomo gives a terrific performance in his role.. the movie deals with a bunch of sexy teenage girls perhaps bored and broke,, they offer ""babysitting"" services as a ruse for prostitution, with one of the girls dad's and all of his friends. there is definitely a lot of sex in this movie obviously and we assume that most if not all of the girls are underage, so that's presents a moral and legal dilemma for the men involved. not really for the girls because they just want the money, the one dad even brags to his friends that he ""did"" this girl and recommends her to all his friends. the girls on the other hand team up to make a lot of cash,, well one or more of the girls decides to get greedy and set up ""dates"" unbeknownst to the others , and when the other girls find out the catfight is on.. will the men be caught and sent to jail for exploiting these teen girls,, or will the girls blackmail the dad's and get away with it,, lot's of tension and drama,, all the way till the final climax.. no pun intended.",/review/rw5666288/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2020,TheTruthofItIs,5," Yeh, it's a Lifetime Movie
","Yeh, not much there, it's a guilty-pleasure that you'd typically find on Lifetime or Oxygen though with just the slightest ""R"" material, so maybe old-style Cinemax. Story is predictable and something you've seen a dozen times already but played out by oh-so-anxious high school teens, and they're not even all that hot, ugh.",/review/rw5666288/?ref_=tt_urv
