5 July 2019,Jeremy_Urquhart,10," One of the best films of this decade
","I am remarkably stingy with my 10/10 ratings. I'll be the first person to acknowledge this. Of the roughly 2600 titles I've rated on here, only 34 have a 10.
Parasite is one of them. If this isn't a masterpiece, then I don't know what is.",/review/rw5459997/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2019,jtindahouse,8," You name a genre, this movie covers it
","I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that contained as many genres as 'Parasite'. The movie starts out almost like an 'Ocean's Eleven' heist film and then expands into a comedy, mystery, thriller, drama, romance, crime and even horror film. It really did have everything and it was strikingly good at all of them too.",/review/rw5459997/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2019,nehpetstephen,10," Meritocracy: it's metaphorical
","In a meritocracy, success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve it--those who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination. Anyone can rise to the top, and for some lucky Cinderella, plucked from the cinders and gussied up in gowns, the meritocracy represents the heights of perfect egalitarian society: ""I started with nothing and ended up with everything I ever desired; you, too, can achieve you dreams, if only you try.""",/review/rw5459997/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2020,Leofwine_draca,10," Thoroughly entertaining
","PARASITE is an excellent effort from Korean director Bong Joon Ho, a talent I've long admired since seeing THE HOST over a decade ago. He's had his ups and downs over the years, although they've generally been ups rather than downs, but this is perhaps his towering masterpiece. It's a quiet and reflective work, his maturist yet, a parable playing out which looks at class divide in a scathing and extremely telling way. The issue is universal, which is why this film did so well abroad (and at the Oscars), although I've been championing the quality of South Korean cinema for a long time. The technical qualities are exemplary and the acting is particularly astounding, with an unusual storyline building to an unexpected climax. A film that thoroughly entertains as well as making you think.",/review/rw5459997/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2019,mysticfall,10," For those who didn't like the movie because of its second half
","It's not really a review but my attempt to explain how I interpreted the movie to those who complain that the film is overrated, especially if the reason is that they didn't like the second half of it.",/review/rw5459997/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2020,bob the moo,," Engaging as a drama, with an intelligent social aspect to it
","A poor family see an opportunity whenever their son starts tutoring English for a wealthy family - if they can engineer it, they can each get one of the jobs within the household. This is the basis for a film that starts out as a sort of con story, seeing the rich family as the 'marks'. As it plays out though, it keeps this assumption in the background, eating at the viewer as an idea, before then making it very relevant in the closing aspects of the plot. Between the start and then, the focus is on the various twists and turns of the drama itself. In this the film engages, and I found it easy to engage with it on the basis of what was happening.",/review/rw5459997/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2019,keezo9uno,10," A true masterpiece.
","This movie is a gosh darn masterpiece. It will make you belly laugh, it will chill you to the bone, and it will make you shed a tear. This movie will stay with you long after the credits are over.",/review/rw5459997/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2021,boblipton,10," Thought It Might Win Best Foreign Movie
","When the buddy who got into college tells him he's moving to the US, and he's passing on the 14-year-old he's been tutoring -- just tell 'em you're enrolled in college, even though you aren't -- the son of a family so low class they've sunk through the foundation finds them very nice, very accepting, and very clueless. So he and his layabout family get all the help fired; his sister is hired as an art psychologist to help the sister, the father as the new chauffeur, and the mother as the cook/housekeeper. Yet even though you don't see them, there are vermin living in the foundations, and they come out when the people in charge aren't around.",/review/rw5459997/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2020,Hitchcoc,9," Totally Unique
","Usually I don't read reviews before seeing a film. This one, however, I did, and happily so. First of all, it was good to know what cinema in Korea is all about. We need to shed our cultural biases, including ""how"" to make films. This had a very clever plot and an engaging group of characters. The title, I assume, means the principle figures have managed to infest a body and then use it to sustain themselves. I hope to see more from this director in the future.",/review/rw5459997/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2020,perica-43151,9," Multilayered portrayal of the real Korea
","This is a movie about a class struggle in South Korea, like what movie ""Us"" attempts to do but done properly. It is a stark reminder of what true living standards for most South Koreans look like, and its realism is very painful. Few are aware of the fact that up to the 1980s, South Korea was in fact more impoverished than North Korea, and it was only late that the situation reversed with famines of the 90s etc, but many people still live miserable lives, and situation is very similar to that in China, where a few got gloriously rich but the urban masses still live in bug infested cheap dwellings.",/review/rw5459997/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2020,impeyrules-54634,9," An original dark comedy about class struggles
",This is a well written and well perfomed original film. With a lot of repetitive cinema these day i felt this was something new. I felt connected and engaged with the character throughout the film. There are several well directed tense moments throughout the film. A popular topic of class struggled well portrayed. Its always nice to see foreign language films having worldwide success.,/review/rw5459997/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Great
",The most original film of 2019 and it is wickedly funny and darkly disturbing all at the same time. The narrative and the actors were excellent. One of the better endings of a movie in quite a while. Class warfare at its best.,/review/rw5459997/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2019,CineMuseFilms,8," A black comedy on social inequality
","There is no shortage of films that depict the injustice of social inequality but originality is scarce. With a large proportion of its population below the poverty line, it is noteworthy that a filmmaker from South Korea has produced a work that has attracted almost universal acclaim. Parasite (2019)generates a great deal of conversation but be warned: it is not a film for everyone, especially those averse to gory endings.",/review/rw5459997/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2019,DJKwa,9," Achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us
","As a film about a family imposing on another, and keeping dark secrets hidden beneath the surface, Parasite achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us: tell a multi-layered story in a widely entertaining manner, but without sacrificing the believability of its central narrative.",/review/rw5459997/?ref_=tt_urv

",Well written and performed also technically shines cinematography & bgm are too good and there's not even a single lag it's perfectly edited. Probably the best experience in recent times. Its pure art resembles the modern society the emotions they had shelved are insanely exceptional a layered masterpiece. If you like dark thrillers then you shouldn't miss Mr. Bong joon-ho's Parasite. Definitely tops the list of best movies in 2019.,/review/rw5459997/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2020,Sleepin_Dragon,10," Incredible.
","Possibly the best film I've seen for some time, yes I have a few lockdown blues, and needed something to cause a bit of escapism, Parasite was the answer. It's one of those films that's almost impossibility to classify, it doesn't really fit into any specific genre, but covers almost all of them.",/review/rw5459997/?ref_=tt_urv

4 February 2020,Fella_shibby,10," Thy shall not ridicule fellas with body odor. Definitely deserves the best picture award.
","Finally saw this much talked about film. As a fan of Korean thrillers, this film surpassed my expectations.

31 January 2020,cricketbat,8," Bong Joon-ho's drama/thriller/comedy is definitely worth seeing
","It's hard to nail down what type of movie Parasite is, but this drama/thriller/comedy is definitely worth seeing. Bong Joon-ho tells this story in a way that keeps you engaged and keeps you guessing, with protagonists you can't fully like and antagonists you don't really hate. Even though I may not agree with every decision this film makes, I enjoyed the journey and I'll be thinking about it for a very long time.",/review/rw5459997/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2019,RforFilm,10," Without spoiling it, Parasite is the amazing film equivalent to ""Is it wrong to steel bread to feed a starving family?""
","If there's an argument that's been a part of society since the dawn of time is that of class. From the days of cavemen, the Roman Empire, the Enlightment, and even modern times, philosophers, scholars and storytellers have explored the ideology of the wealthy and poor. It's something that people have wanted to fix to create more equality and people that discuss whether things should be equal at all. It's hard to give my opinion because we have so many viewpoints that's its challenging to paint who exactly is in the wrong. There are good wealthy people and bad poor people and vice versa. This is also something that many movies has dived into.",/review/rw5459997/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2019,jmholmes-73727,10," FUNNY, TURNS SUDDENLY TWISTED, THEN SAD
","This movie is so masterfully written and presented with a large cast that older audiences will realize how rare movies like this have become. Its enjoyment comes from getting to know the members of two extremely different families, one very poor, the other very rich. How their lives come together is the wickedly enjoyable first half; then, in the second half the house of cards begins to shake and finally collapse with a fury we both dread - and perhaps even enjoy. Though our enjoyment probably has as much to do with the movie-making skills than with the nasty turn of events in the violent final scenes.
If you see only one foreign language film this year, this should be it. Exciting and provocative throughout, it is wonderfully acted and packed with significance for all who live in a polarized society where so many live in luxury, while others live in comparative squalor just a few blocks away. Deserves all the accolades it has already - and surely will continue - to receive.",/review/rw5459997/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2020,classicsoncall,8," ""If you make a plan, life never works out that way.""
","This film's ranking here on IMDb is somewhat of an anomaly. Usually, when a hot new release makes it's way into the Top 250, it manages to remain in it's general range for a while and then slowly decline as more and more reviewers add their vote. ""Parasite"" entered the list in the mid Fifties if I correctly recall, and since then has managed to improve it's position to #26 as I write this. No one knows if that will hold obviously, so I'm curious to see how the movie rates over time.",/review/rw5459997/?ref_=tt_urv
