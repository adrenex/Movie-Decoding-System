21 June 2015,Kareneo,10," Exactly what good Sci Fi is supposed to be.
","Gaah! I can't wait for the next episode! It is building tension ju-u-u-st right: Creepy, heart rending, asking the big questions about life and love and what constitutes consciousness, in other words it just couldn't be better. It also feels like perhaps it actually is building towards a specific future point, rather than just bumbling along and making stuff up as it goes. I am very excited to see where they're taking us, and how current loyalties may shift..? (I hope so!) Very well made, very well acted, just well-crafted in every way. Who said the art of good Science Fiction is dead? It seems to be experiencing a renaissance right now in response to all the boring 'miserealism' of recent times - huzzah!",/review/rw3501651/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2018,cocobinay,10," This is how Sci-Fi is done!
","From the beginning, the premise of this show, the writing, the acting, the twists and the human message were engrossing, and they have remained more so over the last three seasons, and by the way, very relevant: the stakes feel real and relatable to today's issues throughout.

29 June 2015,atlasmb,10," Off To A Quick Start, Humans Is Promising!
","The first episode of AMC's new series ""Humans"" is ambitious, covering a lot of ground in a broad subject--artificial intelligence (and the nature of humanity).",/review/rw3501651/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2015,A_Different_Drummer,8," Review-wise, lots of things happening here...
","First, this is the kind of series the Brits have shown a knack for, riffing off normal life situations into something creepy and unexpected. (See for example UTOPIA, the original UK version, also reviewed by this scribe.) So even though this is a clone of a European show, it is a natural for English audiences.",/review/rw3501651/?ref_=tt_urv

18 July 2015,nicolasrowley,9," Condition of Humans
",My wife and I operate a three episode policy when deciding to watch a new show. With all the great TV out there it can be hard to choose what to watch and not every show has a great start but develops into something memorable. As a result we always wait until we have DVR'd at least three episodes before watching the first. The other reason we record three is if the show is good we will want more immediately. Humans however left us wanting more after the third episode.,/review/rw3501651/?ref_=tt_urv

16 June 2015,seattletuttle,10," The creepiest thing I've seen in a very long time, deeply disturbing & worthwhile
","This is meant to be an extremely positive review, however it might not sound that way. This first episode was so disturbing I had to take a break. When I came back and finished it I had tears I'm my eyes from the disturbing feeling it invoked. This is not normally something I seek out in entertainment. But this is so well done, I simply can't avoid it. If I described the premise created in the first episode, it would sound tired and old; all the questions about artificial intelligence and it's rise equaling the fall of mankind. But somehow the writing, and story, and especially the actors create something new and exceptional. What happens here is inevitable someday. The questions are will we survive?",/review/rw3501651/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2015,ewaf58,9," Intelligent and entertaining
",Well these synthetics cost no more than a car - can cook - garden - iron and engage in pretty lifeless 'conversations'. Quite frankly it might be better to splash your money on the new Mazda MX5 this Summer and have some real fun.,/review/rw3501651/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2020,TheOtherMovieGuy,3," Honestly, I found this to be rubbish
","I really tried to like this; soldiering through three episodes but couldn't take anymore after that and gave up. Much like the concept of Bladerunner, sentient humanoid robots co-existing with humans is a real genre in science fiction so I had high hopes for this. Sadly, I found the series unengaged and hollow. In fact, this isn't really a sci-fi at all, it's family drama with a cliched angry daughter, ambitious mother, fragile relationships etc. And the family father - Lord Have Mercy - was the most uninspiring actor I have seen in a long time. Almost as if he had no soul
This story is modelled on the Swedish TV drama 'Äkta människor' (Real Humans) which I found more interesting albeit still cliched and also a family drama, but the actors there felt more ""genuine"" and the plot was more balanced. Watching this felt like watching Coronation Street with a Sci-Fi robotics twist....and I detest Coronation Street. But if those shows float your boat, I am sure that you'll enjoy the series. But if you're hoping for something Asimov inspired or even remotely Sci-Fi themed (apart from human acting badly like robots) you'll be sorely disappointed.",/review/rw3501651/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2015,keithwoodsholder,9," Promising start
","I expected this series to be an ""I Robot"" lite, but in fact I am impressed with the first episode both from its acting and the completeness of this initial 'view' into an alternative world. Keeping my fingers crossed it will maintain this standard. Although I know this was adapted from a Swedish series I'm deliberately staying away from it for now. The opening episode certainly seems to have captured the sense of atmosphere and something impending that Scandinavians do so well. With a cast which is more than able to add some heft to the 'human' side of the story - it was equally gratifying to see the 'synthetics' pull off the difficult balancing act between machine behavior and enough 'emotional' content to set the series up for some dramatic juxtapositions. Although there is a small level of ""adult"" content I think its use, given the use of technology in our own world, was both relevant and all too believable.",/review/rw3501651/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2019,mcleodjack,5," Not good
","This became a soap opera after the 4th episode. I didn't care about the real characters, and too much emphasis on whether or not people should care about the ""feelings"" of robots. Boo hoo.",/review/rw3501651/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2018,GraXXoR,10," Intelligent series that looks at the place of humanity in a post AI world
","First of all, let me address my 10 rating.
There is no such thing as perfection, but for me, a 10/10 rating means the show delivers everything one could hope for in all aspects (acting, storyline, plot, production) were exemplary.",/review/rw3501651/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2015,RamonThomas,8," Do Synths Dream of Electric Sheep?
",Humans is an unexpectedly great show. The reason for this is that it's understated in the technology an emphasizes the humanity. The cast are all from UK and mostly unknown and it allows us to get to know the characters more. Gemma Chan who plays Anita/Mya led me to this series via her Twitter. I first saw her in Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit.,/review/rw3501651/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2015,dobbinman,9," Possibly better than the original
",As someone who has raved about the original 'Äkta Människor' for some time now I was keen to see the remake. Set in a parallel time line synthetic humans have become commonplace in both the workplace and the home. The programme explores how regular people react with them and how a group of them with modified sentience develop in their own unique ways under the loose leadership of a human. If it follows the original which looks likely then expect some really weird stuff. It also follows the 'life' of an unmodified outdated and somewhat faulty model called 'Odie' who's elderly owner cannot bare to part with him as he has a shared relationship with his dead wife and reminds him of her. Having seen 'Being Human' recently which was dreadful I was prepared for the worst but was surprised to see that the latest version may even be superior to the original. I look forward to the next episode.,/review/rw3501651/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2019,Arnror_II,2," Artificial unintelligence, with teen angst
","Obviously, this wasn't made for me, or any critical thinking individual over sixteen.
1. AI, so stupid they don't pack an extra battery for a long trip.
This is not some on/off stupidity as a plot device, it's constant.
2. Humans, so stupid and emo that they through the course of the show, actually end up betraying EVERY other character, just on emotional whims.
This IS the plot device.
3. None of the characters remembers three episodes back, neither does the writers, and based on the score of this abysmal show, neither does the audience.
Stay clear, there nothing SCI to be found here.",/review/rw3501651/?ref_=tt_urv

23 May 2018,jk-692-236394,4," Season Three goes full on poltical. Preachy and not the least bit subtle.
","There are zero spoilers in this review if you have seen season one and two, other wise you may want to skip it. I really enjoyed the Swedish show Äkta människor, or Real Humans. They called the robots, Hubots, which is such a great name.
That show had humor, relationships and many fun and interesting elements. It was a great scifi show and was quite clever. This version, called Humans decided to go much darker and of course they have to go all political full steam for season three. Not the least bit humorous, and very dark. Humans are basically POS, who are full of hate and are not giving the syths a chance to evolve and have feelings... We are keeping them in enslavement type of dreary camps and turning off their electricity so they cannot recharge.
Humans are mean bigots keeping the good synths ( re:ISIS and Immigrants down).
Even though when a human released the synths to have feelings and be independent over 100,000 people died. But hey, oh well. Humans still suck in this show. We are terrible and just do not get them. Way to totally ruin a great concept. I am sure the original writer of this show in Sweden is hating it. I saw him interviewed and he was not pleased with the first season of this show. I am sure he would hate this 3rd one. Dark, dreary and no thank you to the preachy tone the writers have taken. Not an ounce of subtlety and ever so politically correct. Ugh! I do not think it was renewed for another season. They shot themselves in the foot with their politically charged preaching and agenda.",/review/rw3501651/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2015,ChristyLeskovar,9," Very promising
","Normally I wouldn't recommend a show after only the first episode, I'd wait until it was over. But this new series has the makings of another well-done morality play. Not many of those these days. It's ""Frankenstein"" meets ""Fahrenheit 451"" meets ""The Boys from Brazil."" Lesson–just because we can do something, doesn't mean it's a wise thing to do. The perils can be legion and often unpredictable. The story begins with an overwrought dad buying a synth, which is a synthetic human, to be their housekeeper. His wife is none too pleased when she comes back from her business trip. He is played by Tom Goodman-Hill (Mr Grove on ""Mr Selfridge""). His wife is played by Katherine Parkinson (Pauline on ""Doc Martin""). William Hurt plays an older man who can't come to grips with the fact that his synth, whom he treats like a son, is wearing out. You'll want to watch it in order. It's a tele-novel. Catch up with On Demand or online. I find that with AMC shows, if you watch the airing prior to 10pm, it is cleaned up as far as language, nudity, etc, if there is any.",/review/rw3501651/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2019,jasmits,9," Not into scifi, but love it
","Normally I am not into the scifi genre, but Humans is one of a kind. It's not the storyline (although okay) and not the human characters (okay too, Mattie in particular), it's the characters of the synths that make it special and lovable. One synth stands out for me, and that's Odi. His kind and fragile personality earns an Oscar.",/review/rw3501651/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2015,quincytheodore,8," Pleasant greeting from synthetic personal assistant
","The concept of AI self-discovery has been employed in many sci-fi mediums, especially in recent time. Humans succeeds in individualizing itself simply with good presentation of modern world and credible acting. It also doesn't fear of exposing the awkward attachment or slightly perverse applications of these humanoid, yet still presented in sophisticated fashion.",/review/rw3501651/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2015,deloudelouvain,8," Artificial intelligence isn't that good
","Just finished watching the first season of Humans in three days. A nice refreshing science fiction drama that makes you think if we should continue with artificial intelligence. Because one day this might become reality. And that day will be the end of many things and the beginning of many other things and for sure not all better things. The series is really enjoyable to watch. Not a difficult story to understand, like it is sometimes with some Sci-fi. All actors are good in their roles, even though I hate the son of that family. Other then that if you enjoy a little bit of sci-fi then this show is certainly worth a watch. Looking forward to the second season.",/review/rw3501651/?ref_=tt_urv
