","This movie made a fuss when it came out because there were claims that its author had lied about it being ""based on a true story."" As a result it become a sort of infamous title and people cared less about the film's content and more about its ""accuracies.""",/review/rw6136961/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2005,rbverhoef,8," Good
","'Sleepers' is a good film, existing out of two parts. The first part is a drama that involves four young teenagers in the sixties, Hell's Kitchen, New York. They make a stupid mistake that sends them to a reformatory, the Wilkinson home for boys. Here they are sexually abused by the guards including Sean Nokes (Kevin Bacon). The second parts is about the revenge the four boys have when they are grown up. If you do not want to know what they're plan is, read no further.",/review/rw6136961/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2000,eibon09,," The Sleeper of 1996
",Sleeper(1996) is a deeply emotional and brilliant film that was overlooked in 1996.  It deals with the past and how events from the past can be instrumential in shaping the present.  The movie was very controversial due to the subject matter.  I believe that one reason that Sleepers(1996) didn't get the praise it deserved is the film deals with things that were already present in Mean Streets(1973) and Once Upon a Time in America(1984).  The first half of the feature reminds me a lot of the flash back sequences from Once Upon a Time in America(1984).  Brad Pitt gives what I see as the best performance of his life.  What I also like about Sleepers(1996) is that it puts together two of the best actors of their genreation in Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro.,/review/rw6136961/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2005,Andreas_N,10," Hell's Kitchen's legacy
","A classic. The story is complex and very sophisticated. The cast is sheer brilliant and hardly to surpass. Here we get first-class entertainment in combination with suspense and a variety of themes that are fairly well known to anyone, just as revenge, justice, murder, abuse, atonement etc. The kids do a fine job, really. They add tremendous depth to the deeds and to the behave of the grown ups. Their genuine and sure-handed performances grant the movie a considerable amount of emotional recognition and chain anyone who soaks up and identifies with the storyline and the characters. The very end closes the circle and makes us aware of how quickly our lives can fall apart. Thrilling and suspense is guaranteed. Very recommendable.",/review/rw6136961/?ref_=tt_urv

22 September 1999,SKG-2,7," Last third makes it worthwhile
","Like the controversial book, the movie SLEEPERS is divided into three parts; before reform school, during, and after.  But whereas the parts in the book all worked together into a satisfying(albeit disturbing) whole, the movie only really catches fire in the last third, which is enough to recommend it. Before I get to why, regarding on whether it really happened; that's irrelevant.  It could have happened.",/review/rw6136961/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2013,moosish,7," SPOILER ALERT! Very good film, BUT....
","This film is very well done, of course, being in the capable hands of Barry Levinson and a fantastic cast. I was pulled into it 100% until the trial. I find it not only hard to believe, but IMPOSSIBLE to believe, that any lawyer, under ANY circumstances, could ever have gotten the prison guard/witness/friend/co-worker of the murder victim to admit to the abuses that he committed (along with the murder victim) while a guard at the reform school. In my opinion, anyone as callous and cold-hearted as he was, as a multi-repeater rapist and torturer of children, wouldn't have even a shred of humanity left wherein he could be made to feel guilty in a court room. So that's where this movie fell apart for me.",/review/rw6136961/?ref_=tt_urv

","If you're able to to turn a blind eye to the implausibility of the end, or instead see it as an interpretation of the lengths people will to go to for justice when the system has let them down then, coupled with the very realistic and believable earlier parts of the story, you have a very sad but not uncommon tale centred on abuse, with outstanding performances all round and a genuine reason to take a blood pressure pill to calm yourself down.",/review/rw6136961/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2019,Anttell,6," A mixed bag
","The first half of the film is really strong and the scene that serves as the transition to the second half (the bar scene) is fantastic. I felt that the the latter half as a whole was a bit of a bubble though: there is a lot of The Count of Monte Cristo (the book that is referenced in the film a lot, check it out if you haven't) -esque revenge build-up but the payoff is a disappointment. For me, there were also slight pacing issues towards the end, along with some tonal choices I wasn't a fan of. Still, I'd say it's a fairly recommendable drama.",/review/rw6136961/?ref_=tt_urv

29 July 2000,MartPol,6," Interesting but uneven
","The first hour of Sleepers is highly impressive, with the account of the protagonists' fall into the hands of their oppressors and the subsequent atrocities dealt with very well. The images of what happens to the boys are sensational but realistic, avoiding, except at one key point, the kind of triumphal uprising-against-the-system plot line that normally takes over. Here there are no heroes and no courage - just blunt brutality.",/review/rw6136961/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2011,eonbluedan-1,10," Overlooked perfection
","A well-adapted, epic story of the childhood innocence of four boys brutally snatched away, and the subsequent revenge that took place so many years later. Perfectly paced, it is a long film whose length is never an issue; exciting courtroom drama, realistic sense of time and place, gritty yet sleek cinematography, and convincing performances from a cast that is actually to die for: Jason Patrick, Billy Crudup (""Big Fish"") Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro, Kevin Bacon, Minnie Driver and Brad Pitt in the same movie; it is a rare lineup. This is not to mention the young leads, who are completely convincing in heavyweight roles. ",/review/rw6136961/?ref_=tt_urv

19 January 2011,Wrapper30,8," All star cast does not disappoint
","This is one of the only films that I can watch time after time and still be highly entertained. The film has many layers and a great cast of fantastic actors. It also has a wealth of superbly drawn minor characters. Bruno Krby is excellent as always as Shakes' dad. A man apparently typical of the community in Hells Kitchen. Proud but ruling his wife in particular with a iron fist. He is portrayed far more favourably than in the book where it is clear he is a lousy father and husband. But it is the ever excellent Kevin Bacon who threatens to steal the show as the deeply disturbing Sean Nokes. He is pivotal to the 4 boys descent in to hell and his evil in the bar scene where he meets his demise sets the wheels in motion for the revenge in the 3rd part of the movie. De Niro is superb as always but has great support in Brad Pitt, Jason Patric, Minnie Driver and Dustin Hoffman. A Must see if you like films of this genre.",/review/rw6136961/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2021,gianmarcocibella,6," Good movie about revenge, but don't expect Count of Montecristo
","Before watching this movie i was very excited, after all you don't find a movie with a cast like this every day. Robert De Niro, Brad Pitt, Dustin Hoffman and Kevin Bacon. So you would understand my disappointment when my biggest surprise was not the great plan being perfectly executed. My biggest surprise was that the biggest fault of this film was the acting. WHAT A WASTE OF CAST. Dear good, all this oscar winning legends put together and not a single remarkable acting in the whole movie. They gave the worst characters to them and the better ones to a bunch of nobody's. You realize this when a movie about innocent kids being raped, tortured and mentally disturbed for life do not deliver enough emotion. Of course i felt bad for the kids, but with this cast and this story there should have been tears dropping Down my face and oscar nomitations. This could have been easily a cult movie, instead is a pretty decent movie i'll forget in a few weeks.",/review/rw6136961/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2003,paul2001sw-1,7," Half-awake
","Levinson's Sleepers is a conventional but well-structured thriller, with the confidence to tell its story in three separate chapters, letting each element stand unhysterically on its own: it works as a story, not just as a plot. It even attempts a subtle ending, but somehow there's no real kick at the end. The problem here is the dignified integrity with which the film invests its heroes, something often seen in cinema but rarely in the messiness of real life. The accused in trial are both victims and murderers; but the film plays down the second element, and thereby squanders the inherent ambiguity of the scenario. As the darkness of the ""good guys"" is allowed to pass unnoticed, they fail to accumulate sufficient weight of character to make the ending count. Highly watchable, but it doesn't quite add up to the sum of its parts.",/review/rw6136961/?ref_=tt_urv

18 January 2000,blueice,8," Outstanding
","This movie is one of the best movies made in a long time.  Previous comments seem to focus more on whether or not the story is true and seem to forget the phenomenal story.  Who cares if the story is true or not?  If it is, it only makes the movie that much more disturbing and heart-breaking.  What is the big deal if it is or isn't true?  It is still an amazing movie with a great story.  Most so-called ""classics"" are not based on true stories, so what makes this movie any different?  OK, now that I have said my peace about my feelings about the authenticity of the story, I can now comment on the actual movie.  I can not say enough positive things about the movie. The actors are perfectly casted.  I think every single one of them do an outstanding job in their portrayal.  The story is heart-wrenching and it does an excellent job of getting its point across without showing or saying too much.  This movie deserves more than it got.",/review/rw6136961/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2003,=G=,6," Overkill
","""Sleepers"" is about four boys who grow up in Hell's Kitchen, get sent to reform school, are abused by the guards, and seek revenge as adults. The film offers a good cast with all the trimmings but falls apart in story. It has plenty of 1970-80's pop songs for those who can get nostalgic over them. It has a tease at front and back ends for conspiracy theorists claiming its preposterous story in true. However, it runs too long, gets too convoluted, and is sorely lacking in credibility raising more questions than it answers. For those who find the subject interesting and can tough out a long film with brain disengaged a good watch awaits. All others may want to think twice before committing to this long winded Hollywood-by-the-book tale. (B-)",/review/rw6136961/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2010,moonspinner55,6," Obviously a worthwhile story enacted by a fantastic cast...but still not an easy film to like
","Director Barry Levinson also adapted Lorenzo Carcaterra's allegedly factual memoir about four rambunctious boys from Hell's Kitchen on the west-end of Manhattan in the late 1950s. The youngsters are incarcerated into a boys' detention home for 18 months after a prank on a hot dog vendor goes horribly wrong; there, they are molested regularly by a group of guards, and twenty years later two of the kids--now hell-raising adults--get their revenge by shooting the most vicious guard to death in a restaurant. The way the plot plays out, with a genuinely original take on the whole courtroom procedure, is rather brilliant...yet, on the other hand, the details of this story make the film difficult to wade through, and Levinson's style (flashing back to the attacks in blue-tinted staccato takes) is off-putting. Worse, Levinson's dialogue is occasionally thick with writer's ink--no actor could make it sound convincing--while short-cut tricks such as the use of narration over important footage falls flat. Imagine this story as told by a stronger filmmaker, say Martin Scorsese. ""Sleepers"" is too locked-in as being a 'prestigious epic'; somehow, the sweep of the narrative never catches fire, and it's never as moving as it is meant to be. There are still several very good sequences here nevertheless, and many of the actors (particularly Dustin Hoffman as an untried defense lawyer and Robert De Niro as a buddy priest) are excellent. **1/2 from ****",/review/rw6136961/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2003,MovieAddict2016,," Disturbing, powerful, but lacking a certain something.
","Disturbing drama about four kids sent to a juvenile jail where they were sexually abused, only for them to grow into men years later and seek vengeance on the man (Kevin Bacon) who abused them. A good effort on all accounts, but the film falls apart somewhere in the second half, and seems a bit too bent on making the audience cringe during flashbacks than really trust the story as it sits. Robert De Niro seems a bit held back as a priest, while Brad Pitt and Dustin Hoffman surprisingly hold one's interest more than anyone else.",/review/rw6136961/?ref_=tt_urv
