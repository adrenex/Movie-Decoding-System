2 September 2022,basementbrotherscollectibles,1," This She-Hulk is not Sensational
","1/5 stars. I have all of the She-Hulk comic runs from Savage She-Hulk #1 to the present day run currently sold in your comic shops at the time this Disney+ show released. She is one of my favorite Marvel women and ought to be treated with high respect while having a lot of fun. But the MCU failed to capture the charm, fun, and heart of the lovely green lawyer from the comics. This show suffers from the same problems that the MCU Phase 4 has...it doesn't know what it wants to be, it has rejected its former audience that made it an epic success for an entirely imagined one instead, and it doesn't know where it is going. Specifically in She-Hulk: Attorney-at-Law's case, it did not flesh out the characters well-enough to make the audience care. Who are these supporting cast members? Why are they so one-dimensional? Why should I care? Where are all the actual jokes? The parts where Jen is actually trying to be a lawyer for superheroes or talking in a court scene are the funniest, but in too many other areas it tries too hard to be funny. Some people will watch this show and never laugh even where it is trying to tell a joke, which is rough because this is supposed to be a comedy. It is too bad the insecurities of the writers were projected into Jen Walters. While the pot shots and zingers may make them feel vindicated in this world, it will most likely turn off audience members or just make them roll their eyes. The best advice I could give is remember and respect your audience, respect your characters, make things interesting, know where to start, go, and stop, and finally have some fun. This could've been great but sadly it is forgettable. Most people will struggle to watch through all the episodes once, and very few will ever re-watch them.",/review/rw8614847/?ref_=tt_urv

26 August 2022,mfeierskov,4," It's not unwatchable, it's just not good
","Look, all the people giving the show 1 star reviews, because of some comment about cat calling in the first episode, don't really get to the heart of the problem. Can we please just get one of the terrible Marvel shows with a straight white male lead, so we can shut up about people hating women or people with dark skin?",/review/rw8614847/?ref_=tt_urv

","I knew it couldn't be good, I saw the impressions & ratings, I read all the available reviews, I felt it in my ""blood"" to be a deception, but I was half-wrong with the balance plate heading and converging toward a shaky 4.",/review/rw8614847/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2022,jehoshuaphat,5," Balance
","After almost 60 years of collecting comic books, I've learned to appreciate superhero comics that are just flat out funny. I bought She Hulk, when I was younger, because I expected more of 'Hulk smash!', but I got something more. A main character that realized the absurdity of its fantastical premise and was able to discuss just that overblown concept with the reader (Long before Deadpool). This, without any spoilers, is what this show delivers, along with some flat out laughs.",/review/rw8614847/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2022,AfricanBro,5," Poor first impression
","This isn't bad I just don't like the premise and who they made the hulk into; he went from being one of the most feared, unpredictable and strongest in the mcu to now being a laughing stock. And in she-hulk, based on the first episode at least, it feels like they're trying to tick off boxes while they're at it. I'd like to see the chaos that'd unfold if Marvel or DC changed or brought a male version of a renowned female hero like Wonder Woman or a Valkyrie. All hulk is used for here is being trashed to pump up she-hulk, and he's been kept as ""smart hulk"" for such a long time even though it's short lived in the comics. Like really hulk couldn't stop a car that's not even coming at speed, really?! Anyway, if you wanna make a strong female hero, just simply make her strong. I feel like it's more credible to see her kicking butt and people liking that. If you have to degrade somebody in order to pump up a someone it takes it away. Just create a bad^ss character instead like Captain marvel, Katniss Everdeen in 'The Hunger Games', Letty Ortiz in 'Fast and furious', Lara Croft, or kill bill. You don't have to make her Mary Sue.",/review/rw8614847/?ref_=tt_urv

",I started out disliking the show but it's grown on me. It's light and not serious. It's entertaining for what it is. Tatiana Maslany is great in the role.,/review/rw8614847/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2022,revchristodd-138-985726,8," Hilarious!
","Unlike DC, which seems to have a standard inviolable template for telling a superhero story, Marvel continues to play with various genres and so make much more entertaining movies and shows. She-Hulk, Attorney at Law, is a hilarious take on the reluctant superhero trope. She is not traumatized nor does she have a savior complex. She just wants to get on with her life and career. And a lot of the fun of the pilot is that Bruce kinda resents this and how easy the transition to a Hulk is. If you don't have a fragile ideology or a rigid commitment to the ""Canon of the Printed Comic"" you will love this. And Tatania is the perfect actress for the role!",/review/rw8614847/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2022,DarkVulcan29,8," Not quite bad as I thought
","I started watching the first episode feeling this is gonna sink, cause in the past I've never really like the She Hulk character, and it's not because she's a woman, it's because she always came across has an annoying parody of her male counterpart.",/review/rw8614847/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2022,Anurag-Shetty,9," A fun show but, not flawless.

20 August 2022,Tastentier,8," Still needs to find its footing but it's off to a decent start
","A legal comedy with superhero elements that is not only told from a female perspective but actually written and directed by women is a bold new direction for Marvel. Of course it'll take a few episodes for this show to hit all the right notes, especially with an episode length of 30 minutes that doesn't allow for a lot of plot development. But the first episode wasn't bad at all and I'm confident they'll work out the minor kinks.",/review/rw8614847/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,thisisstepercival,7," I like it.
","There seems to be a lot of negativity around She-Hulk and I'm not sure why? It's fun, it's goofy and it's pretty entertaining. Obviously being from Marvel the production values are high but it's a tv show so you can't expect the bar to be as high as an Avengers movie.",/review/rw8614847/?ref_=tt_urv

27 August 2022,tarwaterthomas,8," I am a conservative through and through.....
",".....and so far this reviewer has enjoyed SHE-HULK: ATTORNEY AT LAW. Tatiana Maslany nails it as aspiring assistant district attorney Jennifer Walters who's hitching a ride with her favorite cousin Bruce Banner (welcome back, Mark Ruffalo) in his sports utility vehicle in the mountains of Mexico when a close encounter with a flying saucer from outer space forces them off a road and into a forest. They survive the crash, and his green blood seeps into her open wound, with the result that she transforms into a huge 6-foot-7-inch green-skinned giantess. Now it's up to Bruce to teach Jennifer how to Hulk with finesse and grace. She winds up teaching him a few things, of course, and they get into a physical altercation that becomes a visual effects workout. Our heroine returns to the Big Apple to try her case in court, but winds up fighting super-strong villainess Titania (Jameela Jamil) and winning. But that gets her fired from the DA's office. Repeated attempts to secure employment end in failure. But she is hired by the prestigious law firm of Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg, and Goodman in the person of big-shot attorney Holden Holliway (Steve Coulter), who happens to be a senior partner. Jennifer gets a corner office with a spectacular view of the city and her best friend Nikki Ramos (Ginger Gonzaga), who's a paralegal. Only thing is, Jennifer has to defend the notorious Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), also known as the Abomination who duked it out with that green-skinned giant in THE INCREDIBLE HULK (2008). And she has to do it as the She-Hulk. Whether Jennifer Walters wants it or not, she is destined to be s super heroine. Especially when the Abomination busts out of prison and is seen fighting at a mixed martial arts tournament. Welcome back Mark-Linn Baker (PERFECT STRANGERS) as Jennifer's dear old dad. To Kevin Feige, here's some advice: you have a good show on your hands. Don't blow it.",/review/rw8614847/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2022,sajmonh,8," Does the world hate fun?
","Honestly I think everyone who talks bad about this show just simply hates fun. It's on the nose. Meta. It's supposed to be like this. I think it inherits the spirit of the successful comic book run, and it doesn't have to be so much in line with the other titles in the MCU.",/review/rw8614847/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2022,mattbrady67,6," I really thought I'd hate this..
","But it's honestly not bad. Only one episode in, but it had its moments. The cgi wasn't near as bad as the trailers made it look. I didn't find myself staring at her face cringing like I did before so good on them for fixing it. Some of the jokes landed and some didn't, but I think a lot of them were in the trailers so maybe that's why. I thought her automatically being better at everything than Bruce without any real explanation other than ""girl power"" was kinda lame, and relying on the whole ""men are the devil and keeping us women down"" was unnecessary. Should be able to write a female led show without having to rely on those tropes, so here's hoping it's not constantly present during the whole series. I did like the moments of Bruce talking about Tony and filling in some of the stuff they left out about smart hulk. All in all I was surprised I enjoyed it as much as I did, but it definitely has room for improvement. Also, make sure to stay for the after credits, only time I actually laughed out loud was when they cut right before she finished her line.",/review/rw8614847/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2022,bdon-guma,6," Not terrible, not great, but still clearly lacking
","Great choice in casting so far as Tatiana gracefully places herself in the shoes of Jennifer Walters. She delivers the material in a way that fits neatly in the mold of the MCU. That said, the writing is where the show is lacking. In the first episode we get a chance to see how JW deals with becoming She-Hulk, except we never see her have to deal with anything. Instead, we are presented with a montage of her training with the ultimate conclusion being that she is simply naturally more capable. This explanation is acceptable because it is a TV show and her background needed to be quickly established; however, it was done so in a way that completely undermined the effort that Bruce had to put over the course of 15+ years to control his hulk powers. His entire growth arc was effectively thrown away in one 40 minute episode. Although it meant to comedic, it was unnecessary for the overall message.",/review/rw8614847/?ref_=tt_urv

18 January 2023,DiCaprioFan13,6," The first Marvel comedy
","I'm a huge fan of Marvel so I always look forward to everything they do and so She-Hulk: Attorney at Law was no different. After just finishing it I can say I actually enjoyed it. It's different than most Marvel shows or movies as this is a comedy but that doesn't make it bad, just different. It's probably my least favorite, this or Ms. Marvel, but that's only because I love the other shows so much...not because this is bad. I don't understand some of these negative reviews. What did you expect and not get? Did you not watch the trailers or read the reviews? You knew it was a comedy going in. Tatiana Maslany does a great job as She-Hulk/Jennifer Walters. It wouldn't be the same with another actress. I also loved all the cameos from Hulk/Bruce Banner, Daredevil, Wong, Abomination, etc. Don't let the negative reviews deter you from watching this, if you're a Marvel fan then watch this.",/review/rw8614847/?ref_=tt_urv
