2 June 2013,AvidClimber,9," Burn After Reading â€” What if you believed you were in a spy movie?
",Burn After Reading is a weird movie. It takes everything that makes a good spy flick and turn it on its head. You can't help but incredulously laugh at what happens. This is all about oddballs.,/review/rw1946164/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2019,UniqueParticle,9," John Malkovich is the best thing about this!
","This is one of the best dark comedies ever made! There is only one thing that rubs me the wrong way and I won't spoil that otherwise I love this Coen brothers quirky masterpiece. I originally saw this in the theater, that was fun, I still can't believe it's been 11 years now since 08. So beyond well written and very cool camera shots; Burn After Reading makes me feel so damn good! Also I absolutely love the music and excessive use of profanity!",/review/rw1946164/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2008,ametaphysicalshark,," The Coens' funniest film since ""The Big Lebowski""
","I'm not the only one to notice the pattern in the Coens' filmography: ""Blood Simple."" was followed by ""Raising Arizona"", ""Fargo"" by ""The Big Lebowski"", and ""No Country for Old Men"" by ""Burn After Reading"". The main concern one had about this film is whether it would be an ""Intolerable Cruelty"" or a ""Big Lebowski"" for the Coens. Let's put it this way: the reviews have been mixed, especially from major mainstream media critics. Guess what other Coen comedy received mixed reviews and was accused of being a somewhat tired mess? Yep, ""The Big Lebowski"".",/review/rw1946164/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2021,jeffstonewords,9," Wacky and wonderful gallows humor
","Darkly irreverent and irresistible, these quirky characters range from the blissfully greedy to the incorrigibly irascible while blindly following their predilections to inevitably ruinous destinations but they do so in a remarkably indelible fashion. This film breaks the rules with extraordinary glee.",/review/rw1946164/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2008,tomrito,9," Very funny adult comedy
","The point here is that this movie is for adults, with adult themes and adult situations. As with all Coen brother movies, there are going to be people who love it and people that hate it. There doesn't seem to be much middle ground. I loved this movie. It was entertaining, dark and very funny. I really liked ""No Country for Old Men"" but I have to say, ""Burn After Reading"" was a more enjoyable film for me. Some of the reviews here have said that the film rambles around pointlessly, without any clear direction; well I have to disagree, if you are paying attention and you are an adult, you should have no problem understanding what is going on. The best part of the movie is watching this great cast perform brilliantly with the odd-ball material they are given. They are all straight men for the Coen brother's antics. There is violence, bad language, and everyone is sleeping with everyone else, especially George Clooney. But the movie is very funny and while the rest of Hollywood seems to have lost there way, the Coen brothers continue to put out intelligent, entertaining and thought provoking material.",/review/rw1946164/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2009,dbborroughs,5," It didn't work for me
","Wacky Coen Brothers film that should on the page work, but in actuality falls flat. The story is about John Malkovich a disgruntled CIA agent who quit in order to write his memoirs. The disc is lost and it becomes a scramble between a bunch of twits in order to get their hands on the information contained with in. Well acted, well written the film falls flat because however the Coens put the film together it drains the humor out of the situations. I mean there were things that made me laugh in the trailer that just sort of washed over me with out a ripple in the film. I have no idea what happened. Its good after a fashion and better than the things like The Lady Killers, but its still not say Lebowski or one of their lesser films.",/review/rw1946164/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2008,Galina_movie_fan,9," The Coen Brothers don't make bad movies - they don't know how :)
","After their Oscar winning turn last year, The Coen Brothers are back with the new film, this time comedy/crime/spy story which is very funny, very dark, quite angry, at times surreal, always ironic and to put it simply a must see for any Coens' fan which means a fan of great movie making. Comparing to the last year's Oscar Winner, No Country for Old Men, their new film may seem much lighter and provides many laughs. But keep in mind, it is comedy: Coens' style and it means that not always the most likable characters get what they look for. As much as the film is funny, it actually paints very disturbing picture about stupidly, idiocy, incompetence, inability to see one step ahead of your actions that keep filling every aspect of our existence with dangerous speed. I loved it - from the very first scene to the end. I laughed a lot, enjoyed the dialogs and the acting. How could I not with the dream cast that include John Malkovich, Tilda Swinton, George Clooney, Francis McDormand, and very funny and deliciously clueless, Brad Pitt, and many familiar faces in the small cameos. George Clooney who has made three films with The Coens got the funniest scenes, and gave IMO one of his best performances. John Malkovich has got to come out of his semi-retirement and act more. His every appearance in the film as forced to quit his job, very angry CIA Analyst who then decided to write a memoir, was a blast. Tilda Swinton as an arrogant icy cold professional woman, and Frances MacDormand as Linda who would stop at nothing in order to ""re-invent herself"", both added to the film's multiple delights.",/review/rw1946164/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2008,massimo-pigliucci,7," not their best, but pleasurable nonetheless
","This is by far not the most interesting production by the Cohens, but it is worth watching on a variety of levels. First, there is the pleasure of seeing a bunch of good actors working together with great chemistry, some of them (like Pitt and Clooney) certainly not in their ""traditional"" roles. Second, the story is actually wacky enough to hold up in terms of internal logic, as strange as it may seem. As usual with the brothers, do expect some unexpected turns, of the violent variety. And yet, somehow, the movie retains the character of a light comedy. Pay particular attention to the very last words spoken in the film, they may be the best summary of the whole thing I've heard so far.",/review/rw1946164/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2008,zardoz-13,1," Ham-Fisted Performances, Poor Plotting, Labored Jokes, and Sudden Lapses of Violence
","""No Country for Old Men"" directors Joel and Ethan Coen's uneven, overwrought, misanthropic comedy of errors ""Burn After Reading"" should have been burned after they made it. Remember, the Coen Brothers won the 2008 Best Picture Oscar for their inspired but violent account of an indestructible hit-man who methodically tracked down his victims and killed them without a qualm. As their first feature since ""No Country for Old Men, ""Burn After Reading"" radiates barely a modicum of the customary Coen luminosity. The fourteenth movie that the two brothers have helmed together struggles to be as side-splitting as either ""The Big Lebowski"" or ""Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou."" Instead, this forgettable farce turns out to be as mirthless as two previous Coen misfires ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" and ""Intolerable Cruelty."" ""Burn After Reading"" opens like a Tom Clancy techno-thriller. An orbiting spy satellite camera zooms into the Chesapeake Bay area on the East Coast, penetrates the cloud cover and pinpoints C.I.A. Headquarters in Langley, Virginia. A bow-tied, bald-headed, Princeton-educated, career C.I.A. analyst, Osborne 'Ozzie' Cox (John Malkovich of ""Being John Malkovich""), explodes with rage when his boss (David Rasche of ""An Innocent Man"") relieves him of his duties on the Balkans desk and shuffles him off to a lower security grade State Department post. The volatile Cox spews profanity when his colleagues attribute his inferior job performance to alcoholism. Cox quits the C.I.A. rather than being reassigned. As he storms out of the room, he vows to pen a tell-all memoir. Later, every time we see Ozzie working on his memoirs, he clutches a drink in his fist.",/review/rw1946164/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2008,katiemeyer1979,8," A Bright American Farce
","Nobody is quite there in this new bright farce by the Coen brothers. The plot is a smart excuse for a movie about nothing but appearing to be about a lot of things. Going backwards and forwards at the same time. Talk about ""The Russians?"" or planning to write a memoir. Brad Pitt is priceless and the innocence of his character is so believable that I wondered how many more surprises this actor has up his sleeve. He is a joy. George Clooney is also terrific and the Coens move through their crossed purposes with speed and elegance. I was totally immerse in their universe even if I didn't quite care what was going on. John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, Richard Jenkins and the unnerving Tilda Swinton complete the package of this movie that feels as if it was made for the sheer pleasure of it.",/review/rw1946164/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2008,gary-444,9," An Intelligent. Quirky, Surreal Delight
","This film will not be to everyones taste, and I wholly understand the polarised responses.A star studded cast enjoy a knowing, wordy script, where dialogue counts, a Coen brothers trademark.However not very much happens, and the narrative is disjointed, so the pace of the story is very staccato.But once again the result is something very wide of the Hollywood mainstream and is all the more satisfying for it.",/review/rw1946164/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2009,planktonrules,5," Well made but it felt incredibly detached.
","This was an odd film--and I don't mean this in a favorable way. That's because unlike most Coen Brothers movies I have seen, I felt almost nothing favorable towards any of the characters and it all just seemed very detached and, at times, uninteresting. While I can respect the intricacy of the plot and the good acting, I just felt like I could not have cared less about the movie and could have just as easily turned it off and not finish it. In fact, had it not been a Coen Brothers film, I probably would have done just that. Fortunately, the movie did get a little better towards the end, but not enough to make the time I invested in it worth the payoff.",/review/rw1946164/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2020,ethanbresnett,9," Superbly ludicrous!
","Nobody does farce like the Coen Brothers. Any fans of their work will be huge fans of Burn After Reading. The script is everything you could want from a Coen Brothers film, with this sitting alongside the likes of Fargo and The Big Lebowski in terms of tone and style. I won't describe the plot as its so fun and bizarre that its best to go in cold and just experience it. Suffice to say though that it is hugely entertaining, with great twists and turns and a fabulous set of eclectic characters. The Coen's really excel when it comes to crafting fantastical characters and plots, and this is no exception. The film flows so well, has so many quirks and strokes of genius, it really is fantastic.",/review/rw1946164/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2009,Bolesroor,1," Burn Before Watching
","The Coen Brothers' ""Burn After Reading"" is a movie so thoughtless, so arrogant, and so poorly executed that it has forced me to re-consider my opinion of their previous films and seriously raised the question of whether they've been frauds all along.",/review/rw1946164/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2010,DarthVoorhees,1," The Coen's Bastard Film
","Inevitably an excellent filmmaker or in Joel and Ethan's case, filmmakers will make a bad film. Joel and Ethan have enjoyed so much success and have made so many great films that they would be allowed a poor film. 'Burn After Reading' shook my faith in the Coen Brothers whom I greatly admire. It isn't just bad it's jaw droopingly awful. It's 'I want my rental fee back' bad. It's maybe I forget 'Big Lebowski' or 'O, Brother Where Art Thou?' and skip your next comedy bad. Skip this film at all costs. Forget the name Coen is on the box, because the Joel and Ethan Coen I've seen must have shut themselves off when they made this piece of work.",/review/rw1946164/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2008,Quinoa1984,10," ""So, what have we learned?"" well, the Coens know convoluted/cracked comedy for one
","And casting, let's not forget that. The Coen brothers, usually writing with specific actors in mind, have placed some of Hollywood's biggest and some of the plain best actors around in parts in Burn After Reading that test them to how far they can take the material before it spontaneously combusts. Maybe it does. While their film does start a little slow, if not too much so, their plot soon requires all of the actors- some Coen regulars big and small, some new- to act stupid, angry, confused, wacko, desperate, going nuts, and generally in characteristic form of a Coen comedy, which is far and beyond a distinct step above a lot of other zany/dark comedies. Thankfully, they all meet the challenge.",/review/rw1946164/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2019,jackgdemoss,8," Maintained a dark comedy feel even through the darkest parts
","Burn After Reading is my first run in with the Coen brothers, so I am completely unfamiliar with their style. What they seemed to have on their side from the get go was a rockstar cast filling all lead and character roles. Even some of the unknowns gave fiery performances. This film felt most similar to Requiem for a Dream both in theme and story-telling. I look forward to catching up on more Coen films in the future.",/review/rw1946164/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2008,janos451,8," Tonight We Laugh
","Norman Cousins would have loved the Coen Brothers' ""Burn After Reading."" The late great Saturday Review editor had treated his illness with Marx Brothers movies, having ""made the joyous discovery that 10 minutes of genuine belly laughter had an anesthetic effect and would give me at least two hours of pain-free sleep.""",/review/rw1946164/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2008,Monotreme02,8," Not what I expected: dark, over-the-top, hilarious but surprisingly poignant
","The Coen Brothers are an interesting pair, there's no doubt about that. Just as they did back in the 1980's with their debut and sophomore films, the Coens chose to follow up their most heavy-handed and serious film since Blood Simple, No Country for Old Men, with a nutty, over-the-top screwball black comedy. But unlike their second film, Raising Arizona, the Coens deliver Burn After Reading with a kind of newfound cynicism attached to it; it's funny, but it's also surprisingly dark and sad, and even poignant to some extent.",/review/rw1946164/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2018,Ed-Shullivan,10," Brad Pitt should do more comedy like his role in Burn After Reading
",Mrs. Shullivan and I saw this movie when it was first released ten years ago. In fact we sat through the film twice because we were 10 minutes late and missed the beginning and boy were we glad we stayed and watched it a second time. This comedy/crime/suspense film is such a classic with the comedy style presented by both Brad Pitt and his buddy George Clooney. This is another Cohen brother film release so one does know what to expect (somewhat) with the Cohen brothers. ,/review/rw1946164/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2008,neil-476,6," Another Coen private joke
","I have had mixed feelings about the Coen brothers for some time. For me, their movies fall into two distinct categories. There are those which I have enjoyed - Fargo, Lebowski. And there are those where I have felt that a good idea has become inaccessible to the audience (ie. me) because it is excessively dressed up in the brothers' private sense of humour (Hudsucker, O Brother).",/review/rw1946164/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2021,Holt344,8," Burn after Reading is the Coen brothers at their craziest, which means black comedy at its finest and an original story
","The Coen brothers does it again, a great and original black comedy-crime film. Burn after Reading is brilliantly written, extremely funny and masterfully directed. The film is written, produced, edited and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen. The story follows a recently jobless CIA analyst, Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich) whose misplaced memoirs are found by a pair of dimwitted gym employees (Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt). When they mistake the memoirs for classified government documents, they undergo a series of misadventures in an attempt to profit from their find. The film also stars George Clooney as a womanizing U. S. Marshal, Tilda Swinton as Katie Cox, the wife of Osbourne Cox, Richard Jenkins as the gym manager, and J. K. Simmons as a CIA supervisor.",/review/rw1946164/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2009,edwagreen,1," Burn After Reading Should Have Been Burned Before Viewing 0*
","The Coen Brothers are always known for their quirky films. I didn't like ""Fargo,"" nor ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" Guess what? I didn't like this absolute stinker as well.",/review/rw1946164/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2008,Buddy-51,7," not their best but still very funny
","""Burn After Reading"" shows what happens when a couple of bungling amateurs attempt to beat the big boys of the C.I.A. at their own game.",/review/rw1946164/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2008,zetes,8," Very weak for the Coens
","I was kind of hoping for another brilliant one-two punch after No Country for Old Men, like Fargo and The Big Lebowski, but Burn After Reading has the feel of being written and made quickly and without much refining. Structurally, it's most like Lebowski, in that it's about a bunch of people mixed up in stuff that is beyond them, mostly nobodies finding themselves in a convoluted spy plot. The joke is that no one really knows that it's all much ado about nothing. The story has Frances MacDormand and Brad Pitt finding a CD with what they think is sensitive information on it. They think they can blackmail John Malkovich, to whom they believe the CD belongs. Meanwhile, George Clooney is screwing around with both Malkovich's wife, Tilda Swinton, and MacDormand, while being married to another woman entirely. Unlike Lebowski, Burn After Reading never bothered to involve me, or be very funny, for that matter. Brad Pitt is the only one who really gets laughs. His meeting with Malkovich, most of which you'll have seen in the commercials, was pretty great. Besides the goofy plot, there's nothing here even resembling the Coen Brothers; no stylish cinematography, little repeatable dialogue. Even Carter Burwell's score feels like it was written in an afternoon, and it sounds a lot like an earlier Coens score, I think Barton Fink. It's most likely their least memorable movie, with the possible exception of The Ladykillers.",/review/rw1946164/?ref_=tt_urv
