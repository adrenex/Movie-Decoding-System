","It's hard to think of blockbuster films that portray Native Americans as well as this one does. They are human beings here, with different personalities, intelligence, dignity, culture, and humor. The fact that a major Hollywood film had a good portion of its dialogue spoken in Lakota, subtitled in English, is fantastic. The portrayal of white cruelty, such as in the scene with rotting buffalo carcasses littering the prairie, invert the classic narrative, both in the genre of Westerns and in how history is often taught. The film identifies who the real savages were, and Kevin Costner should get a lot of credit for that.",/review/rw2648008/?ref_=tt_urv

","I rember seeing this shortly after it came out; the movie speaks to the conflict called the Civil War, but only briefly. The rest of Dances With Wolves speaks directly to the heart and soul of The Native Americans. It is a time that doesn't exist any more certainly, but everyone can learn something about our modern society and how really chaotic it is...",/review/rw2648008/?ref_=tt_urv

28 May 2006,mattrochman,10," The best film of all time
","Many people regard a lot of films as ""top class"" but I always keep a little shelf in my mind for the films that I regard as the best films of all time - films that are simply timeless masterpieces. Welcome to the top of that shelf! There are certain criteria by which films are judged and greatness is only obtained when all the criteria are satisfied in full. Dances with Wolves is the greatest timeless masterpiece of cinema to date because it satisfies all these criteria: 1) Cinematography: the sweeping landscape photography of the Frontier combined with the subtle night-time photography earns top marks. Aside from Oscars for Cinematography and editing, it also won the ASC award for Outstanding achievement in Cinematography - as well as a host of other industry recognition awards. In short - the cinematography is breathtaking.",/review/rw2648008/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2011,Wuchakk,10," Rediscover ""Dances With Wolves""
","I haven't seen ""Dances With Wolves"" for years but recently rediscovered its brilliance. Released in 1990, the story involves Lt. Dunbar (Kevin Costner), a Civil War hero, singlehandedly manning a desolate prairie post in South Dakota. He becomes intrigued by his Native American neighbors, a small tribe of Lakota Sioux, and slowly develops good relations with them. He ultimately adopts a Sioux name - Dances With Wolves - and assimilates with the tribe. When the U.S. Army discovers his actions he is treated as a treasonous deserter. Mary McDonnell and Graham Greene have key roles. ",/review/rw2648008/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2003,reporterman2000,10," One of the great ones
","People who say this movie is long and boring have obviously never sat through, oh, ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""Patton,"" ""Doctor Zhivago,"" ""The Godfather,"" ""Ran,"" ""Seven Samurai,"" or probably even ""Braveheart."" Thank God that not every filmmaker believes that a car must explode every 10 seconds in order for his movie to be a success. Kevin Costner is one of those directors who prefers the long format. David Lean, Francis Coppola and Mel Gibson, to name a very few, also worked in that format, and produced lasting works of art that also packed theaters. There are plenty of options for people who don't like movies that take the time to build character, drama and suspense, movies like ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,"" ""Freddy Vs. Jason,"" and ""Weekend at Bernie's."" I don't think any of those movies has ever been called ""boring,"" but they sure are crap cinema.",/review/rw2648008/?ref_=tt_urv

","Dances With Wolves is three hours long, but that is not long enough, it is so wonderful. It is set in the Civil War-era prairie, and it captures the encounter between a white man and a Sioux tribe. However, it is timeless. It is romantic, adventurous, active, comical, tragic, and educational. It demonstrates the color of one race and the cruelty of another. It forces us to view our own culture with a different eye. It features redemption, nay, salvation. The camera captures the prairie beautifully, the bluest of blue skies and the whitest and puffiest of white clouds, the most colorful of colorful ground, the roundest of rolling hills, and the largest of buffalo herds. This movie was a risky project. The story and the symbolism is simple, but it was filmed and performed masterfully. It deserved the seven Academy Awards it received and then some. A must-see masterpiece. Ten out of ten does no justice. See for yourself.",/review/rw2648008/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2005,philip_vanderveken,8," A not-so-average Western that still does the trick after so many years
","""Dances with Wolves"" is hated by quite a lot of people. Is it perhaps because the Indians aren't depicted as the bad guys for once or is it because this isn't the usual Western in which you'll not find a justification for the slaughtering of the Indians? Is it because it is very long or is it because Kevin Costner is in it? I don't know, but I do know it is very cool to dislike everything he has done, but I'm not following the masses. I can still think for myself and I must say that, even though the man has done some bad projects (for instance ""Waterworld""), this movie is absolutely one of his best.",/review/rw2648008/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is an amazing film--particularly from an artistic point of view as well as the film's ability to convey emotion. When I saw this film in the theater, I felt totally drained and very sad, so it's obvious that Kevin Costner did a great job in directing this film. It was just wonderful.",/review/rw2648008/?ref_=tt_urv

15 June 2003,FreedByFiction,10," The most beautiful movie ever made. And it is from Kevin Costner...........
","I can honestly say I have seen the face of beauty on screen, and it is in the form of the European version of ""Dances with Wolves"", an ethereal work of art that entrances, touches, inspires, and holds you in its grasp of angelic magnificence. If there is an afterlife for films, this would go straight to the pearly gates. Kevin Costner and his creative team are saints of modern film-making. Against all odds, they created a challenging, beautiful movie about a dark period in American history. And the movie, with its statements apparent, never shifts left or right, for which we are all truly thankful. It is a story, plain and simple. They would never make a movie this slow today. They'd never make a movie with this kind of character and story development today, either. The only thing that comes any where near close is the ""Lord of the Rings"" films. This is the best period movie, history movie, and Western all rolled into one. Make no mistake about it, the best film of the nineties is not just a flick, it will restore your faith in films for a long time. Unfortunately, after seeing ""Waterworld"", it won't restore your faith in Kevin Costner. It would take another ""Dances With Wolves"" to do that, and since ""Dances With Wolves"" is a perfect film, that would be impossible. 10/10",/review/rw2648008/?ref_=tt_urv

","I like to watch lots of films, pretty much any film in fact, therefore I can tell you i have seen a fair few duds. I have also seen some spectacularly brilliant films. Dances With Wolves is one of them. For me to have the patience to watch a film more than a couple of times then the film needs to make me want to watch it over and over. Let me tell you I have seen this film more than a few times. I think you know when a film is special to you when you watch it and you keep thinking to yourself ""oh this scene coming up is great"", if you can say that continually whilst watching a film then you know you are watching a great film.",/review/rw2648008/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2013,Metacognizant,10," It may drive home the meaning of being human more than any other film I've ever seen
","The best Western I've ever seen. One of its greatest strengths is its even handed portrayal of both sides of what was a gruesome bigotry ridden fight for land, opportunity, and way of life, between two very different cultures in the late 1800's. The Civil Wars' leftovers were a maliciously violent and frighteningly ignorant bunch, pit them against a culture of genuinely primitive & savage people (scalping & yelping pridefully about it – wow) and you have a perfect breeding ground for intolerance, impetuous violence, and never ending retaliatory fighting. ""Dances with Wolves"" provides a context for understanding both sides' humanity (for better and for worse) concerning this scar on our nation's history. Said understanding is permitted through an engaging story told on a stunning backdrop of our disappearing plains and enriched with beautifully moving music. In 2007, ""Dances with Wolves"" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."" It may drive home the meaning of being human more than any other film I've ever seen. It won 7 Academy Awards, including Best Picture 1990; I'm not at all surprised and support the Library of Congress' decision.",/review/rw2648008/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2003,mrbluto,9," One of the 15 best Movies of all Time
","Dances with Wolves is a great movie, make no mistake about that, Kevin  Costner had lighting in a bottle. Costner has not come close to movie  success since wolves. The cast is excellent, Kicking Bird, Stands with  Fist, Wind in his Hair and my quiet favorite smiles a lot, smiles a Lot  had trouble with growing up and becoming a brave, until it is forced  on him, his mood after he has killed the first time is priceless.  Some people say Dances with Wolves was an anti white movie, that is  total bull, it tells the true story the way few movies have of the  cruelty of the white people. People don't want to admit this movie is a  true telling of the way white people treat other races and nature. It  is a hard movie to digest.It is a hard movie to admit the truth. The  other thought is a lot of movie fans want car chases and explosions. If  a movie is thoughtful, it is labeled boring. Dances is one of the top  15 movies of all time. 9 out of 10 stars.

14 June 2006,wordsmith100,10," A Moving and Superbly Made Movie
","Like most of the commentators here, I found ""Dances With Wolves"" to be a moving and superbly made movie. Others have eloquently talked about the wonderful music and score, the very real script, and excellent acting, so there is no need for me to elaborate. But another element of the movie that I found even more notable is its depiction of Native Americans as individuals with feelings, honorable if at the same time frequently peculiar customs, and as human beings with human urges and impulses. What a refreshing contrast to all of the pablum and nonsense that has been the staple of Hollywood and its treatment of ""injuns"" over the years.",/review/rw2648008/?ref_=tt_urv

","And he deserved those two Oscars he won for what he did on this movie. ""Dances With Wolves"" is definitely a classic epic motion picture, one that should not ever be remade or redone in any way. Because nothing and nobody will ever be able to do what Kevin Costner and his team did on this movie. It won seven Academy Awards and countless other ones, and it deserved every single one of those and much more.",/review/rw2648008/?ref_=tt_urv

22 June 2019,caseyt-48511,10," Perfect? No. Excellent? Yes!
","Let me preface this, no. This movie is not better than Goodfellas and probably should not have won best picture. That being said, it is still an excellent movie with great acting, solid direction, beautiful cinematography and a story that defies western genre standards. Costner had great intentions with this film, and it mostly works. Some would call this movie a ""white savior"" film. But I sort of disagree. If anything, the Indians save Coster. He embraces their way of life after finding his own life unfulfilling. It's a good reversal of an old trope I think. It has that feeling of the grand epics of old like Lawrence of Arabia or Ben-Hur. It might not be as iconic, or age as well, but it still stands on its own as a great and unique film. Costner and company should be proud of what they accomplished.",/review/rw2648008/?ref_=tt_urv
