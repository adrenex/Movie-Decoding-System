16 September 2011,Leofwine_draca,7," The War on Terror, as seen from on the ground
","A taut and engaging Middle Eastern thriller from Ridley Scott, who handles the political motivations just as well as the frenetic action scenes. BODY OF LIES is a modern-day counterpart to Scott's Crusader epic KINGDOM OF HEAVEN, revealing how the war between the East and West is nowadays fought through terror attacks and sinister subversion rather than all-out battles.",/review/rw1987760/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2008,ametaphysicalshark,," A cut above most of its kind
","The main thing I was curious about with ""Body of Lies"" is what sort of film it would end up being. It could have been a post-Bourne action thriller, a serious dramatic thriller with a political edge (""Munich"", ""Syriana""), one of those intolerably dull post-9/11 films (""Lions for Lambs""), or something like Ridley Scott's brother Tony's ""Spy Game"", a movie with an interesting premise and disappointing execution.",/review/rw1987760/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2016,C22Man,6," High-Quality Espionage Thriller
","What is most interesting about Body of Lies is that it manages to rise above the predictability and formula that plagues the vast majority of espionage films. It is post-Bourne wrapped up in a more mature Bond plot with a politically conscious edge. Yet it never feels like it is stealing elements of those, more using them as a launch-pad for its own ideas. Though the film itself is sometimes guilty of falling back into safety, it remains consistently exciting and intently engaging even when those moments occur because of how keenly detailed and acted it is. It makes it standout as a cut above many of its contemporaries.",/review/rw1987760/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2008,EUyeshima,6," Intense Political Thriller Takes More Cues from Hollywood than the Current Middle East Crisis
","The craftsmanship behind director Ridley Scott's 2008 convulsive political thriller is impressive, but having acts of terrorism drive an intentionally labyrinth plot reveals how they impede the story structurally, an insurmountable barrier that screenwriter William Monahan (""The Departed"") can't seem to overcome. The movie's first half is all the more bewildering for all the double-crosses and cover-ups that serve to set up the central situation. Based on Washington Post columnist David Ignatius' 2007 novel, the movie focuses on embedded CIA operative Roger Ferris who is on an undercover assignment to hunt an Al-Qaeda terrorist leader named Al-Saleem. Ferris is not entirely alone as he is connected via cell phone with his stateside boss Ed Hoffman, who is the head of the CIA's Near East division and directs Ferris toward life-threatening tasks in a most nonchalant manner from his upscale suburban home.",/review/rw1987760/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2008,dbborroughs,8," Great spy film works first as a thriller but also as a commentary on Iraq. This is probably the first Iraq film that will have a life outside of its connection to the war
",I've been trying a simple way to explain the plot but its not that easy and its hung up my review of the film for sometime. I can either be very simple and not give you a flavor for the film or I can tell you too much. After much deliberation I'm going to go simple.,/review/rw1987760/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2016,caseynicholson,6," A Well Made Film that Just Barely Misses the Mark

20 April 2009,kosmasp,9," Complex structure
","I'm starting to get what and especially why people praised Leonardo Di Caprio so much. He really holds the movie together here. It's a great script story, but with his charismatic performance he really gives it the extra edge it needs.",/review/rw1987760/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2008,ma-cortes,7," Thrilling and exciting movie about terrorism , spies and geopolitical issues
","The film deals about a young spy named Roger Ferris(Leonardo DiCaprio), a CIA operative serving in Jordan. He's working for CIA chief named Ed Hoffman(Russell Crowe). Ed is a very occupied man, as efficient boss as father of family. The super-powerful CIA uses technological-gizmo-surveillance satellites for people spying and hound terrorists relentlessly. Ferris schemes a plot to chase the mastermind terrorist named Al Saleem . In Jordan Roger forms a shaky alliance with Hani (Mark Strong),the boss of Jordanian Intelligence to break the terrorist ring which are bombing civilian targets .Ferris try to stop cruel terrorist who plans terrorist bombings by means an uncanny masquerade . Meanwhile Ferris falls in love with a Palestine nurse and aid-worker named Aisha(Farahani).",/review/rw1987760/?ref_=tt_urv

4 January 2009,bob the moo,," The lack of tight focus means the plot slows everything down and wastes its main assets
","The names on the poster will have done it for many potential viewers. The trailer will have done it for others. The calibre of the director may even have been the reason for some other sections of the audience but whatever the reasons this film was always going to be a big solid money-maker Â– almost regardless of the actual product quality. The trailer informs us that the film has action, big male stars, plenty of tough dialogue and presumably a good pace to the telling. But then, since when we can we really trust trailers? Body of Lies starts well though and opens up operating at the level of the trailer but sadly it soon loses its way, gets bogged down in plot but doesn't manage to engage the audience or produce the tension it needs to. To be blunt, the film is far too long to sustain itself and ends up feeling surprisingly dull.",/review/rw1987760/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2009,dfranzen70,5," Serious misstep for all involved - skip it
","In a role that's tailor made for his preening, self-involved public persona, Leonardo DiCaprio plays an intense CIA agent who doesn't play by the rules in his fight against terrorism in the Middle East. Russell Crowe is his slovenly Langley-based boss. The overly complex plot in Body of Lies is often ludicrous, with cardboard characters and a heavy-handed tone that attempts to paint a complicated situation in black-and-white terms.",/review/rw1987760/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2008,owlglass,10," Kingdom of Heaven: 1000 years on...
","Films involving 'current events'--particularly those relating to anything happening in the Middle East and Terrorism--tend to be soaked in the writers', producers' and director's politics, which usually end up very much in-your-face and spoil the film, because you suddenly lose the story and drown in the preaching and proselytizing.",/review/rw1987760/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2008,kari_d,7," Good movie, but a bit forgettable
","I have really liked Leonardo DiCaprio's films since he came back from his hiatus (esp Blood Diamond). However, this one was quite forgettable. I enjoyed the movie when I was in the theater and left thinking ""Huh. That was pretty good"". But the week after someone asked what movie I saw and I couldn't remember. It reminded me a lot of ""The Kingdom"" actually (the feel, not the details). It was a very well made film, dialog and script were good, just nothing really stood out and grabbed me. Leo was the shine, he is such a talented actor and I was happy to see him in a great role. I just wish the plot had something fantastic in it to make it into a great film.",/review/rw1987760/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2008,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,8," DiCaprio shines as usual in a technically well made film that ranks amongst the better Ridley Scott films
","Ridley Scott has always been very consistent in my mind as a filmmaker. He has occasional flashes of genius (Alien, Gladiator), but always seems to make steady, good, interesting, and watchable films. The same applies here with Body of Lies. While the film will not be this year's major awards contender, Body of Lies is among the better films by Scott, somewhere between American Gangster and Black Hawk Down.",/review/rw1987760/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2008,laursene,9," A marvelous character study
","Amidst all the slam-bang, Body of Lies is actually a superb character study of two preening, bumbling CIA (presumably) agents trying to save the world in the Middle East. Roger Ferris (Di Caprio) is the agent on the ground, and Ed Hoffman (Crowe) is his remote-control boss in Washington. Their collective M.O. is to overreact and improvise at every turn, aided and abetted by their deep attachment to high-tech gadgetry and fundamental disregard for human lives. Their ally and foil, the Jordanian head of intelligence (Mark Strong), prefers more patient methods informed by a less skin-deep understanding of the people(s) involved.",/review/rw1987760/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2008,wkup,," Who Can You Trust?
",Does trust go out the window in the time of war? It's the question the audience may ponder during the course of this film where it seems that even those on the same team aren't always working in each other's best interests.,/review/rw1987760/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2008,ferguson-6,7," Nobody is Innocent
","Greetings again from the darkness. Director Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe team up again and this time, to really spice things up, they drag Leonardo DiCaprio along for the wild ride.

6 April 2009,claudio_carvalho,4," Disappointing Pyrotechnical Tour
","After two terrorist attacks in Europe, one in London and the other in Amsterdam, the prime suspect is the leader Al-Saleem (Alon Aboutboul). The CIA agent Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio) that operates in the Middle East is assigned by his superior at Langley Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe) to keep a ""safe house"" in Amman under surveillance, and he associates to the Chief of Security in Jordan, Hani Salaam (Mark Strong). Roger does not disclose the whole operation to Hani, and it fails due to the intervention of Ed. Meanwhile Roger has feelings for the local nurse Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani) and he gets close to her family. When Roger plots another scheme to catch Al-Saleem using the innocent architect Omar Sadiki (Ali Suliman) as decoy to lure Al-Saleem, he jeopardizes not only the safety of Sadiki, but also Aisha that is kidnapped. After the execution of Sadiki, Roger tries to negotiate the release of Aisha with the terrorists and proposes to deliver himself to save the nurse.",/review/rw1987760/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2008,PWNYCNY,2," Is the movie over yet?
","Maybe being a government bureaucrat is not the most glamorous way of making a living but it's still a way to make a living. However, after watching this movie, one may come away believing that every government bureaucrat is a lazy, bloated, conceited, paper pusher who lives exclusively to partake of his next lunch break. Not exactly a pretty picture, but this is the picture that the audience has to endure when watching what is nothing more than another tedious, noisy, overacted action movie. Just what the doctor ordered ... right? How many more of these movies has Hollywood made? One thousand? Two thousand? The formula for making these movies is so beaten into the dust that by now it should be completely unrecognizable. The locales change but the plots remain the same, and with the same shallow character development and the equally shallow acting as trained performers are asked to devolve into pseudo-cartoon characters and act accordingly. This movie seemed to run-on interminably. ""When will this movie end?"" I repeatedly thought to myself. Leonardo DiCaprio was totally unbelievable as a CIA operative, but what has to be one of the great gaffs of miscasting, an overweight Russell Crowe plays a CIA bureaucrat. Please note that in this movie the on site operative is ""lean and mean"" while his desk jockey supervisor is fat. This is called stereotyping. What was the casting director thinking? Why not have Jack Nicholson play an overweight office clerk? Or Nicole Kidman play a frumpy department store saleswoman? And the story was so fantastic that no amount of literary license could afford it credibility. An obviously non-Arab American (Mr. DiCaprio) trying to pass himself off as an Arab ... speaking fluent Arabic ... concocting all kinds of hair brain schemes that are doomed to failure ... trying to out think and outfox real Arabs who are completely unfooled by his laughable Arab masquerade ... trying to romance a Palestinian woman while in the middle of conducting a highly sensitive and complex espionage mission ... etc. By now you get the point. Next time try casting an actual Arab in the role. Not even the most naive movie goer can believe all that. There should be a rough balance between the protagonist and antagonist. In this movie the protagonist is so transparent and incompetent that it leaves the story in shambles. Next stop for this movie - DVD land and oblivion. And one other thing. Don;t let this movie discourage you from working for the government. The pay may not be great, but the fringe benefits are excellent, a critical fact that this movie conveniently omits.",/review/rw1987760/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2010,Hitchcoc,8," Where's the Power?
","With DiCaprio and Crowe out there, what is a very obtuse movie at times becomes quite a thriller. Crowe sits back and lets things happen. He knows how little say he really has, so he just puts people in harm's way. DiCaprio finds himself in Jordan trading secrets, and never knowing whom to trust. Crowe is a coach who keeps sending him back for more brutality. We also see the delicate balance that exists among the invaders (us) and the indigenous folks who are ever vigilant. There is a romance that is a bit distracting but explains a lot. The main character, however, is like a gang member trying to leave the game. It becomes very complicated and when he sees how much investment he has, he has to follow orders. This isn't the best movie of its kind, but it will keep one involved.",/review/rw1987760/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2009,markymark70,5," Too Complicated and dull for my liking
",Political thrillers are not really my bag to be honest - I watch them but do I enjoy them? Not really. So it needs to be a very special type of movie for me to give it the thumbs up. Body of Lies is not that special.,/review/rw1987760/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2008,george.schmidt,6," DiCaprio, Crowe & Scott do their best in this listless, murky geopolitical drama
","BODY OF LIES (2008) **1/2 Leonardo DiCaprio, Russell Crowe, Mark Strong, Golshifteh Farahani, Oscar Issac, Ali Suliman, Alon Abutbul, Simon McBurney. Murky geopolitical drama based on David Ignatius' novel about a CIA op (DiCaprio) attempting to take down a Bin Laden-ian terrorist in the Middle East with handler Crowe (going the full Clooney Â– gaining 50 pounds and literally phoning in his performance) acting as his eyes and ears throughout the course of action that has many pitfalls and dark alleys to pursue. Filmmaker Ridley Scott, working with an at- times-hard-to-keep interesting screenplay adaptation by William Monahan, does his best but ultimately the listlessness is bogged down until the final explosive act.",/review/rw1987760/?ref_=tt_urv
