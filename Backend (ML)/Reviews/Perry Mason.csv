23 December 2016,nickryall,9," lovely movie
","I don't get the bad reviews here, were they watching the same film? or maybe they have lost touch with their inner child. I loved this film and I'm not a kid I'm a 55 year old bloke. The film follows the book faithfully and keeps hold of Roald Dahl's odd humour well. The girl playing Sophie is an excellent Northern British actress who plays the part very well and is well cast, the giant character is funny, magical and full of warmth and charm with the CG very well done. Sure its a kids film but as such it is a very good one, if you want more adult material then don't watch kids films but if you like magical fantasy with humour and great visuals I recommend the BFG wholeheartedly.",/review/rw4561249/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2016,larrys3,7," Needs Better Editing But There's a Number of Positives Here
","I'm also quite surprised by all the negativity thrown at this film. Yes, it does have its slow spots and could certainly use better editing, but it can be quite wondrous, humorous, and has some important messages to relay as well.",/review/rw4561249/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2017,margotmaesmm,8," A pleasure for the eye and the soul
","A beautiful tale brought to life by Spielberg. A fascinating universe makes up for the simplicity of the story (which can be forgiven since it's a children's book). Dahl's original story is beautifully retold on screen. The jokes and good ending most certainly make it an amazing, enjoyable family movie that is a pleasure for both the eye and the soul.",/review/rw4561249/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2016,monstermayhem32,8," A nice adaptation
","I remember reading this book as a kid and I was glad that it go the proper film adaptation that it deserved. While the film version forgoes many of the darker elements from the novel but it does stay faithful to the story, the premise deals with ten year old orphan Sophie who is living in an orphanage in London who dreads staying there, one night while having difficulty falling asleep, she encounters the bfg aka big friendly giant who takes her to giant country. She also discovers that the bfg is a kind and friendly giant. However Sophie also discovers that other giants in giant country aren't as friendly and eat human beings.",/review/rw4561249/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2016,spmact,8," Simply Delightful
","First off, I'm not a huge children's movie fan, but this one was just so charming and cute I couldn't help but like it. The real star is the BFG. The funny way he talks and the emotions on his face really made the movie for me. The little girl does a pretty good job as well. ",/review/rw4561249/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2016,creetar,8," I liked it
","I do understand that people are disappointed when watching a Kids movie and expecting an exciting and challenging plot. What is wrong with you guys? Just because it says Steven Spielberg doesn't mean this is a movie that is specifically designed for your needs. I am 30+ and I like this movie a lot, watching it from a kids perspective you even understand the breakfast scene and I bet all kids would laugh at it. It is kinda sad, seeing how incapable some people are recognizing a movie for kids as such. This is a proper 8! I like the accent, the CGI is fitting, the story is for kids, so if you are not a kid, stfu. I can fully recommend it to anybody with an open mind, who is not looking for the kids version of an Captain America Civil War CGI fest.",/review/rw4561249/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2017,SnoopyStyle,6," not Spielberg's best
","Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) is a 10 year old English orphan. At the witching hour, Sophie spots the Big Friendly Giant (Mark Rylance) who takes her to the Giant world to avoid her alerting the public of their presence. The BFG is actually a vegetarian and the runt of the group. The other giants are bigger, bullies the BFG, and eat human beings. The BFG collects dreams and Sophie comes up with an idea to warn The Queen by manufacturing a nightmare about the human-eating giants.",/review/rw4561249/?ref_=tt_urv

4 July 2016,eddie_baggins,4," A ""Giant"" disappointment from Spielberg
","Steven Spielberg doesn't make ""bad"" films; even his oft ridiculed 1941 isn't actually ""that bad"" and lets just forget about The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull but the Great Beared One's The BFG is certainly below middle of the road leaning towards downright average Spielbergian fare, which is a great big shame when you consider the seemingly perfectly suited combination of the famed director and author extraordinaire Roald Dahl.",/review/rw4561249/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2016,makka-00955,8," Lovely family movie
","I loved this adaptation, it is charming, funny and engaging. I've read some pretty scathing reviews, saying it's Spielberg's worst film - or one of, and I couldn't disagree more. It's really a kid's story, dressed up as a family movie. It's also a simple tale, requiring a simple plot and that is what you get, along with some Spielberg magic. The (gas) scene in Buckingham Palace is one of the funniest I've ever seen - it was hysterical! If you want to get all serious and pick fault with the plot line, you shouldn't be watching this kind of movie. It's a fantasy movie, involving some.... well... fantasy! There were some stereotypical British elements, which to us might be a bit overdone, but Spielberg isn't British. Whoever is slating this movie's plot and the movie in general obviously doesn't remember: E.T, Back to the Future; Poltergeist etc, who's plot lines were crackpot in the extreme. BFG is what it is... a lighthearted and delightful fantasy, which kids and adults will adore together.",/review/rw4561249/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2017,tomgillespie2002,5," Not a total failure, but a rambling, timid effort to bring a difficult book to the screen
","It's been a whopping 25 years since Steve Spielberg's last real children's film, when he disappointed children and adults alike with his Peter Pan re-imagining Hook. After a long period of going back and forth between monochromatic, Oscar-wary history lessons and crowd-pleasing blockbuster fare, Hollywood's most famous director is back trying to win the hearts of both children and parents as he did with one of his most celebrated movies, E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982), with a passion project he's been considering for some time. He also reunites with E.T. screenwriter Melissa Mathison (who sadly died last year) to bring the notoriously tricky world of Roald Dahl to the big screen.",/review/rw4561249/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2016,windlepaul,9," Why is this getting so much hate?
","Firstly this is not your average Spielberg movie, it's more of a feel good family movie. The reason people hate this movie is because they are comparing it to a proper Spielberg movie. I think Spielberg was trying to do something different this time for kid viewers. My family loved this movie and if you hated this movie while you're reading this, just give it another try. Lot's of people think this is very immature because of it's fart jokes, I was counting how many fart jokes there were surprisingly there were only four in the entire movie. The director has had a few bad movies recently (Indiana Jones and the kingdom of the Krystal Skull etc.) Basically what I'm trying to say is that this is a good movie and it is too much hate.",/review/rw4561249/?ref_=tt_urv

19 December 2016,miguelneto-74936,6," A cool movie from Disney, it's good to see Spielberg going back to making children's films.
","The BFG surprised me, I expected nothing but a boring and bland movie from Disney, luckily the movie is cool, has funny moments, the giant is a very charismatic character, Ruby Barnhill is fine, Ruby's chemistry Barnhill with Mark Rylance is very good, the look is beautiful, it has good moments, the final scene is cool, the script has problems, the movie takes a while to get nice, I found the beginning very slow and tedious, the direction of The master of Steven Spielberg is good, even though it is not comparable to his best works, The BFG is a fun movie, with some funny moments, has a nice story, even a script with problems, and some weak dialogues, the chemistry of the main characters is Very good, and the movie soundtracks are pretty cool.

5 July 2016,drqshadow-reviews,5," A Flimsy, Effect-Reliant Effort Which Lacks the Magic of Dahl's Book and Spielberg's Preceding Films
","Steven Spielberg's doggedly loyal adaptation of a Roald Dahl classic, sadly, doesn't have much oomph. It's the narrow tale of an orphaned girl, abducted and (eventually) befriended by a steep, thin, heart-of-gold giant, who goes on to discover they have an awful lot in common. Originally a short story that was later expanded into a full novel, I can't remember the book feeling nearly as thin and stretched as the film does. It's got a nice message, some vague warm-fuzzies, a fair piece of physical acting (unsurprisingly, given the cast's stage credentials), but the central relationship is missing some intangibles and the looming threat never actually seems all that important. Spielberg and company took the sugar-coated route, skipping much of the menace that might have earned the film a stiffer rating, and along the way they slashed out its teeth. The dreamy, surreal CG is problematic, too. Often the fairy tale renderings seem more sharp and textured than the live actors, as if they're occupying two different realities in the same space, and that took me out of the scenery on several occasions. Mildly entertaining, but too effects-reliant for its own good. The journey is about so much more than the shape and color of the paths we've walked.",/review/rw4561249/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2016,reborn-966-808248,10," so beautiful so gentle
","This is my first review on IMDb. Why? Because I am surprised, better said shocked about the response to this movie. Such a beautiful film, so subtle so warm, humorous, what a wonderful world created. So much heart. It is not about spectacle, action and it is not specifically for children, it is for everybody with a young heart. Who still has a child inside full of wonder and gratitude of being alive. The characters are so beautiful, humorous, the gentle gentle giant. The girl, strong, direct but touched inside by this gentle giant. The visual effects wow so much to see, experience, the scene with chasing the dreams, beautiful beautiful. And can't say enough about this film, how wonderful wonderful this film was for me. Yes me, a man of 53 years old. And my girlfriend about the same age as me shares my opinion. Are we crazy, or is there something wrong with this world? Thank you Steven Spielberg for daring to create such a beautiful fairy tale, true magic of the heart. If you open yourself for it maybe it can touch you, you may feel it.

25 April 2018,realfandangoforever,8," Wonderful
","This fantasy film, obviously created by people with wonderful imaginations, was a joy to behold. There is so much fine detail contained within, that I found myself constantly wanting to hit the pause button. The characters were amazing, especially the giants, and although I found the film slowed a bit during BFG's reveal, my happiness was reinforced with laughing out loud moments, well, at least one really good laughing out loud moment. The special effects are top notch and the possibility that dreams come from the northern lights just appealed to this long term resident of the NWT. Overall, my time with The BFG was nothing but a positive investment. Well, well done.",/review/rw4561249/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2018,Kirpianuscus,," seductive
","Before to see the adaptation, the mix of emotion and prudence defines me. because, from an early age, I was one of small fans of the book. and the name of Steven Spielberg, as always, represents a good promise. but each adaptation of a lovely book is a challenge first for viewer. and the film is real beautiful. for that, not only the technology has a significant role but the option, a profound inspired one, of director for the couple Mark Rylance and Ruby Barnhill. Rylance is the expected BFG for me. so familiar and admirable performed than the respect for its performer becomes more than great. Barnhill is and she is not the Sophie who I imagine. but she has the all virtues for become, scene by scene. it is a lovely film. and that is only important thing. because it seems bizarre to compare it with more than the novel of Roald Dahl. and the verdict is real favorable for Steven Spilberg project.",/review/rw4561249/?ref_=tt_urv

26 July 2016,TheMovieDiorama,7," The BFG. A Beautiful Fantastical Gentle movie that's fun for everyone.
","Another film to add to Spielberg's filmography, The BFG is about the big friendly giant who kidnaps a child and takes her to Giant Country where the BFG must overcome bullies and seek a friendship with the kidnapped girl. Based on Roald Dahl's original work, I was most certainly going into this with low expectations (not being a fan of the original film)...but was pleasantly surprised! This is actually really imaginative and one of those rare films where I was in awe of the magic and wonder. Mark Rylance was great as the giant, you feel connected to him throughout the film and his voicing talents were brilliant (especially since he comes from a Shakespeare background). The rest of the cast did fine, but there isn't actually that much dialogue. The majority of the story is actually told through the visuals and my goodness there is some impressive work here, truly outstanding effects. I did take me some time to get used to the live action and the effects blending together, but this was only a short time. Spielberg has done well yet again, but the problem is that the film is just too safe. It feels like it was made for the 1980's and does not add anything new to the genre. Also there are times when you feel like the story isn't going anywhere, 117 minutes might be quite long for the younger viewers. Overall, this is an imaginative magical feature that might feel a little bit too safe but is definitely a great addition to Spielberg's canon. ",/review/rw4561249/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2016,Quinoa1984,8," this is enchanting
","I should be surprised that The BFG didn't do better this opening weekend, but I'm not (Pixar when they have something audiences want do so well that no one can come close), and with Secret Life of Pets out on Friday it doesn't stand much of chance of being a financial success. But as an artistic success it is a minor gem in Spielberg's filmography. It says a lot that a man who has been working over 45 years in movies can still make things so delightful, seemingly effortlessly, like the flick of a wrist in visual grandiosity and wonder, with his band of collaborators (Kaminski, Williams, Kahn, and here in a grand finale Mathison as writer, and Rylance who is now like Tarantino/Waltz, I can't wait to see more work from them).",/review/rw4561249/?ref_=tt_urv
