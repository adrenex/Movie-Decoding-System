15 November 2004,Robert_duder,," Forever a classic
","Certain movies will just always be hard to write a review for. You can give your opinion and say what you enjoyed or didn't enjoy but I find myself hesitating in certain aspects just because a classic must be left some space to be a classic. Ghost as far as I'm concerned will forever be a romantic classic. It's sheer brilliance is it's twists, it is incredibly, deeply, romantic and at the same time terrifying, and has an underlying story that is never fully explored. It's got action, mystery, horror, and at the heart is the pure, simplistic romance of it all.",/review/rw1989888/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2006,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,7," Beautiful, touching and moving... a tale of a love so strong it defies death itself
","I must say this film surprised me. Coming in, I knew nothing about it but the famous clay-forming scene... I didn't know I was in for such a strong experience. This film had me from the first few moments of it. I never lost interest. The plot is so interesting and intriguing, you can't help but watch, often at the very edge of your seat. I will say that I found one twist somewhat predictable, but maybe I've just seen too many later movies before watching this. There is a lot of suspense in this film. When I found that it was directed by a Zucker(yup... Airplane and so forth), I was somewhat doubtful as to any other quality in the film than the humor of it... if you're reading this and you're thinking the same, trust me; he pulls it off. Excellently. There are few, if any, flaws in directing. The writing is solid. At times, there seemed to be a little too much humor and some scenes were maybe a tad long, but apart from that, there was not really anything with this film that was flawed. The score is great. The pacing is incredibly good. The acting is really good all-round. Goldberg provides a lot of comic relief, without being obnoxious. Moore and Swayze have magnificent chemistry, you truly believe them as a couple. The special effects are grand, yet they don't take over the movie. This is driven by the emotions, by how the plot affects these characters. I was completely into this movie all the way. The humor is very good and surprisingly tasteful for the theme. Much of it is derived from the situation of Swayze's character and his interaction with environment and other characters. All in all, just a very impressive film. I recommend this to any fan of drama, romance, comedy, thriller or fantasy, as well as anyone interested in seeing a non-parody Zucker film and fans of the actors. 7/10",/review/rw1989888/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2008,CihanVercan,8," When You're DEAD, It's ALL OVER; but When You're LOVED, It's FOREVER !
","The imaginative but well-conceived idea of dishing up a romance upon lovers communicating spiritually owing to one of them is dead, was first filmed by Steven Spielberg 8 months before the Ghost's silver screen release. Spielberg's movie Always(1989) had classy use of visuals fulfilling the needs of viewers with mystery-based expectations. Yet, Always lacked the sense of essential romance concept, despite having the same plot and even the same storyline in Ghost. Originally the idea has been created by Chandler Sprague and David Boehm.",/review/rw1989888/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2003,moonspinner55,7," It shows surprising grace in its mix of romantic drama, fantasy and revenge thriller...
","Murdered businessman in New York City sets out in ghostly form to bring his killers to justice--and to watch out over his live-in girlfriend, who may now be in similar danger. Whoopi Goldberg won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar as a not-so-fake medium who becomes Patrick Swayze's conduit to reaching lady-love Demi Moore. Whoopi is, indeed, a treasure, though Swayze is just serviceable here and Moore has to contend with a non-believing character who takes too long to come around. It might be easy for some to write this fantasy-love story off as a bloated, faded hit with a heart of F/X, but there's surprising grace and finesse in Jerry Zucker's direction. Bruce Joel Rubin also won an Oscar for his original screenplay, which has some nice twists and turns. In these hands, ""Ghost"" is nearly an unqualified success, neatly avoiding treacle and sap simply by combining a sly sense of humor with its romantic spirit--underscored by Maurice Jarre's music and the oldie ""Unchained Melody"" by The Righteous Brothers.",/review/rw1989888/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2007,drystyx,10," a lot of great scenes sign of a great movie
","This may not be a classic, but it comes close. It has one big attribute of most great movies, a lot of great scenes. The story is about Sam, who has a great life, and this movie is the opposite of CLICK. Unlike that stupid movie, this guy doesn't want to fast forward his life with a beautiful loving wife and great career. But it is taken away from him when he is killed. He becomes a ghost. And that might be one of only two flaws in the story. Why he can project his needs when billions of other dead souls can't. But a great movie like this endears us to the characters and plot enough so that this is a very trivial flaw. He finds he can communicate with a fake spiritualist (Whoopi, in a role few could do as well), which is the second flaw, since we have a feeling we've seen this character in this instance all too often. Hoever, again, if the movie is good enough we can overlook this. Without making spoilers, I can only add that the movie satisfies the viewer. There is romance, humor, logic, adventure, suspense, and great scenes. Among the great scenes that make the movie (I'll only mention some) are the scene where Sam follows his friend to the killer's apartment (actually just about every scene with his friend is classic), the scene where Whoopi goes to the bank, the scene where she leaves the bank, the scene where Sam is a ghost in the office with his friend, the scene where the friend hits on Sam's woman, the first scene with the little dark men, the second scene with the little dark men...I could go on and on. What is lost in all of this is one of the greatest emotional bits of capturing character ever, when Sam realizes what is going to happen to an evil man when the little dark men appear the second time, and he expresses true sorrow and compassion for a man who stole so much from him. This is one of the most poignant and heroic scenes ever in any movie I would find it very hard to believe anyone could not enjoy this movie. Truly a winner. Know what? This is a classic.",/review/rw1989888/?ref_=tt_urv

22 March 2006,cwei-1,," Ghost...........Classic!
","After so many years, every time when I see this movie again, it always makes my eyes water! This is basically a simple story. However, the script writer by Bruce Joel Rubin and the director by Jerry Zucker are intelligent. They made the simple story a touching, interesting one. I think most people cried at the end of the movie. This reminded me another commercial successful movie ""Titanic"" in the year 1997. The music (composed by Maurice Jarre) was so moving. Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore played well, not to mention Whoopi Goldberg. Her performance was amazing!(she also had excellent acting in Spielberg's early masterpiece ""The Color Purple"") The visual effects by ILM was extraordinary in that time. By and large, this touching movie is not only a huge commercial success, but also a classic!",/review/rw1989888/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2005,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,9," Excellent romance about true love that lasts eternally
","GHOST, in my opinion, is an excellent romance about true love that lasts eternally. When Sam (Patrick Swayze) got mugged, I got really scared. You'll have to see the movie if you want to know why. If you ask me, Maurice Jarre's score is absolutely beautiful. To me, Carl (Tony Goldwyn) was a very creepy guy. Also, Willie (Rick Aviles) was just as scary as he was. I was amazed at the way Sam could step through anything in his ghostly state. All in all, everyone involved in this film did an outstanding job. In conclusion, if you like Patrick Swayze or Demi Moore, this is definitely a movie to see. You will really be touched by it.",/review/rw1989888/?ref_=tt_urv

26 July 2011,Arcturus1980,9," I have grown to love Ghost
","Ghost is the latest of a dozen or so films that I have come to appreciate much more over time. I had seen it a few times in the '90s and liked it, but not on the level of yesterday's viewing. Every film is a world unto itself, and generally speaking, the more interesting the world, the better the film. I like the world of Ghost. I like the treatment of the supernatural. The denial thereof and other character annoyances can be rationalized away quite satisfactorily. I would, however, prefer a more restrained Whoopi Goldberg, who is a little out of control for the sake of humor. It is something of a comedy after all.",/review/rw1989888/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2001,mm-39,8," This is a good film
","My wife loves this film, and I found it more then a romance movie.  A intriguing story, of deception, death, the after life, and greed.  This is a great film, with character you care about, suspense, romance, and a fresh script.  This film made Patricks carrier, and after this film  he chose a few films that killed his chances of acting in higher budget films.  I believe if he picked a couple more scripts like this one he would be on the same level as Tom Cruse.  I think the politically correct 90's found him too macho for their tastes, and it drove him to do that film about India which helped kill his carrier.  In the end this film is a little about what Patrick could have been, a true international star.",/review/rw1989888/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2006,FloatingOpera7,10," Before Titanic,This Was The Love Story Of The 90's
","Ghost (1990): Starring Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore, Whoopie Golberg, Tony Goldwyn, Rick Aviles, Martina Deignan, Susan Breslau. Director Jerry Zucker, Writer Bruce Joel Rubin Before Titanic (1997) Ghost, released in 1990, was the most beloved romantic movie of the 90's. It is still considered a romantic classic and has all the makings of a terrific movie sans the romance itself. Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore sizzle as the married couple Sam and Molly. Sam is killed after a botched mugging. His rival Carl Bruner (Tony Goldwyn) is bent on stealing money from his bank account and stealing his wife. Whoopie Goldberg plays Oda Mae Brown, a fraudulent psychic who claims to talk to the dead. When Sam dies, he becomes a ghost to extract justice. Sam is able to communicate with Oda Mae. Whoopie is actually at her best in this film. I do know she had already made several funny movies in the 80's but this one is quite delightful. Of course, Sister Act made her famous too but as Oda Mae she's a real riot! Later on, Molly learns of his being a ghost. In its day, Ghost was a combination of thriller, paranormal surrealism and romance, an odd mix. The theme song ""Unchained Melody"" by the Righteous Brothers sold like crazy in record stores and was always on the radio. There is much to appreciate about this film. The cinematography is quite beautiful. It is both dark and light, tragic and triumphant. Yes, Molly has lost her husband but not his love. As a ghost, their relationship has never been stronger. The scene in which Sam (as a ghost) is caressing and kissing Molly as she works on the potter-wheel is still incredibly erotic and romantic! How can one not find that romantic ? Ultimately, evil is defeated and good triumphs. The ending is satisfying in every way. In fact, that ending is one of the many I have loved in movies. Also, this is one of the films that at the time were just meant to be watched with no real need to overanalyze it and to just enjoy it. The early to mid 90's was the time of VHS and this was one of the hottest videos in stores at the time. Sit back, turn off the lights, light some candles, get together with your partner and enjoy the timeless tale of a woman and her ghost!",/review/rw1989888/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2020,ironhorse_iv,7," This is one ghost story worth listening to. It's really good. I really do love it! Ditto.
","One of the directors of 1980 parody comedy 'Airplane' making a gut wrenchingly emotional romantic murder drama? Surely, you can't be serious. Yes, I am and don't call me Shirley. This film was nearly a masterpiece in the way it was shot. The way the camera foreshadowing the villain's turn from the reflection of the mirror of angel statue being lifted in to the antagonist being greedy about the apartment was magnificent. The spooky dark opening with the dust of the apartment looking like spirits was haunting and the horrific, guttural cries they make created by slowing down recordings of babies crying are chilling. Even the appearance of glowing light being shine down on the titular character whenever he's about to leave was powerful even if some of the special effects are dated. To give you an idea of how good the movie directed by Jerry Zucker really was. Some movie theaters actually gave out free tissue packets to attendees during its original run because how much of an emotional tear jerking watch, the film can bring. Trust me even I was crying after witnessing this film. However the story written by Bruce Joel Rubin of a murdered man's ghost, Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) staying behind to warn his girlfriend Molly Jensen (Demi Moore) of impending danger, with the help of a reluctant psychic Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg) did have some flaws. Mostly in the way the filmmakers introduce some of the spirit's powers such as possessions and moving items. First off, I felt like the film could had introduce the Subway Ghost played well by Vincent Schiavelli a little bit better. It was a bit weird for the ghost to interference with Sam when he is following Willie Lopez (Rick Aviles) but the titular character was still able to keep track of his killer even afterward being toss off the train. Honestly that scene should had been cut as it was bit jarring. The movie could had introduce that individual a lot later in the film. For example after Sam finds out that his best friend Carl Bruner (Tony Goldwyn)'s true motives. He could go back to the train heading back to Molly from 321 Prospect Place feeling depressed; only to find out that he is in the presence of another ghost. It's here where they should had a fight; only for Wheat not to give up and somewhat challenge him to teach him that ability. Yes it would be more of a Deus ex machina too convenient event than it originally was, but it would also made that moment a lot more emotional and powerful. Since the movie didn't do that; it always bug me why Sam didn't go back to the train station after witnessing it the first time. Why does it take him a whole bunch of filler scenes later to figure that out when knocking off a picture? Honestly a lot of what Sam does seem pretty idiotic. As fun as it is to watch Sam torment the villain with his ghost powers, writing out his name on the computer was not the brightest decision nor was going into the body of Oda Mae when the antagonists are heading their way. That along is really dumb. It's not like he didn't know that it can drain his powers. He witness another ghost do that earlier in the film. Talking about that scene; why was the point of the ghost doing that in the first place? It's not like he couldn't see his wife's hair. It's very visional. Don't get why he was surprised by it. Anyways those whole possession scenes felt forced nor does it make sense in the story as Sam never told anybody about Mae's powers. Plus it's kinda rapey as the ghost did that without her permission or her consent. It kinda disgusting and not that funny. Despite that, Goldberg did made me laugh at certain parts of the film. She was wonderful for the most part. Glad that Swayze convinced her to do this role to the point that he was willing to drop out if she didn't. She ended up winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress that year. As for Swayze, I do think that he did a good job as the titular character even if Sam is little bland and dumbfounded. His reaction to betrayal and feeling sorry for others felt real. Along with that the pottery scene involving him is very steamy and sensual. It's the film most remembered and most parodied moment. Pretty impressive for a scene that contain no nudity other than Swayze being shirtless. While the song that went along with the scene, 'Unchained Melody' by the Righteous Brothers originally was about a prisoner hoping his girl will wait for him felt unrelated in a surface level to the scene as Sam has yet became a ghost with chained limitations. It still work so well with the movie that it was put back into the billboard charts after 30 years from its first debut. It's very romantic. Even composer Maurice Jarrie orchestral version of the song was emotional to listen to. The scene where Sam says farewell to Molly was heartbreaking. Demi Moore really did act. The way that she can cry on cue and seem flabbergasted really made this moment seem special even if her character was somewhat underdeveloped for most of the film. That scene along became more heartbreaking since Patrick Swayze's passing in 2009. It's somewhat hard to watch now. Regardless in 2010 a foreign remake was made in Japan & a musical production of Ghost hit Broadway in 2012. Still overall: No reboot can beat this movie with its great use of horror, comedy and romantic tone. It's one worth possessing.",/review/rw1989888/?ref_=tt_urv

11 December 2006,blanbrn,7," Your spirit will believe! One of the best of the 90's.
","When seeing ""Ghost"" 16 years ago with friends, and family I knew that this film would go down as a classic and it did it's one of the 90's best films. The movie in my opinion is so successful because of the many themes it's associated with it's not only a love story, but also this film has plenty of comedic moments while at the same time the main characters face a web of betrayal. The plot is well written with many turns as Patrick Swayze gives a strong performance as a New York City banker, who is gunned down and killed right in front of his sweetheart(Demi Moore)and all of this is over a dirty investment scandal. ""Ghost"" then gets very interesting when the Swayze character finds out that the after life does indeed occur! He can see people, but they can't see him! Never fear the only hope is to team with a psychic(Whoopi Goldberg who rightfully wins an Academy-Award for best supporting actress) to uncover the truth behind his murder and to rescue his love(Demi Moore). Overall this movie is a great romance that touches your heart, and makes you appreciate your loved ones especially after their gone. The laughs are also good with Whoopi and it's nice to see the now late Vincent Schiavelli have a small part as a subway ghost, who helps Patrick believe in his supernatural powers. Overall again one of the best movies of the 90's that taught us love, hope, and made us a believer that our past loved ones could be ghost. Also this picture helped make Demi Moore a superstar in the 90's, as she would earn 12 to 15 million a picture during this decade.",/review/rw1989888/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Ghost"" isn't very subtle, and similar themes have been done elsewhere with more depth, but I say just relax and enjoy.  The best reason is of course, Whoopi Goldberg, who is hilarious and as always, very good. As for the story and the characters' reactions  not being plausible, you really need to have a little imagination when you watch movies!  I give any movie credit for not being bad, since there are so many dreary movies out there, and Ghost is not bad.",/review/rw1989888/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 1999,lynx99,10," This is one of the most touching love stories ever made.
","Ghost is one of my favorite films.  It is romantic and touching. Ghost shows the love that transcends even death. The chemistry between Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze is incredible.  The way they look at one another is sexier than any of those very graphic ""love scenes"".  They make a real romantic connection just through their eyes.  Ghost not only has wonderful, likeable characters in Sam Wheat, Molly Jensen, and Oda Mae Brown, but it has an engrossing plot that moves right along.  Entwined in all this is a beautiful score.  The theme song ""Ghost"", written by Maurice Jarre specifically for the movie, is enchanting, and, of course, an oldie, ""Unchained Melody"", adds another magical touch to a magical film.",/review/rw1989888/?ref_=tt_urv

","You have to be pretty darn cynical to dislike this spiritual romantic drama that shows you don't have to expose breasts or buttocks to have a box-office winner that today remains a modern classic. It is a story of good vs. evil, a story of redemption and a story of what can bring about the damnation of the soul. The story focuses on two attractive young adults (Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore), so obviously in love, that even sudden tragedy can't end. Moore, at her softest and loveliest, is an aspiring sculptor, and Swayze is her Wall Street broker fiancée. Their closest friend (Tony Goldwyn) is supposedly their biggest supporter, but the fates prove otherwise. When Swayze is shot and killed in a botched robbery, he is immediately separated from the physical but remains on earth as part of a mission to protect Moore from on-going evils. Swayze locates a fake spiritualist (Whoopie Goldberg) whom he quickly realizes can hear everything he says and haunts her until she promises to help him warn the woman he loves.",/review/rw1989888/?ref_=tt_urv
