1 September 2002,Buddy-51,," whacked-out comedy with a lot of laughs
","`Austin Powers in Goldmember' provides us with an hour and a half of inspired silliness.  Not all of the film's elements work equally well, of course  a seemingly common occurrence in even the best of comedies  but this third in the series of popular spy spoofs generates more laughs than almost any other movie released in 2002.

21 January 2007,ccthemovieman-1,8," Austin's Anatomy
","While the first two Austin Powers films in this comedic series concentrated on spoofing the late '60s/early '70s, James Bond movies and concentrated on female anatomy in the process, this one was centered on penises. I kid you not. (Hence, the title, a play-on-words from ""Goldfinger."") ",/review/rw2185502/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2010,TheLittleSongbird,7," The weakest of the series, but Myers still has his mojo
","After thoroughly enjoying the first two Austin Powers movies, they were daft but enormous fun, I watched this third instalment. I was disappointed admittedly, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The plot takes the whole meaning of daftness to a whole level, so some of it verges on ridiculous, and while Mike Myers is brilliant as Austin and Dr Evil, he overdoes it as the Dutch villain Goldmember and the cameos are very hit and miss. That said, the sets and costumes are still wonderful, the soundtrack is groovy and the script is comedy gold with the cool catchphrases, bad-taste buffoonery and surreal slapstick. In terms of supporting performances Beyonce Knowles is a knockout as sexy and sassy Foxxy Cleopatra and Michael Caine is a dentally-challenged delight as Austin's dad. Seth Green is also fun as Scott Evil. Overall, an inferior sequel, but it was still a lot of fun, with Myers still having his mojo. 7/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2185502/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2021,Calicodreamin,7," Tight like a tiger
","A great end to the trilogy, goldmember has the laughs and has some great moments. The storyline is bogus, but it doesn't matter, there are so many iconic scenes that it makes up for everything else.",/review/rw2185502/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,7," About as good as the second
","While this is still not as funny as the first one, it's still worth watching. It has a load of recycled jokes from both of the earlier films, and a little too many references to the first, in my opinion. It's not entirely bad though, after a slow start it kicks off and gets very funny, very quickly. Most of the old characters return, with a few new ones too. The plot is pretty much the same old deal from the first two, still spoofing old Bond movies. The acting is still pretty good. The characters are more colorful in this one, I think. More developed, perhaps. The sexual crude humor is still there, and is better here than in the second movie, I think. The first is still the best, but if you only see one of the sequels, I recommend you see this one. I thought the twist-in-the-end was pretty lame, but it didn't entirely ruin the movie, as it didn't seem totally out of character or totally unbelievable. I'd recommend this to anyone who liked either or both of the first two movies. The humor is mostly the same, and people who enjoyed the first two will most likely also enjoy this one. 7/10",/review/rw2185502/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2003,Poseidon-3,," The gold is a little tarnished
","The first Austin Powers film was so fresh, zany, charming, witty and  unique.  It took some time for many people to catch on (hence it's legendary  video rental record), but it was dazzlingly, mesmerizingly adorable.  The sequel came out and rather tarnished the prior film by either  dumping or revising various story elements and especially by taking a  turn towards the crude and vulgar. Still, it had it's share of  interesting moments and laughs. In this third installment, the goodwill  is almost completely gone. What remains is a hopelessly indulgent,  often foul and unfunny conglomeration of ""jokes"" and gags, many based  on bodily functions or other off-key subjects. That is not to say that  the film doesn't still deliver quite a few laughs. It's just that by  now, the whole enterprise seems very worn and familiar. There are  several truly funny sequences in the film, but mostly it is saved only  by some surprising and ""right on"" star cameos and the fresh appeal of  Knowles. The (typically) ludicrous plot kicks off with Powers having to  rescue his father (Caine) from the title character by travelling (too  briefly) to 1975. Then the whole parade of series characters is  involved in either starting or stopping the world's total destruction.  Myers is undeniably brilliant at creating various characters and giving  them each a voice of his own. He succeeds in creating these people who  seem real unto themselves. Unfortunately, he also is bent on catering  to what has to be a 13-year-old boy target audience with endless,  endless potty jokes and gross out gags. Some of them are very amusing.  Some of them are just gross. After a short while it becomes overkill.  Knowles (who is certainly no ""actress"") comes across as very attractive  and surprisingly charismatic on film. Her character is mostly  decorative, but she serves the purpose very, VERY well. Her  take-no-prisoners attitude is refreshing, even if she is continuously  shown being kicked in the face. By now, Myers is so much the whole show  that previous supporting cast members (Sterling, Green, Wagner, York)  can barely get a word in. Who knows how much of their stuff was cut in  the hour-plus of leftover material, but certainly plenty of Myers was  left in. It's hard to imagine the lengthier cut because this one seems  interminable, even with the bright spots. The opening sequence is  brilliant. The character named Dixie......hilarious full name. Other  creative and funny bits occur throughout, but the film can not escape  it's pall of crudeness and alienating self-indulgence.",/review/rw2185502/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2002,EmperorNortonII,8," Tarnished ""Goldmember"" Still Shines
","Mike Myers returns for the third installment of his ""Austin Powers"" franchise.  In ""Goldmember,"" he comes full circle with the histories of Austin and Dr. Evil.  Myers again plays shagadelic secret agent Austin Powers, his arch-nemesis Dr. Evil and horrible henchman Fat Bastard, and now also a new bad guy, the Dutch hedonist Goldmember.  I found this movie hilarious and outrageous!  It had a lot of crude humor, like Austin hiding behind Mr. Roboto's fountain.  But there was also a good amount of self-parody.  The best scenes included Dr. Evil's prison rap video, and the suggestive subtitles in Mr. Roboto's office.  The several cameos were also enjoyable, especially Ozzy Osbourne pointing out the joke carried over from ""The Spy Who Shagged Me.""  The scene with Godzilla and its copyright was a relevant joke, considering the MPAA's temporary ban on the use of the title ""Goldmember.""  I did have a complaint about the continuity.  The difference in Austin Powers' trademark ""choppers"" was noticeable.  And although I'd have liked an explanation for the absence of Felicity Shagwell, I'm glad she was not revealed in the movie as a fembot!  Anyway, with this third installment, Austin Powers goes out with a bang!",/review/rw2185502/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2002,JohnLennon1985,10," I LIKE GOOOOOOOOLD....member.
","If I can describe this movie in three words, I would say, ""Shagadelic, baby, yeah!"" Mike Myers, the comedic genius who made the phrases, ""Yeah, baby"" and the word ""Shag"" famous is back again in a movie that is superior to the Spy Who Shagged Me.",/review/rw2185502/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2020,masonsaul,8," Another great spoof movie
","Austin Powers in Goldmember is another great spoof movie for the franchise that while not as as funny as its immediate predecessor, is still great. Mike Myers is once again fantastic in his multiple roles and Beyoncé, Michael Caine, Seth Green and Verne Troyer are all great. It's consistently funny and hilarious at points. Jay Roach's direction is also great, it's extremely well filmed and well paced. The music by George S. Clinton and the soundtrack are good.",/review/rw2185502/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2020,ph_sorin,10," Myers is a genius
","Being a fan of Bond movies and also comedies, almost 20 years later I appreciate Austin Powers movies even more.
Silly, smart jokes, action, more cameos per second than probably any other movie, its a feast. Had me laughing the whole time.
I wish people like Myers be immortal, never stop doing movies and forever give us a bit of their genius.",/review/rw2185502/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2007,view_and_review,8," Myers does an excellent job as different characters
","I was a late comer to the whole Austin Powers craze. I passed on seeing the first two after seeing the trailers for them, I automatically figured they'd be dumber than dumb. I only saw this movie because 12 hour work shifts get really long and we have a t.v. here at work... so what are you gonna do?? ",/review/rw2185502/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2002,yoyomagoo,6," OK- but the worst out of the three
","To be brutal, this movie is cynical. I mean, Mike Myers is a funny guy, but this constant rehash of old material (see the radar jokes, the shadow-on-the-wall, the father-son misunderstandings) is just a bit worrying and suggests Mr. Myers has run out of ideas.",/review/rw2185502/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2007,evil_monkey2007,7," Goldmember = Pretty Good!
","Okay so this film has been reviewed at the cinema already, so I'll save the story details. I won't even mention the great opening sequence or the truly hilarious turn by Sir Michael Caine. Although both are highlights of the film.",/review/rw2185502/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2021,The-Sarkologist,7," Everything you loved, and more
","I would say that this film is rather strange, but then again it is Austin Powers so that sort of goes without saying. Well, I have now rewatched all three Austin Powers films, and I have to say they are actually pretty good. A part of me didn't like them back in the day, namely because of the heavy sexual innuendo that was present in the films, but these days I have lightened up a lot and I have come to really appreciate just how good these films are.",/review/rw2185502/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2019,johnnythegreaserboy,7," Still A Good Time Waster
","Although it's definitely not the best Austin Powers film, Goldmember is still a good little film to watch when there's nothing else on. There's still a chuckle to be had with a wonderful cast with Mike Myers reprising his role (well, roles) as Austin Powers and Michael Cain as Austin's father was a good choice. Despite being more in the 70s than the last two even though Austin is clearly a 60's stereotype, it's a good film to pass the time with a couple of laughs.",/review/rw2185502/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2003,Cipher-J,," A buffoonery on ""Goldfinger""!
","That no one but Mike Meyers could pull off the role of Austin Powers is made amusingly clear in the opening scene, which must be seen to be appreciated. To those who have cringed through one or more of the James Bond films, finding them obnoxiously sexist, chauvinistic and crass, the Powers films are deliciously over-the-top burlesques of that genre, even if some of the gags are relentlessly sophomoric.  Scatological humor is pervasive, especially of the soiled underwear, urinating and farting variety.  In one of the latter the character adds the comment, ""Even stink would say that stinks,"" and in another case, focusing on a bare behind, we get the tired old yawn, ""I always thought you were crazy but now I can see your nuts."" Note that is ""your"" and not ""you're,"" and juvenile puns of that form do tend to blemish the script at times.  Even so, most of the pranks are original, and it's a mindlessly fun film to watch.  Meyers is a comedic wizard, and he is supported at every turn by an outstanding cast.",/review/rw2185502/?ref_=tt_urv

25 September 2003,FiendishDramaturgy,7," By far, the BEST Austin Powers Movie!!
","When I first saw the reviews of this movie, the trailers and the previews in the theater, I thought, ""Oh wow, has Austin Powers lost its edge."" But I was misled by the ""teaser"" trailers. I did not, as a result, see this movie in the theater, but instead waited for it to come out on video.",/review/rw2185502/?ref_=tt_urv

11 April 2005,dgl1199,1," brilliance for idiots
","Are you kidding me? I actually walked out of this trash heap. This has to be one the dumbest, pointless, and most intellectually insulting movies ever made for the money and hype put into it. The real problem with a ""comedy"" like this is that the humour has no value, it just isn't funny. Mike Myers style is offbeat and random, which works when it has a good basis as it did with the James Bond nods in previous incarnations. The basis for this was low grade Howard Stern toilet jokes, one after another, nothing else. His ""Goldmember"" character was just.....odd. Not funny, not even interesting, just bewildering. I really believe the target audience for this one is composed solely of uncultured morons. It's really a shame because the first two Austin Powers flicks had a least some intellectual credibility to them. Myers has proved before that he can take something silly and obscure and make it appealing. This has no appeal. None. This is all about let's be as disgusting and stupid as possible and expect that everyone will love it because it's Austin Powers. And for that this film is immensely impressed with itself. A real let down. Save your money.",/review/rw2185502/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2010,bkoganbing,6," He Loves Only Gold
","Most of the cast of the first two Austin Powers films return for this third and latest Powers creation, Goldmember. I say latest and not last because I think with sufficient interest and the possibility of a good box office, Mike Myers could possibly be induced to revive Austin Powers and all the characters he created in the three films.",/review/rw2185502/?ref_=tt_urv
