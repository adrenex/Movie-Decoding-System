23 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Best Movie in THOR series
","The cast for Thor Ragnarok are all matched well, and the sibling chemistry between Tom Hiddleston and Chris Hemsworth is as natural as can be. Cate Blanchett as Hela, the goddess of death is frightening in her cruelty as well as physical perfection. But, the reason this movie stands alone is the multi talented Taika Waititi, the director of the film. His offbeat New Zealand style shows in every scene, humor throughout and a rocking 80s electronica soundtrack, the film will transport you as fast as Heimdall and the Bitfrost!",/review/rw3841367/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2017,ctowyi,8," This Thor is Thor-some!
","Frankly, I didn't like the first two Thor movies, the game plan was so clear from the get go. Same old ""save the world"" routines, brooding hero with a burden, a love connection born out of necessity and bloated battle scenes. It is the same blueprint for many superhero movies, but Thor has the God element that made the stories feel even more preposterous and ridiculous. It is hard to be vested in his quests because God don't die, hurt as much and can always employ one last deus ex machina that solves the unsolvable problem. But Thor: Ragnarok throws that over-used game plan out from Bifrost into an unknown territory, making it this year's best superhero movie. I know I know Justice League has not descended, but looking at the trailer it doesn't take a genius to see that it will be doing the above-mentioned routine.",/review/rw3841367/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2021,SPZMaxinema,9," The best Thor yet!
","The action and humor mixed up in this movie was done with such quality that you forget about the problems with this movie, if there are even any at all! Thor kicks butt along with new friends of his and unforgettable superhero power scenes that will make you smile! This was especially great seeing it in theaters!",/review/rw3841367/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2017,TheLittleSongbird,10," Thor and Marvel Cinematic Universe are at the top of their game
","Really enjoyed the first 'Thor' and loved even more its bigger, darker and bolder follow-up 'Thor: The Dark World'. 'Thor: Ragnarok' manages to be the best of the three, and is not just a strong contender for the funniest Marvel Cinematic Universe film (yes even more so than the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' films) but also one of their best to date.",/review/rw3841367/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2020,joiningjt,10," The best marvel movie of them all!! Humor and action!!
",This us a phenomenal movie has the whole super hero package plus some great humor. An incredible villian played by the flawless Cate Blanchett!! I like this even more than any of the avengers movies. This and guardians of the galaxy are the flagships of the marvel franchise.,/review/rw3841367/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2017,Troy_Campbell,9," Popcorn-blockbustering of the highest order.
","Being the 17th instalment into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), and the third in the solo-Thor series—generally the least liked within the MCU—it wouldn't be surprising if this cosmic adventure showed signs of repetition and fatigue. It doesn't, not one bit. The opposite is true in fact, thanks to the unique energy and ingenuity brought from New Zealand director Taika Waititi (Hunt for the Wilderpeople, What We Do in the Shadows). Waititi's comedy background is noticeably in full swing, the previously darker Thor outings traded in for a laugh-heavy vibe closer to Guardians of the Galaxy – the movie Ragnarok shares top spot with, as the MCU's funniest film. A throwaway gag about scissors from a side character made of rock (mo-capped and viced by the director himself) is pure Waititi, and the franchise's best one-liner since Chris Pratt's Starlord appreciated the artwork of Jackson Pollock. Of course a big budget means big action, and there's plenty here to thrill and delight: a tone-setting smack down of a fiery underworld demigod, a bruising gladiatorial contest between Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), an exhilarating spaceship chase, and the breathtakingly electric finale. This threequel is visually distinct too, Waititi opting for a grungy-disco 80s atmosphere over the more theatrical opulence of the first two Thor flicks. His use of slow-mo, backed to Led Zeppelin's 'Immigrant Song', for two key moments, is simply brilliant. Supporting Hemsworth, who has never been better as the macho God of Thunder, is Tom Hiddleston as fan favourite bad-good guy Loki, Cate Blanchett as the sneering God of Death Hela, Tessa Thompson as the cocky warrior Valkyrie and Jeff Goldblum as the eccentric Grandmaster, plus a raft of awesome cameos. A few minor nit picks: Idris Elba seems bored as the returning Heimdall, two previous major supporting characters (both females) are conspicuously absent, a talking Hulk doesn't quite work, and the narrative-retcon work could've been more subtle. But when a movie is this damn entertaining, a few quibbles are easily forgiven. Comfortably taking its place in the top echelon of MCU films, Thor: Ragnarok is hilarious, invigorating and popcorn-blockbustering of the highest order.",/review/rw3841367/?ref_=tt_urv

30 October 2017,ferguson-6,7," Zeppelin, Cate, Goldblum
","Greetings again from the darkness. The ultimate cinematic dilemma  how to make the next comic book movie stand out from the (many, many) others? The brilliant answer comes from director Taika Waititi and co-writers Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost – a screwball superhero action film that delivers not only the required alien war scenes, but also a campy villain for the ages in a movie that may be the funniest of the year.",/review/rw3841367/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2017,shawneofthedead,," Get ready to Ragnarok & Roll - this film is the most fun you'll have in a cinema all year!
","In some alternate reality, a movie bearing the title of Thor: Ragnarok has taken itself very seriously indeed: full of literal doom and gloom, it's an apocalyptic drama about the End of Days, as prophesied by Norse mythology. Since that pretty much describes the world in which we currently live, it's actually rather fitting that Marvel's 17th studio film is something else entirely. In our reality, Thor: Ragnarok is a wild, wacky and very welcome blast of pure joy - a raucous comedy that fuses an intergalactic road trip with buddy comedy, brotherly rivalry and battle domes. Thank Thor (and director Taika Waititi) for that!",/review/rw3841367/?ref_=tt_urv

29 October 2017,MuttleyAndTheHeliumGang,," Simply epic
","Well for what it's worth, Thor Ragnarok is definitely a satisfying and suitable ending when speaking of this year's MCU movies. Despite enjoying Spider-Man Homecoming a little more overall, partially because there were things I didn't like about Thor Ragnarok but there was very little I disliked about Homecoming, all in all, this film is really, really good. It's explosive and fun and colorful and enjoyable and looks terrific and exquisite all throughout. Is it overdone? You decide whether or not they overdid some things for this one. I see lots of people comparing it to Guardians of the Galaxy and while I don't fully agree, I can definitely say that there are some things that are reminiscent of the Guardians' movies, but certainly not in a bad way.",/review/rw3841367/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2017,FallenEye,7," RagnaRock, Paper, Scissors?
","There are two ways one can take oneself too seriously: 1. The Twilight Saga way or 2. The Dark Knight Trilogy way. What I mean is, Twilight was silly in taking itself seriously, because seriously, it didn't have the maturity required, both because of its directors and cast, to portray the necessary emotion for the desired results of profoundness. The Dark Knight Trilogy on the other hand, is like age old whisky; Swirl, smell, sip and swallow.",/review/rw3841367/?ref_=tt_urv

29 October 2017,austin0731,7," A very fun movie that sheds new light on the future direction of the MCU
","I think that this newest installment in the MCU, Thor:Ragnarok truly solidifies the MCU's new direction that has been commencing in phase 3. Contrary to the previous Marvel Phases this new Phase focuses on a new direction, in Phase 1 we had the origin stories which came together in the first Avengers movie. In Phase 2 we got some further world building in the different solo movies like Iron Man 3 and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. But, other than these entries Marvel's Phase 2 also gave us some experimental projects like Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant Man. Now in Phase 3 this experimental Marvel is coming in full force.

25 October 2017,joshbarton15,10," An utter blast
","Both missing in action since the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron, Thor and Hulk could be seen as the forgotten children of the MCU, and when they're two of the most popular characters with fans, that seems quite criminal to me. The two haven't really been done justice in their solo films yet, even though I'm a big fan of Thor, but with Taika Waititi on board to direct Thor: Ragnarok, my expectations were sky high.",/review/rw3841367/?ref_=tt_urv

","When the long-banished, not-known-to-exist first-born of Odin(Hopkins, whose parody of himself, as well as his somber take, are both great), his daughter Hela(Blanchett, delicious, loving every moment, and making for another one of the few and far between deeply memorable villains of the franchise) returns to Asgard, her tremendous powers and thirst for conquest mean Thor(Hemsworth going for dry, sarcastic wit, and it works) and Loki(yet again in a new personal situation with his family, albeit overall, he does little to affect what happens) have to stop her. However, they're stuck in Sakaar, prisoners of the dictator The Grandmaster(Goldblum, with his charm turning threatening from one second to the next). And then our titular hero is made to fight the gladiatorial champion – The Hulk(Ruffalo getting to expand the role's vocabulary, personality, and tragedy/pathos – albeit not far enough. It doesn't extend to properly exploring what he's been doing, fighting beings no match for him, previously invariably to the death, despite him leaving Earth was literally specifically to flee this exact thing. They stopped short of where the comic went with it, sadly. The supporting players are appreciated, though).",/review/rw3841367/?ref_=tt_urv

31 October 2017,PyroSikTh,8," Welcome to the Marvel Cosmic Universe!
","Okay so the first thing to note about Ragnarok, which if you have enough brain cells you'd guess yourself after seeing the trailer, is that it's nothing like the previous two Thor movies, beyond sharing some characters and settings. The tone is completely different. In fact it's probably better to compare Ragnarok to Guardians of the Galaxy with it's straight comedy angle and influx of neon colours and whacky concepts. This is the new world order for Marvel's Cosmic Universe in full swing. How this makes me feel isn't quite so clear. As I said, I really didn't mind the other Thor movies, and to see the brooding seriousness get thrown out entirely, particularly in a movie about the end of days, seems like a misplaced choice. That said this is what Waititi does best, and he's on top, What We Do in the Shadows form here.",/review/rw3841367/?ref_=tt_urv
