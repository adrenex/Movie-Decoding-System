19 March 2006,ccthemovieman-1,10," This Is About As Good As It Gets For A Family Movie
","When this came out -- years ago, I thought, ""Wow, this is pretty amazing"" and since then movie audiences have been amazed at a number of camera tricks, computer-enhanced people, animals, monsters, and who knows what....so this kind of story with fun special effects is no longer is unique.",/review/rw5588115/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2008,Chrysanthepop,," A Pig's Fascinating Tale
","Remember the times when a parent or a grandparent would read to a child in bed, so that the child can visualize the story and comfortably sink into his/her dreamworld? Well, 'Babe' feels like such a story. It is a heartwarming tale about a Pig (called Babe by her 'Mom') and her friends at the farm. Chris Noonan executes it in such a wonderful way. The film is broken into chapters (just like in a book) and the lovable talking animals appear like very real and humanistic characters. the lip-syncing is impeccable. Also, I liked that the film doesn't completely refrain from reality as it does show that pigs are killed for meat or that puppies are given away or sold to others. It stays honest. The voice-acting is very well done. Christine Cavanaugh's childlike voice remarkably fits Babe. Miriam Margolyes, Danny Mann, Hugo Weaving and Miriam Flynn are all pleasing. James Cromwell is wonderfully restrained. The setting is a make-belief story-book farm. I found myself wondering, 'Is this an English farm?' and at the same time being confused that the people were speaking with an American accent but there's really no need to pick on that because it simply doesn't matter. Just enjoy the beautiful farm and the lovely characters. 'Babe' is one of the finest family films. Kids will surely love it. Heck, even I loved it when I saw it during my late teens...and I still love it as an adult.",/review/rw5588115/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2002,bob the moo,," Disarmingly charming and wonderful
",Babe is separated from his family and becomes friends with some of the animals on his new farm.  He learns that each animal has a role to play and that both he and Ferdinand the duck are fated to be lunch!  Both take new roles to escape their fate and Babe tries to become a sheepdog.  As Farmer Hoggett begins to notice the unusual way Babe can work with the sheep he begins to groom him for that role Â– much to the worry of his wife and the other farm animals.,/review/rw5588115/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2018,areatw,7," Charming film, impossible to dislike
","I think genre preferences go out of the window when a film like 'Babe' comes along. It's easy to see why this film is so universally popular, the story is delightful and the main characters so likable and endearing. The idea of a having a film centre on a cute pig may have raised a few eyebrows at first, but after only a few minutes any doubts anyone had will have gone.",/review/rw5588115/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2007,Jakethemuss,8," Family Classic
","This is a family film in the classic sense of the word, and it'd be hard to find a more charming and heartfelt tale. Ideally for children, but it can be enjoyed by adults too. It is a fantasy world where animals speak just like humans do.....albeit not in Australian accents, which is where the film is meant to be set.",/review/rw5588115/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2020,milesgreg,8," Underrated
","My god, a 6.7 average score and nominated for 7(SEVEN) oscars?? It has been a very long time since I've seen this movie but it's great. Very original and wonderfully done.",/review/rw5588115/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2009,planktonrules,10," Absolutely precious...
","All too often, children's movies are simply insipid for adults who get suckered taking the kids. The kids are happy but the parents are continually checking their watches to see when the film ends! BABE is a rare family film in that it has appeal to all ages. I know when I took my then five year-old to come see it, we both enjoyed it and now 14 years later, we still adore this film as much as ever.",/review/rw5588115/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2008,LunarPoise,10," That'll do, filmmakers
","I was privileged to see this in the cinema in Melbourne years ago when it first came out and the buzz was just starting. A young-ish, single man at the time, I was dragged along oozing skepticism - but came out loving it unreservedly. I just watched it again with my two kids, aged seven and five, and watched them lap up the magic. It was wonderful to re-visit the film through their eyes. When The Boss takes the shotgun to the barn thinking Babe has savaged the sheep, they were genuinely fearful. They hated the laughter of the crowd at the sheepdog trials when Fogget appears with a pig. They cried when that derisive laughter turns to cheers (though not as much as me...).",/review/rw5588115/?ref_=tt_urv

27 September 2014,SnoopyStyle,8," Sincere feel good charmer
","Babe is the runt of the litter who was born in a factory farm. He gets picked as the worthless prize in a country fair. Farmer Hoggett (James Cromwell) who doesn't keep pigs, wins him in a guess the weight contest. Babe ends up being raised by the sheep dog mother Fly. He befriends the various animals. With the help of Ferdinand the Duck, he gets into trouble and slowly learns the way of the farm. He is doomed to be Christmas dinner for Esme Hoggett but Farmer Hoggett convinces her to save his life. Then Farmer Hoggett notices something strange about the pig.",/review/rw5588115/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2003,yahweh25,10," Blew me away!
","I was one of the biggest detractors of this film when I initially found out it was nominated for an academy award back in 1995.  A talking pig?  You gotta be kiddin' me!  Then, months after Braveheart walked with the award, I finally saw the infamous ""Babe.""  Wow!  Was I ever wrong.  This movie not only deserved the nomination, but was a close, close second out of the five nominees in my book (Braveheart rightfully won, but I would have had no trouble had Babe won).  I love this film because it has a sweet lining, yet tells a deep story about resolve, goodness, and the struggles of life in a very large sense.  It makes you think, but more importantly, it makes you WANT to think about how all our lives are interconnected and what can be done by each seemingly insignificant individual to make the world a better place.  That's saying a lot, when a guy who loves stuff like True Romance digs on a piggy movie.  If you haven't seen this, buy it immediately.",/review/rw5588115/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2009,TheLittleSongbird,10," Enchanting classic for the whole family to enjoy
","Babe is such a charming and enchanting film, that even the fussiest adult can't help finding it easy to like. Babe himself, voiced by Christine Cavanaugh(Darkwing Duck and Dexter's Laboratory) is an adorable character, and one scene in particular when his mother is taken away is a genuine tearjerker. The other animals are also just as engaging, including Ferdinand, and are well voiced by the likes of Miriam Margoyles and Hugo Weaving. The human characters were very warm and likable, and James Cromwell and Magda Szubanski were both wonderful. The film looks lovely, there is a nice story and the music is just superb, with Saint Saens' Organ Symphony and Delibes' Pizzicato. And I loved the singing mice, they were really sweet and funny. All in all, a true classic. 10/10 Bethnay Cox",/review/rw5588115/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2003,ChristopherRice,," An astounding film
","I was dragged to this film by my girlfriend (now wife) when it first came out in fall of 1995. I had zero interest in what seemed to me nothing more than a kids movie. I recall sitting in the theater before the movie commenced, looking at my watch and estimating the time it would end, when my life could begin again after this rude 90 minute interruption.",/review/rw5588115/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2014,OllieSuave-007,8," A feel-good and heartfelt animal movie!
","This is a feel-good animal film based on the children's novel, Babe, a story about Farmer Hoggett (James Cromwell) winning a runty piglet named Babe at the local fair. The pig befriends the other animals on Mr. Hoggett's farm and learns and takes on the job of sheep-herding.",/review/rw5588115/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2005,roidessinges,10," Positively Sublime
","An extremely quirky film that you won't mind watching with the kids. Not full of sappy platitudes, this strange little tale of a pig that wants to be a sheep dog is extremely effective in it's message without hitting you in the head with it. No doubt because it wasn't made in Hollywood... we Americans have never been good at telling children's stories without being condescending and heavy-handed with the moral message.",/review/rw5588115/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2007,AZINDN,10," The Little Pig Who Could
","Some films are so enjoyable that it is nearly impossible not to smile through them as they teach subtle lessons, and Babe is one of the best. It is the odd being that can't laugh at the antics of the animals of Farmer Hoggit's farm as Ferdinand, a duck tries to usurp the role of the rooster, three literate and musical mice read title cards aloud for younger audience members, and best of all, Babe, a Hoy piglet, learns the job of the brilliant herding dogs Rex and Fly, to win the annual sheep herding competition. Clever animation, well done animatronic creature-doubles, and a menagerie of superbly trained farm animals makes the story of the little pig who could be more than just bacon for breakfast a film for the entire family. A simple story that underscores that hard work and tolerance for those different from oneself is to be respected in the kingdom of all animals, Babe certainly brings to the screen through comedy and drama, lessons all ages can understand.

10 November 2005,Lady_Targaryen,8," Adorable Movie
","Babe is one of the cutest movies already made! It's the story of a little pig, who starts living in the farm of the farmer Arthur Hoggettt and Esme Hoggett.There,he meets many new animals,like the Sheepdogs Fly and Rex,their puppies,Maa the Ewe and Ferdinand the duck,among other animals.Winning the respect of his new owner Arthur,Babe needs to prove that he is more than an ordinary pig, who was born to be human's food: he enters the competition for the sheepdogs and wins of all the pedigree-winning animals. His trick is to be polite with the other animals, different from the sheepdogs, that only achieve their tasks being rude to the ewes. Babe is a cute movie, not only for kids,but also for adults. It has a powerful message about being polite and helping others and also to never let anyone put you down, saying that you were not capable to do something.",/review/rw5588115/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2011,indyscott53,," Terrific music
","I'm surprised that none of the reviews I read of Babe (there are 146 of them) mentioned the music. How can you watch this and not be moved by the terrific use of music? Well, quite simply, you can't I think. Still it seems that no one is consciously aware enough of the music to even mention in their reviews. Just today, I heard the 4th movement of Camille Saen Sans 3rd Symphony, the ""organ symphony"", and immediately I was reminded of the movie.",/review/rw5588115/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2000,tfrizzell,," The ""Citizen Kane"" of Talking Pig Films.
","""Babe"" is one of those films that is so warm, wholesome, funny, and dramatic that it is near impossible to dislike. All the animals on Farmer Hargett's land (played quietly by Oscar-nominated James Cromwell) are as real and vulnerable as regular people. One animal, the titled pig, has a heart of gold that will forever alter all the beings in the film for the better. Chris Noonan's direction (Oscar-nominated) and the amazing special effects, which were done primarily by Jim Henson's creature shop, give the film a genuine feel to it. There was no over- indulgence either as the film runs a crisp 92 minutes minutes. Stands very tall with ""Braveheart"" and other notable pictures of 1995. 5 stars out of 5.",/review/rw5588115/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2006,Hitchcoc,9," A Children't Story with a Hard Edge
","This is a masterful story of a little pig, who, like the one in Charlotte's Web, is one step away from the Hormel plant. The reason the movie works so well, is that we see the musings of Babe about the everyday events that take place on the farm. Each of the animals has a set of human qualities, pride, stubbornness, stupidity, you name it. The farmer is that. He doesn't see the animals in any particular way; they are farm animals. What they do in the scheme of things determines their value. When Babe shows an aptitude for rounding up sheep, he becomes of greater value. Even his name is the name that all the little pigs in his litter were called. Things develop as a result of a jealous dog who sees his role threatened. James Cromwell is wonderful as the farmer. He uses that wonderful long face to show expressions, so subtle. He is a serious man, which is probably about par for the course among farmers. But he has a joyous side he doesn't show often. There are some scenes of genuine affection toward the little pig. Maybe it's just that we are all God's creatures and entitled to a little kindness along the way. My kids loved this movie when they were small. We loved it too.",/review/rw5588115/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2006,lee_eisenberg,9," even family films can be well done
","""Babe"" seems like the sort of movie that could come out mind-numbingly sappy. But they did a very good job with it. Portraying a pig becoming a sheep herder, one gets a look into the world as seen by farm animals. Probably the most perceptive aspect was the part about why sheep think that all dogs are wolves. As someone who usually takes no stock in movies like this, I definitely recommend this movie. And above all, this movie showed what a great actor James Cromwell is. Also featuring the voice of Hugo Weaving (of ""The Matrix"" and ""V for Vendetta"" fame). Check it out.",/review/rw5588115/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2006,KUAlum26,10," Wonderful movie!
","I recall first watching this movie in August 1995(I've seen it again no fewer than twice since) with minimal expectations,figuring it was at least better than the poorly planned Gordy,which was released earlier that year(if I recall correctly),and wondering if they could pull off the ""talking pig"" film for kids. What I found simply blew me away.",/review/rw5588115/?ref_=tt_urv
