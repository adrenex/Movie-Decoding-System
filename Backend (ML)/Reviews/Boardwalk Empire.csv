27 August 2003,cariart,," A Terrific Homage to Classic Westerns!
","TOMBSTONE, one of two epic westerns about Wyatt Earp released within a few months of each other (1993-94) lacks the lyrical, 'warts-and-all' quality of Kevin Costner's WYATT EARP, but is a more successful film, with tighter pacing, more clearly drawn characters, and a reverence to the genre that has made it the most popular Western of the last twenty years.",/review/rw0330667/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2010,subego,9," For Val, a role of a lifetime
","I wont review the film here as it has all been said before. I did want to praise Val Kilmer's portrayal of ""Doc"" Holiday. Throughout the entire film, his acting and character embellishments are so nuanced and well done that by movies end, we feel his loss in a very personal way. Credit must also go out the the costumers and make-up artists for their contribution to the overall effect of his role. All the way through the film, he looks sickly, pale and world-weary. His mannerisms and intensity of gaze profoundly establish this character as a focal point in this production. But as for what I started this off with, I consider this role as probably the very best for Val Kilmer. It required subtlety and careful restraint and made the viewer believe that we weren't watching an actor merely regurgitating lines and hitting their foot-marks. I, for one, was entranced by the carefully studied body language and facial expressions...the sweaty desperation of a man who sensed his own mortality but strove to enact his own justice for justices sake. This was just very well done!",/review/rw0330667/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2008,princesss_buttercup3,9," Cowboys are my weakness!
","It's funny, but I notice most of the prior comments are from guys, but speaking as a woman, this is by no means just a guy's flick. It's been one of my favorite films since the day it came out. It's got everything- drama, romance, action, and an honest to goodness story. There are even interesting themes, like the moral dilemma that Wyatt finds himself in-- Is he compelled to help fight the Cowboys even though he's ""retired"" and just wants to live out his life in peace? Is there a moral equivalence between killing for justice and killing for retribution? How far can a man go to sacrifice his own integrity and better judgment? Even though the Earps are the ""good guys"", the movie doesn't glamorize violence. Doc Holliday and some of the Earps' other sidekicks (""Creek Johnson"" and ""Texas Jack"") are obviously pretty shady characters, but at the end of the day, are forced to choose between right and wrong, and they choose correctly. It doesn't get much better than Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holliday, and I can't for the life of me understand why he didn't get nominated for it. I also appreciate the fact that the love story between Wyatt and Josephine didn't dominate the film and take away from the real plot, ala ""Titanic"". The love story simply served its purpose in helping viewers to better understand the character of Wyatt. Also the friendship between Wyatt and Doc was portrayed tenderly but not wussily. And okay, as a woman, let me just say that there is no one sexier than Sam Elliot. Man alive, if there ever was a person born to portray a cowboy, that guy is IT. If you've never seen a Western, or are not a fan, try this movie. It will make a believer out of you.",/review/rw0330667/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2004,oneflewovertheapocalypse,," Val Kilmer's Greatest Performance
",Now Tombstone is a film that I would call the last great western of its genre so far.   It has every sub plot you could want in you're average film and especially in a western.  They have a great cast on board also to establish this gang of ragger muffins.  Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp is just as good as Costner and Lancaster were.  Val Kilmer is probably the main reason why every fan of it's genre talk about it so much as he is not just a fine actor in this but you believe that Doc Holiday and him were somehow related as he takes on the exact same sense of humour which I have read in books and his likeness is there also from what I have seen in pictures.  ,/review/rw0330667/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2014,SnoopyStyle,7," Val Kilmer steals the show
","Tombstone, Arizona is a boom town from silver and is hounded by an organized gang called the Cowboys. It is led by Curly Bill Brocius (Powers Boothe). Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn) is a cold-hearted killer. After success in Dodge City, Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) moves to Tombstone to find riches and a more simple life. He is joined by his brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott), Morgan (Bill Paxton), and close friend Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer). Despite having his wife Mattie there, he becomes infatuated with actress Josephine Marcus (Dana Delany). The Earps get into confrontations with the Cowboys which eventually leads to the shoot-out at the OK Corral.",/review/rw0330667/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2001,tfrizzell,," Everything That ""Wyatt Earp"" Wanted to Be
","""Tombstone"" is one of the best westerns ever made. It was overshadowed in the early-1990s due to the success of ""Dances With Wolves"" and ""Unforgiven"". While ""Tombstone"" is not on par with either of those films, it is an exciting shoot-em-up western that works because it never tries to be more than it is. The Earps (Kurt Russell, Sam Elliott, and Bill Paxton) are looking for their fortune out west. However, trouble ensues as ruthless cowboys are reigning terror all over the region. Powers Boothe and Michael Biehn are the leaders of the bad dudes and a massive showdown is the only answer for all concerned. Also along for the ride is Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer, in arguably his greatest role). ""Tombstone"" also has one of the greatest casts of recent memory. Some of the faces that will be seen include Charlton Heston, Dana Delaney, Stephen Lang, Billy Zane, Jason Priestley, and Billy Bob Thornton. 4 stars out of 5.",/review/rw0330667/?ref_=tt_urv

","Tombstone has to be one of the most truly touching and brilliant films I have ever seen. The action sequences are great and the acting is brilliant, in particular Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday in what is probably the best supporting actor role I have ever seen.

26 May 2006,Bogmeister,8," Earps & Doc vs.Mean Cowboys as early Organized Crime
","A late entry in the western genre when already not too many were being made, this is one of those re-watchable mini-epics, with strong entertainment value. It begins with a bang, an intense shoot-out after some supposedly historical footage narrated by actor Mitchum. We are introduced to The Cowboys, this era's version of the Mafia, led by the charismatic Curly Bill (Boothe). These first few minutes manage to unnerve and surprise the audience right away: we are also introduced to the psychotic gunslinger, Ringo (Biehn), but he's revealed as the most dangerous of the bunch only after the shoot-out, a sleight of hand by the filmmakers - they made him look sympathetic in those early moments while everyone is blasting away and he just stands there looking dazed and bothered. Only afterward do we realize he's a lethal lunatic of the damned - it's a powerful beginning.",/review/rw0330667/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 1998,Tepman,10," One of the finest westerns ever filmed. Excellent...
","One of the finest westerns ever filmed.  Excellent action.  A very good script.  The cast was amazing.  Val Kilmer should have received an Oscar for his role as Doc Holiday.  The movie was probably about 90% accurate historically, but was one of the best retellings of what had occured.",/review/rw0330667/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2007,www-soulreaper555,10," I'm your Huckleberry
","Probably the best Western I have ever seen, if mostly due to Kilmer's outstanding portrayal as Doc Holliday. He lacks, in my opinion, much of the gruffness of John Wayne which, although good, gets boring after so many films. The look on Ringo's face when he realises his opponent is Holliday, not Earp, is priceless, and shows you just how great a reputation Doc has that a man praised as ""The deadliest pistoleer since Wild Bill"" is now making excuses not to go up against him. Russel's performance is also commendable, showing a man who has seen too much blood in his life and wishes simply to settle down, but Kilmer simply cannot be ignored as the drunken but suave gambler.",/review/rw0330667/?ref_=tt_urv

14 August 1998,Sickfrog,10," The Good Wyatt Earp Film
","Proof that westerns can be fun, Tombstone delivers an action-adventure popcorn movie that doesn't have to be campy and one-dimensional to be enjoyable. Here, Wyatt Earp biography is told like a fable. Sure, the facts are often recalculated in this film. But this is not looking to give a straight-on accurate view of Wyatt Earp's life. This is trying to take a man's life as a basis and then add to it to make a cinematic joyride. As opposed to the overlong and plodding ""Wyatt Earp,"" this film decides to have a good time with the story and not get too bogged down in the misery. Kurt Russell is powerful as awful, and no man can deny that Val Kilmer, in his finest performance to date, was fully due for an Oscar nomination, if not an Oscar win. And Michael Biehn also gives a first rate performance as the sadistic Johnny Ringo. This is a thrill ride for anyone who loves westerns, or a good film to try to get others to start watching westerns.",/review/rw0330667/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2020,Xstal,7," Revenge for Being Born...
","Delivered to the big screen at a time when the Western was as fashionable as flared jeans, this semi-factual presentation still uses the oft used effect of yore; to load the bad guys guns with blanks to demonstrate the super human capabilities of the heroes. It's still done today but with laser guns and any number of exotic weapons replacing them - and we still forgive it regardless. Notable, primarily for an unforgettable rendition of Doc Holliday or, Val Kilmer not playing Val Kilmer for a change, this ultimately represents another closing down sale for the Supercowboys franchise as the encroaching Superheroes drive them out of town. It has all the ingredients that made the genre great in its day but, remove the sentimental value from the mixing bowl and the reason for its decline is as plain as plain flour for all to see.",/review/rw0330667/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2004,RareSlashersReviewed,," It may not have a deep heart, but its a hell of a lot of fun...
","The 1990s looked set to be a promising decade for the Western genre after the Oscar darlings Unforgiven and Dances with Wolves cleared up the Academy respectively in 90 and 92. Hot on the heels of those modern-day classics came two individual accounts of Wyatt Earp's legendary life as a lawman. Wyatt Earp boasted an interesting cast in Gene Hackaman, Kevin Costner and Dennis Quaid with strong assistance from an excellent ensemble that included Tom Sizemore and Michael Madsen. Although it was a fairly decent effort, offering a consuming account of the gunslinger's whole life from his humble upbringing and the death of his first wife to his renowned battles with Outlaws like the infamous shoot-out at the Ok Corral. It couldn't help but feel plagued by a yawn inducing 183 minute running time and an uncharismatic turn from Costner in the lead. Tombstone on the other hand, begins when Earp and his brothers move to the town named in the title and is - for the most part, a far more direct and satisfying approach.",/review/rw0330667/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2016,Leofwine_draca,8," The cast alone makes this worthwhile...
","TOMBSTONE is yet another retelling of the famous story of Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, and the gunfight at the OK Corral. The subject is a well-rehearsed one having been covered elsewhere in the likes of John Ford's MY DARLING CLEMENTINE and the Kevin Costner epic Wyatt Earp. However, TOMBSTONE is well worth a look despite the familiarity of the material, and the reason for that is the cast.",/review/rw0330667/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2003,blackadder1999,," good god y'all
","As a Tucson Native, I was totally impressed. Most people from other parts of the world will believe any western with a saguaro in it. This movie is one of the best of all time, and I worked at Old Tucson. If you're looking for a historical timeline, forget it. It's condensed for dramatic purposes, but still it flows, it's got love, action, comedy(mostly Kilmer) and a serious story of what the old west really was like. Amen for this one as opposed to the tragic The Quick and the Dead which was kinda silly if your brain is turned on whilst watching it. Watch for Priestly's, um, unusual performance. It also has a great back story on Earp's life, which makes for much more than a shallow shoot'em up movie.",/review/rw0330667/?ref_=tt_urv

","God bless George P Cosmatos. To anyone who is a fan of the old west genre, holy smokes!! This little piece of western history hit with a thunderous explosion. Tombstone, was in theaters around the time that Eastwood's-- ""Unforgiven"" was just heading out. That (Clint's western saga) won a lot of awards, but to my dismay, it seems as though ' they ' missed this one. To me this is what Oscars are made of . Steely-performances that bring the viewer to a place of awe. Simple. This film of the old west, that some will quibble about the fact that they didn't go into further detail on the lives and events that were part of each character here. Or that some of the facts were traded or missed all together in Tombstone. The director had set this western up and many others on their heels. Everybody mentions Val Kilmer in this as the incomparable 'Doc' Holiday. No doubt that he was indeed just that. ",/review/rw0330667/?ref_=tt_urv

12 February 2020,planktonrules,8," While it still promotes some of the old west myths, it's far more accurate than most westerns.
","In movie westerns, there were shootouts all the time, Indian attacks and chaos. Well, this is true...in films. But in reality, the west was not so lawless and things like the shootout at the OK Corral were the exception rather than the rule. So, when you watch ""Tombstone"" understand that in many ways it is more historically accurate than most westerns but it still presents an image of western life that isn't really true....at least not for the average person living out west back in the day. So, when you watch the movie, just understand that it represents an exception...not the rule. And, while this might surprise you, the famed shootout wasn't even seen as anything that important when it happened...and it was only because of Wyatt Earp's publicizing it so much in the 1920s and 30s that we think it was some big to do today.",/review/rw0330667/?ref_=tt_urv

","First of all, I love the movie. Now some may say, ""What a moron..."" and others will undoubtedly agree with me. But I think it's great. When I first saw the film as it debuted in theaters eleven or so years back, I came away thinking, Men doing a man's job. Sounds a little chauvinist, I'll admit, but there you are. The movie is a tribute to men being men, living their lives on their own terms. The fact that the story is about the Earp saga is almost secondary to the film. To enjoy this movie, I don't think that it's so important for it to have historical accuracy to the letter or even have rain falling consistently through the shots. I would only advise viewers to let this Remington-painting-come-to-life wash over them and just go along for the ride. As long as we remember that this is Hollywood, all is well.",/review/rw0330667/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'll get on a roll every now and then, and right now I'm into the Earps and the Gunfight at the OK Corral. Actually I'm coming back to the subject having watched 1994's ""Wyatt Earp:Return to Tombstone"" last week, which in turn caused me to do some more reading and research on the topic. Both movies actually get a lot of the history of the Earp Brothers down pretty accurately, right down to some of the nuances that led to the famous gunfight. Like Wyatt Earp bumping into Tom McLaury coming out of The Oriental, and cold cocking him to provoke a confrontation. There were a lot of those historical tidbits sprinkled throughout the story, so that if you learned about them ahead of time, you would be even more intrigued by the film.",/review/rw0330667/?ref_=tt_urv

","I loved this movie so much I bought it right after seeing it the first time. The acting is incredible in this film.  I'm not a huge Kurt Russell fan, but he played his role very well.  Among others, I consider this one of Val Kilmer's best performances.  Even if your not a Western fan (like me), you'll still at least enjoy this film.
