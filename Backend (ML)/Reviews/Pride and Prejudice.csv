11 August 2020,andrewchristianjr,5," SUPER CRINGY.
","Almost painful to sit through. Story could be condensed into a minute long, bad dialog spaced out with awful montages. Predictable and very very very cringy.",/review/rw5023816/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2021,rebeccacastledine,3," I've a headache
","The teen angst is so over played and corney.
My eyes hurt and my ears are needing from the corn fest. Normally I'd like abit if corniness but this is beyond what I'd tolerate.",/review/rw5023816/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2020,fabiennehoogewoud-845-936458,1," STOP Romanticizing Toxic Relationships!
","The fact that this movie won 3 Teen Choice Awards is seriously disturbing. Is this the kind of movie we want to promote to the female teen audience?
Bad boy just needs a good woman to tame him. NO! This is a toxic relationship, and we need to stop promoting it! So many teen movies have this at the core and it's sending the wrong message.
This is not what a good and healthy relationship looks like. This is what you RUN from. Ladies, you're not responsible for ""fixing"" a man.",/review/rw5023816/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2019,jelliejune,2," Cringy. Worst love story ever.
","I understand that I might not be the right audience for this film, it's more targeted towards twelve year olds that have never been in a relationship. But as someone who's going to be twenty-seven soon, this movie was so bad. So bad. So many things happen that don't make any sense!",/review/rw5023816/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2019,dar0417,4," Preedicable and boring.
",Just another typical run of the mill love story. This could have been played out as another Nicolas Sparks novel but it wasn't even up to par with his standard.,/review/rw5023816/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2019,lisafordeay,3," If you love Twilight and She's All That with a toned down Fifty shades of grey then this is it
","After is a 2019 Romantic Drama starring Josephine Langford,Selma Blair and Hero Fiennes Tiffin and tells the story of a young woman named Tessa who is starting college and meets a bad boy named Hardin (Hero Fiennes Tiffin) who Tessa later falls for despite the fact that Tessa has a boyfriend named Noah and the fact that Hardin is hiding a secret. So what's the secret you may ask well it turns out Hardin is using Tessa just for her virginity.",/review/rw5023816/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2019,andrea-sarmiento99,1," This was actually painful to watch
","I cringed every 5 seconds most forced writing and interactions I've ever seen in my life
It will literally make no sense to anyone who's never read the novels, you'll want to gauche your eyes out",/review/rw5023816/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2019,wisemanfromtowne,," Lame, lame and more lame.
","How many times has this film been done before? CW, CBS, Lifetime and all others cable networks as well have done this engilsh accent male role to give the lead guy some edge, as if engilsh accents makes a guy more attractive (ridiculous) and a simple American college girl fallen for the guy and finding out he's the type that goes on shooter sprees on college campuses. Lame, lame and more lame. This films only endorse white college student stupidity nothing more.",/review/rw5023816/?ref_=tt_urv

",What is this world coming to. Why would you promote such garbage. Stupid movie I could have done without.,/review/rw5023816/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2019,westsideschl,2," Formula to the Nth Degree
","Always, always a sign of cheap production/script is opening scene w/overhead view of car traveling on roadway. Furthering the formula, for our single mom's daughter being sent off to college, is the dorm scene meeting of her new roomie who of course is the polar opposite of our nice bookish daughter - duh!. Then comes the all too obvious being coaxed into a party instead of studying. Usual redux countless times scenario of alcohol, and girl meets guy which leads to problems & obvious resolution. Classroom scenes were totally fake, e.g. our two lovers arguing an interpretation of a bit of classical lit. Discord w/mom over her independence to do dumb things - predictable. To sell this story our producers only used model looks' actors.",/review/rw5023816/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2019,bealexandra,1," Save your money for something worth!
","I went to see this film with my hopes high since I have read the books multiple times and I absolutely loved them.
Well, I got really disappointed. If you have read the books, you're going to be really disappointed as well. If you haven't, you will not understand the story, since the action is overall really quick, so you don't really understand the scenes or why they are even there. It is boring because 90% of the film nothing much different happens, most of the times is just music playing and Tessa and Hardin kissing and making out. The dialogues are weak, they barely even talk, and if they do, is just hi and how are you. Basically, the characters met and 5 seconds later are already declaring eternal love. No sense at all. The storyline is poor and doesn't respect the film at all. For me, the film killed the book.
I feel like the characters didn't show much emotion. Hardin I just didn't feel the vibe. He is really superficial and his personality is just neutral.",/review/rw5023816/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2019,laurakoontz,1," I wasted 2 hrs that I could have used to drink paint.
","Holy crap this was the most garbage cliche movie ever. The main character Tessa who is not like other girls bc i study meets Hardin who is a bad boy but he like literature and is really rapey like really. The acting is dry and worse than aNY porno I have ever seen. If u want to watch this i suggest you watch 50 shades instead because at least it's graphic enough to distract you from the garbage plot. The plot was so bad and all the ""dramatic"" part made me and my friends laugh so hard. We laughed at a lot of inappropriate times like I could sense those angsty teen girl glares. This was a waste of money and time and I would rather bang my head against the wall for 2 hrs than watch it again. I would rather get lead poisoning from drinking paint and then proceed to drink a puddle in the parking lot of a taco bell.",/review/rw5023816/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2019,SnoopyStyle,3," flat soap
",Tessa Young (Josephine Langford) is a good girl. She is starting college and her simpleton boyfriend is still in high school. Her mother (Selma Blair) hates her new roommates. She is pulled into their party world and the mysterious bad boy Hardin Scott (Hero Fiennes Tiffin).,/review/rw5023816/?ref_=tt_urv

19 April 2019,FrenchEddieFelson,3," An ersatz of Rebel without a cause
","First things first, I clearly do not belong to the intended audience which is probably narrowed to female and romantic teens, between 11 and 15 years old. Possibly older, with a touch of nostalgia. Tessa, an ingenuous teen, leaves home, mum and high school in order to integrate university, her roommate inviting her to join an idle and carefree group. She meets there Hardin, a rebel without a cause (Nicholas Ray, 1956) but with a keen interest in literature, like herself. The continuation is relatively predictable and indubitably goofy. My own rating: 2/3 out of 10. My rating while trying to belong to the intended audience, with a generous empathy boosted to the extreme: 4/5 out of 10.",/review/rw5023816/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2022,TaylorYee94,7," Come on, it was not that bad.
","""The Great Gatsby, it's a good book."" That is how stereotypical 'After' gets. (AND that statement is so not true.) However, it's a good mix of clich√©. It still works: romantic vibes, fluttering heart, and sexual chemistry between a couple. Amplified sound of touching skin escalates passionate and erotic emotions of viewers. Most importantly (in romance films), chemistry is there between two actors. I want to compliment Langford and Tiffin on their decent performance as a leading roles for the first time.",/review/rw5023816/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2019,novaknika-80580,2," Disappointing
","Two people meet in college, fall in love very fast and then for the rest of the movie you watch them making out. The ""plot twist"" isn't even a twist. The book(s) are incredibly gripping, I don't understand why they had to tone the plot down this much. The movie should have been 18+, it feels like it's 12-.",/review/rw5023816/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2019,TxMike,," Pretty standard story, worth a watch for Josephine Langford.
","My wife and I watched this at home on BluRay, while it contains nothing particularly novel it is a mostly well written and well acted story.",/review/rw5023816/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2019,sasssin,1," Awful storyline, awful acting

11 April 2019,theromanempire-1,7," Josephine is the sweetest girl i have seen in years
","Josephine the girl who plays the lead role is the main reason to watch this average romantic drama which without Josephine would be boring as hell if u exclude last half an hour or so but Josephine and her chemistry with the the guy who played the other main role makes this movie worth of your time.
thank god we finally got something worth of a scenario twist in last 20 minutes and the movie ended strong but at the end Josephine is the reason to watch this film.",/review/rw5023816/?ref_=tt_urv

27 June 2019,SassySavage1,1," Worse than Twilight or 50 Shades of Grey
","I cringed everytime i watched Hardin and Tessa and their lines got me on my nerves so much. They take minutes to start talking and when they do it, they dont say anything relavant or logic and it sounds wrong. They do act like children or even worse.
Hardin is a wannabe trying to be creep, stalker, he's a baby boy, like grow up dude. The only issue with him happened when he was 8 years old like along time. Everyone has their traumatic experiences or stories. He's not even a victim of verbal or physical abuse from his family and he acts like his life is the worst...
He isn't even seen like a dangerous bad boy how the book portray him. Bad boys are strong, not a whiny baby... He's just an immature jerk and she is a disloyal girlfriend. I don't even understand how her boyfriend wasn't mad at her for betrayal. for accepting to be cheated on. I guess he was really tired of her. That or he had a girlfriend secretly too.
There is much i would say but i'm not even bothering my time. This movie sucks ass , bad message.",/review/rw5023816/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2019,randyunseen,3," Slow and Boring
",I was looking forward to watching this movie. Hoping that this movie would have a great twist. But it never happened like the trailer promised. I would recommend this movie if you can't sleep. Their is zero energy and horrible directing. I couldn't find one good seen in this entire movie...,/review/rw5023816/?ref_=tt_urv
