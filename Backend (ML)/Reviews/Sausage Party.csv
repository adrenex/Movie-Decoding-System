10 December 2020,Vartiainen,7," More films need to be directed by stuntmen
","Extraction stars Chris Hemsworth and was produced by the Russo brothers. It was directed by Sam Hargrave in his directorial debut. He has previously made a career as a stuntman, most notably as a stunt coordinator in several Marvel movies. And that definitely shows in the film. This film contains some of the nicest action set pieces seen in years.",/review/rw5670110/?ref_=tt_urv

10 May 2020,World-viewer,9," Well worth it.. wow
","Negative reviews have focused on the alleged shortfall in the depth of the plot. Really? Most action movies out there... how many have a plausible plot? At least for this movie, the plot is plausible, the action, obviously a stretch. But those critics railing on the movie forget what a movie is supposed to be all about. Entertainment. It's not a real life documentary, not an ensemble boring drama piece. When it comes to wham-bang entertainment, this movie delivers on all cylinders. The movie is probably more analogous to a version of masterful The Raid than an Oscar drama piece. Live with it. Watch it. Enjoy. It is a movie. It will keep you glued. Though the squeamish may need to take a break.",/review/rw5670110/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2020,jtindahouse,7," A violent film with some seriously good action sequences
","In a world that is currently minus new films, to get a fresh one delivered to us via Netflix was a much needed treat. And I'm glad to report that 'Extraction' was worth the wait. It isn't a flawless movie, but it certainly has some good things going for it. The action sequences were probably the highlight of the film for me. I'm not usually someone who appreciates or even notices good action sequences, but I did with this film which says something. There is one sequence that really blew me away. It is a one-shot sequence that goes on for quite some time and has some amazing ingenuity behind it. Definitely the highlight of the film.",/review/rw5670110/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2020,hellspuppy,7," Great action, zero plot
","The action scenes are really good. Close combat with extremely long shots in tight spaces. Sometimes it has a shooter video game feel to it. Hemsworth and the stunt team really showed of their skills. This movie is really more about close combat scenes, than crazy Hollywood stunts a la mission Impossible. Other than that, all the story is already in the title, which is fine for this type of movie. The actor, who played the boy was a wonderful casting choice. He was carrying the whole emotion of story. We'll be seeing more of him. Other characters were not drawn out. This movie is not for everyone, it is not well rounded, it's all action and no story. I personally enjoyed it though. I recommend this for viewers that like close combat action and martial arts movies.",/review/rw5670110/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2022,buc_nasty-87403,10," Ignore the 6.7 rating
",Dramatically underrated. 10/10. Mind blowing gunfights and close quarter combat. John Wick -ish but probably better action choreography. Some real good acting by the Indian kid and Thor between long amazing action sequences.,/review/rw5670110/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2021,mattforner,7," Exactly what I expect from Netflix.
","Extraction is a fun and average action flick that has awesome action, good performances, and a totally ""meh"" plot. But hey, this is exactly what Netflix is for and I'm totally okay with that.",/review/rw5670110/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2020,Top_Dawg_Critic,9," Jason Bourne meets Call of Duty, in Mumbai
","Wow shocked at the undeserving low score! This is stunt actor Sam Hargrave's first full length feature film sitting in the directors chair, and he nailed it. Outstanding action/fight choreography, great cinematography, perfect pacing for the 116 min runtime, and all around great performances, especially Hemsworth's kick-ass character. I'm reading the reviews about no plot... seriously? Just because there's no surprising unpredictable plot twist doesn't mean there's no plot. It was a simple story, adapted into a screenplay from the graphic novel by Ande Parks, and presented on a bullet ridden testosterone plate. What more does anyone want for that perfect weekend popcorn action flick? I thoroughly enjoyed it! It's a well deserved 9/10 from me.

20 December 2021,jdring2007,8," great action and straightforward plot, simple characters, fairly predictable, but enjoyable
","While a bit too dramatic at times, especially the sluggish last ten minutes, this movie excels as an action movie and takes the role of a mercenary one step higher in quality combat scenes. Hemsworth proves his acting chops more so in this, in my opinion, than in Rush (2013), and his ability to carry such a heavy and strenuous role especially in means of training. The fight choreography is stellar, and the long shots during the extensive chase scene were particularly impressive, further immersing the viewer in the tension. Other characters such as the boy were all depicted so realistically and humanly, even the ""bad guy."" There was really nobody that didn't deliver and that's what made the movie even more engaging. How it was ended, like the last thirty seconds, I also have to applaud.",/review/rw5670110/?ref_=tt_urv

7 May 2020,Jared_Andrews,5," Mindless Action that's actuallly pretty entertaining
","Netflix deserves praise for inserting some action in the form of a Chris Hemsworth-led action movie into our actionless quarantined existence. The movie zips along from one bloody shootout to another, maintaining a necessary level momentum to keep audiences intrigued.",/review/rw5670110/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2020,Fella_shibby,6," We have seen the plot umpteenth no of times, the action is nothing extraordinary, the villains were typical Bollywood style n laughable, the ending a big meh.
","Had expectations aft seeing the trailer but it all fizzled once the movie started playing.
It has a ridiculous story, tension n character development is nada.
I am totally surprised that inspite of this film being backed by Netflix, with amazing star cast, it lacked the substance.
The hand to hand combat with the knife is not thrilling. For the real deal (silat fighting) check out The Raid Redemption.
As a fan of Randeep Hooda, I am happy that he got a good role.
The babe is attractive.
The hint near the swimming pool at the end is again a big meh with the possible of a sequel.
Now that will be too much for a guy to survive with bullets pierced all over.",/review/rw5670110/?ref_=tt_urv

25 April 2020,Leofwine_draca,9," The best Netflix action film yet
","I've been watching all of the Netflix-produced action movies for a number of years now and have generally enjoyed all of them, particularly the run of movies starring Noomi Rapace that they released. I'm pleased to say that EXTRACTION is their biggest and best one yet, a large budget slice of action spectacle with an excellent setting in Dhaka. The Bangladeshi city is brought to life the same way that Morocco was in the third BOURNE film, with all the bustle and sights and sounds.",/review/rw5670110/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2020,the_real_smile,7," Nice performance completely in Bengali
","Chris Hemsworth did this whole movie in Bengali, at least, that is what I think, because for the most part you cannot understand one word he says. The action scenes are nice, al-dough the hero has a million bullets, can handle being seriously hurt with ease and the opponents can't shoot their own foot if they wanted and are in such numbers that it's a nice massacre. So if you like a plain story with lots of action you cannot go wrong with this one.",/review/rw5670110/?ref_=tt_urv

24 April 2020,attitude_321,8," Great Action and Chris is the best thing
","Well good action. Not that close representation of Dhaka, more of an Indian gimic. Hating the Indian accent, Bangladeshi doesn't have that accent.
Chris did well, story cud have been much more.
None the less good to see Dhaka in international names, tho it was negative.
Chris was the only good actor that i actually found, the kid speaks irritatingly slow and doesn't seem to gave the right face for the scene. Better cast wud have been better along with Chris.",/review/rw5670110/?ref_=tt_urv

15 May 2020,nickjl66,9," Forget the storyline just relish the action/directorship
","Thoroughly enjoyed this film - weak storyline but it's totally forgiven because of its brilliant action and the camera work on it is a thing of beauty.
you're glued to the car chases and fights to the point where you feel you should be smelling the exhaust fumes and that if you don't dodge out the way you're going to get a smack in the mouth or shot.
The Director could do a James Bond film no problem.
it's got the rawness of action that's needed",/review/rw5670110/?ref_=tt_urv
