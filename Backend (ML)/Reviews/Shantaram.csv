",Thoroughly enjoyed this show from start to finish.,/review/rw8697210/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2022,BrentCowey,9," So so so much better than expected
","(UPDATE. I thought this was brilliant. Just found out today that the absolute thick, moronic numbskull muppets at Apple have cancelled the second season stupid stupid of Apple!)",/review/rw8697210/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2022,rich-mac,8," This should be quite a ride
","I've been waiting for this for a long time, with a little trepidation, it's always in play when books that portray such a complete and immersive world get adapted.",/review/rw8697210/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2022,pete-collin,9," Apple TV Suck
","Came to write a glowing review for what is a superb adaptation of Greg David Roberts' novels. Not sure I need to as thankfully I'm not alone in thinking this was one of the best shows of the year. I've not always been Hunnam's biggest fan but he absolutely nails it, leading a wonderful ensemble of actors, all at the top of their game. Shubhab Saraf in particular gives a stellar performance as the street-sharp and immensely loveable Prabhu. A story of redemption and love set against a background of corruption, divides and the hardships they entail, the narrative races along immersing us in a strange new world that is foreign to all of us bar those who have visited India. I absolutely loved this show, with a passion.",/review/rw8697210/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Charlie Hunnam is such an underrated actor!
","I have to say I have never read or even heard of the books for Shantaram so I wasn't sure what to expect but being a Charlie Hunnam fan I thought I'd give it a try. So far so good. Hunnam does an excellent job as the lead here and the rest of the cast all do a good job too. Some people are complaining about his accent but I don't see any problems with it and if that's the reason you don't like the show then that's your problem. I've read that it stays pretty close to the source material so that should please some of the book lovers. It also portrays 1980's Bombay very well and the attention to detail is amazing. Overall the acting and storytelling is what makes this a good show. Hunnam is such an underrated actor, he's been great in just about everything he's been in. I'm glad that he's become the star he deserves to be.",/review/rw8697210/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2022,samabc-31952,8," Great adaption, Beautiful recreation of Mumbai, Commanding performance by Hunman,
","'Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows' - Shakespeare in The Tempest
Based on Gregory David Roberts's novel by the same name. Although, author claims it to be a novel but it is mostly an autobiography based on his days in Mumbai followed after his escaping from a maximum security prison. He began writing this novel during his prison stay and the manuscript was destroyed twice by the prison staff. I read this book during pandemic suggested by a friend. The story is thrilling ,electrifying and heartbreaking, poignant at the same time. It offers an emotional and philosophical experience and does not miss out the boisterous actions. The series (have watched only first 5 episodes) does recreate the 1980s Mumbai beautifully with vivid colors, the lamp-lit streets, from dhobighat and slums to the squandering affluent class, from a golden sunlight filling up the sultry air on the narrow streets of the city to the dancing moonlight on the cresting waves of the Arabian Sea. Bhupendra Singh's ghazal in one of the episodes is befitting the scene. The characters development is somewhat hurried but does not leave out much details. Commanding performance by Charlie Hunman as Lin, and equally convincong performances by the supporting cast, seamlessly woven the essence of author's experience with fictionalization but mostly the strong narrative that makes this series a great watch. I felt some parallels with Salaam Bombay by Mira Nair.",/review/rw8697210/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2022,bobetjo,8," Decent start
","Shantaram is quite well done with the atmosphere of Mumbai (Bombay) in the nineteen eighties portrayed accurately. The story is a more exciting rendition than the book, but still holds its own. Much of the scenery matches what I remember of the city. Even the giant open air laundry where Lin hides. The only thing missing is the traffic which even then was much heavier and gave the city its distinctive diesel smell.",/review/rw8697210/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2022,annemaree-99074,8," So far enjoying the adventure
","When the book was released people I know either loved it or hated it. One of my friends thought that Shantaram was going to change her life, I remember working in a dead end job and the staff shared a dog eared copy, dreaming of a better life. Another person howled at what he saw as a poorly written self-help manual. I think how you responded to the book depended on your state of mind. I loved it at the time and have waited a long time for the adaptation which could only have been made in the era of prestige TV.",/review/rw8697210/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2022,AIANDAS,8," Can Sisyphus Find Redemption?
",Lin Ford is a character of a dubious past when he lived his life in Australia. Committing crimes and along the way the inadvertent murder of a man. Does some time in jail but then escapes. He figures time to move on with his life and one of his shady character friends and criminal associate gets him a Kiwi passport and new identity.,/review/rw8697210/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2022,filmtravel101,6," Missing the Magic of the book - turns into soap opera/thriller
","I was really looking forward to watching this TV series, especially after having read the book 2 times while I was living in India for many years.",/review/rw8697210/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2022,Supermanfan-13,8," Pretty Good!
",I've been a big Charlie Hunnam fan since Sons of Anarchy so I thought I'd give this a chance when I first heard about it. Then I saw the trailers and looked forward to it even more. It's every bit as good as I had hoped and Hunnam does an excellent job as the lead here. He plays a former heroin addict name Lin Ford who goes to Bombay n the 1980's as a fugitive looking to reinvent his life. There he becomes a doctor and finds himself in a lot of trouble by partnering with a crime boss that's in a war with some Russian gangsters and have to go to Afghanistan to sort it all out. He also alls in love with a woman that further complicates things while he tries to get his freedom from everyone.,/review/rw8697210/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2022,qualitycontentmatters,6," Show's fantastic. But getting cancelled on a cliffhanger? Come on!
","I'd normally have given Shantaram 9 stars for the quality, story, performance... all of it. It's a brilliant show with everything we can expect out of an Apple TV+ series.",/review/rw8697210/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2022,lexob9,10," Its just very high quality, must watch!
",So I am 1 episode in so far but you just know quality when you see it.,/review/rw8697210/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2022,celt007,7," Good Show
",As far as the apple show's go this might be one of their best .,/review/rw8697210/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2022,cooper_gareth,8," Really engaging. Worth a watch...
","Charlie's accent aside, this is definitely worth a watch. Well written, well paced and put together, and Bombay feels like a character in this tale too. Quickly immersing you in the wonderful colour and craziness of this city. Characters with secrets and demons, this kept me interested, and I really cared about these flawed individuals enough to want to see them win their battles.",/review/rw8697210/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2022,nikhilthemacho,6," Keeps you on the edge
","I haven't read the book, but can definitely say that the episodes are well directed and the direction is slick. The story keeps you on the edge. However the drama and the suspence in the first episode is not matched in intensity in the second and third episodes. Am waiting for the new episodes. The main lead is good and has a good Australian accent. My only grouse is wish there were more Indian characters. But maybe this has got something to do with the book. Also, wish some famous names had been taken in as Indian characters. I don't recognize anyone except Aly. Hope the suspense stays on in the upcoming episodes.",/review/rw8697210/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2022,johnsnoekthuis,8," True enough to the source material
","I love the book! So I eagerly waited and dreaded the series. First of all the casting for Prabhu (especially), Karla and Khader Khan is spot on.",/review/rw8697210/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2022,sureshramamoorthyust,8," Well-made show
","Amidst the lack of creative content and the glut of visual content, it is difficult to find anything that is consistently engaging. Shantaram is an exception.",/review/rw8697210/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2022,stormshadow-62038,9," Surprisingly good
","I don't understand why I've come across so little hype for this show, it's so well done. The acting is excellent, sure Chuck sucks at accents but we all know and look past that, especially since this is the best acting work I've seen from him by far.",/review/rw8697210/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2022,sayedshazee,," My Prison Bible-
","The book was my Bible in prison and I read it from cover to cover the 4 years I was there. It was given to me by an Australian of all people who himself was writing a book about his life in prison and used to hand his manuscript to his brother during his visits every month. The line I was a revolutionary who lost his ideals in heroin, a philosopher who lost his integrity in crime, and a poet who lost his soul in a maximum security prison"" defined my situation to a tee and I cried inwardly everytime I read it, still do. I also went to Pakistan later on and had a similar course as his in Bombay but enough about me.",/review/rw8697210/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2022,greenleekevin,9," A unique fugitive story
","A new story, something different and well done. No cliques, just methodical, entertaining writing and understated acting and action that leaves me wanting more. Characters are complex are peeled like an onion. The broken and flawed protagonist goes by many names and rises to the challenges in surprising ways.",/review/rw8697210/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2022,joostice,7," Been waiting for a screen adaptation for over a decade
","There were rumours about a movie years ago starring Brad Pitt as Lin. I wish they had made it, even better I wish they had cast a real live Australian for Lins part, Charlie Hunnam does the worst Aussie accent. It's painful. I don't think he is a good actor all around either, bless his heart. Very wooden, and canned. If this hadn't been a story I was waiting for years to see and I saw that he was the lead I would have passed and not even given it a chance. SOA was prime time schlock. He suits that better.",/review/rw8697210/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2022,Headturner11,7," And a half
",So far! I'm not a fan of Charlie Hunnam and I have to say for a Britt he does an awful Aussie accent but other than that it seems pretty decent thus far. I don't really like his character( as he seems to always play clueless entitled a###les! But there's not many watchable things out there as of late and this seems interesting enough to keep my attention. Lots of intrigue this far to keep me interested. Maybe his Aussie accent will improve! I mean Caleb Landry Jones is an American actor who played the lead in an Australian movie and his accent was par on and he's an American! Ok I've almost met the character limit. Will continue and edit if needed..,/review/rw8697210/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2022,krisztianv,3," Boring, slow, dragging on with dull conversations
","The first 1-2 episodes were okay but after that it has become extremely boring, slow with conversations so dull that I always find myself doing different things while watching... by the 7th episode it has become so tedious that I found it a lot more interesting to write this review (although I hate writing reviews) but it is so monotonous that I rather did it anyway than waiting for the minutes to count down to zero.",/review/rw8697210/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2022,mcguiremorgan,5," I had such high hopes
","I first read this book in the early 2000s when it came out. I LOVED it. I read it again a few years later, and I heard it was being adapted for a movie and Johnny Depp was attached to the project. Very exciting, and then so many things changed along the way and years later it's finally announced as a TV show by Apple, starring Charlie Hunnam, who I loved in Sons of Anarchy. So as you can imagine I am super excited, I've been waiting all this time for this. When the tv show was announced I decided to read the book again just so it'd be fresh in my mind when the show finally came out.",/review/rw8697210/?ref_=tt_urv
