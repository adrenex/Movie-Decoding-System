9 October 2022,TxMike,," A forced family reunion as dad is on his deathbed. Totally absorbing.
","I had two good reasons to want to see this movie. Back a few years ago we all spent the month of June on vacation in Montana, a beautiful state. And second I love Haley Lu Richardson, she is a really good actress and always a joy to watch. Here she is 25-yr-old Erin who disappeared seven years earlier after some bad family drama. Her half-brother is played by Owen Teague as 22-yr-old Cal (named after Cal Ripkin Jr.). Interestingly both actors were the same ages as their characters during filming.",/review/rw8623963/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2022,Quinoa1984,8," Wonderful little American drama that is a rarer breed in theaters
","The first criticism, or just observstion, I could see leveled at Montana Story is that it's too slowly paced or that the directors (who made the sleeper The Deep End 20 years back, among a few other things) keep the characters holding back from saying what we expect them to maybe say - or hope they won't say - to rach other. But it may be simply that (most) American audiences don't always flow with dramas that have the confidence to take the time to lay out who everyone is, that there's sorrow and more with a little scratch off the card, and then when the time is right for the people, this brother and sister specifically played by Owen Teague and Hailey Lu Richardson, to lay out what's been eating them away for so long. And of course when dealing with bottled up guilt and pain and suffering, that can be a lot to handle.",/review/rw8623963/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2022,benjaminskylerhill,8," Emotionally powerful, if a bit overlong.
","If you can look past the glacial pacing and really see what's being presented on the screen, Montana Story is a thoroughly rewarding film.",/review/rw8623963/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2022,ferguson-6,7," family trauma
","Greetings again from the darkness. Watching two of our most talented young actors do their thing within the framework of old-fashioned storytelling and a breathtaking geographic setting is just about as good as it gets in independent filmmaking. The pacing may be a bit slow for some viewers, but the joy here is in watching two actors own their characters and battle through the emotions that tore apart a family.",/review/rw8623963/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2022,goshamorrell,10," Montana Story"" operates best as a ticking time bomb juxtaposed tonally from Kevin Morby's plaintive melodic score
","Cal (Owen Teague) arrives on a large Montana spread, his long face and hesitant gait foretelling what his father's large wooden, picturesque home holds. When he enters, an overbearing beeping sound arises, and a kind-spoken Kenyan nurse named Ace (Gilbert Owuor) greets him. Cal's father had a stroke. He's now lying in the living room in a permanent coma attached to life support. The ranch isn't in much better shape: A lapsed mortgage, no cattle, a 25-year-old stallion on its last legs, and a few chickens account for what remains. Cal tries to shoulder the burden alone until his estranged sister Erin (a profound Haley Lu Richardson) makes an unannounced appearance. The pair haven't spoken for seven years. Back then, Erin outed their father in the school paper as a lawyer covering up a toxic mess at a local mine. Their father attacked her, beating her nearly to death, only for a 15-year-old Cal to stand frozen, watching. Now she lives in upstate New York and Cal lives in Cheyenne. But their shared regret stands only inches apart. Beyond their abusive father, the siblings share another foible: Their horse Mr. T, the black stallion with arthritis. Cal wants to put him down rather than keeping him locked away and paying for the feed. Erin would rather take the horse with her back to upstate New York. The equine's situation, needless to say, is a reversal of their father's. It's a metaphor operating with a heavy hand.""Montana Story"" operates best as a ticking time bomb juxtaposed tonally from Kevin Morby's plaintive melodic score. The siblings often veer close to laying out their true grievances, and the closer they arrive, the sharper the jagged, rugged landscape becomes, and the colder the skin-smearing wind sounds. Their ping-pong game of nasty words - at one point Erin alludes to Cal belonging in the lowest circle of Dante's Hell, where the betrayers of special relationships reside - comes to a head during a bitter lightning storm that causes a power outage in the home. Richardson's spontaneous overflow of emotions is a gut punch, while Teague's slow emotional build to fall in a landfill of grief is acutely measured. Hits theaters on May 20, 2022.",/review/rw8623963/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2022,zorroaca,6," Kill Time Movie That is Not that Bad
",Acting is ok but the story is not that new. In fact the story could be worse. But this low budget film is watchable and has it's good points (even though some dimwit did leave out plucking the chicken). Moving on... the characters are believable and and the inclusion of Native Americans is refreshing.,/review/rw8623963/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2022,josh-48191,7," Indi Film
","I liked it but certainly a bit slow. There wasn't enough of the backstory and not a movie for everyone. I gave it a 7 rating, but I think it could have been better.",/review/rw8623963/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2022,oman123,8," Really beautiful movie.

30 May 2022,coled-65716,10," Well told story about a real family with real problems
","If you are looking for a summer blockbuster this is not the movie for you (but you should know this from the tiniest bit of research). If you are looking for an incredibly well acted, incredibly well written, and incredibly well filmed in amazing locations movie that deals with real life this is the movie for you. Every actor and actress is superb. The writing is real and simultaneously sympathetic to characters at many different phases and positions in life. The cinematography is beautiful and appropriate for the themes of the show. It could be called depressing, but I would call it humanist and ultimately uplifting. A fanatic might argue with some of the implied past of the father and how it is presented, but as the movie takes time to point out this isn't really his story. Certainly not a story of any political decisions he made - that is window dressing for an amazingly well told about real families with real issues and how they deal with them.",/review/rw8623963/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2022,bill-williams-923-782688,5," Solid Story With Missteps
","Great premise and wonderfully shot. The acting, however, I found stilted and wooden. I fully expected to ugly-cry throughout this story but I was unable to connect with the primary characters.",/review/rw8623963/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2022,tipseek,7," Calming and well intended.
",I love the Copper Pit scene. The conversation between the sister and the Indian boy while he drives her back deeply moved me. The landscape is as expected gorgeous. The scar on the surface is even more unforgettable.,/review/rw8623963/?ref_=tt_urv

15 May 2022,juliaeckelkamp,9," Montana Love Story
","Between its sweeping wide shots of the landscape and its intimate look into family relationships riddled with trauma, ""Montana Story"" is a force to be reckoned with. A love story to Montana, a love story to family and all its complications - do yourself a favor and check it out!",/review/rw8623963/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2022,afghanrespect,7," Where's is the forgiveness?
","They both killed their father, what's the message from this? Ok, we accept that their father did something bad to them. Now, where is that sympathy and forgiveness? For me both of them are a killer plus the nurse.",/review/rw8623963/?ref_=tt_urv

21 November 2022,morrisonsarah,3," Movie about a ranch that knows nothing about ranching
","I really tried with this one, but the story is so boring immediately. I had a very hard time paying attention, the actors are not captivating, although both talented.",/review/rw8623963/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2022,csman00,1," Beautiful and intriguing, but...
","The first 3/4 were beautiful and enchanting. The rest of it was glorified patricide. Yes, we finally got rid of the old man, let's run free with the horses. What the father did was wrong no question, the fact that this movie thinks it's ok to suffocate him in a weak state is despicable. It's wrong legally - an extra-judicial killing, murder that NO plausible formal cover was even provided, while Ace answered all the questions honestly - and, of course, this murder is wrong morally. I lived in Montana and most people I've met were very pro-family and would not get on board with this ""Montana Story"". I would give 9/10 for cinematography, but the obscene twisted ""moral"" of cowardly murdering your incapacitated father in this movie is too much, no.",/review/rw8623963/?ref_=tt_urv
