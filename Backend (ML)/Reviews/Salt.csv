20 September 2018,Irishchatter,9," Absolutely think one punch man is excellent
","Honestly when I first heard of this anime, it was shown as a ""ok"" meme gif on Facebook and made me fall in love with the show as well as its main characters. I like how Saitama is this laid back hero but at the same time, does his best to be badass and save the world. I even like his robot companion Genos, he's also likeable too and actually kind of sweet for a tough ass looking hero himself. As well as that, he cares about Saitama and that really stands out with the show!",/review/rw3569035/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2015,Alan_H4,9," Blown away - Like Saitama the anime itself has no limit's to its awesomeness!
",I am truly tempted to give One punch man a 10 but in my opinion there is no perfection. There is near perfection and one punch man is that. ,/review/rw3569035/?ref_=tt_urv

","A new perspective in the Japanese Anime. No mainstream characters, not a cliché story or plot, it has a great potential in becoming even better, personally I didn't read the manga(the comic) and in my opinion this anime show is really watchable and I recommend it to everyone no parental advisory, call them even and watch it together.",/review/rw3569035/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2015,kaangunderen,10," Completely Hilarious and Full of Quality
","One Punch Man is one of the funniest and most entertaining anime series I've ever watched in my entire life. Even though it is a newly started anime, the first episode was highly anticipated throughout the anime community, and it was definitely golden in my eyes, with high quality animations and a hilarious story line. The main character, his enemies and the life he lives is a complete mockery of other popular anime plots, both from recent and present anime's. The lines and the dialogs in the episodes are full of puns and jokes, with a satiric sense of comedy injected into them. I highly recommend that you watch this anime, as it will definitely at least bring a smile to your face, and you won't regret the time you spent to watch it.",/review/rw3569035/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2022,Rectangular_businessman,9," Thoughts on the first two seasons
","The first season was excellent, with very great animation and impressive action sequences, being an amusing parody of action anime shows and the superhero genre.",/review/rw3569035/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2015,Thomas_sharma,10," A sparkle of sure brilliance
","This series has blown me away within the first 3 episodes, it's hilarious, the action is great, the characters are interesting and not to mention its original design. The main thing that i love about this Anime is the potential it has to be something amazing due to the Manga being so excellently written. Its been a long time since i've seen an Anime that has peaked my interest so much, if you are a fan of Anime you will not be disappointed! Saitama (the main protagonist) is hilarious. Anime seems to have peaked recently due to the standard being set by shows such as Attack on Titan and I believe this show will set a new standard for Animes similar to its genre.",/review/rw3569035/?ref_=tt_urv

","One Punch Man has the perfect balance between powerful planet bursting action scenes and a chilled main character that doesn't seem to bother about anything going on. The animation of the first season is top notch the way the images display the impact and speed of the fights is just mind blowing and a must watch for every animation lover.
Also there's this great humor and perfect timing that makes One Punch Man almost a parody for so many other Anime shows. When Son Goku's gotta train his butt off to defeat his enemies Saitama is already over this point. He just needs one punch to blow away whatever's standing in his way. This idea is just brilliant to me and works surprisingly well.
Watch this show you won't regret it.",/review/rw3569035/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2019,drewsterwang,7," First Season Is a Masterpiece
","One Punch Man is a send-up of anime series from the past that turns tired tropes on their head and breaks up the regular formula seen in series such as Dragonball Z. The main character, Saitama, doesn't have to struggle, level up, or learn new special attacks to defeat the villains over dozens of episodes. His difficulties are mainly interpersonal and societal as he tries to fit into a world of over-the-top heroes and monsters while remaining hilariously deadpan and clueless in contrast. Highlights are not the fights and monsters, but the depiction of bureaucracy and boring details of everyday life that Saitama goes through. Season 1. 10/10.",/review/rw3569035/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2018,mhorg2018,10," Absolutely Hysterical!
","One of the best superhero satires ever made, One Punch Man is, basically, the story of a guy who wills himself to become the most powerful hero of all time. I've only seen the first season, and I hope to see more. One Punch spends most of his time bored - as few if any can survive one of his blows. My second favorite character is the short tempered green haired telekinetic heroine, Tornado. This really has to be watched because it is so damn funny.",/review/rw3569035/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2015,newindex,10," Interesting Plot. Likable Characters. Amazing Animation!
","One Punch Man follows a hero that can end all of his fights with one punch, and that makes him so frustrated. Now you might be thinking, what's so interesting about that? Don't you want to see the hero struggling to kill his enemy? Well not this time. Here, you will see a super-overpowered hero struggling to find a stronger enemy, struggling to feel the thrill and adrenaline of the fights he once felt when he was weak. Was his training to become strong not worth it after all?",/review/rw3569035/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2019,gav_c,9," Hilariously good
",I had to watch this with me living in Japan and everyone mentioning wanpanman. From the start I found it hilarious with Saitama deadpan attitude on everything and how bored he his on fighting like it's an inconvenience. I'm not a massive fan of anime but this is good. I recommend it to everyone.,/review/rw3569035/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2015,simone-email,8," First episode and I already love it
","I saw this anime online once and I finally took the time to watch it. Needless to say, the first few episodes are none less than EXCELLENT! It's action packed, funny, has just the right amount of hot people for the classic anime needs. As soon as I watched the first episode I found myself watching all of them and telling all my friends to watch it; it's so amazing, something to be put to the top, next to Death Note or Fullmetal Alchemist, or Dragon Ball Z. Definitely my favorite anime currently. There's not that much to say except that it's definitely a comedy, you'll definitely laugh or have a good chuckle. It is very gory however, not that suitable for younger anime fans. Though if you've watched Neon Genesis Evangelion or Future Diary, this show is most likely in your range of comfort and you'll most likely enjoy this anime as much as I have. Again, great anime so far.",/review/rw3569035/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2015,eerdem92,10," Definitely a must-watch anime
","I didn't know about the anime when its manga existed but many people told me that ""this thing is brilliant you gotta read it"" and I was like ""meh"" and didn't bother much. However, recently I saw that the show is being animated and 6 episodes were released and I just wanted to give it a shot. And I was like.. Boom! Absolutely blown away with the first episode and watched all 6 episodes without a break and I can say this is currently the best anime out there you can watch. ",/review/rw3569035/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2015,James_096,10," Just AWESOME!!!
","I'd never heard of this manga..So,when I saw the anime getting rave reviews,I decided to give it a shot...Trust me,One Punch Man did not disappoint.",/review/rw3569035/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2015,seige-hound,10," One of the best action shows since Avatar, period
","I'll admit I'm not the biggest fan of anime. I love Studio Ghibli and Mamuro Hosoda's stuff, and I enjoyed Sword Art Online enough (even though it's really flawed) and Clannad is my favourite romance show, but beyond that, I find Anime really hard to get into.",/review/rw3569035/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2022,coles_notes,8," Great
","Based on the manga of the same name created by One, One-Punch Man follows Saitama, a super hero whose incredible strength allows him to defeat all enemies in a single punch. Definitely a farce of the entire anime superhero / fighting genre, the plot lines and humour are superb for what it is, if you're already a fan of these style fighter anime then you should find this quite funny. Netflix is currently carrying the first season, but you'll need Tubi or another service to get the latest season 2 which I just finished up. Unfortunately a new director and animation studio took over for the second season, and while its still quite good, it doesn't near live up to the quality of the first. The first season of One-Punch Man is in my opinion some of the highest quality animation in the last decade, and I could not recommend it more.",/review/rw3569035/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2015,lucasdenomme,10," One Punch Man a must watch
","This anime which has released a few weeks ago is a masterpiece created by renown anime producer, Madhouse. It sat ires classical anime genre making it an extremely hilarious show which will bring many grins to those who have already watch other anime.",/review/rw3569035/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2021,vipul_chaturvedi,9," Imagine Deadpool, but manga version
","Imagine Deadpool, but manga version. The de facto superhero parody series of this decade. Brilliant, impressive, and hilarious in every respect. For a series all about an overpowered protagonist, it got my heart pumping and emotionally invested. Also, Tatsumaki is a loli goddess.",/review/rw3569035/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2018,thomasjay-2201,10," Quality in the Gods
","A simple yet overlooked idea this show and its premise is truly fantastic. Focusing on the most powerful hero in the world who's rising up the ranks of the superhero world whilst trying to retain his personality there's so much fun to be had. Great action sequences and the perfect blend of comedy/drama/action all on beat to a fantastic score this show is truly brilliant. Refreshing the genre and ironically strong in every way there's many appealing factors to this show. Covering a lot of content in brisk episode times this quick series is superb, watch it!",/review/rw3569035/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2015,killakan-03899,10," Review
","This show is one of the best shows I've seen in the anime section. This is a personal opinion but let me tell you why I have it. This show is different than most mainstream anime, it is unique and funny, it will make you laugh every single episode and you will not get bored of it. Moreover, it brings a different type of storyline plus there are next to no anime clichés. The show is smoothly animated and the voice acting is great, at least in my opinion. I have read the manga (aka the comic) and I know what the whole show is about. There will be many more episodes to come if they plan on following the manga. I would recommend this show to every person of every age. The only reason why I wanted to give it 9/10 initially is because the episodes are pretty short. Besides that, it's amazing, a must watch.",/review/rw3569035/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2016,dwarves-36003,10," Best. Anime. Ever.
","When I first heard of One Punch Man, I was skeptical of its premise. But after watching the first episode, I was immediately hooked! I've never seen a show that blends action and comedy so well! The music is great and the characters are very well drawn and acted out.",/review/rw3569035/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2020,doomedmac,9," Kind of amazing
","The characters, animation, and story are all very good. Also, this show is really interesting and really funny. A must-watch for anime fans.",/review/rw3569035/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2020,oneofthesilence,8," Very Fun and well made
","I loved pretty much every element of this show (season 1). But I will first go over my few negatives. The first 2 or 3 episodes are a little slow. Not bad, just a little strange and poorly paced, though they do do a good job selling me on the main character Saitama. Also sometimes the villains and side heroes can be cringey. You can tell that that was kinda the point, but none the less, it's occasionally distracting.",/review/rw3569035/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2017,thevipinsingh,8," Anime is great but Villlains are not
","The overall show is good to watch. The fights are in some cases is good where a hero and a villain posses equal powers. But the one punch man character is too powerful that no one can compete him which makes a fight less interesting. You will not that he is going to kill a monster with a single punch. Personally, I like the fight where both the opponents have equal power better even a villain contains more than it will be a challenge to a hero for unlock his more power but in this anime case. How big or powerful a villain is he can't bear Saitama's one punch.",/review/rw3569035/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2016,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,9," An entertaining anime digging into the MANY clichés of superhero storytelling.
","One Punch Man is almost a one joke show, but it works at continuing to mock, ridicule and even lovably homage a genre that's become such a cultural staple in today's entertainment-consuming society it's a bit of a surprise that this anime stood out from the crowd to get people's attention.",/review/rw3569035/?ref_=tt_urv
