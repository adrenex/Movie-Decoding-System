18 February 2022,Sleepin_Dragon,8," A love story with a twist.
","Sally Hawkins puts in a lovely, sweet, almost sympathetic performance as the central character, it's her delicacy balanced against the harshness of the amphibious man that makes it so interesting.",/review/rw4008166/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2018,siderite,6," The hype of water
","The film starts with an interesting premise: during the Cold War era, a US government research center has captured a strange amphibious creature and the protagonist is a mute cleaning lady. From the beginning the story overflows with symbols if intolerance: towards women, towards handicapped people, black people, amphibious people, immigrants, gays, old people, and so on and so on. It's like it's trying to check all the boxes, see how many it gets in a single row. But while it does this, the story itself just stalls. This is a two hour long movie in which nothing much happens. It shows intolerance, but doesn't go anywhere with it. Yes, we know people are assholes and that during that era, they were slightly worse than now. It does nothing for the plot, which is predictable and boring. ",/review/rw4008166/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2018,TheLittleSongbird,10," Unsettlement at its most beautiful
","So much appealed to me about 'The Shape of Water'. The trailer and story captivated me, Guillermo Del Toro has done some great work prior (especially one of my favourite films 'Pan's Labyrinth'), the critical acclaim and numerous wins and nominations (including a whopping thirteen Oscar nominations as we speak) promised so much as did the talented cast and having Alexandre Desplat on board.",/review/rw4008166/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2018,TheKing87,10," Many people misunderstood this movie! There is a twist in the story!
","I was very skeptical about this movie from the very beginning, because I thought that this would probably be a dumb monster movie with a similar theme like ""Beauty and the Beast"". However, I was very surprised when I saw the movie and think that it was brilliant!",/review/rw4008166/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2018,kirbylee70-599-526179,9," LOVE IN THE STRANGEST PLACES
","I was stunned this year when they announced the winner for the best picture category at the Oscars. How could it possibly be that a movie whose description reads like a low budget horror film from the fifties could win top prize? And from a director known for movies filled with comic book heroes, monsters, ghosts and tales of fantasy? And yet it happened. Now that movie makes its way to disc.",/review/rw4008166/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2018,Marc_Israel_365,9," The Shape of Your Limitations
","The latest beautiful film by the dark fairy tale fantasy director Guillermo del Toro reminds me of hearing 40 year olds talk about what they got out of going to college . It seems that you get what you put into it. I'd claim the same goes for this collective homage film that will certainly open your eyes through many theatrical portals. I found an immediate thought of the French movie ""Amelie"" due to the quiet nature of our protagonist and the smart and artful use of color. It's a romantic viewing for those who appreciate such things and yearn for a better nature in ourselves. This 1960's period piece, set in Baltimore, Maryland, certainly doesn't look like any John Waters film I ever saw, but the small city with a chip on it's shoulder is carried well by the outsider and monster of the movie played by Michael Shannon. Yes, his characters' depth won't go past wading levels, but the fim isn't about character depth, and the story is the star. The movie has a collective voice of characters who, although silenced by the social indignities of that time, rose above themselves for the greater good. Octavia Spencer is understated but is our eyes as an outsider and our conscience as a friend. The only person who this doesn't hold true is Elisa, our protagonist, part mousey mute and part ""quite female"" to say the least. She's daring on a number of issues, but it feels as for personal gain, despite the pure heart angle. I will watch this again to see if I come away with that same sentiment.

6 February 2018,classicsoncall,9," ""He sees me for what I am, as I am.""
","I had my doubts before seeing this film but they were quickly dispelled. What really won me over was the story's placement in what looked like the era of the 1950's, but with a speech broadcast on radio by President John F. Kennedy, the time frame is narrowed down to a couple of years between 1961 and 1963. Even so, the picture beautifully captures the style and sense of the Fifties/Sixties transition - the art work, the color palette, the atmosphere, and the dynamic tension of the Cold War between America and Russia. As for my initial doubts, well, that goes with what one might consider a love story between an amphibian and a human. I really want to say reptile, but the 'Amphibian Man', as he's listed in the credits, did have an ability to exist on land and in water. ",/review/rw4008166/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2018,hunter-friesen,8," A part fantasy romance, part monster thriller that could only come from the mind of Guillermo Del Toro.
","A mute janitor falls in love with a fish man during the Cold War 1950's. That's about as simple as you can describe the plot of Guillermo Del Toro's new film The Shape of Water. Del Toro has always had in interest in monsters for his films. No matter how scary or deformed they look, they always have human traits that connect us with them. In this film, Del Toro has crafted his most likeable monster yet and tells a totally original story (trust me) that is part romance, part thriller. ",/review/rw4008166/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2018,grantss,6," Okay, but hardly Oscar-worthy
","It is the mid-1960s. Elisa is mute, and a cleaner at a US government experiment facility. Her life is quite mundane and unfulfilled. Then the facility starts on a new project: the US government has captured a man-fish hybrid in South America and now they are seeing if the creature's unique physiology could have some uses for humans, especially for astronauts. Elisa becomes attached to the creature.",/review/rw4008166/?ref_=tt_urv

","Another Guillermo del Toro masterpiece - story, screenplay (with Vanessa Taylor) and directed by - (Pan's Labyrinth, Pacific Rim, The Hobbit, Hellboy, Cronos, etc) deserves the Oscar he won for this fine and daring film. How this man is able to take imagination and make it so plausible is a gift - and one we can only hop he continues to share. ",/review/rw4008166/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2018,mhorg2018,8," A Beautiful poem to Monster Kids
","Guillermo Del Toro mentioned that one of the driving ideas behind this was for the monster to get the girl. I'm not going to give this away, but unlike some of the naysayers who've damned this film, they obviously didn't watch it with their eyes open. Who can make a film like this for under 20 million these days? Obviously Guillermo can. This is a dark and beautiful fantasy that one has to pay attention to. The story flows like the water it contains and I can't single out any one performance since all of them are so excellent. I would have liked it if the Amphibian man had a little more original look. He looked like Abe Sapien with the creature from the black lagoon's hands. But he is a beautiful creature, streamlined and wonderful. While some may poo-poo this film, It's Del Toro's best original film since Pan's Labyrinth and far superior to either Crimson Peak and the utterly terrible Pacific Rim.",/review/rw4008166/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2018,tomgillespie2002,9," Suck in a deep breath and take a plunge
","Guillermo del Toro's latest immersive fantasy spectacle began life as a remake of one of the Mexican director's favourite movies of all time - the iconic monster movie Creature from the Black Lagoon. When he pitched his plans to Universal, perhaps as part of their troubled 'Dark Universe' franchise which kicked off last year with spectacular misfire The Mummy, he wanted to tell a love story between the Gill-Man and a woman from the perspective of the titular creature. This idea, which sounds like a dream for film buffs but a turn-off for studio executives, was rejected outright, presumably being for too risque for mainstream audiences. Del Toro stuck with it anyway, and the script turned into The Shape of Water. Would the same film have nabbed the Best Picture at this year's Academy Awards if it was titled Creature from the Black Lagoon? I think not, so it worked out well for everybody apart from Universal, who are probably still licking their wounds from last year's Tom Cruise-starring horror show.",/review/rw4008166/?ref_=tt_urv

31 December 2017,zardoz-13,8," A Creature Feature Romance
","Imagine the Universal Pictures' horror classic ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" (1954) revamped as a romantic escapade, and you'll have some idea what to expect from ""Hellboy"" helmer Guillermo del Toro's supernatural saga ""The Shape of Water,"" starring Sally Hawkins, Octavia Spencer, Richard Jenkins, and Michael Shannon. Doug Jones plays an enigmatic humanoid amphibian from the Amazon who walks upright on two legs. Equipped with gills and face like C3p0, he lands in the hands of the U.S. Government. ""The Shape of Water"" takes place in 1961 during the early years of the Space Race between Uncle Sam and the Soviet Union. Unlike the reptilian ""Black Lagoon Creature,"" this gill guy wouldn't frighten a fly, though he does use his large, webbed hands with claws to tear a couple of fingers off his sadistic human curator. Later, he munches on the head of a contentious cat. Scrambling to launch a man into space, the U.S. Government believes this creature will provide them with answers to questions about human survival in space. Basically, this fable concerns an oversized lab specimen and the heartless abuse that his captors inflict on him with Nazi-like relish for their research. Mind you, Hollywood has made movies comparable to ""The Shape of Water,"" such as ""Splice"" (2009), about a lab specimen that unscrupulous researchers concocted from a genetic crucible and then learned they couldn't control it. The humanoid amphibian here isn't as treacherous as the feminine hybrid in ""Splice"" or the ""Species"" (1995) franchise. ",/review/rw4008166/?ref_=tt_urv

","While we know that some monsters are decidedly not lovable, the creature in Mexican director Guillermo del Toro's The Shape of Water, like many humans who roam the planet, is more of a lonely outcast seeking connection than a life-threatening presence. Performed by Doug Jones (""The Danger Element"") underneath all the prosthetics, this monster is an amphibian humanoid known as the Asset, captured by scientists from the Amazon (the one in South America) to help with the U.S. space program. Amphibian man (as he is listed in the credits) resembles a cross between King Kong and E.T., though definitely not as cuddly as the latter but a much better dancer. ",/review/rw4008166/?ref_=tt_urv
