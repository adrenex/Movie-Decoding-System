13 June 2008,ametaphysicalshark,," This is a joke, right?
","Allow me to provide some background information on my relationship with the films of M. Night Shyamalan: I adored ""The Sixth Sense"" and still think of it as one of the best films of 1999 and one of the best supernatural thrillers in ages. ""Unbreakable"" was a fascinating take on the superhero genre. I loved parts of ""Signs"" to bits and consider the sequence in the basement towards the end of the film one of the finest examples of suspenseful build-up in recent film history. I even liked ""The Village"" and could easily dismiss ""Lady in the Water"" as a mere misfire. I was greatly anticipating ""The Happening"", especially as it seemed to be echoing one of my favorite guilty pleasures- the paranoid 70's sci-fi thriller.",/review/rw1891576/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2009,hall895,4," It's not happening
","Who keeps giving M. Night Shyamalan money to make these movies? Seriously, what studio executive read this script and thought that making this movie would be a good idea? After the disaster that was Lady in the Water Shyamalan comes back with a movie which unbelievably, almost impossibly, may actually be worse. Lousy acting, laughably bad dialogue and a story which is just downright stupid combine to make one terrible movie.",/review/rw1891576/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2020,royhectorkabanlit,6," Good enough to watch
","It's not as bad as the Professional Critics say it is, but I can understand why they hated it. The Characterization of basically everyone in the Movie is pretty poor, although Zoey Deschanel, Mark Wahlberg and John Leguizamo does work hard with Material they have and sort of work to a certain degree.",/review/rw1891576/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2017,TMoneyDogVIP,9," Don't understand the hate
","I have watched this movie probably 15 times since it was released. I know I'm probably one of only few dozen people that enjoy this movie, but I don't understand all the hate that it receives. I truly thought that it had a good storyline (something different at least). I can agree with some people where the acting is kinda bad throughout the movie but I still found it enjoyable. If you haven't seen this movie before, I would recommend it. Its worth a shot, and I believe that the movie is actually pretty fast-paced. I'm one of those people that still hope someday they make ""The Happening 2"".",/review/rw1891576/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2016,TheMovieDoctorful,8," A Solid, Albeit Imperfect, Tribute To 50s Sci Fi B Movies
","""The Happening"" is arguably one of the most critically slammed blockbusters of the past 10 years. Beloved as ""so bad, it's good"" cinema at best and regarded as an abysmal failure at worst, it's regarded by many as the film that began M. Night Shyamalan's descent from beloved visionary to embarrassment of the industry. However, when one looks at the movie from the perspective Shyamalan intended (As a cheesy tribute to 50s Sci-Fi a la ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"") it's not half bad. Don't get me wrong, ""The Happening"" isn't a film like ""The Wolfman"" or ""Attack of the Clones"" where I genuinely can't understand why people think it's terrible; it has problems. BIG ones. But for what it was trying to do, the film succeeds more often than it fails. ",/review/rw1891576/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2008,cosmic_quest,6," Not brilliant but it is worth a look
","When I first saw the trailer for 'The Happening', I was quite excited at the prospect of another film by M. Night Shyamalan. After all, I enjoyed all his previous films, save 'Lady in the Lake', and was sure he would deliver another breath-taking blockbuster. Sadly, I was wrong and while the film was not a turkey, it was not of the excellence I had expected.",/review/rw1891576/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2008,shariqq,4," It might be clich√©, but it has to be said: The Happening is not happening.
","Shyamalan has proved to us earlier that he can be as good as the best with masterpieces of cinema with The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. Yet, since then, he has declined steadily. Signs and Village were good movies, but with Lady in the Water and now The Happening, he has touched a level of incompetence that could never have been expected of him.",/review/rw1891576/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2019,cashbacher,9," An implausible but perhaps not impossible scenario
","This apocalyptic tale holds your attention and is based on an extreme extrapolation of what happens in nature. As people that follow medicine are well aware, most of the drugs, both good and bad, have their natural origin in plants. Specifically psychoactive drugs such as marijuana, cocaine and opium. It is also known that plants produce and release a variety of chemicals in response to environmental dangers.
The premise of this movie is that the plants in the United States are being subjected to a stressful environment due to human actions, so they respond by releasing a psychoactive chemical. When humans encounter the chemical, they experience an overwhelming compulsion to immediately kill themselves. Some of the suicides are horrific in nature, such as allowing themselves to be eaten by zoo lions.
The ""attack"" takes place in the New England states of the United States and the movie follows the adventures of Elliot Moore, his wife and the daughter of one of Elliot's friends as they flee the terror that is stalking them. Moore is a high school science teacher and he quickly learns that the attacks are triggered be specific circumstances.
The movie is at times very gross and explicit as people find very gory ways to kill themselves. There are moments that tensed me up and I am generally immune to screen fear. Human nature being what it is, you see the best and worst of what humans will do when in the grip of fear. There is also denial and the inevitable claim of government malfeasance before the movie ends on a pessimistic note.",/review/rw1891576/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2008,DICK STEEL,8," A Nutshell Review: The Happening
","To me, this is not a movie about finding out what the issue at hand is, or trying to crack the mystery behind the phenomenon, or even about figuring out what the twist, if any, would be. It's a story about communication, how we, in today's context, are so reliant on mass media delivering every bit of incident deemed newsworthy, and providing that amped up ""insights"" to send us to paranoia. If you notice of late, we have been bombarded with crisis after crisis, or could it really be instead, the flavour of the moment that the mass media drums up? Avian Flu? Food Crisis? Fuel Crisis? Business Continuity? Terrorism? The list goes on, with news editors determining what to drum up, and where to send everyone crying out that the sky is falling. The Happening does just that, as we see newsflash after newsflash providing speculation after speculation that everyone listens, and accedes to.",/review/rw1891576/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2010,imagiking,1," The Happening: Woefully Acted, Barely Written and Just Absurd

12 June 2008,heyuguys1988,2," Believe it...

14 June 2008,bytesmythe_42,1," ""Awful"" doesn't cover it.
","I haven't seen an M. Night Shyamalan movie since ""Signs"", although I've heard each was worse than the previous ones. Strangely, this gave me hope that ""The Happening"" would be a turning point for the director that had won so much acclaim with ""Sixth Sense"".",/review/rw1891576/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2009,febangel30,8," An Important Message....
","Although, several people did not like this film, I have to say that I enjoyed it tremendously. From the beginning of the film, you become hooked. It was incredible to see that only a few minutes into the film, you witness the strange event happening so soon. When the people in Central Park become affected by the chemicals, they look like they are frozen in time. Then the real horror begins. As I watched it got me thinking about years back when sea creatures began ""killing themselves"" by beaching themselves. There was no explanation for this event in the first place and it created quite a stir. Many marine biologists theorized that there might been some type of bacteria or threat in the ocean that caused it to happen",/review/rw1891576/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2008,supah79,5," If it's intentional, it's still a bad film
","I'm a Shyamalan fan. He's not afraid to take chances. And he believes in himself and his story. Most of the time, that helps. Gems like Unbreakable en The Village would never have seen the light of day if someone other than Shyamalan came up with it. His direction always makes sure his story gets the maximum effect. I like his screenplays because they always consist of two things: originality and well written characters. His new feature has neither. It's that simple. As a Shyamalan fan, I felt this disappointment a little with Lady in the Water. But now, it's twice in a row.",/review/rw1891576/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2008,Scars_Remain,10," I Will Never Understand People
","M. Night Shyamalan has created a very original story with a lot of creative ideas, amazing tone and brilliant shock and suspense scenes that would make even Hitchcock proud. So why all the hate for such an awesome movie? The only conclusion I can come up with is that either people just love to hate on Shyamalan, as was evident with The Village, or they just wanna see more rehashing. People must love love all of the sequels(Indiana Jones 4, The Incredible Hulk), remakes and adaptations(Speed Racer, Iron Man), and the straight forward rip-offs(The Strangers, The Ruins), etc. etc. Don't get me wrong, I liked most of these movies with the exception of the rip-offs and Speed Racer but The Happening is far superior because it actually has originality. It truly, in my opinion, is the greatest movie of 2008 so far and maybe the best movie of the past few years.",/review/rw1891576/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2008,sro28-1,1," The End of an Era (but not a career)
","Let me preface these comments by saying that I am a major Night fan. I look forward to news of his next project and love the stories of his supposed total control over his movies and carte blanche from the studios. If those stories are true, I have a feeling that era will be ending for Night with the release of The Happening. I ignored all the pre-release press I could before going to see this movie. I read none of the reviews, but one word I did catch was ""uninspired."" Unfortunately, that one word describes this movie perfectly. In the first ten minutes of the movie, I thought it was due to the acting and that maybe Mark Wahlberg was miscast. However, after another ten minutes I realized it wasn't the actors; it was the extremely lame script. Without giving away any details, this is a disaster film where the disaster ""happening"" starts with the first scene of the movie. Unfortunately, no suspense builds and there is absolutely no sense of dread or panic on screen and so none translates to the audience. Surprising, since the 21st century has provided us with too many occasions to study how we react in times of disaster, whether by nature or terrorism. It's as if Night ignored all this when writing the story. The characters sleepwalk through the scenes (and, no, it's not a symptom of ""the happening"") with no believable sense of the horrible events taking place. Granted, we don't need to see people running around in circles screaming and crying, but people do not stand in small groups after a disaster calmly taking turns talking one at a time. Without sharing in any of the horror that the characters are suppose to be experiencing, the film is a total bore for the audience and the source of ""the happening"" is laughable when revealed. I found myself repeatedly checking my watch, saying, ""I can't believe how bad this is"" ¬ñ not something I'd expect to do in a Night movie. Looking around the theater, I could tell others were sharing the same feelings. Most were scrolling through emails or texting on their phones.",/review/rw1891576/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2019,acedj,7," I don't see the issue
","A lot of people I know, and a lot of reviewers on here run this movie down. Is it great? No. But it is a good movie. It could even be plausible. Humans are a blight upon this world, and who is to say that nature wouldn't act out against us? No the writing is not the best for MNS, but it is a good thriller. Give it a shot.",/review/rw1891576/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2008,bob the moo,," Shyamalan's stock drops further with a film that lacks tension, characters, good dialogue, drama, urgency or intelligence (SPOILERS)
","It is a normal day in Central Park whenever people start talking strangely, moving awkwardly and inflicting fatal injury on themselves. With the media buzzing with talk of terrorist attacks, mass evacuation of the central New York area is organised. Among those fleeing is teacher Elliot Moore, along with his wife and a few others. The theory is that the municipal areas are the targets but somehow the attacks continue in smaller areas all along the East Coast. Seeking refuge further and further from population centres, Elliot tries to work out what is happening ¬ñ if only to stay alive.",/review/rw1891576/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2012,TheLittleSongbird,2," Proof that a movie with such potential could fall so hard
","As I have said before, I am not a M Night Shyamalan detractor, I just feel saddened that somebody responsible for a masterpiece such as The Sixth Sense and a great movie like Unbreakable could fall to lows by being responsible for a movie as strange as Lady in the Water and as horrible as this. For me, Shyamalan's worst film is between this and The Last Airbender.",/review/rw1891576/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2009,poolandrews,6," I kind of liked it in spite of it's bad reputation.
","The Happening starts early one morning in Central Park in New York City where people suddenly start committing suicide for no apparent reason, this strange outbreak of suicides continues to spread throughout the city, the state & the Eastern seaboard. High school science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg), his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) along with his best friend Julian (John Leguizamo) & his young daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez) flee nearby Philadelphia but become stranded when the train service is discontinued. As the speculation grows over what is causing the mass outbreak of suicide it's seem the only thing known for sure is that it is caused by an airborne toxin, as the friends try to stay ahead of the toxin & survive it becomes increasingly difficult...",/review/rw1891576/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2011,Theo Robertson,4," Interesting Premise Devoid Of Any Logic In Its Development
",THE HAPPENING is a great example of someone coming up with a good premise for a story then sabotaging it at every turn . The premise might seem somewhat fanciful but given some intelligent development we could have seen a movie that was compelling . Instead we ended watching a film that has the audience pointing out what a ridiculous film it is ,/review/rw1891576/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2008,tripxyde,6," Enigmatic Terror
","After ""Lady in the Water"" has disappointed critics and audiences alike, M. Night Shyamalan rebounds and reclaims his dignity as a filmmaker with ""The Happening"". I really do not like talking much about a good Shyamalan movie because the power of his movies usually come from the revealing surprises it gives audiences; his movies tend to scare you with something you cannot immediately understand. And Shyamalan is the master of mysterious threats, which is quite clear with this movie. All you need to know is that there is an unexplained phenomenon that is inexplicably exterminating human beings in and around the North American region.",/review/rw1891576/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2008,Michael Fargo,8," --it Happens
","I wish people would cut M. Night Shyamalan some slack, 'cause I'm going to. I've always found his films watchable and of a type that I'll call ""intelligent"" horror films. I'm perplexed--not that fans of, say, Freddy Krueger are non-plussed by Shyamalan's work, but--that those who praise films like ""Iron Man"" can point to this and say it's nonsense.",/review/rw1891576/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2008,kvinneslandr,8," For those with imaginations... and attention spans.
","I'm surprised this movie is getting as many bad reviews as it appears to be getting... but the occasional good review is very telling, especially Ebert's. I'd recommend reading his review because in my opinion he 'got it', and no need to repeat his observations here.",/review/rw1891576/?ref_=tt_urv
