27 September 2017,weemonk,7," Hard crowd to please
","Wow. A lot of people seem hard to please on here. Most series are struggling by the 7th entry (7 stars appropriate) having ruined continuity, rehashed the same formula seen before or by having lost original cast members. A Nightmare on Elm Street had to switch it up to 'it's a movie but not', Halloween had to bring JLC back, Saw was calling it a day, Hellraiser was already screwed and Friday the 13th gave the heroine telekinetic powers to spice things up. It's damn hard to keep a series going and adding new ideas.",/review/rw6887829/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2017,Coventry,4," Too Many Chuckies
","Perhaps I just was in an exceptionally optimistic and generous mood when I watched it, but I quite liked the previous installment ""Curse of Chucky"". Especially after the dreadfully awful ""Seed of Chucky"" in 2004, ""Curse of Chucky"" felt like a far more mature and good old- fashioned horrific revival of the franchise with the emphasis on suspense and plot rather than on stupid slapstick one-liners. Unfortunately it was a lucky shot, as this direct sequel is once again a largely ludicrous and inept hash. The slayings are still joyously blood-soaked and the mysteriously captivating Fiona Dourif (daughter of) returns as leading lady, but the screenplay is pure nonsense and Chucky is again a sneering jester instead of a menacing killer. The story continues quite logically, with Nica Pierce submitted to a heavily guarded mental institution after the bloody events of the previous film. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Foley, arranges for Nica to be transferred to a less strict clinic and participate in group therapy. Andy Barclay, Charles Lee Ray original target victim, is also still around and keeps the heavily mutilated leftovers of the possessed Chucky doll in a safe at his house. Meanwhile, a number of Good Guy dolls are being sent to the clinic and they ALL appear to be possessed with Chucky's cheerful persona. The explanation for why all the dolls are simultaneously possessed is cheap, imbecilic and downright preposterous. Don Mancini sort of made his life's work out of the ""Child's Play / Chucky"" series. He wrote all films since the 1988 original and took over directing them since 2004. He'll probably never make anything else, but maybe he should. I think we've seen enough Chucky movies by now, even though the gore & splatter always remains worthwhile. The seventh installment contains, for example, an ingenious decapitation and a delightful head-crushing.",/review/rw6887829/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2021,matthewssilverhammer,8," Can't believe how good these Chucky sequels are...
","As a full-throated defender of the remake, I never understood why OG fans were against it. While I still love the thematic fun of the remake, I now understand what their issue is. These two straight-to-VOD, Mancini-helmed sequels are so compellingly weird, funny, scary, & bold that the remake felt like it might overshadow this original storyline, a storyline that keeps getting stranger & cooler. Nica is the best character in the whole franchise & one of the great scream queens in slasher history.",/review/rw6887829/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2017,Minus_The_Beer,7," Chuck Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest
","The old adage that ""big things come in small packages"" has definitely proved to be true for the ""Child's Play"" films. Somehow, against all odds, this little guy has legs, becoming the most enduring and consistent horror movie franchise in recent memory, spanning and surviving three decades, without retcons or reboots. A big part of that success lies at the feet of writer turned writer- director, Don Mancini, who has been at the helm since the beginning, ensuring consistency throughout each installment. Also along for the ride since the beginning is the indispensable Brad Dourif as killer turned killer-doll, Chucky. Dourif's manic and often hilarious vocal performance combined with Mancini's ""anything goes"" sensibility makes each film a true pleasure to watch. All of that fan-pleasing, funny-bone teasing goodness is back for the seventh film, ""Cult of Chucky.""",/review/rw6887829/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2019,baileycrawly,9," I Loved It!
","Cult of Chucky is one of those polarizing movies. I happen to be on the positive side of the fence.
Once again, Alex Vincent returns to play Andy Barclay (of course he had a cameo at the end of the previous one, but that's hardly notable). This film has a couple of guest stars that are well known to those familiar with the franchise, which is a real treat for the viewer.
This film is beautiful to look at. The way Don Mancini played with the colouring to make Chucky pop is absolutely phenomenal. And the story, while a continuation from the previous film, is different enough to be much more interesting and engaging for me as a viewer. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The plot had lots of unexpected turns as well. I found it to be great fun!",/review/rw6887829/?ref_=tt_urv

13 February 2018,jadavix,4," Dull and underwhelming sequel
","For most of ""Cult of Chucky""'s run-time, I was thinking that any fan of the series could have come up with a better movie than this. But then in the last twenty or so minutes, I saw a bit of what the movie should have been for its entire length. Chucky is barely even in it up until these last moments, and there is barely any violence, or attempt to scare.",/review/rw6887829/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2017,DJ_Shilo,7," Reunited after thirty years
","It was really a pleasure to see Alex Vincent back as Andy Barcely after almost thirty years when he was a little boy in ""Child's Play."" Don Mancini seems to have a whole carnival planned out for this horror franchise that has become quite popular since debuting back in the late 80's, about a killer doll named Chucky. Don Mancini's latest incarnation ""Cult of Chucky"" is about as batshit crazy as you can imagine but the question is, for being a seventh sequel in the franchise, is it good?",/review/rw6887829/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2017,horrorules,10," Rating 5,2 for this GREAT movie it's an insult
","81% on rotten, numerous positive reviews from various festivals, critics, fans and of course only 5.2 on IMDb, now a haven of pathetic, frustrated trolls and haters. I saw this movie yesterday, at a theater in Rome at Fantafestival and this movie is a MASTERPIECE. Mancini confirms a great director and screenwriter, film photography is fabulous, the plot is fabulous, violence is at very high levels, it is undoubtedly the most violent and frantic chapter of the franchise, in the film is deepened the psychology of the characters . This is a perfect movie !!! my rating is 10/10 and all the pathetic haters can watch Justice League, Insidious, Crap and Furious and all the scum that's around. CHUCKY IS BACK !!!!!",/review/rw6887829/?ref_=tt_urv

3 June 2018,claudio_carvalho,4," Exhausted Franchise
","Thirty years ago it was released ""Child's Play"" with the cult Chucky, a killer doll possessed by the soul of a serial killer. The sequels are watchable downfalls of the original movie, but unfortunately ""The Curse of Chucky"" was a breath to the franchise. However ""Cult of Chucky"" shows that the franchise is completely exhausted, with a boring and stupid story. The worst: the ending is a cliffhanger for another sequel. My vote is four.",/review/rw6887829/?ref_=tt_urv

","Nica (Fiona Dourif), was locked away in an asylum for the insane wrongly convinced that she was the killer doll Chucky. When her ""shrink"" introduces a ""Good Guy"" doll, the blame should be rightly placed. But a new string of bloody and gory deaths plaque the asylum; Nica can only wonder if she isn't crazy after all.

3 October 2017,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,7," ""Cult of Chucky""- A slick sequel that rewards longtime fans and takes many fascinating risks... though it's unorthodox story and noticeably low budget may turn off some.
","For near thirty years now, good-ole' Chucky the killer doll has been terrorizing audiences the world over with his killer antics and twisted gallows humor. He's an indisputable horror icon, so it was never any surprise that even after a prolonged absence starting in 2004, he would eventually re-emerge. And that he did with 2013's surprisingly accomplished franchise-revival ""Curse of Chucky""- a fiendish chapter that won back many of the fans whom had drifted from the series. ""Curse"" reinvigorated the character and the story, and reminded fans of just why they fell in love with that delightfully demented doll in the first place.",/review/rw6887829/?ref_=tt_urv

","The film opens up with the original Andy (Alex Vincent) all grown up and being played by the same child star. He keeps the tortured head of Chucky (voice of Brad Dourif) locked in a safe where he hits it with a nail gun from time to time. The main plot concerns Nica (Fiona Dourif- Brad's real life daughter) who was the wheel chair girl from the ""Curse of Chucky."" She was convicted of murder and is now in a medium security facility for the mentally ill. Jennifer Tilly, the Human Bride of Chucky delivers a Chucky doll to the facility that already had one which they use for therapy.",/review/rw6887829/?ref_=tt_urv

","I don't know what all the complaining's about. I thought this was the best Child's Play in quite some time. Curse was a solid entry in the series, but personally I didn't find its return to the more serious tone of the original movie to be the greatest thing that ever happened to the series, like most people seem to believe.

3 October 2017,LegendsofHorror,7," Movie Review: Cult of Chucky (2017)
","Let me start off by saying that the ""Chucky"" craze has been around for a long time, ""Chucky"" has gone through several changes over the years a lot like ""Fred Krueger"". They both started out as terrifying entities but over time sorta turned into demented blood crazed comedians, but throughout they always had their saving grace as horror icons. That being said, Child's Play 1-3 created a stone cold killer made from plastic, after the original trilogy he became a somewhat parody of himself...until now.",/review/rw6887829/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2018,paul_haakonsen,4," So there is a cult now, eh?...
","I have been watching the Chucky movies ever since the first one, and I am one to say that the franchise has been on a downward slide for a long, long time. Granted, I haven't been much of a fan actually, although most of the movies are enjoyable for what they were, but never reaching anywhere near along the likes of Jason Voorhees or Freddy Krueger.",/review/rw6887829/?ref_=tt_urv

","The Chucky/'Child's Play' franchise was the most recent one to be watched and all the films reviewed, as part of me being on a quest watching some of the horror franchises not yet seen (yet the intent had been there for a while). Part of my want to see them was my fascination to see if killer doll Chucky deserved his horror icon status. My conclusion seeing the films is that he does deserve it and is a hugely entertaining and creepy character, though quite a bit better than the films he features/stars in.",/review/rw6887829/?ref_=tt_urv

3 October 2017,super-joey,10," Yay!!!
","Unlike all other slasher franchises from the 70s and 80s that have rebooted ""for a new generation,"" this one keeps moving forward and manages to stay utterly creative. The Chucky movies are one big, continuing story since 1988. Don Mancini has had a hand in every one of them. He wrote parts 1-4 and then, for parts 5-7, he took over as director as well. His latest, Cult of Chucky, adds something completely new and unexpected to the saga but does not forget the past. Heck, there's even a reference to Kent Military Academy (the location for part 3). I really enjoyed this movie! Brad Dourif returns again as the voice of Chucky and has some fun dialog to spout. His daughter reprises the role of ""Nica"" and continues to impress. The memorable music is by Joseph Loduca who got his start with The Evil Dead in 1981. Cult of Chucky is fresh but faithful to the franchise.",/review/rw6887829/?ref_=tt_urv

7 May 2021,kevin_robbins,6," This is a hard one to rate
","Cult of Chucky (2017) is a movie I recently watched off Syfy. The storyline focuses on the victims of Chucky trying to cope with life after the incidents; unfortunately for them, Chucky is back and aided by his wife. This movie is directed by Don Mancini (Seed of Chucky) and stars Alex Vincent (Child's Play), Allison Dawn Doiron (Lost Girl), Brad Dourif (Dune) and Fiona Dourif (Shameless). The storyline for this is okay but not great and feels like an excuse to make another movie rather than being creative. The movie is a bit uneven. The kill scenes are just okay other than the glass decapitation sequence. The wheelchair sex scene opening was random and kind of funny as was the woman who thought she was a ghost. I wasn't a fan of the Charles flashback scenes but I did like the ending. This is a hard one to rate but I'd score it a 5.5/10 and recommend seeing it for fans of the series.",/review/rw6887829/?ref_=tt_urv
