13 November 2019,ssjsolidsnake,7," Good popcorn action flick
","If you enjoyed the previous 2 movies, this movie follows the same simple formula but it's a very nice 3rd movie.
Don't go in expecting a deep story, some actors just scream bad guy straight away and make everything predictable, go in just to enjoy the nice combat scenes and fast paced action.
Overall it's a nice film to just enjoy without thinking too much about it.",/review/rw5073350/?ref_=tt_urv

25 September 2019,kosmasp,7," Angel Butler
",Leonidas cannot fail ... I mean fall ... right? Sorry I'm mixing up my movies here. But you can see the action star Butler going for it again - a third time. And if you thought the other movies were crazy and unrealistic ... well you were right and this one adds to that! What did you think I was going to say? In all seriousness - do not take this movie serious.,/review/rw5073350/?ref_=tt_urv

16 August 2020,bob the moo,," Enjoyable enough b-movie tosh
","Early in this film we get two things pointed out. First we get to meet an old friend of Angel, who is the head of a large private military contractor. Secondly we understand that the President (who is guarded by Angel) is clamping down on private military contractors. The rest of it writes itself from here, and the plot is fairly by the numbers in terms of what it does. Fortunately it has the money to make it look good and have some good action, even if the story is hokum. It helps of course that nothing about it suggests that it is anything more than a B-movie thriller.",/review/rw5073350/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2019,paul_haakonsen,7," Action-packed and entertaining...
","This movie was actually quite good, but then again, so was the first movie ""Olympus Has Fallen"" from 2013. Oddly enough, I never got around to watching the 2016 movie ""London Has Fallen"" - but I will definitely do so, especially after this movie was as good as the first one.",/review/rw5073350/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2020,MR-ODIN,," Angel Has Fallen
","This is a good film, but they definitely shouldn't make anymore, as much as I like seeing the ""president's guardian angel"" on screen again it is definitely being milked now. In my opinion these have gotten progressively worse since Olympus Has Fallen and should stop where they are before it turns into a bad film franchise. But except for that it is a good showing of action and lives up to the story of the last 2 films. A solid recommendation from me.",/review/rw5073350/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2019,ThomasDrufke,7," This Series Has Not Fallen
","After looking at my list for this year, there really aren't that many straight forward action films made anymore. But Angel Has Fallen came at the perfect time, end of August/early September when there's not much else out in theaters, at least blockbuster movie wise. While not better than the first entry 'Olympus Has Fallen', it is certainly superior to 'London Has Fallen' from 2016, and it makes for a nice cap to the 'Has Fallen' trilogy. That is, if this is the end to the series. And look, there's a ceiling to Gerard Butler's acting talent, but he's more than serviceable in a role like this and last year's Den of Thieves. Oh and Nick Nolte? He's so dang good in this movie it feels like he's on an entirely different level than everyone else. I'm here for it.",/review/rw5073350/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2020,Leofwine_draca,7," The series has still got it
","The third part of the unlikely FALLEN trilogy sees Gerard Butler returning to the fold for a different type of presidential assassination; this time around, Butler himself is the focus as he's set up and subjected to a manhunt by members of a sinister conspiracy. Yep, it's another 'wronged man' type thriller, a film that goes all out in presenting a different kind of action spectacle. There are wide scale drone attacks, huge explosions in the woods, and an electrifying shoot-out at the climax that's well worth the wait. Although these films are cheesy and derivative, and ANGEL in particular employs some very dodgy CGI effects at certain points, I can't help but love them regardless. There's something endlessly earnest about Butler's gruff protagonist and the director certainly knows how to keep the pace going, even if you've seen it all before. It's fun, and that's the main thing...",/review/rw5073350/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2019,louis-ohalloran30,6," A decent action film.

However they are attacked by drones that kills eighteen agents and only the wounded Mike and Trumbull in coma survive.

5 September 2019,phd_travel,8," Very enjoyable and exciting - sometimes older is better
","Just when you think they have run out of ideas for action movies, this exciting and inventive thriller comes along. I enjoyed all the sequences from the drone attack to the hospital shootout. Gerard looks suitable as a worn out pain killer addicted secret service man at the end of his rope and his face looks puffy. In fact a lot of the cast are older and all good. Nick Nolte is well suited for once as Dad. Jada Pinkett Smith plays an FBI agent. The plot is about a secret service man framed for an assassination attempt on the President.",/review/rw5073350/?ref_=tt_urv

",May i first say im not really a fan of Butler or this film series but i was shocked and surprised to see a really good action movie thriller and cant really understand the negative reviews.I found nothing wrong with camera angles or C.G.I.Its fast paced and different and far better than the first two films.,/review/rw5073350/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2019,nogodnomasters,8," Don't worry about finding me. I'll find you.
","The mercenary corporations lead by Wade Jennings (Danny Huston) want President Trumbull (Trump Bull would be too obvious) dead. His policy of not using the private sector in wars is hurting their bottom line. Only Mike Banning (Gerald Butler) with compressed discs, insomnia, and on pain killers can save him, except he is being framed as the man who attempted to kill Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) and is America's most wanted. Nick Nolte has a long anti-government diatribe as Mike's dad.",/review/rw5073350/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2019,davidgee,7," Fast and - well, yes - furious
","Yes, we've been here before. Twice. This is the second attempt on President Trumbell and the third movie in the HAS FALLEN. Gerard Butler is beginning to look in need of an adrenalin boost, as well he might. It says a lot for him and the writer (and the CGI guys) that the Mike Banning shtick still has the capacity to thrill audiences. This formula is recycled from the DIE HARD franchise and, before that, from THE FUGITIVE. Bruce Willis's charisma kept DIE HARD tanked up through episodes 2 and 3 before flagging with Part 4, so now might be a good time for Mike Banning to retire. There's another bunch of high-octane movies whose name escapes me, but I seem to remember they have managed to stay consistently fast and furious.",/review/rw5073350/?ref_=tt_urv

26 August 2019,The-Sarkologist,3," Yep, another mindless action fil,
","For some reason they keep on making these films, but I guess the box office takings do tend to have a lot to do with that. Yeah, just check them out and you will probably understand because, well, who cares what the critics say, and who cares about the ratings on IMDB, if a premise rakes in money, then Hollywood will keep on churning out sequels. Mind you, it wasn't as if the cinema was all that packed when I saw it, not compared to, say, Infinity War, but then again that made an awful lot more money than these ones did.",/review/rw5073350/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2019,zardoz-13,7," Better Than Average Nonsense
","The third time isn't as charming for ""Shot Caller"" director Ric Roman Waugh's ""Angel Has Fallen,"" the second in the president's bodyguard trilogy, which commenced with ""Olympus Has Fallen"" (2013) and then ""London Has Fallen"" (2016). Despite a stellar cast of familiar faces and lots of high-octane explosions and shootouts that punctuate the plot, this tolerably entertaining entry ranks as the more formulaic, springing fewer surprises than its predecessors, and lacking a shred of old-fashioned fun. Indeed, indestructible Gerard Butler is back on guard as the president's top watchdog Mike Banning, and Banning is every bit as beleaguered here as he was when the fireworks erupted in ""Olympus."" For the record, Butler and Morgan Freeman are the only surviving cast members from ""Olympus"" and ""London"" who reprise their roles. This time out Morgan Freeman governs the Oval Office as President Trumbull, while President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) has departed. Furthermore, ""Coyote Ugly"" star Piper Perabo has replaced Radha Mitchell who played Banning's wife Leah in the first two entries. Several faces fresh to the franchise participate in this new, larger-than-life escapade. Among them is Nick Nolte as Mike's reclusive father, Jada Pinkett Smith as a tenacious FBI agent, Tim Blake Nelson as the bespectacled Vice President, Danny Houston as one of Mike's old army chums, and ""John Wick's"" Lance Reddick as another Secret Service agent on Trumbull's security detail. Sadly, Waugh and writers Robert Mark Kamen of ""The Transporter"" and Matt Cook of ""Triple 9"" have cooked up a conspiracy thriller bristling with an inventory of genre clich√©s. You'll figure out the identities of the villains long before their treachery is exposed. Clocking in at a minute over two hours, ""Angel Has Fallen"" shoehorns one improbable action scene into another with reckless abandon. Meanwhile, the writers do a skillful job of painting Mike Banning into a corner as a traitor on the Kremlin's payroll. Nevertheless, you know nothing can keep a good guy-like Mike Banning-down.",/review/rw5073350/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2019,UniqueParticle,9," Exhilarating roller coaster especially in 4DX
","Mind blowing intensity and excellent conspiracy filled mash up! Gerad Butler is among one of the most badass actors ever and one of my favorites, have been for at least 15 years. I've never seen a 4DX movie before this I was surprised by the flashes, seat moving, and mist plus the action was so much more intense than usual like the gun shots felt close by and I'm terrified of roller coasters so this was unique. I absolutely love movies - I wish I was famous! This sequel is everything you'd want and more!",/review/rw5073350/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2019,elgrampo77,8," Very good pop corn cinema
","As always it depends on what you expect. If it is Shakespeare-like award winning drama then you are probably wrong. But if it is a well done action hero movie with superb shooting scenes, nice acting by butler, freeman & Nolte and some humor on the top, then go and see it. Of course you know after max 10
