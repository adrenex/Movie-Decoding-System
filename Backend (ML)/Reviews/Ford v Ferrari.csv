24 September 2022,javiergarcon,10," Very difficult movie to make.
","If half the reviewers knew how hard it was to make this movie maybe they would make this a 10. That is the negative about reviewers they do not have the experience or education in movie making. I for one work in the industry, and I have to say wow! So much detail went into this movie that so many other reviewers missed. I am also a Combat Veteran that has a Service animal. So to say that I have experience, I am not lying! When Lulu made it to the funeral I about lost it! I couldn't hold it in and I broke down in tears! A flood of sadness and tears of all my brothers that have died from suicide rushed into my senses, I felt so much dread and pain because I miss them. This movie touched my heart to the point I turned to my Service dog ""Chase"" and he looked up at me and I said ""Thank you for saving my life"" and then he closed his eyes and went back to bed acknowledging what I just said. Dogs know when you are grateful.",/review/rw7900008/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2022,UniqueParticle,9," More of a tearjerker than a comedy
","To the person that said it's been done before sure but never this story I'm sure there's very few about a dog from the army. Channing Tatum was superb throughout I loved Dog (Lulu) the journey story and bonding was so lovely! So much wildness, charm, endearment, and great dialogue throughout; amazing movie I'd recommend to anyone!",/review/rw7900008/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2022,pmtelefon,8," At times, it's excellent
","Co-director and star Channing Tatum does a nice job with ""Dog"". It is a great looking movie filled with nice performances. The story does take a few unexpected turns but it never loses focus. The movie has a nice pace and packs more emotion than one might expect. Also, the dog is great. ""Dog"" is a well done, emotional movie. Honorable mention: the soundtrack. (I saw ""Dog"" at Regal, Westbury, NY.)",/review/rw7900008/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2022,OneAnjel,10," Important film - unfortunately not everyone will get the humor but everyone seems to get the drama
","If you're male and/or had boots on the ground (or the spouse of such), you are likely to understand the humor here and why Comedy is included in the genre. Sure, the essence of the film is serious and profound. But I totally see why the writers and Director used the humor of one-track-mind Army Ranger (no, not sex) v loyal Malinois to offset the underlying message. A few reviews hit the mark - this is about 2 broken beings who helped heal each other (it's a process); both found that elusive 2nd chance. Some reviews claim a lot was left out. Well, if you have no background whatsoever, then you might just see the surface. But you also wouldn't know anything was missing because this film can be taken at face value and still deliver an important message. After all it's currently no 3 in America. Knowing all the nuances is for a very few, relatively speaking. God bless them. I really loved this film. And having Tatum to look at was a nice plus. I do hope our government can stop thinking of 'damaged' soldiers as expendable. The world is upside down right now - mocking the importance of a strong military. But to me, it's not unlike how Christianity is being beaten down by huge voices from a few trying to drown out the many -- it's the pendulum swinging into the dark... But eventually must swing back into the light. Hooah.",/review/rw7900008/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2022,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,7," It's a drama, not a comedy.
","This film's trailer and classification might lead you to believe it's a comedy and although it has some humor in it, it is primary a drama. I was expecting lots of laughs based on the trailer, but I realized the editing on the trailer doesn't match the type of editing style of the actual film.",/review/rw7900008/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2022,HumbleMensa,9," Changed my mind
","Okay. So, I am not really a Tatum Channing (Who? Stockard Channing? Carol Channing?) err, Channing Tatum aficionado. Kind of thought he was the beefy guy of the moment--yet here he still is. But, wow, he did a fabulous job in this flick. Absolutely a wonderful story and for sure this movie is an unexpected DRAMA. Channing's range has expanded. I mean, this is not an academy award movie, don't get me wrong, but it it is well done, emotive, tear jerker at times...totally impressed. Great scenery. Great lighting ---the production team did a good job. And the reality beneath this story, most of us don't have a clue. Well done across the board.",/review/rw7900008/?ref_=tt_urv

24 February 2022,neil-476,7," Darker tone than expected
","Briggs, Riley, and Lulu, were all Army Rangers in Afghanistan, and suffered a variety of physical and, especially mental, traumas. Briggs' PTSD saw him invalided out, while Riley drove into a tree ar 120mph. This left Lulu, Riley's highly trained Ranger dog, suffering both PTSD and bereavement. Briggs, wanting official endorsement for future employment despite his handicap, is tasked with transporting Lulu (or Dog, as he calls her) down the Pacific coast to Riley's funeral. All does not go smoothly.",/review/rw7900008/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2022,rannynm,7," Compelling Story About Two Warriors That Rescue Each Other In Their Odyssey Of Self-Discovery

",It's definitely an original. Cute frisky sassy dog. Channing was excellent in his role. He actually looks military. Movie is playful while the dog tugs at my heart. Happy ending gets 9 stars from me. You saved the dog.,/review/rw7900008/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2022,Pairic,8," Moving Serious Comedy
","Dog: A serious comedy. Channing Tatum is a discharged Army Ranger recovering from a brain injury, he wants to do a security guard course but needs clearance from his former C. O. Unsure that Tatum is fit the officer says he'll sign off on it if Tatum delivers a temperamental Combat Dog, Lulu, to her handlers funeral in Arizona. A road movie ensues with high jinks from Lulu messing up Tatum's encounter with tantric yoga practitioners, meeting up with an off the grid hippie couple and causing havoc in a hotel. There are plenty of laughs but also a very serious side to the film. PTSD, alcoholism, drug abuse and family break up among injured war veterans are explored. As is the monstering/othering of the enemy and the effect that can have on the dogs outside of a military setting, An entertaining film which you won't forget in a hurry. Directed by Channing Tatum and Reid Carolin, Written by Carolin and Brett Rodriguez. 8/10.",/review/rw7900008/?ref_=tt_urv

19 February 2022,carlhannan-18311,9," Dog 2022
","Been looking forward to this movie since I saw the trailer, just finished my experience at the cinema and I am impressed. All I can say is it should of been marketed as more of a drama as well as a comedy, still definitely worth a watch and very good acting by changing Tatum.",/review/rw7900008/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2022,sbweightman,8," heartfelt and poignant
","A heartfelt and poignant drama about a man and a dog dealing with physical and psychological trauma after serving in the US Army, such as PTSD, loss and moving on. It's not a comedy, but the road trip has plenty of humorous events to keep you entertained as well as the interesting emotional drama. Great acting from both the leads as they break down, heal and build themselves up again, and some beautiful scenery as well.",/review/rw7900008/?ref_=tt_urv

5 October 2022,justahunch-70549,7," Nice film about one of our not often thought of heroes
","This is pretty good and it somehow avoids most of the predictable cliches usually in animal movies. This tale of an Army veteran taking a violent K-9 dog to the funeral of the soldier he was assigned to does have a fairly predictable ending, but that's okay as no one would want it any other way. This is a well made film with Channing Tatum providing us with one of he better performances. Animal films tend to get overly sentimental, but this one avoids much of that and is an on the road drama with comedy overtones that should satisfy any dog lover. Not sure how or why Tatum became a film director for this with another first time director, Reid Carolin, but whoever is responsible for what, it's a job well done much like the hero of this film, Lulu.",/review/rw7900008/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2022,bcbuttles,9," Loved it - for Dog lovers and American Patriots!
","Really amazing and wonderful story. Not a sad story at all. Really great story of helping, searching, seeking the help for two amazing soldiers (one with 2 legs and a furry one with 4 legs). Lulu (Dog) is simply incredible and amazing. A must watch for all Lovers of Dogs and America! Great friendship message but and even better Love story between a Solider and another Soldier.",/review/rw7900008/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is a very likeable film. Between the likeable characters, especially the dog and the touching story. I think the film was handled very nicely. Giving it a calm mellow feel to it. The comedy is fun, and scenery is cool. Overall I though this film did exactly what it wanted to do and tell a touching, funny, sweet dog movie.",/review/rw7900008/?ref_=tt_urv
