3 May 2022,Pat100,9," Very dark, very good comedy
",I'm sure there's something immoral about giving this show a 9 but it had me laughing for all 8 episodes and I can't find any fault with it.,/review/rw7975669/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2022,JaneU2143,10," Hilarious One Liners
",Courtney Cox and Greg Kinnear play so well off of each other. I have LAUGHED OUT LOUD at Kinnear's one liners in every episode.,/review/rw7975669/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2022,NickBOKC,8," A Must See
","Don't be deceived by negative reviews, this is definitely worth your time! I came close to passing on this brilliant series but glad I gave it a chance. The writing is perfect and love the hilarious quips between the family members. I would have given it a higher rating but wanted more. Eight episodes Isn't Enough, pun intended. The family dynamic is enough to make me go bat cray, too. You will be left wondering if Pat is really cray or possessed. The ending left room for a season 2 but not sure how it could be done.",/review/rw7975669/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2022,ShaMana999,8," 3 eps down and I'm enjoying it quite a bit
","Don't really understand the low rating this show gets. It's got a snappy script, well executed by the cast. It is a very classic sorry but embraced in it's fullness. It's a bit silly and a bit serious, but anyone watching it should never forget that this is intended to be silly. I like it and plan to finish the season as it unveils. I don't expect amazing twists and turns, just an enjoyable ride.",/review/rw7975669/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2022,degrimstead-1,8," Glad to see others are liking this
","I'm so surprised at all the bad reviews, esp from critics. I think this show is fun! I don't like horror and I think the scary stuff is just right. Funny writing and the family dynamic is interesting. Let's see, what was that other Courteney Cox comedy that was totally panned by the critics but the viewers liked? Oh yeah - ""Friends.""",/review/rw7975669/?ref_=tt_urv

11 March 2022,catrine-48845,8," Not bad
","I did not expect much because of all the negative reviews. I decided to watch it anyway because there's not much else on. I found it entertaining. I always liked Greg Kinnear and Courteney Cox. . As per other reviews, I did not notice much with the age different. If they're in their 50s ,they had their kids in their 30s So I don't see why all the complaints? Just give it a try and don't expect much. It's a lighthearted dark comedy and I'm looking forward to season two. If you are offended by bad language , definitely don't watch it.",/review/rw7975669/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2022,meghanndotta,8," Grew on me
","I must admit I wasn't all that into it at first. But if it was on I'd let it sort of play in the background. After doing that a few times it started to grow on me. Now I look forward to new episodes. Some of the complaints I've seen on here are pretty harsh. I don't think they are fully warranted but I admit it's not everyone's cup of tea. However, it might be yours if you give it a chance. I'm glad I did. By the way, love Judith light as Courtney Cox's mom. The family is a mess but entertaining.",/review/rw7975669/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2022,ruthburley,8," So cute & entertaining
","I'm really enjoying the lightness & comedy of this series. I'm having a lot of laugh out loud moments!! ðŸ˜Š. Loving the characters, especially the teenage daughter, but really, all of them. Well done!!",/review/rw7975669/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2022,flowerstardust1979,8," My Proof That I shouldn't Read Negative Reviews
",Honestly this is laugh out loud hilarious! I almost didn't bother after reading negative reviews and low ratings. It's a very dark comedy and the humour is spot on. I won't go into the story as there's different layers that are hard to accurately portray in writing. Just watch it. Glad a second season has been commissioned. Interested to see how this continues. If you're looking for something full of depth and serious then this isn't for you. If you're looking for a laugh out loud comedy of a woman being possessed by a ghost and slowly transcend into madness then you'll enjoy.,/review/rw7975669/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2022,tidd-46365,8," Confused ðŸ˜•
","I think this show is off to a great start, personally, but I'm really just here to ask what is everyone's issue with the ages of the cast? Get with the times people! It's 2022 and completely normal to have kids in your 30s which would make you 50s with teenagers! End rant, but seriously, get a grip!",/review/rw7975669/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2022,animegamer420,9," Slow start, cool funny scary and mysterious.
","I've seen 7 episodes and this shows awesome! Its a slow start but its worth the investment. I appreciate when a show takes risks instead of relying on a formula, and this show isnt predictable. Its pretty funny. The mystery is engaging. The characters are cute. It has a Silent Hill theme of not knowing if the main character is crazy or if theres a supernatural threat. Its my new fav.",/review/rw7975669/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2022,kjak-69010,10," So Far So Good
",After watching the first two episodes I am ready for more. It's not fantastic but definitely watchable.,/review/rw7975669/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2022,radiospots-2,10," This is so hilarious oh, absolutely love it ignore anybody that gives it a low rating.
","Absolutely surprised that this is so good. It is hilarious, the writing is fantastic and I think the casting is superb, it couldn't have been better. I don't know why anyone would give it so few stars because to me it was one of the funniest TV series that's currently being aired by far.",/review/rw7975669/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2022,PartialMovieViewer,9," Worth a Look
","I haven't watched much with either Courteney Cox or Greg Kinnear, but these two work great. Is this the best I've seen? Nope, but it is pretty good. Formulaic? Of course - everything in this show can be dug out of those classic scary flicks. Is it scary? No, the tongue and cheek nature of this movie made me laugh so much I didn't have the time for being scared. Well paced and great (and strongly borrowed) script. Is Greg Kinnear's part better than his co-starring role in, ""The Mystery Men?"" Not quite. I will Courtney Cox is super in this. I really enjoyed this.",/review/rw7975669/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2022,ben-james-75,10," Give it a chance
","I love this kind of show. We all know the 'ghost story' thing. This is a bit American Horror Story a bit sitcom. We all know the tropes, that's ok. It's a fun ride. I want to ask the 'people' that don't like this show and all the other shows/movies they dump on; 'Do you want people to have no entertainment, do you want no different point of view on a familiar story. Does anyone else feel like the bulk of the bad reviews are just trolls that don't like anything on principle. This is an ok show if you like this type of story. If it's not for you. Watch something else. Let other people make up their own minds.",/review/rw7975669/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2022,Dougmd1974,8," Funny, creepy, wild
","I enjoyed this series. Performances from Courtney Cox and Mira Sorvino are good. I always feel like Courtney is labeled an underrated actress. The son was a weird cast choice and doesn't seem to fit the family dynamic. The humor is dry which I really enjoyed a lot, and I normally don't like but I did in this show. Give it a shot! I hope it returns for season 2!",/review/rw7975669/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2022,cparousis-30615,8," Courtney Cox is awesome
",I was never a fan of Greg Kinear but Courtney Cox shines in this. The backdrop of the Shining hotel adds to the storytelling. The kids are annoying but they need to be in this story. Some minor scares nothing to make you jump out of your seat. First two episodes show promise. Mira Sorvino is perfectly cast to play the spirit of the hotel. Give it a try. Will add this to my DVR.,/review/rw7975669/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2022,hqdmj,," this show is GREAT!!!
",The comedy horror genre is my fave and this is a great installment! Great to see Mira Sorvino and Courtney Cox and all the characters have great chemistry!,/review/rw7975669/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2022,Nikar4,8," Give it time
","I spent the first few episodes unsure whether I liked it or not. I kept thinking ""I'll watch one more to decide"". Honestly, I've one episode to go and realised I'm hoping for a season 2.",/review/rw7975669/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2022,South-County,10," Great new edgy show with an amazing cast!
","Great new show with an amazing cast. Love the horror comedy aspect and quick montage images to other classic horror films they sneak in each episode. Courteney Cox is so amazing and multi-faceted in her role, Greg Kinnear is hilarious, while Mira Sorvino is ghostly elegant. Even the teenage kids have their moments. Each episode from week to week keeps getting better and more intriguing. Can't wait for next week's episode.",/review/rw7975669/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2022,talkteav,9," Comes at you quickly, Shining Vale has a thrilling pace that draws you in from the very beginning.
","The comedy is light and does not overshadow or completely pull you away from a scary moments. For me, it's the first time I'm seeing small, predictable moments compliment rather than hurt. Described as a horror-comedy, Shining vale also seems to fit the categories of mystery and drama, where I felt intrigued, sorry, and scared for Pat (Courteney Cox). These first two episodes left me with a lot to unpack and a desire to see more. My regret will most likely come at the end of the series when I find myself wishing I had waited until Halloween season to watch.",/review/rw7975669/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2022,therealdeviants,8," Spoof of Amityville Horror
","Not a fan of Courtney Cox, but the pairing of her and Greg Kinear is perfect.",/review/rw7975669/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2022,pombolton,8," Decent comedy horror.
","People are such babies. Just enjoy the show you complete muppets. Stop acting like you are some sort of critic's ffs. Just enjoy the show for a change instead of reading these insane reviews. It's Genuinely ok, if you like a comedy horror then you will enjoy this. Courtney Cox does a good as does Greg Kinnear.",/review/rw7975669/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2022,chrisdye-20128,10," seen every episode so far
",Ok so first.thing you should know going in is that coxes character has.episodes involving a ghost that could possibly be described as mental insanity now for. A review of the show I gotta say I laughed out loud multiple times per episode so far it's a good dose of horror as well second the show contains extreme profanity and sex humor if you have a issue with that stay away from this otherwise it's wonderful.,/review/rw7975669/?ref_=tt_urv
