","I thoroughly enjoyed this film, not expecting the gut-punch it provided. The two leads, Jacob Buster as Calvin and Emma Tremblay as Itsy, provided outstanding performances. They were adorable, even though they both played outcasts. (Lesson: It's okay to be different. You don't have to change so you can belong to a certain group.)",/review/rw8841943/?ref_=tt_urv
