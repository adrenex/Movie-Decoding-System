30 April 2022,coreytegley,7," Ben foster is incredible!
",Ben foster is one of the best young actors. If you've seen his movies you will know. His transformation in this movie from the black and white to the color is incredible. It doesn't even look like him. All the other actors were great. The story was a good one but yes had some slow parts. But the parts of the camp were great. So much feeling all the way til the end which was really messed up. The things they made people do was sick. But this is our history unfortunately. Definitely worth a watch.,/review/rw8167402/?ref_=tt_urv

28 April 2022,ChrisBeaken,6," The Survivor
","With an intriguing true story and a notable team behind the camera, it was disappointing at the average execution throughout. Starting off, Ben Foster as the title character is brilliant in his portrayal. He brought a brutally raw and emotional depiction of a survivor of Auschwitz as well as the side effects of what those events could do to a person. The scenes that took place in the past were horrifying in their depiction. The cinematography and camera work allowed the feelings of each character to be present throughout. It was also enlightening to aspects of the Holocaust that haven't been fully explored in a film. However, where the film brilliantly succeeds in some areas, it sadly fails in others. The film feels as though it was split into two parts, having an intriguing first half, while the duration of the movie after feels unneeded. It made what could have been a great film, drawn out longer than it needs to be, making it at times boring to watch. There are also technical elements of the film that could have easily been fixed to make the film have more of an artistic edge. While there are minor spurts within the narrative, the majority of the film has a bland feel to it. Overall, where the film has plenty of brilliant aspects, it ultimately falters in an overly long runtime and bland execution, making for an experience that sadly has more ambition than it can offer.",/review/rw8167402/?ref_=tt_urv

","As we get farther away from the atrocities at Auschwitz, this movie gives us another perspective. An incredibly sad and hopeless circumstance for this man, yet he continues on.",/review/rw8167402/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2022,bbevis-47954,5," Excellent Story and Performances
","Conveyed in the most boring way possible. The first 45 minutes or so is pretty engaging due to Ben Foster's performance. Around one hour in The Survivor starts to do significant jumps in time that are off putting. The pacing becomes glacially slow after the first hour and I stopped being engaged in the story. Scenes of lengthy conversations are drawn out with uninteresting cinematography (with the exception of the holocaust scenes) and static camera placements. The dialogue never pops out enough to make many of these conversations engaging. The performances really save this movie with Ben Foster showing off his chops and Danny Devito putting some much-needed energy in the few scenes he is in. Some scenes do stand out and are very profound, but others struggle under the weight of the stilted dialogue and a runtime that feels like three hours. Worth a watch if your expectations are in the right place, because there are parts of this story that are tragically beautiful. Unfortunately, The Survivor is a great story told in the most boring way possible.",/review/rw8167402/?ref_=tt_urv

15 May 2022,guskeller,8," Fresh perspective
","The Survivor provides a fresh perspective on a known atrocity. Narratives surrounding the Holocaust are often meaningful, but this adds tragic layers of survivor's guilt and complicated love. Ben Foster (who is underappreciated) gives a conflicted and vulnerable performance while also sacrificing his body for the role. The third act awkwardly shifts away from boxing and the dialogue is straightforward, but the plot remains extremely humanizing. By maintaining a small scale and examining the protagonist's complexity, The Survivor makes unbelievable horrors relatable and recontextualizes a desensitized story. For that, the film stands out and succeeds.",/review/rw8167402/?ref_=tt_urv

8 June 2022,zkonedog,5," A Film I Desperately Wanted To Like Far More Than It Deserved
","There is absolutely no doubt that ""The Survivor"" is a fascinating, harrowing, and poignant Holocaust story. At times, the film features concepts/ideas that are truly significant and worthy of investigation. Sadly, the overall product comes off as quite messy and doesn't allow for the type of meaningfulness that could have sprung from such a project.",/review/rw8167402/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's the first time i'm watching a boxing biopic movie that are Nazi related, it is a very interesting take and life that are captured powerfully by director Barry Levinson, beautifully shot, and well performed, feel a little bit too long, but what happen in The Survivor i mostly enjoy, engaged, and it is overall a pretty fascinating movie.",/review/rw8167402/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2022,On_The_Mark,5," A lot of strong stuff overall severely boring movie
","I think told in a linier fashion this might have been a little more entertaining but the constantly shifting in times along with a bit of boring dialog, the thing just drags a lot. Just because it's a Holocaust story doesn't mean it's a great film.",/review/rw8167402/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2022,danieljfarthing,6," Harrowing true-tale Holocaust survivor story that drags out too long, diminishing it's impact
","In harrowing true-tale drama ""The Survivor"" Ben Foster (solid) is a Holocaust survivor who endured & witnessed shocking atrocities at Auschwitz (shown in striking b&w flashbacks by veteran director Barry Levinson) where Nazi Billy Magnussen (good) forced him to 'box' fellow prisoners to entertain the guards. Still traumatised years later, in NY, he boxes again (inc vs Rocky Marciano (coached by Danny DeVito)) while seeking the love he lost before the war (aided by Peter Sarsgaard & Vicky Krieps)... but this is no fairytale. It's hard-hitting, noble fare, but does drag out too long (at 2hr 9mins) ultimately diminishing it's impact... and that is a shame.",/review/rw8167402/?ref_=tt_urv

2 May 2022,patricklittleton,7," Editing and pacing makes this film confusing. Great story.
","The way this film was edited together makes it confusing for the viewer. It's too choppy and takes away from a great story and a great message in my opinion. Usually, Holocaust stories seem exploitative and a means to invoke sympathy, but this was a strong message about one man's will to survive at all costs. The most important scene in the film, in my opinion, is with the SS officer and Harry Haft at the banquet table after Harry's long fight. It is extremely relevant about the times in which we find ourselves today.",/review/rw8167402/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2022,mattpatt-30444,9," Trauma depicted in triumph.
","Although there are some trite choices, the overall feeling and impression of the film leaves you feeling choked by the visceral realness of the trauma of Harry Haft. Scenes are concise and carefully placed to reveal the strife of someone living in galvanizing shame and remorse for his actions. The search for his love, who was taken to a camp for being Jewish in Poland during 1937, is his guiding light forward to survive.",/review/rw8167402/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2022,kwenchow,2," A bit touching at certain point, but overall too slow, and full of annoying overuse scene! Not recommended!
","This film start with a man walking at the beach, and he thinking about his young lover scene! As turnout, this film is about a man ""Harry"" need to draw attention from the media by fighting with famous boxers, and eventually find his lover ""Leah""! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the searching scene, overuse of the staring scene, overuse of the arguing scene, overuse of the calling names scene, overuse of the driving scene, overuse of the running scene, overuse of the training scene, overuse of the flashbacks scene, overuse of the singing scene, overuse of the drinking scene, overuse of the eating scene, and overuse of the smoking scene! Make the film unwatchable! At the end, Harry found Leah, but Leah already married! Harry telling his wife ""Miriam"" a joke at the very end! That's it! Another disappointed film!",/review/rw8167402/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2022,radhrh,7," Schindler's list meets Raging Bull
","A great performance by Ben Forster, his best to date makes this low budget bio pic compelling. But the last 30 minutes detract from the whole. As with all boxing movies the fights are unconvincing, trained boxers don't take it in turns to punch each other. The love story at the film's heat is also unconvincing, love just doesn't work that way. Still a solid 7 though, which is he high praise from me.",/review/rw8167402/?ref_=tt_urv
