23 October 2009,planktonrules,9," Complex...
","When I first heard about this little film I wasn't particularly interested. Being a high school teacher, I wasn't impressed with the idea of seeing a movie concerning a teenage mother. Believe me, I know enough of them already! However, on a lark, I decided to finally watch the film--almost two years after it debuted. And, in hindsight, I should have just gone and seen the film when it came out, as unlike my ASSUMPTION, it was not really a glorification of teen pregnancy but a very complex film--a film with a lot of different messages and possible interpretations. This is definitely NOT a by-the-numbers (formulaic) film--there is a lot that is original and new. And, if you were worried that the film would be pro-teen pregnancy or abortion or whatever and it might offend you, don't think that way....the film is great for anyone, conservative or liberal alike. And, it might just be an excellent film for you to see with your teens. Excellent, simple and very effective.",/review/rw1791475/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2011,Sandcooler,9," Every good thing you've heard and more
","""Juno"" is an incredibly cute movie, and for once I don't even mean that in a patronising sense. If the movie universe was some sort of gigantic petting zoo, ""Juno"" would be the adorable little lamb standing in the corner making the jealous other lambs look like death incarnate. It's not a sugary sweet tale by any means, in fact it's a real down to earth kind of story that's not always pretty, but the approach to it couldn't be more right. It's humble, it's little, it's low-budget, and that's exactly what makes it so great. What I also liked about it, hell what I like about a lot of independent movies, is that it's never predictable. There is no formula, you don't know what's coming, you don't sit there quietly ticking of all the clich√©s: you just enjoy yourself tremendously. Finally, one last addition to the heap of praise and I swear I'll stop: it's been ages since I've seen an ending scene this beautiful. It's exactly the way you want it to be, and the camera zooming out at a barely noticeable speed is a brilliant touch. I quite liked ""Juno"".",/review/rw1791475/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2008,Buddy-51,8," from the art house to the megaplex
","The thing that separates ""Juno"" from so many other films about teen pregnancy is that, in this case, the 16-year-old who finds herself in that predicament refuses to become a victim of her circumstances. From the moment she confirms the unwelcome news, Juno studies her options - abortion, raising the child as a single teen parent, adoption - then takes matters into her own hands. Like the Roman goddess who is her namesake, Juno is a bright, often sharp-tongued individual who prides herself on her observant cynicism and her way with a sarcastic quip. However, she's not above appealing to the adults in her life when the problems of the world get to be too much for her (though, in some cases, the grownups are coping with more serious issues than she is). Yet, Juno makes certain that it is she and she alone who will have the final say when it comes to determining the course of her own future and that of her child.",/review/rw1791475/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2016,gbill-74877,8," Smart, funny, and many positive messages
","Full disclosure, I would probably see Ellen Page and Jason Bateman in anything, I love them both so much. Page is of course in the starring role here, and delivers an outstanding performance as the quirky Juno, a high school who finds herself pregnant after spontaneous sex with her nerdy friend (Michael Cera). The film is very well made, with clever dialog and composed of countless little moments that are amusing, despite dealing with a serious subject. Juno resolves to give the baby up for adoption to a yuppie couple played by Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner, but things get complicated with Bateman's character begins getting close to her because of their interests in rock music and slasher films, kindling long-standing desires on his part to do more in life before becoming a father.",/review/rw1791475/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2008,isabelle1955,," Manipulative and Simplistic
","Look, I do get it. I fully appreciate that a film about a girl who gets pregnant, has an early abortion, then manages to move on, would be a pretty short movie. In fact, so short it wouldn't get made. No one wants to know about reality. And certainly in 21st century North America, no one wants to portray abortion as a viable option. Very, very bad form currently.",/review/rw1791475/?ref_=tt_urv

","This could have been a very, very good film. I enjoyed the basic plot - a quirky, tomboy-ish 16 year old discovers she's pregnant, decides to give the baby up for adoption to the ""perfect couple"" but finds that the perfect couple isn't so perfect - and maybe no relationship ever is.",/review/rw1791475/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2007,shizz_27,7," Let's not get carried away, people.
","""Juno"" is funny (nearly every single line of dialogue is written to elicit laughter), directed with at just as sure a hand as ""Thank You For Smoking"".. possibly surer.. and acted gamely by the whole cast -- especially Olvia Thirlby and J.K. Simmons as the title character's galpal and understanding dad. The script, by Diablo Cody, is rich with one-liners; anyone who's read Candy Girl (which is unbelievably intelligent and funny; her description of Shania Twain, especially, had me rolling) will kind of know what to expect.",/review/rw1791475/?ref_=tt_urv

","I rarely go the movies, I watch them on cable or rent them usually. When I heard about Juno I was interested but afraid it would disappoint. I Forgot about it and probably would have never seen it if I had not stumbled on it on cable one lazy Sunday afternoon. I think there are some very valid criticisms of the movie and of course there are some errors and questionable choices made, but the movie was filmed in 31 days which I find amazing.",/review/rw1791475/?ref_=tt_urv

","This wasn't worth watching, and I had that feeling after I saw a trailer for it while I was in the cinema waiting for ""Atonement"" (that film should not be mentioned on the same page as this one). I got it out from my Uni library, so at least it didn't cost me money. It's not all bad, Jennifer Garner's performance as the woman desperate for a child is very touching, but the rest of the film is so obnoxious and pretentious that I just want to kick it.",/review/rw1791475/?ref_=tt_urv

","Juno is the story of how a 16 year old girl (named Juno, played by someone who is now supposedly no longer who they were, but that's a whole other deal) finds herself in a pickle of a predicament, and how it affects her life and the lives of those around her in the most offbeat, quirky ways.

23 February 2008,Turfseer,3," For lovers of Oprah
",Those who love Oprah will probably love this movie along with aficionados of daytime soap operas. The strategy of such movies is to give the characters a few quirks but make sure they all have hearts of gold. Juno is full of witty quips (improbable for most 16 year olds) and her boyfriend Bleeker loves tic-tacs (that's about all we found out about him throughout the entire movie). ,/review/rw1791475/?ref_=tt_urv

","Anybody who gets to see the promos or the DVD covers would have enough clue about what the movie is about.Well I can tell you this,its not only the story which was brilliant - Its the wonderfully written screenplay,great acting by the casts,captivating photography with great locations and of course Ellen Page's incredible acting which has made a mark. There is generally a specific group of audience who could appreciate a certain movie,but when it gets to Juno...anybody above the ""PG13"" audience will definitely love it.The movie is about emotions,friends,innocence,parenthood,commitment and of course the fun in living it up! I enjoyed watching the movie over a Sunday afternoon at home,I just fell in love with it :)",/review/rw1791475/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2008,stefanbe,10," Despite the massive popular success that Juno has deservedly received, it is still a small film with a big message at heart.
","While the teen comedy genre has been littered with the fine works of directors like John Hughes and Paul Weitz, most entries are poorly written and acted affairs that fail to capture the world of teenagers. With Juno, director Jason Reitman and screenwriter Diablo Cody have managed to create a realistic portrayal of teenage life without being dreary or overly artsy. The intent of Juno is to tell the story of a sixteen-year-old girl who deals with a responsibility ""way beyond her maturity level"" and the people around her who care. The filmmakers succeed in not only creating the most realistic teenage comedy ever produced, but also in bringing characters who the audience trusts and knows. Juno is down-to-earth and grounded in reality, never over-the-top and intelligent enough to not rely on cheap gags to gain laughs. The naturalist feel of the actor's performances also gives the film a sense of being there with the characters as they charm the audience with their whimsy. Juno is bold and smart and is always entertaining and comfortable.",/review/rw1791475/?ref_=tt_urv

29 November 2008,orangeisthenewawesome,1," This movie is garbage
","Realize this movie was hyped to the wazoo for being wacky and offbeat. Actually, it's just garbage. The dialogue absolutely RUINS this movie. I realize it's a movie and is not necessarily expected to be realistic but it is so far from reality (and not in a good way) that it's just annoying. The character of Juno occasionally resembles a realistic teenager but most of the time is just a caricature of some type of person I have never seen or heard of in real life. The soundtrack blows. The whole movie is some pretentious attempt to be cool and artsy and instead just comes across as really silly.",/review/rw1791475/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2016,oOoBarracuda,9," Juno
","Diablo Cody penned an insanely well-written story of a sixteen-year- old individualist who becomes pregnant with her friend/crush in her 2007 film Juno. Directed by Jason Reitman and starring Ellen Page, Jennifer Garner, and Jason Bateman; Juno is fantastically crafted with enough pop culture references to place it until the end of time. The uniqueness of each person is fostered and treasured through Juno, going to show that if you can find that one person to make you feel comfortable with being you, do whatever you can to be with them.

1 January 2008,zetes,5," Too cutesy by half
","When I saw the trailer for this film, what seems now like seven months ago now, I cringed. It came off as if the screenwriter was screaming ""Aren't I quirky? Yay!"" I was hoping, even praying, after the hugely positive reviews hit the street, that the trailer was just trying to sell it as a quirky indie flick, and that it was really just a heck of a lot better than that trailer, which, by the time it opened in the Twin Cities, whence screenwriter Diablo Cody hails, I had seen about a thousand times. Alas, no. Not only is it as bad as the trailer made it look, the trailer shows bits from just about every sequence in the film. It doesn't give away one of the movie's big twists, but it does give away about 75% of the jokes. What's truly pathetic is that only about one out of five jokes were funny anyway. And I wasn't the only one who thought so. The theater was packed (Twin Cities residents can't help but flock to any movie that even mentions the state of Minnesota, and the audience got excited at mere references to St. Cloud, Stillwater and Mankato), but not once did the audience collectively find anything uproarious. You'd hear some laughs at most of the jokes, but it was never everybody, and it was only ever sporadic. And the film had its fair share of gags that completely bombed, the audience entirely silent. The plot is incredibly shallow, and completely uninsightful about the issue of teenage pregnancy. Apparently, it's only a condition that requires belabored dialogue and a constant barrage of twee-pop songs to make it out okay. To make it worse, a large portion of the audience was made up of teenage girls. Between this and Britney Spears' sister, I predict teen pregnancy to be all the rage in 2008! Seriously, the whole film sometimes comes off as Diablo Cody making an embarrassing scramble to prove her indie cred. The Stooges! Dario Argento! Belle & Sebastian (okay, I love Belle & Sebastian, too, so sue me). For the most part, the characters are two-dimensional and come off as disconnected from any recognizable reality. For an instance, would an ultrasound technician express her satisfaction that a teen will not be raising the baby so audibly? Would the receptionist at Planned Parenthood treat a patient so cavalierly? The only characters who come off as anything close to three-dimensional are Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner. Garner in particular is outstanding among the actors, and, with this script, you can put all of the credit with her talent. Her scene in the mall is a knockout (perfect for an Oscar clip, yes?). Really, the performances in general are pretty good. As soon as I saw Ellen Page in X-Men 3, I knew she would be a star. I hate the fact that I think X-Men 3 is her best movie so far, despite the two others she's had that garnered some critical acclaim (Hard Candy and the film presently being discussed). I do wish they'd given Michael Cera, so funny in Superbad, a little more to do. I'd like to propose that we stop Diablo Cody before she strikes again. This script CANNOT win Best Original Screenplay. If I start the hunger strike now, I should be able to get some media coverage. Oh, who am I fooling",/review/rw1791475/?ref_=tt_urv
