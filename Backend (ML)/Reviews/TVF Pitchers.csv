","In Los Angeles, Lenore St. John (Famke Janssen) is murdered with sliced throat in the apartment of her ex-husband Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) and he is accused by the police of murdering her. Detective Franck Dotzler (Forest Whitaker) pursues Bryan while he investigate who might be the killer and protects his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). Bryan discovers that the Russian gangster Oleg Malankov (Sam Spruell) is the responsible of Lenore's death and together with his team of friends and Lenore's husband Stuart St. John (Dougray Scott), he hunts him down. But why Lenore was killed?",/review/rw3167286/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2015,moviexclusive,3," A shockingly disappointing finale, 'Taken 3' is a disgrace to its star Liam Neeson and an appalling display of ineptness by its director Olivier Megaton
","To set the record straight, no one gets taken in 'Taken 3', a condition that its principal star Liam Neeson laid down before he agreed to return for this third and presumably final instalment. That is perfectly fine with us; after all, how many times can ex- Special Forces operative Bryan Mills find himself having to deploy his very particular set of skills after a member of his family is taken away from him? Indeed, that is not the issue we had with this utterly disappointing third outing, which totally squanders what audience goodwill the first movie had accumulated and its immediate predecessor had not yet depleted.",/review/rw3167286/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Taken
","This is my biggest guilty pleasure of all time, I know this film is God awful, from the directing to the writing and the stereotypical villain but I honestly don't care it was just popcorn entertainment and seeing Liam Neeson as Bryan Mills is always good. The plot of this film is basically the plot of The Fugitive. This film is so bad it's good and that's why I give this film 6/10.",/review/rw3167286/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2015,thesar-2,1," Mistaken
","Oh, sure, there are a ton of sequels that both ""take"" down a series, but also ""take"" it too far. Taken 3 is the A Good Day to Die Hard of the series and by God, I hope both movies end the two franchises. ",/review/rw3167286/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2018,TheLittleSongbird,2," Good thing the series ended here
","Moderately enjoyed the first 'Taken', while finding a fair share of faults, finding it overall an above average film that could have done more with promising potential. Was underwhelmed by 'Taken 2', which had good things but was essentially a very tired and even more ridiculous rehash with lazy stereotypes and a lack of suspense.",/review/rw3167286/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2015,rogerdarlington,," ""It ends here"" is good advice
","In the beginning, former special forces expert Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) found that his daughter was taken in Paris while, in the sequel, he himself was taken in Istanbul. Clearly Neeson took a bit of persuading to play the role a third time, but it would appear that three factors persuaded him: first, he didn't want to do any travelling this time (so all the shooting -in both senses of the word - is in the overly-familiar Los Angeles where he goes ""down the rabbit hole""); second, apparently he didn't think anyone should be taken this time (and the writers obeyed the injunction until near the end when they just couldn't resist any more); and third, he wanted the money.",/review/rw3167286/?ref_=tt_urv

30 December 2016,Floated2,7," Above average though Entertaining
","Taken 3 opens with a sort of turned over family soap opera within the Mills family. Daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) is pregnant and unsure how to tell her father or her boyfriend. Ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) is unhappy with her second marriage and having fantasies about Bryan. But then things get dangerous when someone close to Bryan is killed, leaving him framed for the murder. He then goes on the lam with the police, lead by Detective Dotzler (Forest Whitaker), in hot pursuit. Bryan must evade them while tracking down the real killers at the same time. Much of the rest of the film is a cat and mouse game between Bryan and Dotzler. Although there was not much of a ""taken"" set in this film, there does happen to be one subtle close moment which is important in keeping to pay close attention.",/review/rw3167286/?ref_=tt_urv

21 January 2016,m1965,," Excellent!
","I love this series. I can't for life of me understand why anybody would review this poorly, yet I see bad reviews. Clearly those people are nitpicking. This is a classy action film. It follows really well in the footsteps of those that proceeded it. Liam Neeson is just a great action star. He knows when to pour it on, and when to back off so it's not too much. That's really important in this genre, because any misstep can easily make the movie look phony, cheap - or just bad acting.",/review/rw3167286/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2015,searchanddestroy-1,," At last the last chapter
","I am very pleased to know that's at last the final chapter of this juicy, fancy crap trilogy. Product one more time of Europacorp crap factory. Luc Besson's crap factory. Except for jewels such as THREE BURIALS or HOMESMAN, pure masterpieces. So, back to this one, I'd begin to say that I prefer WID CARD, that I watched last week. It was a simple B picture without any pretension, except the one to entertain, nothing else. But TAKEN 3, this big, fancy juicy crap cost at least one hundred and fifty millions dollars and that remains predictable from the very beginning. Action sequences are killers not for the characters but for the audiences. I nearly left the theatre. I was through only after ten minutes. I did not want to disturb the people sitting around me, so I stayed. But I thought all long this crap that I wouldn't make it.",/review/rw3167286/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2015,The-Sarkologist,8," Don't expect the trail of bodies from the previous movies
","Well, once again Megaton grabs the weapon of mass destruction that happens to be Liam Neeson and this time drops him in the heart of Los Angeles, though since in this film he has been framed for murder and in most instances he is being chased by the LAPD he unfortunately isn't able to go on the killing spree that he did in the previous movies. I guess that is not surprising because it looks like they have wanted to try something different from the previous movies so as to wrap up this action packed extravaganza.",/review/rw3167286/?ref_=tt_urv

13 January 2015,bob-the-movie-man,5," Disappointing and unrealistic sequel
","Liam Neeson returns to the role of Bryan Mills, a government operative with a ""particular set of skills"", who gets framed for the murder of one of his nearest and dearest - - I don't do spoilers, but the trailer neatly does: thanks a bunch trailer! Knowing his innocence, and not taking any s**t from anyone, Mills goes on the run to get to the bottom of who framed him and make them pay. Hindering Mills more than helping him is police chief Franck Dotzler (Forest Whitaker) who is not only dogged in his pursuit of Mills as the key suspect but also extremely smart, trying to piece together the complex three-way relationship between Mills, his ex-wife Lenore (Bond-girl Famke Jansson) and her current husband Stuart (MI-2's Dougray Scott). Staying just one step ahead of the pursuing cops, Bryan's focus rapidly turns to his daughter Kim Bauer - oh, sorry, wrong franchise - Kim Mills (Maggie Grace) and keeping her safe from the bad guys.",/review/rw3167286/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2015,xgabrielchastainx-427-835287,1," Actually worse than Taken 2.
","You'd have to be an idiot to trust the opinion of someone who can't review a movie without waffling for 20 minutes. Listen to me; you won't be sorry. This is not a good movie. Taken was pretty good; Taken 2...not so much. This one is just bad; It's just an old guy running around, shooting at stuff. None of the clever stuff from the other 2 movies is here. Nothing that made Taken good is in here. Nothing that made Taken 2 at least recognizable as a Taken movie is here. ",/review/rw3167286/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2015,george.schmidt,8," Neeson continues his dynamic as stealthy avenger Bryan Mills
","TAKEN 3 (2014) *** Liam Neeson, Maggie Grace, Famke Janssen, Forest Whitaker, Dougray Scott, Sam Spruell, Leland Orser, Jon Gries, Dylan Bruno, Don Harvey. Neeson is back as Bryan Mills, the man with a 'special set of skills' who finds himself as a fugitive in the murder of his ex-wife (Janssen) and his attempt to find the real criminals while protecting their daughter (Grace) in the process. While Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen reteam with a more tight and streamlined screenplay than the last chapter of the successful high octane franchise - as well as its director Olivier Megaton keeping things lively - it is still predictable as to who the perpetuator is even before he makes his appearance. Still Neeson is undeniably dynamite as the stolid avenger and the ass-kickings are more viscerally fulfilling.",/review/rw3167286/?ref_=tt_urv

3 January 2019,saptesh786,8," Good Thriller !
","Once again I am wondering for low ratings to such good thriller 'Taken 3 'as the movie is watchable . I agreed that there are some unrealistic situations as one can't trust, but thrill, tension and suspense are major part of the movie and will carry you within high voltage voyage of breathe holding actions. Moreover there are also one or two twists at the end. As me Taken is best, Taken 2 is average and Taken 3 is good. It is also appreciable thing that the main actor Liam Nelson is doing all his stunts own. Technology war is playing a big role in the movie. Intelligent hero with intelligent cops and clever villain are entertaining you till last. Leave aside unbelievable situations and enjoy thrill only you will definitely got a good movie not disappointing you.
Firstly I though there is a link of first two parts (Albanian brothers), but later found this is alike from it and we can hop that for Taken 4 to complete Albanian brothers revenge story.
I recommend for thrill & suspense. Go and watch. Not consider low ratings.",/review/rw3167286/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2015,zardoz-13,10," The Third Time Is The Charm!!!
","A good action thriller rarely gives its hero a chance to catch his breath. The bottom seems to fall out from under Liam Neeson in the second ""Taken"" sequel with twists, thrills, and surprises galore. In ""Taken 3,"" the 62-year old Irish thespian makes monkeys out of some rather nasty apes. This improbable but exciting, PG-13-rated, crime thriller differs from its predecessors. Not only does it take place in Los Angeles rather than Europe, but also nobody abducts anybody. Instead, ""Taken 3"" is a wrongly-accused, innocent man, murder mystery about husband accused of carving up his former wife. The first sign an action franchise is on the ropes is when the producers either start pulling the plug on primary characters or replacing actors. The Famke Janssen character Lenore St. John exits the action early on in this fleet-footed installment, and she ends up in the morgue with a slashed throat. Lenore won't make an encore unless ""Transporter"" writer & producer Luc Besson pulls a ""Dallas"" and resurrects this dame. Similarly, ""Mission Impossible 2"" actor Dougray Scott takes over the role that actor Xander Berkeley originated as Lenora's second husband, Stuart St. John, who appeared briefly in ""Taken."" Nevertheless, despite these changes and the ill things they usually bode for a Hollywood franchise, ""Taken 3"" surpasses the first two epics. ""Taken 2"" director Olivier Megaton and ""Taken"" scenarists Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen never let the pace slacken once they've established the premise and everything goes to Hell in a bucket. Neeson has to elude cops on foot, survive cars plunging respectively down elevators as well as hillsides with explosive results, swerve around cars and gigantic cargo container boxes careening down a freeway, and dodge a hailstorm of blazing lead. If you enjoyed the first two ""Taken"" movies, you shouldn't be disappointed with the third one. Personally, I liked it enough to watch it twice. ",/review/rw3167286/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2015,thomas-w15,2," Even Liam Neeson could not save this one....
","Taken 3: Liam Neeson is the king of action movies. He is the ultimate badass. Every action movie I have seen with Liam Neeson, I have enjoyed. Every single film... except Taken 3. Liam Neeson tried but ultimately the movie was terrible. The film suffers from a near non- existent plot that thinks a lot of car chases and explosions is enough to make this movie passable- it was not. ",/review/rw3167286/?ref_=tt_urv
