","I hadn't seen the first film and only knew Scott Adkins from badly acted low budget action thrillers where you constantly skip ahead to the next fight scene, because everything in between is just atrocious.",/review/rw8640653/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,9," More Accidents please!
","I enjoyed the first Accident Man, but noticed the directing issues that failed it from being great to only good. And it's rare that a sequel is as good or better than the first film, but with newb filmmakers the Kirby brothers in their second full length feature film at the helm this time, they nailed it, and this sequel is near perfect.",/review/rw8640653/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2022,tkdlifemagazine,9," One of the Best Martial Arts Films of 2022
","Scott Adkins returns to the big screen in Accident Man: Hitman's Holiday. This action packed, comedic romp, is a sequel to the 2018 cult classic, Accident Man.",/review/rw8640653/?ref_=tt_urv

","Hey, I liked this comic derived action better than the drivel of Marvel and DC at this point.",/review/rw8640653/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2022,Robi1946,6," Too-notch once again!
",You won't find any quick cuts to the action if you're familiar with anything that Adkins has been a part of.,/review/rw8640653/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2022,destroyerwod,8," A bloody good time mate !
","I really enjoyed the first Accident Man, it had a very solid cast when it comes to on screen martial arts including Michael Jai White, Ray Park, Amy Johnston. The story was simple but effective and the action was top notch.",/review/rw8640653/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2022,jimworrell-10770,9," Seriously good martial art choreography...
","However, it does get laboured as the human body couldn't really sustain that amount of hurt!",/review/rw8640653/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2022,alan_holloway_2,10," Fast, Funny and Fighty!
","I loved Accident Man, as it was a surprisingly faithful adaptation of the acclaimed UK comic. Scott Adkins was a new one in me, and I thought he nailed it.",/review/rw8640653/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2022,DezmoTheMovieMan,7," Are you not entertained? I was!!
","I watched the movies in reverse order, starting with number 2, then number one. Prior to today, I have no idea this movie even existed. As it turns out, it was pretty entertaining. I've never heard of Scott Adkins, but he did a great job and kept me entertained the entire movie. I also love Perry Benson's support role, he was funny and kept the story clean.",/review/rw8640653/?ref_=tt_urv

18 October 2022,stanrohrer,8," Well worth the watch!
","This one is well worth the watch if you like to watch movies for entertainment vs being preached at and woke-splaned. None of that here. All the action you'll ever need and the plot fits the action. Definitely get your popcorn ready ahead of time. The acting is better than I expected as well. The characters that are supposed to be likable ARE, the ones you're not supposed to like are pretty dislikable as well. The fight with the clown was definitely over the top. Pretty much non-stop entertainment with this movie. If you only watch movies for social commentary and angst, this isn't the movie for you.",/review/rw8640653/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2022,imdb-23821,9," Shockingly amusing
",I sit here writing this review in total amazement watching yet another Scott Adkins film and finding it so much better than the pandemic garbage I've seen for 2 years. This isn't Ghandi. It's a bit over the top adventurism which doesn't take itself seriously and provides plenty of laughs and superb martial arts to keep you entertained.,/review/rw8640653/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2022,kamzrevs,10," BEST MARTIAL ARTS MOVIE OF 2022
","BEST MARTIAL ARTS MOVIE OF 2022!!!!! Scott Adkins, directors George and Harry Kirby and the rest of the crew put up amazing job with action, comedy, characters and music. The fight scenes in this movie are one of the bests ever, the camera work during fights is very very well done, no cuts and no shaky cam as the fights should be directed. Fight scenes are better than the first movie because they are done in Hong Kong style like Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, et cetera. This film is Deadpool meet Hitman's Bodyguard and John Wick. If like martial arts made in Hong Kong Style with comedy then this movie is for you.",/review/rw8640653/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2022,nogodnomasters,7," Even killers need mates
","The film opens with a killer clown ( Beau Fowler) attacking Mike Fallon (Scott Adkins ) teaser. It shows us one overblown hit as Mike retreats to his centrally located abode in Malta. Here the film copies the ""Pink Panther"" Cato Fong home attack with Sui Ling (Sarah Chang) who had some good lines and was able to steal scenes. Mike runs into fellow assassin Finicky Fred (Perry Benson) and they end up working together as there is a lot of work on Malta. Their world gets turned upside down when a large contract is placed on Dante Zuuzer (George Fouracres) the crybaby son of the Greek mafia crime boss Mrs. Zuuzer (Flaminia Cinque). Mike is placed in a position to guard Dante against a league of assassins or else Fred dies. One of the paid assassins is Big Ray (Ray Stevenson) Mike's dad. To make matters worse Dante swallows a tracking device. Mike ends up facing the assassins one at a time.",/review/rw8640653/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2022,thephatgentleman-69305,9," A Wild Ride for Any Red-Blooded Acton Junkie
","We live in pretentious times. If a film doesn't feature ""the message"" or other agendas, it is usually given the middle finger by critics. Which is unfair. I DO NOT want EVERY film I see to pander to the popular political or social agendas of today. Sometimes, I JUST WANT a WILD GOOD TIME!",/review/rw8640653/?ref_=tt_urv

",Scott Adkins Does it again.,/review/rw8640653/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2022,strindbergman,6," A decent sequel with some funny bits
","I enjoyed this movie. Not the best action movie, not even amongst Scott Adkins's best, but still a fun watch. The first movie was a nice surprise when I saw it, and I didn't know there were going to make a sequel, so there goes another nice one.",/review/rw8640653/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2022,danielcereto,4," Embarrassing CGI
","I love B-movies like the original Accident Man. It was a great little surprise full of action, dirty jokes and acceptable fighting choreographies. That's why I watched this one.",/review/rw8640653/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2022,Leofwine_draca,5," Weak and rushed follow up
","This is a disappointingly rushed follow-up to the original movie, which I largely enjoyed. HITMAN'S HOLIDAY was obviously made on the cheap (in just a couple of weeks) with location shooting in Malta the only asset. The story is as basic as ever, but this time mired in dumb humour and even dumber situations, resorting to toilet humour and the like to make an impact. I only found a couple of scenes amusing. On the plus side, it once again has superior fight choreography even if the action is a far cry from that of the original movie, and some scenes, like the killer clown, go on far too long. The Chinese girl is a real scene-stealer here.",/review/rw8640653/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2022,aaron-bella,10," Scott Adkins batman
","Scott Adkins as the next
Batman believe Scott Adkins would be one of the best actors to play this roll, because all the past Batman actors haven't had the skill to look good in the fighting scenes Batman is suppose to be one of the best fighting characters in de comics so far he's been one of the weakest and slowest I've seen, if he's played by an actor with the skills needed to fight and look great he might finally get his title back as the best, Scott Adkins is the man to bring life back into Batman if they would only give him a chance, would really like everyone's thoughts on it #scottadkins #batman #batmanfancast #scottadkinsbatman #scottadkinsfancast #fancast #fancastdc.",/review/rw8640653/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2022,gangeshgnair,5," you can watch it for scott adkins and his action
","Into 10 minutes of watching the movie, thought that i might as well stop watching it. But you know what, i love scott adkins and just kept watching it. And i kind of started liking the movie after 40 minutes, because that's when the real action starts. I liked all the action sequences in the movie but my favorite is the one that comes in the mid point, that ones really good. Perry benson was good and funny, all the guys who played assassins were nice.",/review/rw8640653/?ref_=tt_urv

28 October 2022,daisukereds,6," For what it is, it's pretty good!
","This works as a standalone movie, as it takes the time to put you up to speed with a quick summary that doesn't get in the way of the story.. even if there isn't much of a ""story"" anyway. What it has, is a fun situation between killers.",/review/rw8640653/?ref_=tt_urv
