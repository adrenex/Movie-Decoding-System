31 August 2022,Dave-79,7," Great Premise - Questionable ""Format""
","I have to agree with others who've said that 20 minutes is an insanely short period of time for a single episode for a show of this nature. Although promising and compelling in many ways, I think I'll probably wait for the end of October and binge the whole thing. 200 minutes is basically one long movie, and it makes sense to me to watch it as such, instead of the alternative. I'm looking forward to it, though, because so far it's very good. And now I've been told that my review is too short. And that it needs to be at least 600 characters. I'll click the ""submit"" button after this particular sentence in order to discern whether or not I've met the minimum requirements for this ""review,"" which is not really a review but more of a critique of this show's particular format. *click*",/review/rw8503402/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2022,Her-Excellency,9," A surprise among current TV series.
","If you look through the offerings that most streaming services have to choose from, it is ... disappointing ... to say the least. Boring. Repetitive, almost. By the third row of these 'pickings', every one of the shows being pushed, look and read the same. IN FACT (true story), I held off from suggesting this as a watch to my husband because I thought it was the doctor/patient series 'The Shrink Next Door' (title which I just now had to look up by remembering that Paul Rudd and Will Ferrell were in it), and which did not interest me. In any case, we passed this up a few times until hubby mentioned Steve Carell was in it, after which we looked it up and began watching. We're now 5 episodes in, and we are both surprised and pleased.",/review/rw8503402/?ref_=tt_urv

1 October 2022,apaskevi-1,9," Ridiculous people
","I saw all the low star ratings, and was confused why this brilliant, thought provoking, cerebral, well-acted, well-executed, thrilling psychodrama was receiving such low ratings. The reason is rather ridiculous.",/review/rw8503402/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2022,lmrk5705,9," Domhnall Gleeson Is Amazing
","With each episode only 20 minutes long, like other reviewers, I will leave this until all episodes are released and binge it. The first two episodes are excellent. Can't wait to see how this pans out.",/review/rw8503402/?ref_=tt_urv

4 November 2022,pendletonsa-91109,8," Solid
","I'll start by saying I watched this series after it was all released, so the length of the episodes seems irrelevant.",/review/rw8503402/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2022,barob-51973,10," 20 min segments vs a movie?? This is a 10 star show

25 October 2022,spidermonkeycoleman,5," A strong start, but ultimately ruined by an unjustified length and bad ending

10 September 2022,Femalefan,8," If Dexter went for therapy...
",Imagine if Dexter went for psychotherapy and that's enough info to describe the premise of this show without giving away too much. Solid acting from Steve Carell and I'm looking forward to seeing this evolve as the show moves forward. Make sure you watch it with little background noise or distraction as it's pure character discussion and nuanced details.,/review/rw8503402/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2022,Xavier_Stone,4," Some good acting, but the 20min eps makes it terrible
","I love both actors, the writing and flash backs all paint a good picture and it's easy to follow along. However it seems as though just as soon as you are getting into it, the episode ends and there's a new development just to hold your attention for the next show.",/review/rw8503402/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2022,dayana421,5," Changing my 10 star review after watching the 3rd episode
","This was my 10 star review.....We seriously need more shows like this, tired of so many garbage shows out there. The Patient is well written, well acted, unusual show, it's Dexter in psychotherapy. Steve Carell's acting is excellent as usual, very convincing as a Jewish therapist, and Domhnall Gleeson created a strange but somewhat likable Dexter like character, extremely knowledgeable in fine foods because of his profession. Keeps explaining the foods he brings home from restaurants with fancy names and descriptions. The show has dark humor combined with suspense and intellect. I have watched 2 episodes so far and I hope the quality and the momentum of the initial episodes is maintained. I really enjoyed it.... And this is my 5 star review ....after waiting a whole week for the 20 min 3rd episode changed my review to 5 stars. It's like getting a box of chocolates and when you open it there is only one half eaten chocolate.episodes are too short and empty not worth waiting 1 week for a half eaten piece of chocolate. Could have been excellent great acting ,could have been an interesting storyline, it may still be but for now it's not worth the 1 week wait for 20 mins of emptiness.",/review/rw8503402/?ref_=tt_urv

",The Patient 1st and 2nd episode review:,/review/rw8503402/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2022,UniqueParticle,9," Absolutely love this!
","Been waiting till I got incredible sleep to watch and The Patient hits the spot. I love anything about this subject of someone unstable, this done right I just expected the episodes to be longer. The perfect 2 main actors Steve Carell and Domnall Gleason, I don't think Steve has done much thrillers in his career it's a pleasant surprise. This is a brilliant concept that might have mixed opinions but I think it deserves praise! Sam's character is entertaining especially with his knowledge, you want to know more about him. I'm intrigued for more it'll be hard to wait a week, I hate this 600 character bs that IMDB there's not enough to say but this show is awesome!",/review/rw8503402/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2022,CountJonnie,7," Incredibly strong acting
","The patient is about a killer who wants to get rid of his urges, by kidnapping a therapist and locking him in his basement, for private therapy. Which results in a unique relationship.",/review/rw8503402/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2022,reprisecompilation,10," Brilliant Steve Carell. A series not to binge watch.
","First of all: Steve Carell is in his very best form in this series. Amazing, subtle, real theater acting.",/review/rw8503402/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2022,chron,5," Some Good Work, But...
","There is enough to like about this series. The acting is well done, especially the understated performance of Steve Carrell. The plot premise is certainly novel and interesting. It didn't feel like it was too far out there.",/review/rw8503402/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2022,wvj3,4," OK so this is not a mini series
","This is not a mini series. This is a movie that they broke up into 20 minute segments. Why? Just make it a movie. Didn't they have a streaming service that had 20 minute episodes and they went under? Does Hollywood not learn from past experience? I've seen longer commercials. OK rant over. The acting is excellent and it's an interesting story that really has not been explored before. I like it. Steve Carell is always amazing. He can pretty much do anything. The actor that plays ""Sam"", Domhnall Gleeson, is also excellent. If it wasn't for the 20 minute episodes I would given it a 7. However for bad marketing it gets a 4. Hollywood get it together.",/review/rw8503402/?ref_=tt_urv

25 October 2022,sfsugs-78775,4," Was this supposed to be satire?!
","Our serial killer is 140lbs soaking wet, but only kills grown men with his bare hands and never has a scratch on him. Could the prop team not fight him a weapon? No MMA background, just the same little choke move on everyone. Also where the hell are the cops and security cameras in this town?",/review/rw8503402/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2022,anniebella,10," I never thought Steve Carrol could move me to tears
","This show had my full attention for all ten episodes and Steve Carrol had me moved to real heartfelt tears on multiple occasions with his brilliant acting. This was so delicately made and gripping I was feeling the anguish of Dr Strauss the whole way through. The actor who played Sam was also excellent and he made me feel incredibly anxious which was the whole point. This was not a relaxing watch it was quite stressful but a very clever plot and impressed that it held my attention the entire 10 episodes, I honestly didn't think they would be able to stretch the story out for that long but they did it beautifully with Dr Strauss' own internal struggles. A whole different way to look at a serial killer. Well done!",/review/rw8503402/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2022,treydrier,6," Good acting but boring and weird format
",I got halfway through the 4th episode and turned it off. I could not take the boredom any longer. I like the premise. The acting is very good. The writing is not great. The wife's guitar playing at the son's wedding was the final straw. And then there's the daily carry out food choice. The show is just so boring that I grew frustrated having to sit through flashbacks that have nothing to do with the plot. His son doesn't seem to like him. His wife is a bit strange. Yeah ... ok. And then there's the idiotic 23 minute episodes which everyone here has already written about so I will leave it at that. It's not terrible just slow and frustrating.,/review/rw8503402/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2022,trgs5173-406-814019,4," Holy cow that was boring
","The first episode had me hooked with Alan being taken right away and held captive. I was like oh this is gonna be a good suspense show which I love. Wow was I wrong!! As the episodes went on I became so bored. Thankfully the episodes aren't very long. I almost gave up watching but was really hoping something would actually happen...some kind of suspense or a little bit of action. I mean it's about a serial killer and a hostage. Alan never tries to fight back at all?? Really??? And the side story of him having problems with his family...sorry but I didn't really care about that. And his daydreaming I guess of talking to his deceased therapist...another part of the boring factor. And then we get the final episode and what a let down of an ending. Even that was boring. And his daughter getting the letter and message from her dad and Sam (the killer) in the mail and she just calls her brother about it? Ummm how about the police so they can look for ya know some evidence maybe left by Sam instead of them handling it all. And how Sam's mom can be ok with her son killing how many people and destroying their families lives. Wow. That ending of him chaining himself self up in the basement for his mom to take care of him...really? That's what we get?? How's it gonna be explained to everyone that he knows why he has ""disappeared"" basically? And the last scene of Alan's son in therapy now? *Sigh*. I didn't necessarily need a happy ending where Alan made it out alive but the way everything ended was just so boring.",/review/rw8503402/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2022,jordan2240,6," Enjoyed it until the last episode
","We enjoyed the suspense that was built up throughout, and found the performances, particular Gleeson's to be excellent, but the ending left both my wife and I feeling let down. It turned out to be more of a family-reconciliation story than a psychological thriller. Perhaps we simply didn't find the ending to be what we had hoped, but our biggest point of contention was that it seemed none of Gleeson's victims put up a fight. Was he supposed to be super-human? They simply lied there as he strangled them, which was particularly unbelievable in the cases of both his father and Carell, who's characters were not even restrained as they were being strangled. Even when Carell held the mother at 'knife' point, she did nothing to try to get away. Did anyone who wrote this not think it was a bit odd that someone wouldn't fight for their lives as hard as they could? I also found myself getting a bit bored with the interaction between Carell's character and his dead therapist. Overall not a bad watch, but I don't know if I could recommend it after that ending.",/review/rw8503402/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2022,paul-allaer,7," Intriguing first 2 episodes leave me wanting more
","As Episode 1 of ""The Patient"" (2022 release; 10 episodes of about 22 min each) opens, the Steve Carell character (we later learn a therapist named Alan) wakes up in an unfamiliar room and with his ankle shackled to the bed. We then go back in time when Alan has his first patient session with a guy name ""Gene"", who proclaims himself to be ""f---ed up"". At this point we are less than 10 min into it.",/review/rw8503402/?ref_=tt_urv
