20 January 2012,Chrysanthepop,," Britain's Next Favourite Spy Is Back
","Britain's beloved spy is back in Oliver Parker's new spy adventure 'Johnny English Reborn'. Needless to say, the film spoofs the spy action thriller genre (the first titles that pop in mind are those James Bond flicks) and does an excellent job in doing so. And of course, Atkinson is playing the lead so one can expect at least some laugh out loud moments (and there are many of them). The script is funny and the amusing action sequences are remarkably shot. The title role was obviously written for Rowan Atkinson and he performs all guns blazing, tickling you to the bone. Very few can pull off slapstick as well as he does. He is accompanied by two smoking hot beauties, Gillian Anderson (who does a very impressive fake British accent as she stresses and stretches each word) and Rosamund Pike (as a professional behavioural therapist who inadvertently happens to know hypnotherapy). Dominic West does a good evil villain.",/review/rw4037657/?ref_=tt_urv

","Johnny English has been 5 years in retirement in Tibet learning the ways of the master. He is called out of retirement for a mission to China to hunt down ""Vortex"" an assassination group out to kill the Chinese premier. There are 3 keys, or key parts that must be gathered together to have access to a secret weapon.",/review/rw4037657/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Mr. Bean turned spy. Good fun!
","Johnny must redeem himself in a plot against the Chinese Premier. He's back and Johnny English Reborn is actually one of those sequels that outshines the original. While he's older and much of the comedy still is at it's very basic, Mr Bean as a spy, it works a lot better in this film. The plot seems simpler, the idiocy seems to be kept more 'in-check' and it just made the film that bit more enjoyable rather than annoying.",/review/rw4037657/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2012,ma-cortes,6," Entertaining sequel in which Johnny English splendidly performed by Rowan Atckinson goes into the action
","Johnny English Reborn is a comedy spy-thriller with Rowan Atkinson as inept secret agent versus a nasty organization called Vortex . It maintains the slapstick franchise including a good cast as Gillian Amstrong , Rosamund Pike , Dominic West and professionally directed by Oliver Parker . In his latest adventure, the most unlikely intelligence officer in Her Majesty's Secret Service is recruited by MI7 and must stop a group of international assassins before they eliminate a world leader and cause global chaos. Now that the world needs him once again, Johnny English goes into the action . In the years since MI-7's top spy vanished off the grid, he has been honing his unique skills in a remote region of Asia. But when his agency superiors learn of an attempt against the Chinese premier's life, they must hunt down the highly unorthodox agent. Now that the world needs him once again, maladroit klutz Johnny English is back in action. With one shot at redemption, he must employ the latest in hi-tech gadgets to unravel a web of conspiracy that runs throughout the KGB, CIA and even MI-7. With mere days until a heads of state conference, one man must use every trick in his playbook to protect us all. For Johnny English who stumbles through cases like a bull in a factory , disaster may be an option, but failure never is and he invariably and usually by accident manages to solves them .

21 October 2011,TheLittleSongbird,7," So much better than I expected, very thrilling and funny
","This is not to say I didn't enjoy the 2003 film Johnny English, I did. It was cute and funny with a great cast, if occasionally a little too silly and predictable. Johnny English Reborn I was of two minds whether it would work, it looked very funny and interesting, but I worried that it would be too more of the same or that Daniel Kaluuya would be overused or irritating.",/review/rw4037657/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2021,racoonito,7," My meaning of comedy
",This movie is priceless. This is one of my favorite movies of all time. The comedy is prefect and in place. The acting of Rowan Atkinson and the side characters combine for a perfect movie.,/review/rw4037657/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2020,benjacobchurch,8," A funny film
",This movie is great. I love Rowan Atkinson and he is hilarious as always in this movie. There were some very funny gags and the plot wasn't simple but wasn't hard to follow either. Would recommend to people of all ages!,/review/rw4037657/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2019,leoxatzian,6," What if Mr Bean was a spy ?
","As far as spy comedies go, this movie is neither the best nor the worst of it's kind. The plot is simple, the protagonist is the goofy but lovable character we have come to expect from Rowan Atkinson and the villain is obvious as to who he is from beginning to end. In conclusion, ""Johnny English reborn"" purposely keeps everything simple in order to invest more time in silly jokes, resulting in a mediocre but entertaining spy comedy.",/review/rw4037657/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2011,Dinosaw,7," Better than the recent comedies!
","For those sick of the recent high school/teen comedies and rom-coms we're bashed with these days, this film will be a breath of fresh air for you. Sure, the film has some rehashed comedic scenes, but a lot of the humour is pure laugh-out-loud type layered on very good bits of suspense and chase scenes. I really loved the well-choreographed chase scenes and the climactic battle, which was something the first film lacked.",/review/rw4037657/?ref_=tt_urv

16 September 2011,Alise_shenle,10," Great
","This movie is damn funny. I didn't watch the first show, but I can assure you, when I went to watch it yesterday at 21.15, all shows from 20.45, 21.00, 21.15, 21.30, 21.45 were full. Also, during the parts where Mr Bean just talked something funny, the whole theatre was laughing. I almost threw my popcorn up into the air during the chair shrinking part, and my dad choked on his drink. The whole movie is funny and not in a lowbrow way like most movies you see nowadays with disgusting sex or poop jokes. It has the British humour. And the opening scenes imitate the parkour one in James Bond but it is much more realistic. I think, if you don't set your expectations too high, you will find it above your expectations.",/review/rw4037657/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2011,adrian-limch,6," Zero Expectations

16 September 2011,DICK STEEL,7," A Nutshell Review: Johnny English Reborn
","Silly spies and comical cops are always a welcome treat to chase those blues away as far as my record goes, from the likes of Frank Drebin to Austin Powers , perhaps there is none other than Rowan Atkinson's Johnny English, a misfit of British Intelligence, that was much maligned when first unleashed into the world back in 2003. Atkinson is better known throughout the world as Mr Bean, his most successful creation to date, but his Johnny English didn't receive as much love, so a sequel to the film is somewhat surprising, yet anticipated because of Atkinson's prolonged absence from the big screen.",/review/rw4037657/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2019,NijazBaBs,9," better than the 2018 sequel
","I liked this sequel much more than the newer (2018) sequel. There is less useless talk, more action, and more realistic. There we are less aware that movie is movie, setup, acting, but looks more real because it is recorded in such a way, from better position and distance, that actors are not aware of the camera or that they are acting. Looks like there has been less setup made, but actors simply acted more naturally and relaxed. Better action, vehicles, stunts and better actors than in newer sequel. Each character was unique and characterized by some of it unique funny features and are easy to remember. Almost perfect. Perfect for those who like comedies, although I don't like so much that genre but prefer funny parts of other genres, so rated it one less star.",/review/rw4037657/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2014,dromasca,7," reborn indeed
","The combination of high-tech thrillers a la James Bond and the so English humor of Rowan Atkinson worked fine for me in the original 'Johnny English' and work even better in the 'Johnny English Reborn' sequel released eight years later, which I got to see only now. If I am to look for the perfect comedy entertainment I would go for something like this because it succeeds to be funny and anti political-correct, while keeping some logic and sending references to the original movies it is inspired from, without taking itself too much seriously at any moment.",/review/rw4037657/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2011,helmutty,7," Johnny English's back
","I have no idea why the sequel to the funny Johnny English took at least 8 years to be made. I am surprised that there're no Direct-To-DVD sequels (It is smart not to). Guess what. This is bigger than the first one though I wouldn't say that this is more funnier than the first movie but this at least has some hilarious moments. Surprisingly, Singapore has this faster than in U.K and USA.",/review/rw4037657/?ref_=tt_urv
