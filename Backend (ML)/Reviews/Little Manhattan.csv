20 April 2001,Howlin Wolf,7," An interesting little film...
","... because, whilst it doesn't have anything overly outstanding about it, it manages to be very entertaining. Perhaps it's just because the pairing of Gibson and Downey, Jr. appeals to me. Whatever it is, I found the setup interesting, the comedy funny and the action nicely staged.",/review/rw3302238/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2002,Flippitygibbit,," An action movie best played for laughs
","I actually thought this film improved with each viewing - some of the comic lines were lost first time around, with people speaking together, and rotor noise from the aircraft. Air America is probably a little too script-by-numbers, but only if you think about it too much - the key is to just enjoy the action and the comedy. I couldn't tell whether Mel Gibson's character was incredibly laid back, or if the actor just wasn't giving his all - but for me, the more interesting characters were the supporting cast anyway: David Marshall Grant as Rob Diehl and Art LaFleur as Jack Niely. There were a few too many pilots to pad all of the cast out, but the collective effort provided much of the humour. Robert Downey, Jnr. was perhaps the best out of the main cast, from cheesy 'eye in the sky' pilot ('the traffic is kinda sad, kinda bumsy-looking'), to Air America rookie, lost in a world of 'bar girls, squiggly writing on signs, and more bar girls'. Neither Gibson or Downey, Jnr. were particularly convincing as pilots, but luckily the planes (such as Pilatus Porters and Caribous) had enough character to pull off the airborne scenes. Downey, Jnr.'s character had a spectacular, if not slightly drawn out, crash-landing scene, slowly dismantling his aircraft as he slid along an old airstrip. The soundtrack was also a bonus, placing the film in time where the main characters were slightly anachronistic. Frank Sinatra's 'Come Fly With Me' saved the cliched ending with the same droll humour that was peppered throughout the rest of the movie. Overall, Air America is a  film best watched with your brain switched to 'idle' - although the subject is serious, the film is best as pure entertainment.",/review/rw3302238/?ref_=tt_urv

","Air America is a great action comedy that's simple, fun and witty. Mel Gibson and Robert Downey Jr. both give great performances with good chemistry. Nancy Travis and David Marshall Grant are both really good. It's well paced, well filmed and Roger Spottiswoode's direction is also really good. The soundtrack is great and the music by Charles Gross is good.",/review/rw3302238/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2007,ianlouisiana,8," Ditch the collective-guilt syndrome and give it an unbiased eye.
","Here in the UK we have Harold Wilson to thank for refusing to send our soldiers to Vietnam.There are many reasons to consider Wilson,along with Blair both ""socialists"",the worst prime minister of the 20th century,but this single action will prevent him (as opposed to Blair)topping that particular poll.He rightly considered America's south east Asia policy to be none of our concern and propitiously declined to be involved in it. The obvious corollary to that statement you can fill in for yourself. That is not to say that the average Brit in 1969 was anything like anti - American.As usual the lunatic fringe made the most noises,stormed the embassy,threw marbles at police horses and generally alienated the very people they should have been trying to get onside. All of this is perhaps a rather long - winded way of demonstrating that Post - Vietnam guilt is not part of our culture,although heaven knows we understand post - colonial guilt well enough. Therefore we can watch movies about the Vietnam war with far more detachment than the Americans who appear to feel the need to apologise for the miscalculations of long - gone presidents and ignore the traumas of the veterans who were conscripted - many against their will,most against their better judgement - to fight in a desperately hostile and alien environment.These men I salute,the apologists I disdain. ""Air America"" is a very fine movie showing how men involved in conflict take what comfort they can,when they can,in any way they can.From the safety of our cinemas and living rooms we can scorn them and the way they live and think ourselves terribly liberal and morally perhaps even intellectually superior to these grunts,but perhaps we should remember that a liberal is just a fascist who hasn't been mugged. There are no starry - eyed idealists in modern war.The last ones perished in the Trenches - the pilots employed by the CIA were pragmatic skilled professionals who took risks only when no other option was open to them.They flew what they were told to fly and carried what they were told to carry.They didn't spend a lot of time agonising over what they were doing.It is this aspect of their lives that the movie concentrates on.Mr M.Gibson as the vet and Mr R.Downey jr. as the FNG are both excellent,particularly the former,who,along with Mr A.LaFleur acts as though he actually knows how to fly a plane. Sometimes strange and ostensibly undesirable alliances are made in war and I have no doubt the CIA dealt with Vietnamese Army officers and other officials using the most viable currency available - and if that turned out to be drugs,well,so be it.No amount of post - conflict hand wringing is going to make an iota of difference. ""Air America"" tells it's story straightforwardly and doesn't back away from historical facts,if you want to see history re-written with the benefit of hindsight watch Michael Moore. The soundtrack is entirely aposite and the movie contains the campest version of ""A horse with no name"" you could hope for. This is a very under -rated movie and one that future generations freed from tunnel vision will see and recognise accordingly.",/review/rw3302238/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2002,psmoviemaven,7," Some pilots are willing to work anywhere to ""slip the surly bonds of earth"" ...
","This film rendition of Christopher Robbin's ""Air America"", the story of CIA's secret airforce in Laos during the Vietnam War has been fluffed up a tad too much.  I would have hoped they would have kept the tone of the book which was a bit edgier; more like the film version of MASH.  This version makes the ""non-war"" in Laos seem like a Disney World Ride. However Mel Gibson and Robert Downey Jr make it worth the price of admission.  After you watch the flick track down the book for the REAL story.",/review/rw3302238/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2015,SimonJack,7," An aviation movie on the edge of war, with action, scenery and history
","To what extent the different parties were involved in opium smuggling, black market guns, clandestine military operations or anything else in Laos during the Vietnam War, the public likely will never know. Or, at least, we won't know which stories to believe. The bottom line then is that one can't trust any of the claims or defenses. But, the facts about who was there and their purposes are clear, public record, and not refuted. The Internet has sources readily available about Air America. It actually started as far back as 1950. That was in the Truman Administration, so the reviewer who criticized this movie for its implication that Richard Nixon was behind it and tried to cover it up was correct in his assessment. All administrations tried to keep a lid on U.S. activities in Southeast Asia outside of Vietnam. Of course, the information and activities would eventually become known and details made available. Again, Web sites on Air America provide lots of information, some quite fascinating. . ",/review/rw3302238/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2005,hrjstore,6," Thank God for Mel Gibson to rescue Hollywood from itself!!!
","With Gibson involved; Couldn't wait for the show to hit the screen in Houston so I could take My kids and show them a reasonable representational response to their: ""What did you do in the war, Daddy?"" - (I was an H-34 Driver, out of Udorn '66 - '68)... Despite Gibson's standard magnificent acting, the writing was a bummer compared to the REAL calibers of wit & humor that took place. It's a damn shame the writer didn't have tapes of the up-country aircraft comm traffic to draw from; you'd be waking-up in the middle of the night, laughing at the one-liners. In 28-years and 13,000+ flight-hours in 7-Nations on 5-Continents; that was the greatest bunch of maniacs I ever had the honor of working with.",/review/rw3302238/?ref_=tt_urv

","Air America is an easy, fun, not hard to watch movie. I have seen it many times and find it an easy no brain. I can watch the movie and do other stuff at the same time and still catch the jokes and the plot. I like Robert Downey Jnr always and this movie is no exception. He gels really well with Mel Gibson. I am an actor and I would have loved to be cast in this movie. Love the scene where Robert Downey Jnr is asleep, hammered from the previous nights session on the booze when Mel Gibson flying his helicopter hooks him up while still asleep on garden furniture.

29 July 2007,tenthousandtattoos,7," Solid entertainment
","Easily one of my personal favourite ""light-hearted action movies""...Air America takes place in Laos, circa 1969, and follows the exploits of a band of roughneck pilots working for the company of the film's title, flying dangerous cargo drop missions in the unfriendly skies. Billy (Robert Downey Jr) is recruited from his job as a traffic helicopter pilot to join Air America. As he wants to be ""down in the action, not up above it"" he takes the job and so meets Gene Ryack (Mel Gibson) the unofficial head of the bunch, who is as he puts it an ""adrenaline junkie"".",/review/rw3302238/?ref_=tt_urv

25 March 2005,denscul,3," Propaganda movie may confuse younger viewers.
","I picked out this DVD out of the cheepo bin at Walmart because the cover showed one of the planes I flew during Viet-Nam (C-123k). I did not fly for Air America, but knew being a C-123 pilot, I knew a lot who did, including those who flew in my Reserve Unit back home. I am not a movie critic, but wonder about the subliminal motivation of Directors and Writers who make movies like this. The best part of this movie has to go to the cameraman. The flying shots and stunts (although totally cartoon like) are excellent. The movie begins with Hollywood's favorite fall guy in 1969. But the fact is, Nixon did not start Air America, he did not begin the lies. Johnson was responsible for Air America and Nixon inherited the lies, the war, and Air America. Its not fair or accurate to portray Nixon as a liar on the subject of Air America. All President's have inherited the lies of their predecessors. Nobody smart enough to fly a C-123 was dumb enough to not know what they were joining. That makes the Downey character unbelievable. A C-123 was a rugged airplane. It could easily fly on one engine, or the two auxiliary jet engines. The three stooges shooting a duck with one shot is more likely. Pilots who flew with Air America were civilian employees of the CIA, they were not reckless soldiers of fortune. They had a good reason to behave and believe in a future, if they survived their extremely dangerous job. They were given double time towards a retirement pension. They weren't required to sell dope or guns to get a good pension. Dope was legal and a way of life in SEA, as it still is today in Afganistan. If individual pilots tried to make money on the side, it was not CIA policy. The CIA was fighting a war on communism, not drugs. The writer based his story on ""war stories"". Pilots love to BS anybody who will buy them a beer and listen. The writer and Director who had an ax to grind about Viet-Nam and Nixon. See the movie, and remember how it starts - it blames Nixon for what existed for years. Remember, he didn't become President until Jan 20, 1969.",/review/rw3302238/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2012,Robert_duder,6," Big star power and talent bogged down by a slow silly story
","I love Mel Gibson and I love Robert Downey Jr. Both have great star quality and are in fact terrific actors so I don't know how Air America stumbled but it does. Its not really a comedy, its definitely not action, and its not drama and it never finds its footing anywhere in those genres. Both Gibson and Downey's characters are rather vapid and empty and the setting for the film never feels quite right. It has its moments of being interesting but then falls apart before it ever becomes anything. Director Roger Spottiswoode has done a lot of films, some good, and some rather corny but this one just feels very rushed. I guess I expected an action comedy and as I said it doesn't fit into any of that. It doesn't know what it is and the audience will feel that because I certainly did. I suppose I had high expectations and those certainly weren't met so this one was passable for me but definitely doesn't fulfill the expectations. 6/10",/review/rw3302238/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2017,jimbo700,10," I Love This Film!
","Air America is over 25 years old and it's still on my list of movies I watch regularly. It's not that I disagree with those who acknowledge its faults, because I aknowledge them too. The things that make me want to watch this film over and over are: The music, which is fabulous... The soundtrack is filled with great tunes, some of which are a little out of the period but it doesn't matter. It's great to hear Rick Derringer and Edgar Winter cover their own hit ""Free Ride"" and Bonnie Raitt & BB King do a great cover of Dr John's ""Right Place, Wrong Time"". And Charles Gross's score is a perfect fit for this film. The second thing that makes film so great is the cinematography. The flying stunts still hold up to today's CGI effects and they were all pulled off by real pilots. But cinematographer Roger Deakins makes it all so much better with some of the most beautiful shots I've seen. The way this film was photographed reminds me of the beautiful cinematography from David Lean and Jack Hildyard in ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"". Air American was filmed mostly on location in Thailand and the lush vegetation and rolling hills and mountains are stunning. Air America is the story of a couple of pilots who fly cargo (and heroin) for Air America, the CIA's wartime civilian airline during the war in Vietnam. Mel Gibson plays a seasoned veteran pilot and Robert Downy Jr. is the young, idealistic newcomer who stirs it all up. When it was released it drew harsh reviews from the big publications, mostly because (according to the reviews) it tried to poke fun at, and perhaps dishonor the real life pilots of Air America. Putting politics aside I never thought this film dishonored the Air America pilots. The film's main weakness is the thin plot (based on real events). The acting is great. Downey and Gibson have great chemistry, and the supporting actors/actresses are also spot on. It cost over $35 million to make this film and every penny is seen on the screen. Unfortunately it never caught on at the box office and only grossed $32 million (worldwide). The acting, stunt flying, music and cinematography make it worth multiple viewings, even if you don't understand the plot or find it hard to relate to the characters. If you can watch it in this context, you might love it too.",/review/rw3302238/?ref_=tt_urv
