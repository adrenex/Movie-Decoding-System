3 March 2020,robfollower,8," Dispatches From Elsewhere Review
","Now that I have had the opportunity to see the first few episodes, I must say I am properly hooked. The feel of the show is something novel. Dispatches From Elsewhere is also extremely confusing and wildly unpredictable. The main plot often feels impossible to pin down. It's difficult to even describe the series to someone who hasn't watched it in a way that even remotely encompasses what it's about. But the ultimate effect of all this? A sort of narrative alchemy that leaves me wanting more, even as I admit that I'm not entirely sure what it is that I've been watching.",/review/rw5521733/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2020,ed-503-465183,8," After watching the first episode, I'm intrigued. I'd like to see where this is going.
","So as of yet, I don't know what to think of this one. As to what star rating I'd give this, my place holder is a 7. I hope it turns into something interesting and different, but I don't know right now. Watching this, for me, is like making a wrong turn down a road I've never been and seeing some interesting things that are a bit off and make absolutely no sense.",/review/rw5521733/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2020,mr-video-1,8," Not average television
","If you look at the breakdown of voting for this show, you will see sharp divisions between people who thought it was wonderful versus terrible. Lots of folks gave it a perfect ""10"" and lots gave it the worst possible ""1"". That's exactly the kind of show or movie I seek out. It shows the filmmaker is taking huge chances to make something truly unexpected and different. I love to see filmmakers NOT playing it safe.",/review/rw5521733/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2020,Mfbarry-90-773507,7," Really different, fascinating show
","Jason Segal is one of the most fascinating ""creatives"" in the entertainment industry. He is constantly re-inventing himself and his career, from ""Freeks & Geeks"" to ""How I met your mother,"" from ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" to re-inventing The Muppets.
This is his latest, a limited series based on a mysterious ARG that popped up in San Francisco a few years back (and then, just as mysteriously disappeared.)
It's anything but safe. It's funny, clever, disturbing and very addictive. It's anything but boring, concerning 4 people who find themselves caught up in a strange company by the name of The Jejune Institute. A company which may or may not be real and may or may not contain the answers we all seek.
Starting created, directed and written by Segal.
Co-starring Sally Field, Richard E. Grant and Andre Benjamin (3000).
Really interesting, highly recommended.",/review/rw5521733/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2020,chairhead_82,6," Was so good at first, what happened??
","The first 7 episodes of this show were great!
It was nice seeing Sally Field in a show again, and I didn't realize how much I'd missed Andre 3000.
The diversity of the cast was nice, the plot seemed a little out there but in a fun and interesting way.
Unfortunately by episode 8 things start to slide, episode 9 does a poor job of wrapping anything up, and episode 10 is self indulgent, pretentious nonsense best left unwatched.
Seriously, if you haven't seen it yet, don't bother, it adds nothing to the show and is not the feel-good, uplifting ending they seemed to think it was going to be.
Disappointed.",/review/rw5521733/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2020,arittenberry,10," Brilliant
","This show is captivating, brilliant, groundbreaking, beautiful, and speaks to my soul. If you've ever struggled with who you are, who other people are and how you fit into this world together, if you are touched by art and beauty, and if you like spooky and surprises, you cannot miss this mind altering masterpiece. Mahalo Jason Segel and crew for being brave and bringing this to the world.",/review/rw5521733/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2020,julieprice,6," Just like the experience in San Francisco!
","Everything about this felt like it felt to ""play the game"" in San Francisco"". We went to the ""jejune Institute"" ~10 years ago for ""Nonchalance"" and played 2 rounds of the game and never quite figured out what was going on, but it was amazing and fun and quirky, just like the show. Very well thought out and imaginative. I'm hoping the show continues and we can finally reach an understanding of what on Earth we were doing and where it was leading...",/review/rw5521733/?ref_=tt_urv

25 September 2020,christophscott,8," The Story Doesn't End
","It's what they lead the show with. But most of the audience is so used to having a story end satisfactory they don't know how to react to this. Maybe I wanted the story to end like that from an aesthetic point of view, because it just was so extraordinary. But conceptually, the outstretched aftermath episode and totally detached Segal-special, delivered the show's message. It made me conscious about storytelling, idealization and human desires. Was it worth diminishing the original story to do so? I don't know.",/review/rw5521733/?ref_=tt_urv

27 February 2020,cgoncalves-05898,10," Don't believe the ratings, this is the best tvshow I've seen besides dark lately
","It has a twin peaks vibe, It's the most original show as of late. It's different.
I don't understand the ratings really, characters are relatable, it's a very human show, it has a melancholic quality to it. I definitly want to see where it goes.
I believe once it finishes, it will be a gem like few others.",/review/rw5521733/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2020,marc-cheyne,6," Excellent series - bar episode 10
","This is a wonderfully engrossing series - with a contagious theme of creativity, spontaneity and inspiration. The overall quality of writing, sets and acting is top notch. The cast of actors are perfectly suited to portray their charactors, with Eve Lindley standing out ahead of everyone else in her breakout role.",/review/rw5521733/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2020,feelreallove-921-845971,3," It began well ...then IT DIED
",I enjoyed the first few episodes. It began like a derivative 'Dirk Gently...' (but not as clever) with a smattering of insight like 'The OA' (but not as soulful). Then around episode 4 onwards morphed into this Disney High School Musical (minus the music) thing. Couldn't stand it anymore.,/review/rw5521733/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2020,FinnHudsonFromElsewhere,9," A promising start to a new AMC series.
","Dispatches From Elsewhere, based on the first episode, seems like a great and intriguing new series for AMC. It may be a bit slow, but its interesting premise, great acting, great characters, and wonderful direction that will keep the audience engaged, hopefully, for a long time. Hopefully this will fill the hole that Lodge 49 left behind.",/review/rw5521733/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2020,rrtiverton,4," Confused and disappointed
","The series started off great, but WOW, did it go off the rails. Made it to episode 11 and I am both lost and disappointed. Now Peter is Jason? Is Janice now named Sally?",/review/rw5521733/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2021,nancyldraper,7," Difficult to review
","I need to confess that I've put off writing a review of this limited series because I'm really conflicted about how it is crafted. It begins with a decidedly sinister narrator (or is that just the real life vibe of Richard E Grant?) telling us that they are going to break all the rules of storytelling in a limited series. The first character is written and performed to be emotionally flat and yet we are told to identify with him. Once I got to the relationships, I began to enjoy it (Eve Lindsey's and Sally Field's characters and performances are fantastic) but the last episode turns everything on it's head when it breaks the fourth wall (again) and turns into the creator's existential catharsis, which really unravelled the whole experience for me. (FYI, the series was inspired by a 2013 documentary called THE INSTITUTE about a group of people who fashioned this alternate reality game in San Francisco.which was also a trippy experience) I give the six episodes in the middle of this series an 8 (great) out of 10, but the others a variety of 5 (meh), 6 (fair) and 4 (poor). {Fantasy Drama Mystery} >See why this was a difficult review to write<",/review/rw5521733/?ref_=tt_urv

3 March 2020,kcitraro,10," It's an amazing trip with serenity and determination
",I watched the first 2 episodes so far. I did not know ahead of time what the show was about. I learned as I went. I found my own hidden treasures in this show. A web site is on the building. Go to that site and it opens a huge world of belonging and adventure. At some points through this show I feel serenity and belonging. Characters are very relatable. I'm going to sit back and enjoy the show . Feel the show and let me myself find the narrative. I am Kathleen. And I am you!,/review/rw5521733/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2020,acharrell,8," Weird & Intriguing!
","Based in the first episode it's an 8. I'll have to see if that holds up. Impressions so far are that it looks cool, is well written and acted. It's weird and has a bit of a Michel Gondry early 2000's vibe. I am a big fan of strange TV. Most of my favorites get cancelled after a couple seasons because they're too weird for the general public. Check out the low rated reviews for this one and see what I mean. The people complaining about this show are either too unimaginative to understand a show like this, or they are just overtly racist and bigoted. Again, read the negative reviews to see what I mean. If you have an open mind and like a good weird mystery you should give this a shot.",/review/rw5521733/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2020,paul-2148,1," Dull and depressing. Zzzzzzz.
","A little ways into the pilot my head was hurting trying to figure out if this was meant to be a comedy, a parody, or a drama about depressed people. In the opening credits it says that the series was based on a documentary called The Institute, about a scavenger hunt game created inSan Francisco over 10 years ago. I began to watch that and had similar feelings about the film. In the film they refer to the ""Institute"" as an ARG (Alternate Reality Game) but to me it just seemed like a prank created by bored art students - several steps up from prank phone calls. To base a television series on a film about a prank that happened 10 years ago seems desperate to me, and Jason Segel seems to be straining very hard to make something substantial out of nothing. Perhaps if he had taken more liberties with the material and tried to make something mysterious like Twin Peaks was, or funny like Lodge 49 sometimes can be he would have gotten somewhere, but unfortunately he traces the documentary pretty closely and that's a mistake. In the film the creators of the game try to retroactively portray it as a creative social experiment, and the inductees of the game as they are called, seem to give it more meaning than it really deserves. Much like the characters in the series, it just seems like a lot of boring people that can't find meaning in their lives have gotten together to distract themselves from the dullness of their real lives, and that's not good TV.",/review/rw5521733/?ref_=tt_urv

2 March 2020,JinFL,6," I turned it on for Sally Field & will see where it leads
","I enjoy Sally Field and it has been awhile since I've seen her in a series, so I tuned in. It's different than anything I've seen recently, and at first I wasn't sure I'd like it. But, I kept watching and as more characters joined Peter, it became more intriguing. The four in this ""family"" are a diverse, quirky mix, but I think that will keep my interest. Yes, there is some social commentary with the characters, but isn't that life? I find people different from me intriguing and so I'll continue with this and see where it leads. Reviewers who lament they wasted their time seemed to be closed to new experiences. What would your response be if you were Peter?",/review/rw5521733/?ref_=tt_urv
