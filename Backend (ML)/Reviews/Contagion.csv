","A true best of both worlds for classic Disney and classic Pixar fans. It had already been many years since the acquisition, but for me this was the first time Disney's buyout felt like a positive direction for the animation pioneers. Filled with possibly Pixar's most attractive environments, character designs (Side note: Merida has my favorite character design of any animated human character. I mean seriously her hair alone is a thing of beauty.), and easily its best score, the studio does a deft send up of classic princess movies while instilling the pure feeling of magic they are known for though Scotland's rich Celtic lore and cryptic mysticism. Brave is a criminally underrated installment in the Pixar cannon that I hope grows in stature over the years. If Wreck It Ralph is Disney doing Pixar, Brave is Pixar doing Disney.",/review/rw2631195/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2012,planktonrules,7," The CGI was incredible!
","While I must admit that ""Brave"" is not among my favorite Pixar films, I was totally blown away by the computer graphics. To some extent this is to be expected--as years pass, the CGI is bound to get better and better. But it's more than that--the textures, colors and depth were all incredible and I was in love with the animation throughout.",/review/rw2631195/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2020,auuwws,7," Brave
","Nice movie, not the best Pixar movie, but I really enjoyed watching it. Merida was a good character. Her relationship with her mother was excellent. The message of the film was excellent.",/review/rw2631195/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2015,Mr-Fusion,5," Sadly homogenized
","I dunno what to make of ""Brave"". It says PIXAR before the title, but this is very much a Disney movie, from the gags and rhythms right down to the cutesy tone. I think that's the biggest thing; it's just kinda generic. Which is disappointing because it's set in the underused Scotland (and features some really picturesque locales). But mostly, it's the weak story, and it feels surprisingly long for 90 minutes. There was some great buildup with Merida's archery, but no payoff for such an independent female warrior.",/review/rw2631195/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2015,ironhorse_iv,6," Time to brave here and give you my true opinion of the movie. I'll bear it all. Brave was pretty disappointing.
","The animation is beautiful, but it looks like they stole or mirror CGI designs from DreamWorks's 2010's How to Train a Dragon film. It get worst, as the story is mess. Directed by three people, Brenda Chapman, Steve Purcell & Mark Andrews, and set in medieval Scotland. The movie tells the story of Princess Merida (Voiced by Kelly McDonald) whom just come of age. Her over-bearing mother, Queen Elinor (Voiced by Emma Thompson) is so intended is to keep her people alive, that she is willing to marry off, her daughter to the firstborn sons of the clan leaders, in hope for peace. Merida thinks, otherwise, ignored her duties, in hope, of making her own path in life. Soon enough, both women are, in the crosshairs, with each other. Both must learn to sacrifice, some their values, and ideals in hope to grow, a stronger, and meaningful relationship. Can they work out, their issues with each other or will their kingdom suffer, because of it? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I give credit where credit due, the writers did try to add something new to the Disney princess motifs, with the whole mother & daughter, mend the bond relationship. The problem with it, is the fact, that it's very underdeveloped. Not once, throughout the film, was I convince, that they truly understood each other's problems. The movie rarely gives them, any time to talk it out, and listen to each other, due to all the weak conflicts. I think Queen Elinor turning into a bear, kinda hurts the plot, since she's unable to show, her side of the story. It's very odd for Disney to do this. The usual talking animal trope that often comes with humans-turned-animals is sadly not here. Another problem with the plot is that it felt very recycle. The whole 'magic bear transformation lesson', storyline seem like a rip off, another Disney movie, 2003's Brother Bear. That movie did such a better job, in showing the dangers of selfishness, while understand responsibility when it comes to family and growing up within a community. While, yeah, they're two different movies; I felt like Brave fell flat where Brother Bear didn't. Personally, I think they should have removed these magic bear sub plot lines completely; and focus more, on the conflict of war & marriage. These magic odd legends that doesn't mesh well, with the rest of the film. First off, the curse of Mor'du and Merida situation only vaguely relate to each other, when it comes to theme of selfish in this movie. The curse, overall, deals more about total greed. While Merida is about breaking tradition for individual rights. Vastly different. Near the end, Merida and Eleanor fight this supposed selfishness curse altogether, to show that they're willing to change. Symbolism or not, though, it's still very sloppy writing. Another problem is the Will-o'-the-wisps. They're portray as good spirits, that help the protagonist lead her to her fate. This is far away from the truth folklore, in which they are evil beings that lure victims to their deaths. I don't understand, why Merida would trust these creatures; not once, but three times. They always lead her, to more misfortune. What is the movie, trying to say? That you have to be brave, but willing to let fate, lead you to own demise? I somewhat get the brave part, but who says, that you have to clueless and lead yourself to danger! Maybe, the movie should be, call 'stupid'. Anyways, Merida's problem was never, about how brave, she was. It's all about the issues, when it comes to her freedom of choice. The film is so heavily invest in that theme. So when, it tries hard to introduce, fate into the mix in the opening. Merida's message comes off, as confusing. Fate says that you have no choose, that decisions are meaningless and choices are an illusion. If Merida was so into her fate, why did she bother trying to change it, with the Highland Games and with the witch!? It doesn't seem brave, when you think about it. In many ways, this show how pointless, this movie with its choices. In the end, Merida doesn't really change, anything. While, the film is certainly set in a feministic world, where the women secretly control the state, while the men ruled in public. The agnatic seniority society still lives and she still has to marry somebody. All, she did was postpone her, trouble fate. That isn't brave at all! The whole easy conflict wasn't resolve, when it could had. It comes across as weak. I think the title, The Bear and the Bow is a much more apt title, because of that. When I think of ""Brave"". I'm thinking it was chosen to be subtly reminiscent of Mel Gibson's Scottish Oscar-winning blockbuster smash. No wonder, why the trailers for this film was so confused. Some of the trailers try to play up the ""epic adventure"" while others emphasized Shrek-like slapstick, subversive humor. In reality, both weren't even close. The movie is shallow with its humor and the movie wasn't that epic. The movie is offensive, both to women and men. The voice acting is a mixed bag. Some accents are laughable and rough to hear. The historic anachronism are strong, epic music doesn't felt Scottish, and story fails to deliver a satisfying pay off, when the movie ends. The only highlight is the movie has a lot of Easter eggs cameos from other Pixar's films; that some viewers have started a Pixar film theory, where all the films were connection. Overall: It's a shame this film is such a mess. Best Animated movie of 2012!? I doubt, it, Academy. It's a wasted opportunity of something that could had been great. I absolutely have zero desire to ever visit again.",/review/rw2631195/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2012,cadillac20,8," Another Great Pixar Film
","Brave is a film I've been looking forward to since I first laid eyes on it's beautiful trailer. It had everything a great Pixar film has: a wonderful setting, fantastic CGI, beautiful and interesting characters, and a lot of heart. In fact, Merida alone was such an interesting and adorable character, that it was instantly on my to watch list. Granted, this isn't Pixar's best, but that's holding it up to extremely high standards. As an animated film, however, this is a fantastic and fascinating film, a treat for the summer.",/review/rw2631195/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2012,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,1," Unbearably Misleading
","This is the epitome of burying the lead But the trailer seemed a bit strange to begin with. Instead of the usual montage summing up the entire movie, or at least half of it, we get one scene: an assertive tomboy princess with neat looking fiery red hair shoots an arrow to choose her own fate instead of a bunch of losers vying to marry her: the one that hits the bulls eye wins her hand in marriage. (Let's make it clear, all three young men are pathetic wrecks: if one resembled an Elfin Johnny Depp with half a brain, perhaps there'd be no story at all.) After our frustrated heroine, Princess Merida, hits all the marks by herself, the real tale begins – and not only is it strange, awkward and confusing, but even the target-audience children might shake their heads in disbelief.",/review/rw2631195/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2012,Loving_Silence,8," A Visual Feast and a Solid Pixar Film
","Brave is a beautiful and moving new fairy tale that fits seamlessly into the genre; Princess Merida is a wonderfully multi-facted heroine; the film shapes itself around problems that are familiar and understandable and will be well-understood and appreciated by kiddos and parents alike; the supporting characters that are given the most attention are well-crafted (but too bad for those others that fall by the wayside). The visual effects are flawless, in my opinion, the best if all Pixar films.",/review/rw2631195/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2012,BigWhiskers,3," Chick flick/Small kid movie that disappoints.
","This movie is definitely for women in general. A young girl coming of age is told she must have a suitor and get married. She's a tomboy and wants to do her own thing and her mother and father want the opposite - that's about it . The rest of the movie is filled with low brow humor , typical slapstick violence and the usual moral of the story ending. After seeing the trailer and the movie poster ,one would think Brave would be about this young girl fighting and winning battles with her bow and arrow and a rousing adventure. Instead it's a dull boring coming of age story with not much to give except for the kids who like to watch cartoon bears and other creatures frolic around the woods and moms raising their bratty teenage daughters. 3/10 .",/review/rw2631195/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2012,Joe_Chadowski,7," Pixar's latest effort enchants us with stunning visuals, and charismatic characters, but misses the X factor that makes Pixar film's great
","This should have been an easy review to write. Brave should have been a film that cemented itself as one of the all time greats, a necessary addition to any Top Films list. It should have been a film that claimed a place in our hearts as so many other Pixar films have in the past. But it's not. And writing this review is proving anything but easy. It's hard because I'm sitting at my Dell Latitude feeling bewildered at how a film from the best animation studio in the world left me feeling lukewarm at best.",/review/rw2631195/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2012,AustinOswald,8," Amazing movie. Completely underestimated.
","After last years Cars 2, many began to underestimate Pixar and believed that it would begin to fall out of the radar. Well this movie will definitely prove them wrong. This movie was a visually stunning masterpiece with a great story. Even before the movie started it was exciting because of the unique and creative short La Luna along with the Monsters University teaser trailer. If you are reading this and haven't seen the movie yet make sure you STAY TILL THE END OF THE CREDITS for just a little scene about something that happened earlier in the movie. Thanks to everyone at Pixar studios for creating a true masterpiece!",/review/rw2631195/?ref_=tt_urv

","I love The Incredibles, Up, Shrek, Toy Story, Monsters Inc., Despicable Me and Megeaman. I thought I was going to see something that amazing, but with a female protagonist. But no. It was the same old Disney princess movie: a princess having problems about who she is or is not going to marry. We saw that in Snow White, Seeping Beauty, Cinderella, The Little Mermaid.

16 August 2012,TheLittleSongbird,8," Not among Pixar's finest, but solid family fun regardless
","I have always loved Pixar's films, they are charming, funny, full of heart and have identifiable characters, strong stories and gorgeous animation on the whole. I was strongly anticipating Brave as I would do for any animated movie, and while I still enjoyed it very much I was a little disappointed as well. Ranking it with Pixar's other films, I don't consider Brave as good as the Toy Story films, Up, Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo and WALL-E, but I consider it better than the Cars films(which I did like actually) and put it on the same level as Bug's Life(Pixar's most underrated), Ratatouille and The Incredibles.",/review/rw2631195/?ref_=tt_urv

There was a liberal dose of children in the audience who, from the sounds of happiness during the showing, was proof that it should be a solid hit.

","When thinking of the best animated movies, one's mind always flashes immediately to the Pixar filmography. Since 1995 with the first Toy Story, they've been charming audiences with wonderful movies like Finding Nemo, Up, and WALL·E (the latter being one of my all time favorite movies).

","Pixar execs used to say that the story was indispensable in their filmmaking. They were right. It is too bad they didn't follow their own advice in making Brave. As a formulaic Disney movie, it would be average (though with above average visuals). But our family (kids' ages from 10 to 18) doesn't bother seeing formulaic Disney movies anymore. We saw it yesterday, and everyone was disappointed. ""Cliche,"" one of our children said. ""Easily the worst Pixar movie I've ever seen,"" said another (though none of us has seen Cars 2).
