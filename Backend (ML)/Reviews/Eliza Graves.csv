28 January 2004,mwendel,6," Blue Crush meets Road Trip with Skateboards
","Take Blue Crush and Road Trip to the asphalt with boys instead of girls. The movie is an entertaining over-the-top story about four friends who decide to make the summer more interesting by trying to live the dream of becoming pro skateboarders.  Their path to potential stardom is one full of roadblocks of all shapes and kinds.  Don't look for any award winning performances here, but do look for some good laughs and some good and great skateboarding sequences.",/review/rw1004280/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2005,Stoli_Raz_N_7,7," Nothing Spectacular, Except for the Skating
","This film is just plain fun. The story isn't anything spectacular, but the skating is sick, the babes are all top shelf, and the main characters are just four guys having fun. Their adventures are enjoyable, and the show is slathered with multiple layers of humor and style. Of course this isn't going to be on any critics' top ten lists, nor will it win any awards anywhere, but the extraordinary films that wind up in those categories often have little to no replay value - once you've seen them, they're pretty much done. ""Grind"" is a film that's so enjoyable, it's easy to watch it over and over and over again. I've already seen it eight times.",/review/rw1004280/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2004,furiousneon,10," Some pretty funny stuff.
","I picked this movie up for like 4.99 on DVD at a rental place nearby..and i have to say it was worth it.  Although im not a big fan of skateboarding or the X-Games as a whole..i enjoyed this movie.  It was pretty funny.  It goes by at a steady pace and the characters all have a pretty good chemistry with eachother, especially considering that the lead roles are all newcomers. There are a few notable cameo's(Bam Margera, Tom Green).  The story itself isnt anything great.  It's not original or anything, but it still seems pretty fresh.  Its funny through out and considering that im not a skateboarding fan and i enjoyed it, Id recommend this to anyone.  Its some pretty funny stuff.",/review/rw1004280/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2021,burnzyburns,7," Stuck in 2003
","Grind is more of a skateboard montage then a movie and it is jammed deep into the year 2003. It's probably the most early 2000's teen movie you could ever watch, it's packed with punk rock music for nearly every scene as if someone from Warped Tour directed this movie.",/review/rw1004280/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2005,ysman-1,9," Grind - brainless fun
","I saw this movie on satellite with no preconceived notions. No it's not War & Peace but it was plain goofy fun like a cross between a ""Road"" picture & ""Animal House"". People who criticize this movie for not taking skateboarding seriously have totally missed the point. This movie could've been about ping pong & I still would have enjoyed it for what it was. Brainless fun. So if anyone is looking forward to basically shutting their brain down, but still getting a couple of cheap laughs I recommend this movie. It is NOT for young children. Some of the humor is ""raunchy"" but nothing anyone over the age of twelve hasn't heard in the school yard. It has a fairly basic moral (never give up) and not all the women in it are eye candy. Perfect for the demographic it was aiming for.",/review/rw1004280/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2005,sgreenwald-1,7," I think it's great
","I agree with another comment that the critics shouldn't have torn this movie apart like some others! It wasn't all that bad. There were those random parts that you don't think should be in there, but it is a funny movie that you can never get sick of! ",/review/rw1004280/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2003,DigitalPhreaker,6," Not Great, But Not THAT Bad
","Wow, I was surprised to hear people rip this movie apart like they did Gigli (although it's understandable for Gigli). This movie wasn't all that bad. I thought the cast was pretty good, and I loved Sweet Lou, but he was the Dazed and Confused rip off that someone else said. Granted, I will never buy this movie when it comes out on DVD, but it was worth the few extra bucks for the laugh. If you guys want a good laugh, without a lot of thinking (or plot) then see Grind. 7/10",/review/rw1004280/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2004,jjgoard,1," Skaters apparently have nothing to look forward to...
","Uh, people who gave this a ten: I get that you're into a hobby that only marginally interests most other people. So am I. (Don't ask.) But do you really think that a much better skating story couldn't easily be made? I would think, at least, it would really upset you that there was no attempt at all to blend the stunt double shots with the actor shots. Couldn't those actors even learn to do some basic tricks?",/review/rw1004280/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2005,vertigo_14,3," Decent skate movie bogged down by clichés. (spoilers)
","'Grind' turned out to be a better skate comedy than I had expected, but it had the potential to be so much better had the filmmakers not been so intent on serving up heavy doses of clichés and comedy homages )such as Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Thrashin', Dazed and Confused, The Search for Animal Chin, and more).",/review/rw1004280/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2004,Manon_1,1," Beware!!
","Probably the worst movie I've seen in a long time. The worst part and by far is Vince Vieluf, this guy is not funny, this guy is very annoying and after a while, the scenes where he was the center stage were put on fast forward! If this guy can make it in the movies, well so do I!",/review/rw1004280/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2005,DaniiBabii728,10," great movie
","I've seen this movie many times and ill watch it again. I absolutely love it! The first time i watched this movie was at my friends house and hes a skater so i thought i would be bored to tears with another skateboarding movie, but i was totally wrong its funny and interesting! You might think you wont like it if you don't like skateboarding but i don't like to skate and i still loved this movie. The characters are wonderful skaters and great actors and the plot is hilarious! Even thought i don't know anything about skateboarding i still understood the movie and there were even so people in it that i knew like bam margera and Ryan sheckler. You will fall in love with this movie - not asleep!",/review/rw1004280/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2004,virogenix,," It was at least entertaining....
","OK so maybe this was not an Oscar performance by well, anyone. But really, let's face it, there are worse movies. And, yeah, it entertained me while it lated. So while I can't say that this will be on my top ten favorites by any standards, I guess it wasn't so bad. The cameos of Bam and Tom Green were decent. And any movie with clowns and midgets can't be totally terrible, right? The music didn't totally suck. There was ""Gross Humor"", which I personally like. The ending was a bit campy. To be honest, it would take a real moron not to follow it totally it was so transparent. On the whole, I say watch it. It is a good there is nothing better on flick. It won't totally bore you because it is fully devoid of anything worth learning.",/review/rw1004280/?ref_=tt_urv

8 July 2005,milosz_m,1," really bad
","This film is really bad. And there's no difference if one is in or not into skateboarding. I'm a not a die hard skate fan but I enjoy the sport. And skateboarding in this movie is shown well. That's for sure. But this is a fiction movie not CKY. And everything besides skating is bad: the screenplay, dialogue, acting and directing. The film isn't funny at all. Although it tries hard all actors are just stinky bad so it doesn't stand a chance. Vince Vieluf is rather weak actor but the film is so bad that he is somehow the funniest of the cast. The rest isn't worth your time. You have few quest star appearances (like Bam Margera who, by the way is also hopeless at acting) but it won't save it. It tries hard to be funny and cool but it's boring (it took me two days to finish it). I sincerely do not recommend it.",/review/rw1004280/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2005,kgwest,4," Not for grown ups
","Our to pre-teens and a bunch of their mates all of which have skateboards, freestyle bikes etc.. thought this was great. They laughed at all the jokes, ood & ard over the tricks and looked suitably concerned whenever things seemed grim. My husband & myself however knew everything that was about to happen well before it did and grew more and more irritated by the over the top stereotypical characters. Not even the skateboarding managed to save it for us having seen a bit more of it than the kids we were not quite so easily impressed. On the upside they were totally entertained on a rainy afternoon loving so much they even watched the making.",/review/rw1004280/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2006,djheroinchic,3," Skateboarding for the MTV generation
","Prior to watching it, I was never expecting a great film, I knew it would be more along the lines of a teen comedy. However, I was expecting it to at least be a fun ride. Unfortunately, what would have been an average movie at best, turns out to be sub par. The key for a movie like grind to succeed is to not take itself seriously and provide laughs. Most of the jokes in the film provide a grin at best and maybe a few provide one or two out loud laughs during the entire film.",/review/rw1004280/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2003,hepcat70,1," worst teen movie in memory
","This movie is the nadir, horrifically bad. There's nothing to like about the 4 leads - the geeky guy is tolerable, the main ""cool"" guy gives you nothing to hang your hat on to root for, one guy is a total rip of Matthew McM's character in Dazed and Confused, and the gross-out guy is utterly lacking in comedic timing and is as far from funny as one gets. The casting director should never work again.",/review/rw1004280/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2011,Roddenhyzer,3," A waste
","It was strangely difficult for me to write this much about ""Grind"", because everything that could possibly be said about the movie could much easier be condensed to a simple ""Road Trip Ripoff"". Similar characters, similar premise and similar conflicts, only this time, it's served with a surprisingly arbitrary side dish of skateboarding. I think this is actually one of my bigger complaints about this whole thing: It's not really a skateboarding movie. The skating scenes are periodically shoehorned in there, as if the director tried his hardest to get them over with as quickly and unimpressively as possible. Even the showdown, which is literally just one, long half pipe performance, is filmed in such a ham-handed, not to say *bored* manner that it could be trumped even by the skate scenes in ""Most Vertical Primate"". I'm hardly exaggerating. ",/review/rw1004280/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2006,jpschapira,6," Wasn't expecting all of it
","Movies like ""Grind"" can achieve a lot of great things without necessarily being great. I'm not going to give out or write other movies' names to explain what I said, but it's true and I'll try to cover it. After witnessing this film's horribly edited trailer, I knew something terrible was coming my way; but I also knew I had to see the thing.",/review/rw1004280/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2006,red_head_rocker56,1," Worst Movie EVER!!!
","This was the worst movie that I have ever seen in my whole life. I love skateboarding movies, but this just ranks in one of the worst that I have ever seen. It would be better if there were actual actors. It is all about these punks who want to go on a tour or something (sorry if I got the storyline wrong, Its not like I actually payed attention). And the director squeezed some romance and some ""funny"" parts. If funny is acting like a total jackass and being so dumb that its not funny anymore, than this movie is for you.",/review/rw1004280/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2006,amercanpyscho138,1," Worst thing to happen to skateboarding since Bam Margera.
","Well, once again, the great art of skateboarding has been beaten with a brick by trendy teen movie creators. I mean, if you're really that amped to focus a movie plot around skateboarding, it least do some research to find out what's actually possible on a skateboard and what's not. You've got angles revealing the fact the stunt doubles can't even do half the ""Mcvarial 900s"" in the film. As a skateboarder and filmer of skateboarding, this movie is complete mainstream trash. If you want to see the true cinematic greatness of skateboarding, go out to your local skate shop and buy one of Jon Holland's many Transworld Skateboarding films. Roll forever.",/review/rw1004280/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2005,Mr_Sensitive,5," It Is A Hugh Disappointment
","Probably the most boring teen / skateboarding movie I have ever seen (and tell the truth: I like teen movie no matter what , but this is too bad). If you asked me if it that bad, I would say ""no"" but it was a huge disappointment, especially with such a good teen casts.",/review/rw1004280/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2004,gothats,3," Yech!
","I usually say that the less you know about a movie, the better it is. In this case, I wish I had looked online before watching it, so that I could've avoided it. Absolutely terrible! Someone else wrote ""gross lame humor is what sells but this movie had none of that and that's why I loved it it's not lame and disgusting and the same old jokes over and over again"". This is completely wrong! That's all that this movie offers: stupid, lame jokes.",/review/rw1004280/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2006,scotty4,10," The best movie.
",This movie talks about 3 guys who love to skate and don't know what they want to do in life.The main character decides to go on a skate tour and looks for pros to give his (skate) video.I think this one of the best comedy-skateboard movie I ever seen! Why? Cause the guys in the movie are funny and if you love skateboarding you'll probably love this one. You can see a lot of different skate-pros in the movie. My favorite part is when they start dancing in front of BAM and thats funny! And it shows that you don't have to go to school to end up pretty well so take a peek at the movie and then you'll tell me about! Also if you want to start skateboarding you could probably learn from them!I like how the actors play the scenes and especially Adam Brody because he one of the greatest actors of the new generation.He also plays in The O.C and he is freakin good skater.,/review/rw1004280/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2005,chelzm,10," Great
",I think that Grind was a great movie! A lot of people don't like it but you usually have to be into the content of a movie to enjoy it. I am really into skateboarding. It is awesome! It's my favourite thing to do so I guess that's why I like the movie so much! When I first heard of it I thought that it was going to be a crappy movie. But when I actually saw it...I loved it! Mike Vogle is so hot too! So that might have made me more interested in it. But the movie is still great! I love it! The actors are great and the storyline is good as well! I also like how it has real skaters in it like Bam and Tony Hawk! I really look up to Bam! He is an awesome skater! I love him! He's like...my idol!,/review/rw1004280/?ref_=tt_urv
