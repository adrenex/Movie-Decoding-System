14 July 2016,gradyharp,9," 'All those years, living the life of someone I didn't even know.'
",Writer/director Terrence Malick is Terrence Malick and either you relate to his films or avoid them. They are art pieces: not all art appeals to everyone. His films are an expression of a philosophy that the mind constructs all the input the eyes see and the body feels and while it may not make a story that is easy to follow (is there really anything to follow in any of his films?) it provides a unique experience that requires the viewer to relinquish expectations of storytelling and simply sail through the visual magnificence of the images Malick places on the screen and populates with enough characters to offer a hand during the journey he has shared.,/review/rw3398851/?ref_=tt_urv

21 February 2016,kdavies-69347,," A Difficult Movie to Follow
","Knight of Cups was a very different subject than I was expecting from director Terrence Malick. Few directors delve into the raw emotional content that carries us through our daily narrative. Most of his films approach the viewer from the very abstract to the rather mundane. I was quite impressed with most of his previous work, but I failed to grasp what was going on here.",/review/rw3398851/?ref_=tt_urv

","Recently Peter Greenaway confessed he almost never saw a movie because there was no development to the form, still being a staged play, with actors doing their lines before the camera: just painting by numbers. Malick is one of the few that do not fit that description of the current state of the art, the others being directors like Tarkovsky, Kar-Wai and to a lesser extent Kubrick.",/review/rw3398851/?ref_=tt_urv

","Let me start by saying that I regard Terrence Malick as the sole currently working director who can be spoken of with the same reverence as that for the great early masters of cinema â€“ Welles, Chaplin, Hitchcock, Renoir (make your own list). Since 'The Tree of Life' - even since 'The New World', I have thought of him as the saviour of modern cinema from the slurry of bland naturalism.",/review/rw3398851/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2016,Lubezki,8," A surreal look into a man's crumbling world
","Let's get one thing straight; Terrence Malick's films aren't exactly everyone's cup of tea. They're arguably the most unconventionally crafted movies from a well renowned director out there. Audiences normally criticize him for being highly pretentious and having no meaning in his work. But for some, his films represent everything we love about the artistic medium of motion pictures. With his latest offering, ""Knight of Cups"", Christian Bale stars as a screenwriter eager to explore his seedy persona in the dreamlike whereabouts of LA.",/review/rw3398851/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2018,arwn,8," Existential and introspective poem
","I don't know what is there not to get. Why people are so confused about this film. It's very simple.
It's said right in the beginning ""Remember the story I used to tell you when you were a boy? About a young prince, a knight, sent by his father, the King of the East, west into Egypt, to find a pearl. A pearl from the depths of the sea. But when the prince arrived, the people poured him a cup that took away his memory. He forgot that he was the son of the king. Forgot about the pearl. And fell into a deep sleep.The king didn't forget his son. He continued to send word, messengers, guides. But the prince slept on.""
And this is basically what this film is about. Trying to wake up, trying to find yourself. Seeing your lived life flashing by before drowning, and feeling the loss and regret of wasted life and opportunity. Now seeing the messages and messengers that were sent to you, but you were blind. You were asleep and refused to wake up. You wanted to dream. You could have been anything, but you didn't choose anything. You were lost and you didn't even know you were lost.",/review/rw3398851/?ref_=tt_urv

","How can one rate a ""movie"" like this one? How can you sum up, what is happening? Maybe you can't, maybe some will be able to see through it, maybe some won't. Even ""Tree of Life"" seems like a ""Straight Story"" compared to this. And yet still it is intriguing and very well thought of. It is about life, love and how we spend our time on this planet. How and with whom we surround ourselves with.",/review/rw3398851/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2015,Horst_In_Translation,4," Another flawed Malick movie
","""Knight of Cups"" is the newest film by American filmmaker Terrence Malick, who is way into his 70s by now. First of all, the cast of this 120-minute movie looks excellent: Bale, Portman, Blanchett, Poots, Mueller-Stahl, Kingsley, Banderas, Pinto... you cannot ask for much more than that. However, everybody who knows Malick's other (more recent) works will know that his films are so defined in his unique style that there is rarely room for great acting. And the same is the case here. I thought this was a pretty boring watch, possibly worse than ""Tree of Life"" and certainly worse than ""To the Wonder"".",/review/rw3398851/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2016,benmichael-6333,7," A trip
","As we grow more and more tired of dull as dishwater, predictable, structure obsessed nonsense, we come to love films that want to use the medium to take us on a trip. I see nothing wrong with enjoying beautiful imagery, stunning music and a bit of emotional self analysis for a couple of hours. Or would you rather the story by numbers of say, Joy? I may not have loved this as much as Thin Red Line, or Tree of Life, But am I happy to spend two hours with Mr. M? Indeed I am. Anyone who has led anything verging on an interesting life will have plenty to ponder as this washes over them. This was like meditating. It's freeing to let a sense of the story wash over you without having some contrived plot shoved down your throat. I let the cinema invigorated and cleansed.",/review/rw3398851/?ref_=tt_urv

1 January 2016,KineticSeoul,6," Rich guy problems...
","This is a very Terrence Malick film where the trailer is far more interesting than the actual movie itself. It's leaning more towards the experience side of things over story and character development. There really isn't a direction, but a guy experiencing the shallow, pretentious, fake and hedonistic side of Hollywood as a screenwriter. The cinematography is nice to look at, although it drags on a lot with it's scenery which seems to take up much of the screen time. There is hardly much dialogue in this, just bunch of quotes and philosophical stuff. The plot is about a guy who works in Hollywood delving and indulging himself temptations that goes with money, fame, power and connections. And in doing so he feels that he is losing his identity in the process. It's not as crazy and trippy as the trailer makes it seem. Despite this film being ambiguous and all, it's still somewhat easy to follow. Because it's all about the experience over a story. Overall to sum the plot of this film in a humorous way...The whole thing is basically a rich guy problems kind of deal. So yeah, it is pretty shallow and pretentious but the setting and cinematography is neat enough to draw in certain audiences. However you can experience most of the stuff in this film if you go to a night club, a crazy and wild pub or a strip club. It isn't a amazing artsy film I would watch again and it wasn't really enticing, but I give it a pass. It's not a awful artsy film but it wasn't thought provoking or impactful either.",/review/rw3398851/?ref_=tt_urv

","more clueless, going-nowhere pretentious. Trying so hard to find some unnecessary answers with a film to play out meaninglessly by a guy who miraculously relocated or misplaced himself in lot of big-deal events or scenes, either looking up to the sky or jumped off from a pier into the sea for no obvious purpose but spur-of-the-moment childish behaviors, or entangled himself with some females in close contact, flesh against flesh, intimate but without profound romantic feelings at all, or woken by a sudden earthquake, moronically and aimlessly roamed around inside his room with bare feet littered with shattered glass, then when the aftershock tremors hit again, escaped downstairs, still without shoes, looked up to the sky, saw chopper passing, sirens....on and on, situated himself in desert, movie shooting locations, swimming pool, bed for no purpose.

14 September 2015,nickle101,1," Long & vacuous
","Beautiful shots, lots of them. 2 hours of perfume ads, with an unhappy protagonist, Christian Bale. He is apparently a successful, but definitely miserable, comedy script writer; unintended irony I guess. He doesn't do anything, other than feature in most shots, often bare foot, speaking monotone about the difficulties of 'being', occasionally swimming in his clothes in swimming pools and the sea, often accompanied by women, one more beautiful than the other. The women, most of them, wearing flimsy designer attire, dance and wave their arms about for no apparent reason.

25 September 2017,Bored_Dragon,8," Pay attention to this moment. And everything is there... perfect and complete just as it is.
","I could write a novel about this film. For quite some time I was thinking how to write short review and not miss the essence. Mass bashing of this movie does not speak so much about its quality as it speaks about today's audience. World got faster, people have no time, they're impatient and nervous, and even worse, they're addicted to adrenaline injections served by modern big and home screens. Unfortunately, this movie is not for everyone. It's not for most of people. But if you are willing to relax, open yourselves emotionally and let the moment carry you, this film could be enriching experience. They say it's pretentious, boring and has no story. True, it's not perfect, it has pretentious and even boring moments and it is very tiring watch if you are not capable to let go. Fact that it does not have plot doers not mean it has no story. It has story, and what a story it has, it just does not tell it in conventional ways. It tells the story by picture and sound and emotion. Every cadre is like a postcard, every sound contributes to artistic photography. This is one of those movies that are not supposed to be analyzed, but felt. I never saw any Terrence Malick movies till now, and if this one really is his worst then I definitely must watch all the rest.",/review/rw3398851/?ref_=tt_urv

26 June 2016,westsideschl,2," Yuck, Ughhh
","Ughhh, yuck. OK, that's out of me. Another attempt in film of unscripted free- expression trying to produce something meaningful (or perhaps the intent was to be unmeaningful? - sounds better than meaningless). The writer/director, with a little guidance to the actors, just asked them to wing-it as they felt appropriate to the setting. The problem is actors basically had to rely on their life experiences which for the most part has probably been a life of pampered pretend. A better choice would have been to replace the boring lives of actors with real people who have had to endure difficult, challenging, even life changing events.",/review/rw3398851/?ref_=tt_urv

","This...is not a movie. It's a narrated commercial for nothing, or maybe for the cameras they used for filming? The shots are cool, I'll give it that, one point for the cinematography. Nothing happens in this commercial, there's no story arc, no plot, no character development. You will not experience any emotions during this film, unless you are moved by perfume ads in magazines. You will not have any thoughts about this thing either, besides 'why did I finish that?' , if you can survive to the end. Its a tough watch. Lots of pretty girls in it, so if that means anything to you, then I might recommend this. ",/review/rw3398851/?ref_=tt_urv
