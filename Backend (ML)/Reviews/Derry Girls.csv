12 October 2017,ferguson-6,6," Thurgood 101
","Greetings again from the darkness. The question must be asked: is the movie worthy of the man? The man was the first attorney for the NAACP. He won 29 of the 32 cases he argued in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, including the ground-breaking 1954 Brown v. Board of Education (separate but equal public education). This man was a trailblazer for Civil Rights, and in 1967 became the first African- American Supreme Court Justice. This man was, of course, Thurgood Marshall  a man who unquestionably deserves not just a movie, but a really good and important one.",/review/rw4071523/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2018,Bryan_Rathbun5,8," Marshall
","Marshall is a great movie that delivers on an old-fashioned courtroom drama. Great story with really good acting from the leads. Great cast overall. So far I have loved every role I have seen Chadwick Boseman play, he is a great actor and has this sort of swagger when acting. Sterling K Brown is great and one of the greatest actors in recent years. It was different but enjoyable seeing Josh Gad in a drama. I wish they would make more of these movies that follow Thurgood Marshall's journey. The only negative thing is that it felt a bit long.",/review/rw4071523/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2017,KingKongKyle,7," An Old Recipe Prepared Well
","I got to attend an early screening of Marshall tonight. I'm interested to see how critics react. I have a feeling many of them will object to the ""paint-by-numbers"" approach to the film. While we have not seen Thurgood Marshall represented much in film, it does feel like we've seen this movie more than once before. But that isn't really the point. I've eaten spaghetti and meatballs hundreds of times before. I still enjoy it each time, the same dish, so long as it is made well. And Marshall, while not reinventing any wheels, is made well. Chadwick Boseman leads a terrific cast that includes Josh Gad, Dan Stevens, James Cromwell, Kate Hudson and Sterling K. Brown. Everyone is there to give this very important true story some depth and weight. At the same time, the screenplay never gets too caught up in its own self-importance. While some very dark themes and tragic events are present, there is a sense of humor pervading much of the film. This makes the people and events portrayed in Marshall relatable, instead of feeling like we're watching a group of untouchable, stoic historical figures. Marshall isn't designed to inspire anger or guilt, instead it encourages us to examine examples of unity that have been used to overcome struggle. It has more in common with films like The Help or Hidden Figures, than more aggressive films like Detroit (though that film is very intense and impressive). I would say Marshall will play out just as well at home as it does in a theater, but there is something about seeing it with a crowd that in this case adds to the experience. The gasps of the audience when an atrocity is displayed, the clapping when a bigot loses his/her battle-it is a good film to enjoy with an audience. From a technical standpoint, the film does not go out of its way to impress. The cinematography, costume and production design, music, editing-all seems serviceable if not particularly memorable. In this case its the story and the figures it portrays that you'll remember. 7/10.",/review/rw4071523/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2017,travishouze,6," Marshall Is Good, But Not As Great As It Could Be
","Growing up one of the first influential black figures I learned about was Supreme Court Judge Thurgood Marshall. While my life didn't veer in the path he took, it was a chance for me as a young black male to see the dedication and time he took to his craft and where it could take you. Almost 2 decades have passed since then, and found myself surprised to see a film finally based on him and his capabilities. While the younger me was excited, I found myself wondering how this film would hold up side by side with other black period films like itself in recent history.",/review/rw4071523/?ref_=tt_urv

30 March 2018,SnoopyStyle,7," good very nice
","It's 1941. Thurgood Marshall (Chadwick Boseman) travels the country as NAACP's only lawyer crusading for black defendants against the racist justice system. His next case is in Greenwich, Connecticut where rich housewife Eleanor Strubing (Kate Hudson) has accused her driver Joseph Spell (Sterling K. Brown) of raping her. Insurance lawyer Sam Friedman (Josh Gad) is recruited. He's reluctant and on top of that, Judge Foster (James Cromwell) refuses to accept Marshall into the local state bar. With Marshall silenced in court and with no criminal court experience, Friedman has to battle entitled prosecutor Loren Willis (Dan Stevens).",/review/rw4071523/?ref_=tt_urv

13 October 2017,asimow,8," Excellent courtroom movie about the young Thurgood Marshall is tense and witty
","This enjoyable and inspiring movie is a worthy contribution to the courtroom movie genre. It memorializes the great Thurgood Marshall (who later won Brown v. Bd. of Education and sat on the Supreme Court). The film brings to life a forgotten rape case in Connecticut that Marshall tried early in his career when he was the solo staff lawyer at the NAACP. The story focuses on the plight of a black man accused of raping a white woman and it highlights issues of racism in the courtroom and on the streets. The movie recalls the classic fllms ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" (which also involved a black on white rape case) and ""Anatomy of a Murder"" (which also involved sexual issues and in which--like many real trials--we're never sure just what actually happened and who is telling the truth). The writing is sharp and witty and the acting and direction are great. Particularly strong is the emerging partnership and friendship of Marshall and the local lawyer, Sam Friedman, who had never tried a criminal case and thought he would just sit next to Marshall during the trial and and do nothing. But the judge forces Friedman to conduct the trial with Marshall serving as his adviser--and he rises to the occasion.",/review/rw4071523/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2017,ThomasDrufke,8," Chadwick Boseman - Certified Biopic Star
","I hate to say most, but there's a lot of biopics that are very formulaic in nature. And come to think of it, every genre deals with that issue. I can acknowledge that it's immensely hard to make a film that feels fresh and relevant at the same time. But I think the reason I tend to feel this way about biopics is because a lot of them seem to be directly aimed for the Oscar audience. And while that could be the case with Marshall, it's nothing less than a delightful film to watch.",/review/rw4071523/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2017,Tcarts76,5," Nothing more than average
","I can give this movie nothing more than a 5 out of 10. Marshall is a fairly average movie all around. I was expecting a serious toned well made movie telling me something about a future Supreme Court Justice. Instead, I got a lackluster average courtroom drama. The acting is average and the characters are almost cartoon-ish. Had this movie been made in the early 1990's I may have been able to give it a 6, because that is what it feels like. A tired early 1990's courtroom drama. To see people rating this movie a 8, or 9 destroys my faith in humanity as a whole, this was not a great, spectacular movie that will make you think, it's a lazy boring sunday, ""because there is nothing on,"" movie.",/review/rw4071523/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is a Lifetime Channel movie with a Seinfeld musical score. The filmmakers clearly just wanted to make a trashy courtroom drama, and just stuck Thurgood Marshall's name on it. Everything written about him in the epilogue is 100x more interesting and more deserving of a movie than the obnoxious caricature we're given here.

8 April 2018,zardoz-13,9," Civil Right Courtroom History
","Before he played the lead in Marvel Studios' superhero sage ""Black Panther,"" actor Chadwick Boseman played a genuine African-American hero in ""Boomerang"" director Reginald Hudlin's ""Marshall,"" a sterling biographical courtroom yarn about civil rights attorney Thurgood Marshall. As it turns out, this is the same individual who argued 32 cases before the Supreme Court and then later donned the robes as the first African-American to sit on the highest federal court of the United States. It doesn't hurt matters that seasoned civil rights advocate Michael Koskoff and his son Jacob penned the screenplay. Interestingly, the elder Koskoff still serves as an attorney in Connecticut, where the trial took place in 1941, so he would know something about the hurdles that Marshall had to negotiate. At this point in his life, Marshall worked as the sole legal counsel for the NAACP, and his NAACP superior Walter White (Roger Guenveur Smith of ""Eve's Bayou"") dispatches him to all parts of the country to defend poor African-Americans who cannot afford an attorney.

31 January 2018,JohnRayPeterson,9," A 'Home Run' - Entertaining and historical
","Better known for is TV series directorial achievements, Reginals Hudlin, this movie's director, hit a home run by providing us with good story telling flick that is also one about an icon of Black History, not a small thing to do. An excellent script from co-writer Michael Koskoff has a great deal to do with that because of his own background as a nationally known attorney (if you know about that sort of thing) and one with experience arguing the kind of cases that Thurgood Marshall could himself have. Then Chadwick Boseman who plays the lead character delivered a spot-on performance, believable and convincing, as Thurgood Marshall. I would venture a guess that Hudlin, Boseman and Koskoff in particular would have known the Marshall bio through and through, and most importantly believed in the telling of the story.",/review/rw4071523/?ref_=tt_urv
