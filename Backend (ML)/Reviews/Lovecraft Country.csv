24 May 2002,Fractalizer,," This is what I have been waiting for!!
",I am writing this comment after watching _all_ 14 episodes of Spaced that are currently available in what was basically one sitting. Living in Germany I had been totally unaware of this rare gem among all the mediocrity and outright rubbish that is usually aired on TV until the owner of my favourite video shop (which specializes in US and UK imports) pointed out the Series 1 and Series 2 DVDs to me.,/review/rw2201266/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2005,jack-71,10," Possibly the best thing to ever happen to television
","The whole two series was as close to perfect as I can imagine. Funny, beautifully shot, well-produced, the only downside was that there wasn't more of it. Perhaps the reason that it wasn't as successful as it should have been was that it didn't get a large enough audience. It was aired in a time when ""The Royle Family"" undeservedly won all the awards and praise, whereas Spaced was considered to be aimed at immature adolescents, film parodies and comic book references only worthy of an audience that doesn't know quality when they see it. And this is a tragedy, because, if television series' can be considered art form by any stretch of the imagination, then this is a masterpiece, something to be admired by others, a definite benchmark for all other programmes.",/review/rw2201266/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2005,Greg75,," Exactly what french TV will never be able to do !
","""Spaced"" has never been broadcast (to my knowledge) on French TV, so I bought the complete 2 seasons series on Amazon after seeing Shaun of the Dead, which I consider to be one of the best comedies ever. Well, even without any subtitles (I get around in English), ""Spaced"" appears to me as the exact epitome of what British TV can do at its best : a perfect brew of comedy, rhythm, political incorrectness, extraordinary acting, stylish writing, socially-oriented matters... I really was mesmerized at the creativity both screenwriters and director displayed all along the 14 episodes, always renewing what could be taken as pure show-off style on the first one. This is why I love British comedy, TV & cinema. Wit. Man do they have it. Simon Pegg if you ever read this : you ARE the Force !",/review/rw2201266/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2001,al.thorpe,," Wonderful
","There simply isn't a better TV comedy around at the moment than Spaced. Simon Pegg and Jessica Stevenson's scriptwriting is so sharp and full of references it can sometimes be hard to keep up through the onslaught of hilarious jokes. With such well rounded characters it is just too good for words, it is the recognition humour and references that make this a wonderful comedy.",/review/rw2201266/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2003,ProperCharlie,," It's life Tim, and boy, do they know it.
","""Spaced"" is like watching the cartoon of the life of the average SFX reader or Ain't-it-Cool UK talkbacker.  It's the closest thing to fanboy (and fangirl) heaven there is.  By that, I don't mean it's a perfect word for word film version of Lord of the Rings nor even a big BBC production of Asimov's Foundation trilogy.  No, this is where really good fanboys (and fangirls) go when they die.",/review/rw2201266/?ref_=tt_urv

20 February 2005,samgisoad,," More Please...
","'Spaced' is, for my money, one of the best comedy series produced in the English language in the last ten years; genuinely, laugh-out-loud funny, scrupulously well-written, brilliantly acted and with a kicking soundtrack that has introduced me, at least (and I'm guessing a few others) to some fantastic little-known bands (Using LemonJelly long before they were famous, for example) - this must rank alongside 'Black Books' in its cult-but-inclusive appeal. The true genius is in the fact that you could probably watch this with your vicar and - apart from a low swearing incidence - they would find little to criticise (unlike, say, equally funny but edgier shows; Chris morris' work for example) but it still makes perfect post-pub viewing. When one sees the dross that usually passes for sitcom in the UK, once-great Shakespearean actors mugging at the camera and silently cursing their agent as the canned laughter robotically shrieks, you wonder why they don't just hand over the entire comedy drama section of UK TV to Pegg, Stevenson, Bailey, Moran and Serafinowicz. Please make more. Please.",/review/rw2201266/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2005,celesteavonne,," Americans should watch ""Spaced""
","I've just spent five hours watching the most terrific British sitcom, ""Spaced."" Now my inner voice speaks with an English accent and I'm left wondering if maybe I grew up on the wrong side of the Atlantic. I am an American viewer, and I'm sad that it has taken so long for this show to reach the States.",/review/rw2201266/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2019,Tweekums,9," Great turn of the millennium Brit-com
","This series is centred on Tim Bisley and Daisy Steiner; two twenty somethings who meet while each is looking for a new place to live; unfortunately everywhere each of them want to live is for couples. Then they hit on the idea of pretending to be a couple to hire a flat together. They get a place in a house belonging to Marsha, who lives upstairs with her teenaged daughter; Brian, an artist lives in the flat downstairs. Other key characters are Tim's friend Mike, who was kicked out of the Territorial Army for stealing a tank and trying to invade Paris and Daisy's friend Twist.",/review/rw2201266/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2013,SnoopyStyle,9," Simon Pegg and Nick Frost begins
","Tim Bisley (Simon Pegg) and Daisy Steiner (Jessica Hynes) are just platonic friends in desperate need for a place to stay. They pretend to be together to rent a couples-only room. It's a 20something show with Nick Frost as Tim's best friend Mike Watt. There's a lot edge to it. Tim and Daisy are both geeks. She's a frustrated writer, and he works at a comic book store. It's a great alternative slacker sitcom chalk full of pop references. The second series is better, and more well written. The first one is a little bit uneven. But more than anything, it gave us two important things. First, it gave us Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Second, it gave us Burning Star Wars Paraphernalia for The Phantom Menace. For that, they should have gotten a Nobel Prize.",/review/rw2201266/?ref_=tt_urv

21 January 2006,jag91772,," Brilliant and entertaining!
","Okay, so I happen to be a partying, comic book reading, horror movie watching, video game playing, thirty something-year-old gal from the US, who is also a major Star Wars geek. And according to some that is the only audience that this show would appeal to. Well, I disagree. It really spoke to me, for obvious reasons, and I think that the characters of Tim and Daisy are much of an amalgam of the people in my generation who want to succeed but are either afraid to take the risk, feel like they can't get a break, or are just to damned lazy to do so! But there is also something about the relationship of the characters that I think could appeal to anyone. And the peripheral characters are deliciously strange. I think that it's well written and acted. I think that it's funny, and weird and bizarre and just really, really fun to watch! If you liked Shaun of the Dead then you will definitely like this series. I only had one problem with it. They didn't make enough episodes!!!",/review/rw2201266/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2015,brando647,8," ""Spaced"" is the Ultimate Geek's Sitcom
","As a fan of Edgar Wright and his films, discovering ""Spaced"" on Hulu a few years ago was an epic surprise. I'd had no idea that Wright, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost had done a two-series television show in England and it came as no surprise that it was full to the brim with the geekiest of references. It's bound to appeal to anyone who loves their films and, as popular as their films have become with American audiences, I'm surprised ""Spaced"" hasn't found some sort of syndication on this side of the Atlantic to introduce a whole new audience. The premise of the show isn't something we haven't seen a hundred times before in other sitcoms but it's the execution that makes it stand out. The show opens with Tim Bisley (Pegg) meeting Daisy Steiner (Jessica Hynes); Tim has just gone through a nasty breakup and Daisy is hoping to move out of the flat where she's squatting with a bunch of losers. Options are scarce until they discover an advertisement for a flat available for ""professional couples""so Tim and Daisy agree to pose as a couple in order to move in. The series follows the lives of these two and their eccentric friends: militaristic Mike (Frost), struggling artist Brian (Mark Heap), fashion-obsessed Twist (Katy Carmichael), and their perpetually drunken landlady Marsha (Julia Deakin). Over the course of the fourteen episodes, they will pursue their dreams, form relationships, engage in robot battles, and, in Tim's case, come to terms with a crippling hatred for THE PHANTOM MENACE.",/review/rw2201266/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2006,dr_foreman,10," This is my generation...
","""Spaced"" is a perfect portrait of my generation (well, pretty much my generation - I was born in 1979). It features everything I associate with people my age - clubbing, gratuitous pop culture references, heavy-duty substance abuse and, of course, chronic laziness.",/review/rw2201266/?ref_=tt_urv

17 August 2014,kikkapi20,9," I FOUND SPACED SIMPLY Hysterical!.
","This show is one of the most influential comedies of all time. It's definitely my favorite sitcom ever! As the title of this review suggests, Spaced is (at this moment in time) my personal favorite sitcom of all time. The characters, the situations and the filming is / are brilliant and the lifestyle the show focuses on will probably be quite a good prediction of what my life will be like immediately after University life ends. The characters are comic creations of real life and the situations are on the ridiculous side of real life, occasionally falling over into absolute madness, but in a very good way. It is the ultimate fan boys show - there are hundreds of nods to other TV shows and brilliant films and you can tell that the writers are just as huge fans of quality entertainment as most of the fans of Spaced are. The music is inspired. Although some aspects of the show look slightly dated already (even though it was filmed from 1999 to 2001) it is well worth discovering if you've never watched an episode. Also the second series is better than the first and just as fresh as the first series. The characters are developed further and the direction and stylistic features are even more sharp than the first series. The main characters (Tim and Daisy) are great, and the characters of Mike, Brian, Marsha and...Tyres (I LOVE HIM) are wonderful in supporting roles, and provide much of the comedy. If you've seen Shaun of the Dead and you haven't seen Spaced, you're missing out. You will love it.",/review/rw2201266/?ref_=tt_urv

10 February 2006,mulhollandman,," Another Bloody Classic
","This program is definitely another program of it's time. In the late 1990's and the early part of the Millennium Channel 4 had what was it's most fertile time with regards to producing situation comedies for all tastes. Amongst them were That Peter Kay Thing, Phoenix Nights, Father Ted and Black Books. But through all this there came Spaced with its touching tale of two flat mates and their strange assortment of friends living within the same house in London. But this was not the only winning formula that they had in there. There was also the film/television/art/theatre references which were sometime very surreal but they tapped into the post modern world we live in and highlighted certain statements by media guru's that say that there isn't anything original anymore.",/review/rw2201266/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2010,shark-43,10," SPACED is Out of Sight!
","SPACED is a wonderfully written and terrifically acted British comedy. Much of the creative team went on to do the great SHAUN OF THE DEAD. Simon Pegg & Jessica Stevenson have such great give and take, such chemistry - they are a delight. The show is just funny - that's all it tries to do - yes the characters become three-dimensional and you care about them - but the pace of the show is so fast, so brisk, with tons of pop culture references - but the pace is like a runaway train (in a good way) and in the long one, Spaced just tries to make you laugh and they succeed. Little moments between friends, buddies hanging out in front of the TV - this is the kind of stuff the show nails - where you, the viewer, go - that is just like me and my mates when we were just hanging out. The rest of the cast is top notch and the actress who plays the older landlady, Marsha - is brilliant. American TV has bought the rights to this (sadly) and have butchered it twice in pilot form - I hope it never reaches the US screens in its ""Americanized"" version - where I am sure they will take all the rough edges off and give the typical US TV notes - ""we have to like them - we want them to be good at their jobs."" ""Well, they don't really have jobs."" ""What??? That won't do.""",/review/rw2201266/?ref_=tt_urv

24 October 2019,keoght,10," ""Hi! Where errr, errr, a couple! Yessss! Hahaha!""
","This is by far (opinion of course, not fact) the greatest sitcom/tv series ever made. It captured so much of what was and what is! The nostalgia. The gaming. The movies. The TV. The jokes. The life of 1998-1999! It is now (unfortunately for me) classed as a classic! Cult classic (Whatever 😁) It is amazing in every sense of the word! Spaced captures all. Enjoy. Love it. Reel it in. Absorb. Most of all...love Daisy and Tim (not Rosie and Jim) 🍺🍻🍺🍻 SPACED 10/10",/review/rw2201266/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2010,paul2001sw-1,5," Thin
","A supposedly surprising sitcom based upon the very modern idea of a couple of twenty-somethings sharing a flat: 'Spaced' sounded as if it should feel fresh and original. But in fact the set up feels very familiar: the landlord (in this case, actually a landlady) lives under the same roof as her collection of sexually inadequate, loser tenants; although the permutations are different, 'Spaced' really doesn't feel so completely different from 'Rising Damp'. The one original quirk is that jokes are often followed up by vividly unreal exaggerations showing us what the characters really think. But this was done with more style in 'Dream On' and in this case, far from adding to the original joke, seems more to labour the point - this isn't the sort of comedy whose humour is allowed to nearly escape you. In some senses, these visual plays are more the equivalent of a laughter track - something to tell the audience to laugh. The odd line made me smile, but overall, I prefer a bit more realism in my comedy; there's no real bite when the characters are drawn so thin.",/review/rw2201266/?ref_=tt_urv
