5 February 2021,lornak-18008,9," Netflix adaptation of Fire Fly Lane is Near Perfection.
","I just finished binging this over a 24 hour period and honestly loved the whole thing. Having grown up in the 60's and 70's, I found it a realistic representation of that time period as well as the years past that. I had read the book and I spent way too much time waiting for certain events to happen before I realized there has to be another season. I wasn't sure about the casting at first, but in the end I thought the two main stars were perfect for their roles.",/review/rw6599097/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2021,jasarrubbo,10," Binged all of season 1
","This is absolutely perfect in every way. The 80's flashbacks are spot on and full of nostalgia, and all the flashbacks caused no confusion it is done so well. Katherine Haigel and Sarah Chalke are perfect together, chemistry is amazing! Love everything about it.
It is funny, sad, devastating, and so relatable!",/review/rw6599097/?ref_=tt_urv

",I needed a story and characters I could get lost in and enjoy. Firefly Lane delivers and its fun watching as the storyline unfolds.,/review/rw6599097/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2021,nat_mt,10," I love this so much!
","What a wonderful, moving series about the love story of two best friends and soul mates. Sad in places, I love the changes through the years 70's, 80's and early 2000's. Wonderful costumes, lovingly crafted characters, powerful stories about life, loss, love and mostly friendship and the family we choose! I cannot recommend enough and looking forward to series 2 as it finished on a bit of a cliff hanger- I couldn't believe I had finished the series in less than a day and I work!",/review/rw6599097/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2021,karaq,9," Loved it!
","Really loved this show and will be anxiously waiting for season 2! Acting is great and it is fun to watch Katherine Heigl again! I thought the chemistry between alI the characters was spot on. The actors that play Tully and Kate as teenagers are fabulous. I do think the writing lacked a tiny bit, but it did not stop me from enjoying the show and being entertained. The back and forth between past and present is well done and not confusing. Binge worthy!",/review/rw6599097/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2021,michelle_kummer,10," Love this show!
","I totally binged on this show, it's refreshing and clever. I love that it goes back and forth and shows the friendship between Tully and Kate.
I don't know why people are complaining, it's good to see all the trials and tribulations these girls go through from childhood friends to college, careers and then in their 40's.
I am a huge fan of Katherine Heigl both actresses are cast perfectly and have a fabulous chemistry.
By watching this you can see why the two women are so different Tully had a tough upbringing and suffered a horrific rape and her mum is a junkie, where are Kate has a stable home but a brother who has to live in the closet and only Tully knows he is gay.
Ben Lawson as always is the handsome loyal husband to Kate, so when her life is falling apart Tully's is finally coming together. She has major trust issues, which is understandable and meets a gorgeous younger man who falls in love with her. She's getting the love she has longed for on top of all the money and fame.
I don't know why some reviewers are saying she's mean, she's generous, kind and loyal.. she's just tough as she has to be.
Kate lived in her shadow as the nerdier kid but Tully always has her back and lifts her up.
I truly hope there is a season 2 plus more!!",/review/rw6599097/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2021,dax-87-757053,7," What can a friendship not survive? You would never know this season!
","It sucks, when you watch 10 episodes for real friendship about two girls. They come always together after a fight. And in the last episode you see them shattered.
What happened?! You will never know.(only when you read the book) or in 2. season.",/review/rw6599097/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2021,imdb-ikysmoviedatabase,10," Fun and entertaining
",I'm seen some bad reviews but the few episodes I've seen. I haven't found anything wrong with them. The story is fun and moves at a good pace. Some people are moaning about the way 70s and 80s are shown in the show. The picture is different but doesn't bother me. I still enjoyed the show.,/review/rw6599097/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2021,brandis-82097,9," Excellent Show to Binge
",Let me start by saying that I did not read the books or have a frame of reference going into this show. I loved it. I watched it over a day. It was so good. I love the time jumps. I know some people complained about them but they were easy to follow. The girls that played young Tully and Kate were amazing while Sarah Chalke and Katherine Heigl shined. I was left on the edge of my seating wondering what would happen next and cannot wait for another season.,/review/rw6599097/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2021,janfan20,10," Serious memory lane!
","Great casting, in-depth story & great sound track! Hope we get another season.",/review/rw6599097/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2021,Leonie_1988,10," Fantastic! Great binge!
","The cast pulled me in and the story kept me there. I really enjoyed the whole journey of these two inseparable friends (that's all I say, no Spoilers).
Sarah Chalke and Katherine Heigl (Izzie!) shine in every scene and work well together. The supporting cast is also very well cast.
I hope we will get a second season!!! Sooo good! And the costume design! Wow!",/review/rw6599097/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2021,jiballini64,2," With a friend like Tully...
","Old Kate doesn't need enemies. Best mate flirts with her husband and every other object of her affection. As someone else commented, it all seems a bit forced. Two girls with nothing in common stay friends even though they get less in common as they get older. It's actually cringey and uncomfortable to watch.",/review/rw6599097/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2021,xocuddlebugxo,10," Besties
","This is such a good show. I laughed, I cried, it reminds me of the bond and when I say bond with my best friend I mean -> we are closer than sisters. I remember reading this book. Katherine Hiegel is a great actress and so is Sarah Chalke. The portrayal of besties growing up makes you smile and think about yours. Have tissues there's sad parts. It's a great show to watch with your bestie, hell even if your best is a guy. just watch it. Oh season 2 please :)",/review/rw6599097/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2022,lasasala,," Heigl is great-could this be the lift she needs
","This is a lovely show about friendship. Charming, sweet, it hits all the high notes.",/review/rw6599097/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2021,lisaannyoung5,8," Watch till the end
","I was excited to see Katherine Heigl back on screen. At first, it was cute, seemed like it was going to be pretty cliche' maybe boring. But, I knew I'd finish it because I've always loved Kathryn and I'm glad I did. It ended up being really good and I can't wait for season 2.",/review/rw6599097/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2021,Sleepin_Dragon,3," Just don't bother, more syrup than any one person can digest.
","Maybe you need to be so utterly bored to watch this, but I'm sorry, I thought this was dismal, absolute mind numbing drivel, two besties..... Please. I thought the acting was pretty poor, and the flashbacks throughout were just so jarring.",/review/rw6599097/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2021,christinewiberg-11296,3," Hard to watch
",Overacting with a really bad script. People are behaving totally unrealistic. DonÂ´t understund how people can rate this crap so high.,/review/rw6599097/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2021,rebekahrox,7," Not fair.
",Great show until the final episode where we are left with a bombshell development that comes out of nowhere and lots of loose ends. I understand leaving some questions to build a new season with but this was way too much. Would have been a 9 or 10. Sucks.,/review/rw6599097/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2021,ursuladuke,2," A weak story that should have lasted an hour.
","Kind of interesting at the beginning, but I quickly started skipping mostly all of the tiresome flash backs, which I found hideously made, totally unconvincing with those ridiculous wigs and blurry lenses. Heigl's acting is more than decent, but it's not enough. I found Chalke's character very obnoxious, pretentious and uninteresting, having absolutely nothing in common with Heigl's, who is not that likeable, but at least explained to a point. The relationships portrayed seem so shallow and forced, lacking chemistry.",/review/rw6599097/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2021,kathrynkk,10," Definitely worth the watch!!
",Brilliantly written and some very touching moments in some episodes.,/review/rw6599097/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2021,tb4now,2," Maybe if I had not read the book...
","Maybe if I had not read the book, I would have felt this series was ok, however, ther the characters were so unbelievable, that I felt no connection to their relationships to each other. In addition, why in the world does Hollywood always feel the need to change a wonderful story by adding their crappy changes to it just to fit their agenda to be ""woke?"" The Hollywood today is quickly going downhill",/review/rw6599097/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2021,Zedyeti,4," Unpopular opinion
","This show isn't great. I did finish it but thing was the longer it went on the less interesting the story was and really begin to dislike the main characters. Some of the jumping timeline scenes seemed to be in awkward places and made the editing out of wack. People seem to love the source material so I'm sure I'll get hate for this review. Overall this show fits a specific target audience that will love it. I will say the ending is crap, but I wouldn't bother with another season find out the answer to the cliff hanger.",/review/rw6599097/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2021,papirna_vila,3," It's 2021..
",".. And still the main difference between the hot girl and ""ugly"" girl are the glasses.
It's 2021 and not every successful woman regrets not having bunch of kids or else she never knows the true meaning of life and will be miserable forever.
It's 2021 and no one wants to figure out how to represent a middle class like it is, and not with a 10 million dollar mansion with view on a ocean.
It's 2021 and only way to represent a bad choice for a gay man is a woman who wears a pants with ""Juicy"" written on her ass.
Toxic relationships are not something that should be celebrated. Also, bad filters to make 46 year olds look like 20.",/review/rw6599097/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2021,vlsummacumlaude,4," Meh
","I understand that this is based on a book that covers a friendship spanning multiple decades. That being said, my interest was primarily focused on the early relationship between Tully and Kate; I found their adult relationship far less compelling. I couldn't really understand why they were still friends decades later; as others have noted, there was simply no chemistry between Chalk and Heigl to make those portions of the story work.",/review/rw6599097/?ref_=tt_urv
