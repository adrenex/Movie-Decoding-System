25 November 2019,Coventry,7," ""Do you have any idea what I can do to you ... on Yelp?""
","""Kraftidioten"", a.k.a. ""In order of Disappearance"", is a brilliant 2014 black comedy/vigilante thriller from Norway. Since a lot of people in this world object to reading subtitles (and simply because it's an easy and profitable business), Hollywood is always eager to produce remakes of successful foreign movies. For once, however, I didn't immediately feel like boycotting the US remake; and this for two reasons. Number one: native Norwegian Hans Petter Moland directs the American remake himself and, number two, none other than the awesome Liam Neeson reprises the role of the grieving but vengeful father. Apart from different people in the cast, obviously, ""Cold Pursuit"" is practically a shot-by-shot remake of ""In order of Disappearance. The setting has moved from snowy Norway to snowy Colorado, and the drug wars are fought with Native American tribes instead of with Albanian mafia families, but the plot of the quiet and introvert plow driver seeking retaliation for the murder of his innocent son is identical. This basically means that ""Cold Pursuit"" is still an awesomely entertaining action movie with sublime dry humor, but the freshness and the surprise elements are gone (unless if you haven't seen the Norwegian original, duh).",/review/rw6872892/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2020,kosmasp,6," In Order of ... releasing
","I would suggest before you watch this or think about watching it: go and watch the original! Way better, way funnier (darker) and feels generally better in tone. Now obviously some may think this is Taken or like Taken - it is not. Which makes some of the people watching this already mad. Especially because they don't know the movie this is based on.",/review/rw6872892/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2021,Mike_Yike,7," Not Bad At All
","I was expecting a movie similar to Neeson's ""Taken"". ""Cold Pursuit"" was much better. In fact, Neeson was really one of the ensemble actors in the movie. Anyway, Cold Pursuit was really a dark comedy more than a thriller. The film reminded me in a good way of Fargo. It wasn't quite as good as Fargo but it had a similar feel to it. I'm sure this is not the first review to make that observation.",/review/rw6872892/?ref_=tt_urv

4 November 2019,Leofwine_draca,7," Straight remake
","COLD PURSUIT is a straightforward English language remake of the Scandi crime comedy IN ORDER OF DISAPPEARANCE, starring Stellan Skarsgaard. It follows that movie's plot very closely and has the same mix of extreme violence and dark comedy to see it through, which perhaps gives it an edge over the more mundane thrillers that Liam Neeson has been churning out lately. He's a good choice for the role of the taciturn grieving father, while the lengthy supporting cast put in a lot of effort to inhabit their larger-than-life character roles. Unusually for a remake, I found myself enjoying it a lot more than the original; it seems snappier, despite the two hour running time, the inevitability of it counts for a lot, and the Tarantino-style deadpan humour hits home time and again.",/review/rw6872892/?ref_=tt_urv

",This wasn't garbage. i was enjoying it for a while. but it went nowhere and got worse as it went on. some of the acting was bad. the villain was awful. the story was kind of nothing. so much in this movie is completely useless. so many side-plots should be removed.

10 May 2019,arungeorge13,6," Made me laugh more than I'd expected it to! [+59%]
","The thing with most Liam Neeson actioners these days is that their screenplays solely depend on his tough guy demeanor to keep the proceedings engaging. Cold Pursuit, another Liam Neeson actioner on the onset, is entertaining but for reasons not pertaining to the set pieces alone. Don't get me wrong, the set pieces are very much there but this film doesn't go the typical Hollywood remake route.",/review/rw6872892/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2019,gbidari,4," A total mess
","Hard to follow, rediculously absurd plot points. Lit and shot very well, some interesting performances. Buzz are editing and style can't find its footing. Tonally all over the map. It's dramatic, serious then slapstick and goofy, then violent and shocking, then kooky. Way too many characters with no background and you just don't care about anyone.",/review/rw6872892/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2019,dogmaticdogs,8," Great Film Once You Understand Its Intention, With a Beautifully Surreal Depiction of Denver
","This film was not what I was expecting but once I understood and came to grips with the fact it was a dark comedy, in a Fargo-esque sort of way, and a parody of revenge killing films, rather than meant to be taken seriously other than for its beautiful absurdity, I started to really enjoy it.",/review/rw6872892/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2019,piggulu,6," More like disappearance of focus
","Starts out really good, with Neeson as the usual man on a mission and exacting brutal vengeance on a few men. But after that it shifts attention to too many needless people, mainly for comedic effect, but apparently to advance the story by inches to avoid Neeson's character from appearing to be too powerful to get things done alone. Unfortunately, it just doesn't work here since these side events don't feel parallel to the main story or interesting. For example, a female cop, portrayed as eager and hard-nosed, is constantly discovering bits of info related Neeson's son death, even confronting him out of the blue about it, appearing suspicious of him for some reason, but nothing ever happens after that. What was the point? Then the 2nd half really gets dragged on by too much forced attention on the Native Americans and the same old ""white men took everything"" story (I don't want to sound insensitive but it was too out of place), and a kid that would've been better off staying on the sidelines.",/review/rw6872892/?ref_=tt_urv

13 February 2019,RforFilm,7," Cold Pursuit is the Liam Neeson parody that combines Coen brothers-style storytelling with Tarantino-style pacing
","It's the January/February season, which also means it's time for a certain gravely-voiced actor to make another action movie we've been seeing around this time for a while. Yep, it's Liam Neeson time. Some people might see him as a one-note actor who plays similar characters in most of his movies. You'd be right if you were just referring to his recent revenge movies like Taken or ""thriller on a mode of transportation"" movie like Non Stop or The Commuter. You could even make that argument with his comedic roles like The Lego Movie or dramas like Schindler's List.",/review/rw6872892/?ref_=tt_urv

7 December 2019,nicholls905-280-546911,6," Not the usual Neeson film
","Neeson has had quite the action adventure since Taken, and from what I hear this is the last. This has an unusual style, but the dark comedy angle doesn't work as planned. The plot was interesting if a little cliche. Neeson does most of the heavy lifting and most of the support are only there for namesake purposes, not great characters. As an ending to the genre for Neeson this is just okay.",/review/rw6872892/?ref_=tt_urv

26 June 2019,Wizard-8,4," As fun as trudging through lots of snow
","Although it is possible to combine hard violence with humor, it certainly isn't an easy thing to do. As a director, you have to have an especially steady hand to make sure both extremes compliment each other. ""Cold Pursuit"" tries to mix violence with humor, but the end results don't really work well. To be fair, the movie could have been a lot worse had the humor been more of a yuk-yuk style. The humor here instead is more subdued and subtle, but all the same, whenever it came up it just felt... odd. It didn't really fit with the seriousness and violence elsewhere in the movie. But that's not the only big problem with the movie. The movie, for one thing, unfolds at a really slow and casual pace, making it too long for its own good. Despite running almost two hours in length, there are some glaring plot details that are either not properly explained or simply not explained at all. Also, some characters (particularly Liam Neeson's lead character) don't get enough opportunity to show a background or everything that is motivating them. Why, for example, does Neeson's character almost immediately decide to start on a bloody path of revenge after his son is killed? We don't know, because we were barely introduced to his character before his son's death. The movie has some atmosphere, I admit, and it's far from the worst movie I've ever seen. But in the end, you'll likely forget completely everything about it a few days after watching it.",/review/rw6872892/?ref_=tt_urv
