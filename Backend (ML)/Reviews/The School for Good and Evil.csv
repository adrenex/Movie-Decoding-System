27 October 2012,planktonrules,8," There's a lot to like but the film has one distinct disadvantage.
","Back in 1995, the definitive version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" was brought out--and everyone I know who saw that one agrees with me that it is simply the best. Much of it is the acting (having Colin Firth as Darcy isn't bad) but the biggest reason to adore the made for TV version is that it's long--very, very long. This allows the story to unfold slowly and is never rushed. Unfortunately, every movie version I've seen is just too rushed--and it's hard to shove this wonderful story into a two-hour time slot. So, no matter how good the 2005 movie is (and it's quite good), it cannot hope to equal the mini-series. It's a shame, actually, as there's so much to like about this Keira Knightly version. The music is great, the locations top-notch and the Bennett girls actually look their proper ages! For example, in the 1940 MGM version, the actual ages of the actresses was their mid-20s to almost 40! And, the Bennetts are supposed to be teenagers (there about)! ",/review/rw1186641/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2009,TheLittleSongbird,8," Handsomely filmed adaptation of a beautiful book!
","The book by the wonderful Jane Austen is definitely better than the film, dealing with the consequences of love, and the social differences of the late 18th century. The film is certainly handsome looking, with some truly beautiful locations and costumes, with a nice script and some excellent performances from Keira Knightly as Lizzie and in particular Judi Dench as Lady Catherine. Donald Sutherland (yeah, you saw right) was quite charming as Mr Bennett if you put his awkward accent aside. I liked Matthew MacFadyen as Mr Darcy, with his handsome looks and all that, but I will say I do prefer Colin Firth's interpretation from the sublime 1995 mini-series, Firth seemed to adopt a more likable and sympathetic approach to the character. I liked the way the film dealt with the period look and the social differences, and while there was a lot of the pride I would have liked to have seen a little more of the prejudice. If anything, the film could have done with being twenty minutes longer, as I felt there wasn't quite enough content from the book. Then again, it's been a long time since I read it, so I could be wrong. Overall, a beautiful film, not quite as good as the 1995 film Sense and Sensibility with Kate Winslet and Emma Thompson, but worth watching for the detail that obviously took a lot of effort to get right. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox.",/review/rw1186641/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2006,Flagrant-Baronessa,10," A timeless adaptation of a timeless Jane Austen novel.
","The fantastic romantic world of Jane Austen again makes its way to the silver screen in Joe Wright's new adaptation of the classic novel Pride and Prejudice. It is the first feature film to be adapted from it in 65 years, and believe me when I say it does not disappoint. This adaptation is, for lack of a better word, a BRILLIANT achievement that keeps you actively involved from the first scene to the very last scene, just about consuming you with aching romance Â– and it is sprinkled with humour and intelligence.",/review/rw1186641/?ref_=tt_urv

17 November 2005,katiemeyer1979,10," Jane Austen for ever
","Jane Austen's tale of love and economics reaches us once more with the energy of a thorough novelty. ""Pride and Prejudice"" has been a favorite novel of mine since I first read it and I've seen Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson, Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle and now Matthew MacFadyen and Kiera Knightly. Amazingly enough I've never been disappointed. The material seems to be full proof. Colin Firth's Darcy, in many ways, is the Darcy I've always imagined. He's been an actor I've followed feverishly since his glorious Adrian LeDuc in ""Apartment Zero"", Matthew MacFadyen was totally new to me but he managed to create that sense of longing that makes that final pay off so satisfying. Kiera Knightly is a ravishing revelation. I must confess, I didn't remotely imagined that she was capable of the powerful range she brilliantly shows here. The other big surprise is Joe Wright, the director, in his feature film debut which is more than promising, it's extraordinary. The photography, the art direction and the spectacular supporting cast, in particular Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn, makes this new version of a perennial classic a memorable evening at the movies",/review/rw1186641/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2022,wheatley-20230,9," A delightful watch
","I believe this is Keira Knightley's best film. She gives us a spirited rendering of Lizzie Bennett, the heart and soul of every scene. A charismatic performance that does not dim, no matter how often I watch this film.",/review/rw1186641/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2005,isabelle1955,," Exquisitely filmed.
","Pride and Prejudice has always been one of my favourite books, so any screen incarnation has to live up to certain personal expectations of character, style etc. And of course, there is the gold standard of the 1995 BBC series, which, as other reviewers have pointed out, had the luxury of several episodes to cover a story that here takes just two hours. So I was truly delighted to enjoy this movie so much. It had a lot to live up to.",/review/rw1186641/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2005,rogerdarlington,," Three weddings and no funeral
","This quintessentially English film is utterly charming - a very traditional interpretation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel that manages to entertain, amuse and even move. First time director Joe Wright has worked with television playwright Deborah Moggach's script and a wonderful collection of mainly British actors to delight us. The versatile camera-work, luscious countryside, grand settings, period costumes, and atmospheric music are evidence of a work on which much love has been lavished.",/review/rw1186641/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2006,Quicksand,10," Wonderful Moments, Both Big and Small
","There's really nothing negative to say about the film. The actors are perfectly cast, the direction is subtle and well-realized, and even a shade more cinematic than I would have expected, or than it needed to be. The moment, early in the film, when Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are arguing while dancing, and as they look at each other, everyone else in the room disappears... emotional, cinematic, and brilliant. Soft little touches like this, throughout the film, make it work far better than some dry BBC version of any Jane Austen book.",/review/rw1186641/?ref_=tt_urv

","I saw this movie for the first time on a premium channel, and bought the DVD shortly after. I also can't pass it up any time it's repeated on cable. I'll look forward the whole day to watching some program or another, but if I see that this movie is on, I'll forsake almost any other other program for it.",/review/rw1186641/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2005,Joejoesan,7," Where are Colin and Hugh when you need them?
","In 1995 the 5 hours miniseries of Pride & Prejudice, with Colin Firth as Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet, was a big hit in England and the Netherlands. It even inspired Helen Fielding to write the Bridget Jones's novels. Therefor, whether you'll like the new 2005 movie mainly depends on the fact if you've seen the version that was done ten years ago. If you have, you'll probably be very disappointed with the Knightly movie. If you haven't, well, maybe this romantic flick may be 'amiable' enough for you.",/review/rw1186641/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2005,screenwriter-14,9," PRIDE AND PREJUDICE...A Timeless Romantic Tale
",Keira Knightley brings magic to the screen from the first frame of the film as she reads a book and slowly walks back to the brick home of the Bennet family while ducks waddle about and clothes flap in the wind. Thus setting up the romantic location of the beautiful English country side and the magnificence of the great English homes which create a visual background for PRIDE AND PREJUDICE and in the development of all the characters which follow.,/review/rw1186641/?ref_=tt_urv

12 April 2006,nycritic,10," The Movie Version
","Whenever there is a version of a novel that has come to be accepted as the definitive one, making a new one brings the usual baggage as to ""will it live up to the expectations"" or ""will the lead actors symbolize the characters in the book"", among other ""will there-won't there"" questions and people will make the inevitable comparisons, if at all for the sake of the comparison itself.",/review/rw1186641/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2005,ab-2,10," Best film of the year 2005
","The period piece has never been a favorite film genre for reviewers. There have been excellent ones, such as Barry Lyndon and awful ones, such as Sense And Sensibility. Perhaps the worst quality is the tendency for these types of films to just stop and ponder. Pride & Prejudice is thankfully not that type, but will instead enter the pantheon of great period films.",/review/rw1186641/?ref_=tt_urv

14 October 2005,ysic2,1," What a shame.
","Sorry to say but was disappointed in the film. It was very very rushed, as I suppose you can understand a movie length version of Pride & Prejudice would be and I felt that a lot of the major scenes were glossed over just to get through the story. As the movie is so rushed, unfortunately you don't get to really know about and feel for each of the characters much at all. ",/review/rw1186641/?ref_=tt_urv

24 October 2005,evebay39,2," Minor errors? But Pride was constipation, they forgot Prejudice. And Austen come to that.

20 September 2005,mamlukman,9," See it!
","I saw this at the Toronto Inter. Film Festival. At first I thought, ""why yet another Pride and Prejudice?"" But I quickly changed my mind. Yes, the 1995 version was wonderful, and yes, you can develop characters a lot more in a miniseries. Let it go and judge this on its own terms.",/review/rw1186641/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2005,mercybell,10," Oft told tale made soulful, young
","I saw an advanced screening of this film in Boston and was very pleased, it is intelligent in its handle of the material and its fluency in cinematic crafting. Goodbye to dusty, ""precious"" interpretations of Jane Austen. This cheeky, poetic, even dark new film makes the story youthful with down-to-earth vibrancy and worship of emotion. Here are young people making the mistakes and dreaming the dreams of the young (when it was written it wasn't antiquity, it was life). Lizzie is not a smirking omniscient but a quick witted independent; hotheaded and fiercely loyal to her sister. She is wary of an unfair world and uses her wits to survive. Darcy is not an impenetrable stoic but a shy sensitive soul with high unwieldy social pretensions fending off the outside world. And they are both lonely and have big yearning hearts, so the filmmakers made one great decision -- they let them fall in love the first moment they lock eyes. In a shot we see hearts behind fortified personalities and an instant chemistry that takes a movie's worth of battling with each other and themselves to right itself. It's an earthy move that sets the tone for a film about the people and world behind the antiquated manners, a world not so different from ours. ",/review/rw1186641/?ref_=tt_urv
