24 November 2020,barob-51973,8," Why all the hate?
","Well I had a great review written but it was erased when I switched to another site to fact check some other movies.
What I wanted to say was this is a hard movie to watch. It's hard bc it's honest. We all have our struggles and this is another depiction of an honest struggle families have. In America we like to place labels. In this case the labels are hillbilly, red neck, or white trash. It's all true, but it doesn't mean that's bad. It means it's honest. It makes me think of other honest movies about American families like Crooklyn, Ordinary People or Kramer vs Kramer.
In this year of 2020 the word struggle comes up time and again, but let's not forget another truly American symbolic word .... perseverance. Watch this movie and know that if you're down and feel like the world is against you just keep fighting and persevere. I hope this movie can inspire that feeling. It did for me.",/review/rw6304481/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2020,PerryAtTheMovies,7," Everyone's Opinion is Different....
","I thought this film was a great drama that uses flashbacks of the past to explain what's running through J.D.'s mind as he tries to navigate university and his moms constant drug addiction. The acting was powerful all the way through. It has gripping emotions from start to finish that shows how bad you have to work, and to want something, to succeed when all the cards are stacked against you. Some may find this to be a ""woe is me"" kind of story, but I think it showed the never quitting spirit that Southerners have. Honestly, it's better than the professional critic reviews that I've read.",/review/rw6304481/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2020,Jac23443,8," Solid Movie...
","I honestly do not understand the harsh reviews, I watched this movie with low expectations because of what I'd read before going into it but I thought it was fantastic! I don't doubt this will get Amy Adams or Glenn Close a nomination for film awards, at the very least. This movie is definitely emotional and the performances will linger with you after you finish because it is vulnerability and it is weakness, and redemption, and perseverance, and helplessness all at once. Amy Adams is this whirlwind of drama that proves hostile to her family while she struggles with her drug addictions, her son having to cope with the lack of both parental figures with only his grandmother to be his guide and savior throughout his childhood. This movie really kind of gave a window into what addiction does to a person who neither can afford help, or is looking for it, and how complicated life can become. There were so many moments throughout the movie that could have forced Amy Adams' character to confront herself by letting her reap the consequences of her recklessness. But her family behaved like this cushion or a doormat, or a crutch for her misdeeds and drug addictions and the badness would become a cycle, a trend almost, an expected high with a certain inevitable low.",/review/rw6304481/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2020,lee_eisenberg,10," the thing about growing up in a dysfunctional poor family is that you never escape the drama
","Prior to watching ""Hillbilly Elegy"", I had read reviews calling it things like poverty porn, Oscar bait, and a missed opportunity to truly examine the characters. Ignore those descriptions. This is a look at how growing up in a dysfunctional poor family affects you for your entire life. Glenn Close's and Amy Adams's performances are like a brick in the face (and yes, I'd say that they both deserve Oscars for these intense roles). Definitely see it.",/review/rw6304481/?ref_=tt_urv

25 November 2020,eejohnston-56374,7," Definitely Uncomfortable but Don't Listen to the Critics
","Trying to figure out why the critics' score is so different from the user score and all I can think is because the former is detached from the reality of rural white poverty. Living and teaching in an area similar to where J.D. comes from, I see his struggle of trying to escape poverty through education and the impact of drug abuse on communities on a regular basis. It's easy to dismiss this as ""Oscar bait"" and it definitely is...but it's also a movie, though really difficult to watch at points, that tells the uncomfortable reality for far too many.",/review/rw6304481/?ref_=tt_urv

28 November 2020,lynnmgill,10," I grew up in "" Hillbilly Country"" ...THIS movie is SPOT ON !
",""" WHY the bad reviews?"" Someone asked. They thought it was good. Well written . Well directed and the actors were good. ( AND IT WAS ) Spot on .
Here is the reason they are some bad reviews. Some people have never experienced THIS life . They have no idea that people actually do LIVE LIKE THIS .
KUDOS to Ron Howard who also did not grow up in Hillbilly Country but did an excellent job of making this TRUE STORY so accurate on screen.
All the lead actors were amazing and they TRULY portrayed the people they were supposed to be in this.
One of my friends said they only part she didn't like was the CURSING .
"" Did they really need to use that language?"" She asked me .
Absolutely. THAT is normal language for these poor small towns .
If you grew up there you would understand that. F%$@$ was a word I heard as child as commonly as rich people hear "" yes sir"" . It was necessary for them accurately portray these people .
This movie made me cry , because it was TRUE TO LIFE . It brought back many memories for me . I lived this . I too chose to leave and "" be someone.""
Thank you Glen Close for portraying "" Meemaw"" so incredibly well .
I know . I had a Meemaw just like that .
THIS is a GREAT movie . And if you "" don't get it"" ... maybe it's because you were born with a SILVER SPOON in your mouth and it is probably STILL THERE.
Get out and see some of the REAL WORLD .",/review/rw6304481/?ref_=tt_urv

","Don't really understand about all the hates or jealousy here. I am a very picky individual when it comes to watching a movie too. However, I find this one very entertaining and outstanding among all those stupid CGI films that were released during the year. Couldn't be happier because this one just quench my thirst.",/review/rw6304481/?ref_=tt_urv

24 November 2020,bike4steak,7," As a kid from the South
","While I hoped this movie would be more well made then it was, it was still great to watch. It was nice to see a movie that felt very familiar, especially coming out on a big streaming platform like Netflix. They did a good job with this one. Glenn Close was amazing every second she was on camera, and definitely carried the film. The music was nice too, and the film feels very authentic. It might not be perfect, but Hillbilly Elegy should definitely pique anyone's curiosity and be able to hold on to them for the entirety of the film. Go watch it and decide.",/review/rw6304481/?ref_=tt_urv

15 January 2021,kosmasp,9," Childhood vs. Adulthood
","Just recently I watched a documentary about child abuse. And this fits right into this. Or fits the bill as some would say. Now it makes sense that this is also based on a true story. The actors in this are phenomenal. But I do understand people having issues with this. Starting with the already mentioned abuse. Mental and physical abuse that is. And for some maybe really tough to comprehend how someone would be that way. But there are explanations and even when others (and myself included) may think: don't do it, there seems now way that is helping anyone at all ... that does not take into account what the characters feels that moment. The love for ones mother can be quite big, even when others may think it is undeserved ... another similarity between this and the documentary.",/review/rw6304481/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2020,staciarose20,6," A harsh truth.
","In many ways things have not changed. The child abuse, drugs, poor education, etc. Massive struggles. These are still issues throughout the Appalachian Mountains, but they're also scattered everywhere else too. The only thing that differs is most kids in these situations don't end up at Yale.",/review/rw6304481/?ref_=tt_urv

27 November 2020,tms-60170,9," A Hillbilly's Review
","As a born and raised Kentucky girl, I could relate to this story. I was disgusted by the negative reviews from the media and Hollywood folks. It's obvious they know very little about poverty, family and all the trials of being poor white people.
We hear so much about race and how every white person is privileged, well this story proves that poor folks suffer and have suffered just as much as anyone.",/review/rw6304481/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2020,blanbrn,8," Raw and harsh look back at a rocky and tough hard upbringing.
","""Hillbilly Elegy"" based on a J.D. Vance memoir and well directed from Ron Howard is one brash, blunt and harrowing look thru flashback at a rural upbringing that helped influence and make one Yale law student. If one grew up in the rural South or Appalachian many can relate to many of the scenes of hollows, mountains, and just good loving country folk. Anyway the movie is a tale of upbringing and forming strong family bonds as this would shape one J.D. Vance from his Kentucky start thru Ohio living to his arrival at Yale law school till his meeting of his girlfriend Usha(Freida Pinto). Love is felt in the strongest and toughest form from Mamaw(in a transformative turn from Glenn Close) and the wild card of the family is J.D.'s mom the far out and eccentric Bev(Amy Adams) who battles her own personal demons of addiction. This picture does feel real and emotional as it's touching to show how family and a rough raising helped shape success and start a new journey in life.",/review/rw6304481/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2020,pronitmallick,6," The emotion didn't strike that much
",Hillbilly Elegy is a film that starts with a soothing vibe and goes on introducing all the characters. Pacing of the first arc goes smoothly but starts to feel kinda boring after some time. Right at the end of the first arc things start to feels repetitive where the story is just circling around the family drama. The film tries to strike us with all the emotional moments where sometimes it works fine but sometimes it doesn't. Amy Adams delivered a fine performance throughout the whole movie but in the end it wasn't enough to lift up a whole movie. overall it's a film that you can definitely watch for once.,/review/rw6304481/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2020,gideonzack,6," Great acting and a good story.
","These critics are ridiculous! This is a nice story, very well acted. Amy Adams and Glenn Close did a fantastic job. I found the first third to be a bit much, erratic and lots of yelling, but if you can get though that it's a rewarding film. It kind of grows on you over 2 hours and by the end you feel more connected to the characters. Overall 6/10.",/review/rw6304481/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2020,Cinesnatch,10," A Tearjerker Steeped in Americana Starring Two of the Greatest Working Actresses
","It's not often that filmmakers touch on subject matter which reveal greater truths about a neglected part of our society. Ron Howard digs into the forgotten dregs of Appalachian society and holds a mirror to the socioeconomic realities of an unnurturing environment and the fortitude, faith, and blind ""luck"" which is required to pull oneself out of a seemingly hopeless situation. Glenn Close--in a monumental role as a fierce, yet vulnerable matriarch--is no less than exceptional as a woman trying to raise her grandson to a better life. Amy Adams shows yet again what a dependable star she in the Hollywood constellation. Complete with carefully manicured visuals and a moving score, this is the event movie of the year.",/review/rw6304481/?ref_=tt_urv
