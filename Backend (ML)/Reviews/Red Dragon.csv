19 March 2021,TxMike,," It was the 1930s and the boy still dreamed of finding his father.
","There are several important characters but the story really revolves around two of them. Finn Cole plays 17-yr-old Eugene Evans, his dad was an alcoholic and left when Eugene was a small boy. Eugene got one postcard from his dad, praising the beaches on the Mexico Gulf Coast. As Eugene grew up with a stepdad he never lost his dreams of finding dad. In his dreamland.",/review/rw6285599/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2021,shawnmikedryer,8," Beautifully shot coming of age tale
","This love story is set during one of the toughest times of our history, The Great Depression. It follows Eugene Evans, a young man struggling to find his place in the world with big dreams to live a life of adventure. When the news hits of a bank robbery nearby with one of the fugitives on the run, this peaks Eugene's interest being that the fugitive has a large bounty for her capture. As fate would have it shortly after Eugene discovers the fugitive, Allison Wells, had taken refuge in his family's garage with a gunshot wound. Allison's nature is infectious and with the growing attraction and chemistry between the two Eugene becomes torn on how to proceed, claiming the bounty or breaking bad.

12 November 2020,ferguson-6,6," outlaw on the run
","Greetings again from the darkness. Outlaws on the run have been fertile ground for movies over the years, and young director Miles Joris-Peyrafitte and writer Nicolas Zwart give the genre their best shot (pun intended). The easiest comparisons are probably Sam Peckinpah's THE GETAWAY (1972), Jonathan Demme's SOMETHING WILD (1986), and Arthur Penn's Oscar nominated classic BONNIE AND CLYDE (1969). However, given the style of this film, Terrence Malick's BADLANDS (1973) was likely more of an influence for the filmmakers.",/review/rw6285599/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2021,andreascaloni,7," GOOD MOVIE WITH GREAT PERFORMANCES
",Dreamland is about a teen bounty hunter that is torn between helping or capturing a seductive fugitive bank robber hiding in his small town during the Great Depression. The movie is a well made drama with an interesting direction. There are two great performances from Margot Robbie and Finn Cole. Dreamland isn't always gripping but it is still a good and entertaining ride.,/review/rw6285599/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie isn't bad at all... stop please to give reversed ratings! Referring to 2019 movies for example Shazam! Has 7 and this one 5,8.... It's ridiculous.

20 November 2020,shresthadavid,7," Rare and underrated
","I don't know why meaningful movies like this gets so low ratings and low popularity these days while some big label Sci fi and stupid unrealistic superhero movies get huge attention for nothing. This movie, if you watch it carefully and with a little patience, goes straight to your heart and leaves you with a blend of emotions which you can't put into words easily. Yeah its somewhat slow paced and has some flaws throughout the story. But, movies like this ones are rare to find these days.",/review/rw6285599/?ref_=tt_urv

28 November 2020,nogodnomasters,6," There is no one in the barn
","The story centers on Eugene Evans (Finn Cole) growing up on a dirt and dirt storm farm in very rural Bismark, Texas. He was abandoned by his real father and his mother remarried the deputy who had a daughter. She narrates as an adult, hence we know she doesn't die. Eugene likes crime and detective stories. Allison Wells (Margot Robbie) is a bank robber also wanted for murder. Like Bonnie and Clyde and Harley Quin, she is out to stick it to the man. Eugene discovers her shot and in the family barn with a price on her head.",/review/rw6285599/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2022,JackBluegrass,8," Taking us back to Hollywood's Golden Era...
","Taking second place to acting here, this recent movie blew me away with its continuous creative and stunning photography, coupled with very talented editing. That pairing gave us an example of modern-day imaging, that is as brilliant as that pairing in Hollywood classics of the 1930s-40s, with that era's breathtaking arts and sciences. This somewhat often-told story has been boosted dramatically........by filmmaking! I was not aware of cinematographer Lyle Vincent's photography before this. But I'll be on the lookout on IMDB for other movies he has made.",/review/rw6285599/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2019,ayoreinf,9," This should be the launching pad of some brilliant careers
","I had hard time believing Mile Joris-Peyrafitte, the director of this brilliant film and Nicolaas Zwart, its script writer have done so little so far. Even Lyle Vincent who's responsible for the amazing cinematography of this move has a relatively short CV. It doesn't show, in fact it looks like the job of some old masterful veteran of the trade. When this superlative trio combines with Margot Robbie, who has already proved herself on screen many times in the last few years and with Finn Cole, Travis Fimmel Kerry Condon and the very promising Darby Camp (who's career is already longer than some of the other names I mentioned here). What we get is simply a very good movie that should serve as launching pad of many Hollywood careers.",/review/rw6285599/?ref_=tt_urv

","The actors are very good, but the story of the film was not interesting. It is strange that during the film, Margo Robbie could not even walk due to a foot injury, but in the last sequence, the sequence in the forest, she somehow escaped as if she were a track and field champion.ðŸ˜„",/review/rw6285599/?ref_=tt_urv

27 February 2021,zardoz-13,5," Wannabe ""Bonnie & Clyde""
","The 1930s' era, Dust Bowl Depression, couples-in-crime saga ""Dreamland"" evokes better memories of Arthur Penn's ""Bonnie & Clyde"" (1967), a tragic take on the two star-crossed lovers who terrorized Texas until authorities mowed them down in a fusillade of gunfire. The difference between director Miles Joris-Peyrafitte's ""Dreamland"" and Penn's classic is the roles of the desperadoes have been reversed. Allison Wells (Margot Robbie of ""Suicide Squad"") is a hard-boiled heroine who shares more in common with Clyde Barrow than Bonnie Parker. Eugene Baker (Finn Cole of ""Slaughterhouse Rulez"") is the wide-eyed youth who marvels at Allison's bad reputation. A hopeless romantic, Eugene is more like Bonnie, because he sees the world through rose-colored glasses. The two embark on a short-lived crime spree. One survives and the other dies. Basically, ""Dreamland"" amounts to a nightmare more than a fantasy. Like some arthouse movies that defy expectations, ""Dreamland"" complicates its storyline with an adult narrator, Eugene's half-sister Phoebe (Darby Camp of 2018's ""Benji""), but she is twenty years older now and romanticizes the plight of her ill-fated brother. Actress Lola Kirke provides Phoebe's adult voice. The interesting thing about her narration is its inconsistency. Phoebe couldn't have been around to witness some of Eugene and Allison's shenanigans. Meantime, this narration is reminiscent of Terence Mallick's archetypal crime couple epic ""Badlands"" (1973) where Sissy Spacek voiced over the events that she participated in with Martin Sheen. Freshman scenarist Nicolaas Zwart of TV's ""Riverdale"" and director Miles Joris-Peyrafitte break up the film's realism with fantasy in a compelling fashion. Essentially, nothing goes right for anybody, and everybody lies to each other. Presumably, Margot Robbie-who starred in as well as produced ""Dreamland""-was drawn to the material, because it gave her a chance to stretch herself as an actress. The ""Harley Quinn"" star is not plain Jane enough to pass for a plausible desperado. Too beautiful for her own good, Robbie lacks the required abrasive edge. Mind you, she gives a good account of herself, but she doesn't behave like a murderous maven.",/review/rw6285599/?ref_=tt_urv

18 February 2021,westsideschl,2," Poor History
","Another Bonnie & Clyde non-creative rewrite. Robbing banks during the Great Depression of the '30s only this time the film's hooks are two poorly acting, but physically attractive baddies. Historically the only accuracy was in a CGI dust storm amid drought stricken plains' crop lands. Oddly, in the beginning narration says this takes place in Bismarck, most famously in North Dakota, but a few seconds later everyone is in Texas. Lots of script holes such as people coincidentally showing up at the same place despite the vastness. We lack of background on all but our main character, especially what transpires during the important robbery especially the money. And, no gas stations for vehicles that get 14mpg (can't go far on that). Ending is weird fantasy not fitting anything in the script.",/review/rw6285599/?ref_=tt_urv
