22 August 2016,Leofwine_draca,8," Nearly great
","For most of the running time, 99 HOMES is an exemplary thriller. It's always a delight when you find a film detailing a subject matter that's not been covered very much in film before and the financial crash of 2008 is the topic here, in particularly the glut of ill-conceived sub-prime mortgages in America that led to the worldwide recession. The film follows the fortunes of a real estate broker who makes a living from evicting people from their homes.",/review/rw3332437/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2015,subxerogravity,7," The intense drama was increased by it being about recent events and well acted.
","Micheal Shannon really controls the screen when he's on it. He plays villain well, especially well in this film, showing both sides of the coin.",/review/rw3332437/?ref_=tt_urv

29 August 2016,funkyfry,6," Solid performances boost mediocre storytelling
","I really wanted to like ""99 Homes."" I didn't hate it, but it is far from perfect. The skinny: Andrew Garfield is a construction worker who loses his home to foreclosure, unable to find work. He has to move with his young son (Noah Lomax) and mother (Laura Dern) into a hotel on skid row, but through a twist of fate find himself working for the man who evicted him (Michael Shannon). As he gets involved deeper in various real estate scams, his sense of morals has to be balanced against his need to provide for his family.",/review/rw3332437/?ref_=tt_urv

","Dennis Nash (Andrew Garfield) lives in Orlando, Florida with his mother Lynn (Laura Dern) and son Connor. He's a single dad struggling to get by with his construction job when the housing crash takes the last bit away from him. The bank has foreclosed on his childhood home. Realty agent Rick Carver (Michael Shannon) leads the eviction. Dennis goes to argue over stolen tools during the eviction and Rick recruits him into his company. Rick runs scams to steal from the vacant homes to get reimbursed by the government or the banks. Dennis' morality is muddled as he desperately tries to get his home back.",/review/rw3332437/?ref_=tt_urv

","I think most of America was impacted in at least some capacity by the 2008 economic crisis/crash. Obviously, the housing market was hit the hardest and really at the forefront of the situation. 99 Homes tells the story of a single father who still lives with his mother in his childhood home having to deal with an eviction and the unexpected events that follow.

","Say what you want about America but money is a very big part of our society. It's a free-for-all pursuit of money and it so helps with having a good family background. If you can't afford college to get your degree or don't have a career after high school, you are on your own.

","99 Homes did received several backlash due to controversy which caused the film to do poorly at the box office, and many of the trailers were not as put as what they needed to be. However, the film has been praised by many majority critics for its daring subject matter and overall tenacious acting (Andrew Garfield delivers a strong performance).

10 February 2016,larrys3,9," Another Searing & Powerful Bahrani Film
","I'm a huge fan of filmmaker Ramin Bahrani, and I found his latest offering a searing and powerful film. Set in Florida, in 2010, at the height of the foreclosure crisis and the Great Recession, this can be a most difficult movie to watch at times, not only due to the heart- rending subject matter, but also due to Bahrani's incredible way of presenting the stark reality of the human condition and human behavior.",/review/rw3332437/?ref_=tt_urv

10 January 2016,paul2001sw-1,5," An unconvincing portrait of society and capitalism
","'99 homes' could have been an interesting film, a dramatic take on the foreclosure crisis that struck Florida after the financial crisis of 2008. But it's a hard story to dramatise, and the movie fails to offer us clarity on what was actually going on. There's a film that could have been made, for example, about the harshness of capitalism, a system that produces winners and losers, but also a system that has been quite effective in raising living standards as a whole. There's a film about how unscrupulous people exploit gaps in the law to profit off other's misfortune. And there's also a story how the only way the poor may have earn a living is to perpetuate the very system that restricts the options of people like themselves. But trying to tie the three together into a single dramatic narrative gives us a story that is just too neat to be credible: a man loses his home, finds work evicting others, and is even offered the chance to become rich himself (for reasons that do not seem altogether persuasive) by the exploitative businessman who hires him. Yet overall the film is the poor attack on capitalism: what are we supposed to do, let people stay live in houses they can't pay for, just because someone once (wrongly) gave them an out-sized mortgage? Refuse to take the only jobs that will feed our families because we suspect our boss is a shark? The personalised moral conundrums presented by the film are in fact poor illustrations for the mundane dilemmas of life. Capitalism is a system, with its own resilience and (short of deciding to ferment violent revolution) the relationship between an individual's choices and the shape of society is indirect and obscure. I found it hard to understand what the take-home message of this movie was supposed to be, except that there are fundamentally good guys, and bad ones, in the world â€“ which doesn't really provide much insight into how systems can go wrong, and destroy the lives of the individuals who participate in them in the process.",/review/rw3332437/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2015,watkins-29879,5," It was an enjoyable movie to watch but the ending ruined it
",Short and simple. The movie was entertaining the whole way through. Only two parts I didn't like was the mom flipping out and the ending. How can you get that mad at your son and take his kid away. He did what he had to do to help his family survive. I just felt the mom was being ungrateful. I'm also pretty positive that his son would of become excited and jumped in that pool. Any kid at that age would be excited for a swimming pool. The ending was also pretty lame. I mean why end Soprano style. I feel like I wasted my time watching this movie because there really is no ending. Anything could of happened as it ended. If I would of known how it ends before watching I probably wouldn't of watched. So if your like me maybe this review will stop you from wasting time on what could have been a great movie. Movie was an 8 for me up until the end.,/review/rw3332437/?ref_=tt_urv

13 February 2016,pc95,8," Simple and Focused
","(spoilers) Director Ramin Bahrani scores a hit with ""99 Homes"", a simple and focused tale of greed and avarice. A good cast including Andrew Garfield, Laura Dern, and Michael Shannon (indulging himself in another villain) backs up great direction. What works so well is the apparent investigation of the origins of avarice - indeed being unable to cope and losing your home which so many equate to identity and thrust into foreign, public, and poor conditions. In this tale combining need, shame, and lies Bahrani deftly creates one of the better movies to come out in 2015. The lead character is entranced by the siren song of greed despite all his shame and own experience. Well worth a watch. Recommended 7.5/10",/review/rw3332437/?ref_=tt_urv

6 August 2022,nanettemeau,8," Very good til end
",The movie could have been a bit more joyful I think towards the end and I didn't care for the mother's enmeshed relationship with her son. I didn't see much wrong with the house that was purchased for his mother and son. I realize the message is about be nice to those who are being evicted. Although the reality is there are some pretty s***** people who are irresponsible and who are bad tenants and there are squatters. The movie doesn't tell the whole picture of what really goes on. It's not black and white. In other words being a successful realtor or wealthy person does not mean you are the bad guy necessarily. The other side of the coin is that not all people who are being evicted are good people.,/review/rw3332437/?ref_=tt_urv

9 October 2015,dave-mcclain,1," ""99 Homes"" offers at least that many reasons not to see it.
","Let me save you some time and money. Please pay attention because I'm not going to repeat all this as often as the movie does: Government programs are scams , banks are uncaring institutions, real estate brokers are evil and homeowners who can't pay their mortgages are stupid, but innocent victims of the system and are sometimes prone to violence. There. Now you don't have to see ""99 Homes"" (R, 1:52). You now know all there really is to know about the presumptions in writer-director Ramin Bahrani's anti-business, anti-government drama. The movie does have a few things going for it, but not many.",/review/rw3332437/?ref_=tt_urv
