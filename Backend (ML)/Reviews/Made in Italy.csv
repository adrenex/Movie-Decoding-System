22 September 2003,jaywolfenstien,," Street Fighter Correction
","Following up the spectacular disaster of competing fighting game turned movie, Mortal Kombat succeeded where Street Fighter failed.  Not a fantastic movie nor one that goes in my top ten, but Mortal Kombat (without a doubt) is one of the better game-based-films.",/review/rw6876361/?ref_=tt_urv

3 July 2010,thesar-2,2," Mortal is right...No one's human with this evidence of crud.
","Terrible CGI. Awful Acting. Clichéd plot. Predictable storyline. Cardboard characters. Disgustingly bad dialogue. Doesn't do 2-player video game justice. And worst of all – it's a comedy but doesn't know it; I laughed so hard during this movie it was as if this was directed by M. Night Shyamalan. Furthermore, I have yet to see The Last Airbender, but I can imagine this 15-year-old movie mirrors M. Night's most recent failure.",/review/rw6876361/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2021,impressivesgirl-37857,5," Not as good as the game obviously
","Honestly I thought the 2021 one is pretty bad but then I played this one and it is definitely a lot worse than I remember it. I used to like this one but the execution is just bad. No back story, no explanation, no consistency, bad costumes. The characters are lacking depth and their general vibe from the game is completely absent - they are not menacing (except for Shan) and interesting enough as it was in the games. Wtf were these ridiculous fight scenes?! And what happened to Kitana's hot outfit? At least I absolutely love the bad ass theme song - reminds me of the childhood.",/review/rw6876361/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2021,JoelChamp85,9," Love It
","This is how you make a MK video game into a film. The sets looked straight out of the game, the characters had proper appeal to them, and it didn't waste time on unnecessary story. The lighting and camera work looked awesome, even with some of the cheesy matte paintings and early cgi it still destroys the 2021 version. The corniness just makes this film great.",/review/rw6876361/?ref_=tt_urv

",Director Anderson pretty much ripped off the whole Enter the Dragon plot since it shares so much with the actual game to make this movie. No need to work the brain over with that. I had absolutely no expectations for the movie being it is a game so I guess that is what is keeping me from giving this a zero.,/review/rw6876361/?ref_=tt_urv

31 October 2000,CuriosityKilledShawn,6," Paul Anderson's only good movie.
","I've always believed that video-games will never make good movies. But Warner don't seem to understand what a goldmine they're sitting on when it comes to Mortal Kombat. The franchise has so many characters, complex back-stories, and mythology that it honestly dwarfs the X-Men. There is a huge amount of potential in Mortal Kombat. This juvenile 1995 effort only scratches the surface of that potential, but still manages to be an enjoyable no-brainer.",/review/rw6876361/?ref_=tt_urv

","Mortal Kombat is a terrific game.Mortal Kombat is a crappy movie.There is no way this movie could've been any cheesier.The game is bloody,violent,and for mature gamers.The movie is watered down,badly choreographed,and full of bad special effects.The game has creative characters with cool costumes.The movie has boring,lame,goofy characters, and costumes that look like they were bought at K-Mart.The game has a neat plot and a interesting story.The movie has no plot and no story what so ever.This movie is a ridiculous excuse for an adaptation.It is as fun as watching a donkey in the middle of a poo.

29 June 2015,jimbo-53-186511,3," It has the requisite amount of noise and special effects, but much like those that fall foul of Shang Tsung Mortal Kombat has no soul
","I used to love playing Mortal Kombat when I was a kid back in the 1990's and remember watching this film version many years ago. I decided to rekindle my lost youth by watching this film version. I was hoping for a fun, distracting piece of nonsense that would be entertaining but forgettable at the same time. Well it was forgettable alright, but not what I would call entertaining...",/review/rw6876361/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2003,Theo Robertson,3," Computer Games Should Not Be Made Into Movies
","I know there`s a ready made market for films based on computer games but shouldn`t film makers also cater for people who have never played the game ? Why not make a film based on a video game with an involving storyline , and decent acting and half decent fight scenes with real martial arts stars ? , at least that way you`ll appeal to a wider market . All these things are missing from this film version of MORTAL KOMBAT . In fact it`s so bad that it doesn`t feel like a film based on a computer game but more like aa advert for a  film based on a computer game . Weird huh ?",/review/rw6876361/?ref_=tt_urv

","I did enjoy this and the sequel as a kid, but now that I've played the ultra badass MK9 and MKX, I look back on the movies and I really think that they should've been Rated R with all the extreme gore and fatalities unleashed, I mean, seriously, how are you gonna adapt a game known for its gore and fatalities and tone it down to a PG-13 just to please younger viewers?, that's just being a sell out and a wimp. I'm really glad that the third movie koming out next year will be Rated a hardcore R with ALL the EXTREME gore and fatalities UNLEASHED, THAT is how a mortal kombat movie should be done, NOT watered down and sissified for younger viewers",/review/rw6876361/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2021,ubtgkse,4," Sucktality, Paul Anderson fails, flawless disappointment
","While some fan service is ok, some performances are fun (linden Ashby, Cary Hiroyuki tagawa) and the theme song is awesome, this is garbage. The effects are a joke, the fights are mediocre, the pg-13 rating is just one big WTF, the story is boring and generic, the jokes are not funny, and the effects (with the exception of goro) are pathetic. Terrible movie, waste of time. Just play the games and the 2021 movie.",/review/rw6876361/?ref_=tt_urv

9 September 2015,anaconda-40658,2," Video Game Trash.
","Mortal Kombat (1995): Dir: Paul Anderson / Cast: Robin Shou, Christopher Lambert, Bridgette Wilson, Talisa Soto, Linden Ashby: Video game film about the measures and extremes that the body can accept pain. It assembles a bunch of colourful warriors to do nothing more than kick each other's asses. It seems to me that society is headed in that direction. One can only stroll by a local high school for bully spotting. The villain sucks the souls out of his victims because he is tired of collecting baseball cards. Another moron shoots sharp objects from his palms for that quick and easy ear pierce. The visual effects are the prime sell because acting is horrible with dumb dialogue consisting of grunts and groans as if visiting a busy washroom. Director Paul Anderson could have made this film cheap using high school bullies and Halloween costumes. It might have even been more entertaining. Actors include Christopher Lambert, Bridgette Wilson, Robin Shou, and Talisa Soto among others and their prime function is to see how far they can put their foot up someone's anal track. Linden Ashby plays Johnny Cage who is apparently an actor out to prove his skills are real. Is he for real? They have the ability of ripping their opponent's insides out after yelling, ""Fatality!"" Someone should pull the reel of this lousy film so viewers can be spared the biggest fatality. Score: 2 / 10",/review/rw6876361/?ref_=tt_urv

3 May 2021,cardsrock,5," Fatality!
","There's some fun nostalgia here, but honestly not much else. The CGI has aged very poorly and acting/writing is pretty poor. The fact they used the actual MK music is dope though and definitely amps up the fun factor. If you take this film for what it is, a nostalgic mid 90s video game adaptation, you can find some amount of entertainment.",/review/rw6876361/?ref_=tt_urv
