19 August 2009,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,8," Refreshing and affirming
","My jaw is still aching, almost an hour and a half after the credits rolled. I don't recall when I last laughed this consistently and heartfelt at a new production. Yes, this is pretty formulaic stuff... if you've seen one mismatched couple romantic comedy, you've seen them all. This never claimed to be anything other than that. It definitely delivers what one expects from the genre, without any of it being phoned in or taken any less seriously. Not every film needs to revolutionize the craft, and shape cinema for decades to come. If everything was excellent, it would become the norm, and it would cease to be special. And I find it incredible and immensely positive that a movie with this kind of humor(observational, and largely derived from typical situations that happen to everyone) can still be made, and be nicely received. Humiliation and pain are not actually funny. They get a schadenfreude reaction, ""thank goodness that didn't happen to me"", and thus we move further apart, isolate ourselves all the more. This does the opposite, letting us get closer to each other, share the little things that we've forgotten are silly or ""off"" in our everyday lives. It does go a tad too far on occasion, to get the audience going, but those instances are few in number. The acting is great all-round, and the two leads have chemistry, and play off each other well. There are countless memorable sequences, jokes and gags in this. This contains ""moments"" between Bullock and Reynolds, as well, and they genuinely work. You feel for them. The characters are just about invariably well-written, interesting and credible. In general, the script is well-done. The music is pleasant and well-chosen. This ought to entertain nearly everyone, of any age. There is a little strong and/or risqué language, and a couple of usually mild sexual references, and this tends to be inoffensive. I recommend this to all who think they may enjoy it. Chances are that you're right. 8/10",/review/rw2096603/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2009,Dragoneyed363,8," A fun and excellently done comedy
","Okay, I had been really excited to see The Proposal ever since it came out. I was hyping it up a lot when I knew it wasn't going to be a masterpiece, but I just love Sandra Bullock and Betty White and couldn't wait to get my hands on this film! When I did, it definitely lived up to my expectations.",/review/rw2096603/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2009,therunner42,7," A fun way to spend an afternoon
","The Proposal isn't going to win any Oscars, nor will it become your favourite movie of all time. However, it does exactly what it is supposed to do; that is to entertain you. The Proposal is the story of a tough editor Margaret Tate (Bullock) who forces her assistant Andrew Tate (Ryan Reynolds) to marry her so she can stay in the U.S. (Interestingly, in the movie Bullock plays a Canadian and Reynolds an American while in real life, the reverse is true). What happens next will not surprise viewers but they will get many laughs along the way. Reynolds and Bullocks are very funny and also very believable. Betty White (from the Golden Girls) almost steals the show as Andrew's 90 year old ""Gammy"". The beautiful Alaskan setting doesn't hurt things either. Overall this is not a unique movie or even a unique role for Bullock but it is a very funny (and fun) way to spend an afternoon.",/review/rw2096603/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2009,jmbellin,6," Decent Proposal
","Well, if I could split the movie into two, I would say that the first half is a superb Proposal and the second half is fairly traditional Hollywood pablum. In the first half, the wonderful comedic timing and chemistry between Bullock and Reynolds was terrific. The writing was first-rate intellectual, snappy sparring, even throwing in some literary references in the put-downs. Kudos to the Director, Anne Fletcher, and the Screenwriter, Pete Chiarelli.",/review/rw2096603/?ref_=tt_urv

19 October 2009,EUyeshima,6," Starts Off with Snap and Verve But Moves Soon Enough Into Predictable Rom-Com Territory
","Even though it so clearly apes the set-up of David Frankel's ""The Devil Wears Prada"", I think the first 25 minutes of this 2009 romantic comedy has genuine snap enhanced by the sharp comedy interplay between stars Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Once the story leaves the Manhattan publishing house for the pastoral wilderness of Alaska, the story reverts into a formulaic sitcom bearing more than a passing resemblance to Bullock's break-out vehicle, 1995's ""While You Were Sleeping"", including an escalation of comic deceptions and a heart-tugging wedding confessional. Give credit to the fortyish actress/producer for not giving in too much to standard ingénue behavior this time. In fact, she plays the alpha dog with Reynolds relegated to the traditional leading lady role. The result produces enough contrived shenanigans to please Bullock's die-hard fans thanks to by-the-numbers work by director Anne Fletcher (""27 Dresses"") and first-time screenwriter Pete Chiarelli.",/review/rw2096603/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2009,CSHaviland,7," Charming though Predictable
","Most charming Sandra Bullock movie since While You Were Sleeping, though quite a bit more predictable. (Anyone who knows the general premise can guess how the movie is going to play out.) But it was funny and sweet, and if you need to choose something to take your wife/girlfriend to, choose this one.",/review/rw2096603/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2010,TheLittleSongbird,8," Predictable but fun comedy, helped by the strong performances and some truly beautiful scenery
","I saw The Proposal last Saturday with some friends, and all of us were very impressed with the film. Of course the plot is gentle, yet very predictable, and I did feel the writers could have developed Margaret's dominance over Andrew more. Still, it is very well done. One definite plus was the strong performances from Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds, Bullock especially gave one of her better performances in years. The two share a real chemistry and some good comic timing that was really refreshing to see. Out of the supporting cast, who all did very solid work Oscar Nunez deserves mention for his hilarious portrayal as the handyman, it is Betty White a delightful and very underrated actress who steals the show as the matriarch who thinks marriage is preachy. The Proposal is further advantaged by some truly breathtaking Alaskan scenery. It was so beautiful to watch, and perfectly captured by the skillful cinematography. The direction from Anne Fletcher is very nice, and the film is snappily written with some genuinely funny moments. There were some parts in the more slower and subtle parts that I felt tears welling up too. All in all, very well done for a comedy, predictable it is but it is fun too. 8/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2096603/?ref_=tt_urv

20 June 2009,Chris Knipp,5," No laughs in Alaska
","The moment when pushy boss Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) suddenly forces her unsuspecting, docile, but ever-so-hunky young assistant Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) to tell her superiors they're to be married so she won't be deported back to her native Canada, there's a certain awkward amusement. But it's more in the way Ryan Reynolds plays it than the situation, as written -- our unease, and the actor's. If there is such a thing as ""reality,"" this ain't it. What's a Ken-doll type like Ryan Reynolds doing in a job like this? The answer is, waiting for this moment. Otherwise, if you had the sort of guy who might really be doing this sort of job, you wouldn't have a romantic comedy, and that's what the makers of the elaborately lame The Proposal are reaching for.",/review/rw2096603/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2009,Simon_Says_Movies,6," Hard to admire, easy to enjoy
","The Proposal is a hard film not to enjoy but it's an even harder film to admire. Aside from the two exceptional lead performances from Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock and the humour they create, the story is dowsed in clichés and left to drown. I need a film to at least be thoroughly realistic if not authentic, and the tired screenplay often delves into slapstick and camp when it should have let the leads carry the film.",/review/rw2096603/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2009,Smells_Like_Cheese,1," Why would you do this to people?
","My best friend, God, I love her, we've been friends for 10 years, she's been there for me through everything as I've been there for her, I would crawl through broken glass to get her a birthday gift wait, that doesn't sound so healthy. But I do love the girl, however, what the heck did I do to her to be punished this badly when she begged me to see The Proposal? See, I don't get it, we have a ""romantic comedy"" script, no one changes anything, just the actors, every cliché in the book and somehow people fall for it. There is a needle in a haystack when it comes to a romantic comedy being actually funny or entertaining, but with the positive reviews that the IMDb users had been writing, I was actually thinking maybe this might be a good movie YOU IMDb USERS, how dare you?! Shame on you that you fell for it once again, I'm going to point out how my puppy could have written this script after I tell you the story, even though I'm sure you can figure it out for yourself.",/review/rw2096603/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2020,akcenat,8," Amusing, enjoyable and predictable rom-com perfection even in 2020
","""The Proposal"" (2009) is basically a fun, family romantic comedy even in 2020. Chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds makes the movie one of the above average rom-coms. The supporting casting is brilliant, especially Betty White, because she does practically steals her scenes from anyone she is involved with. Ultimately, the story is a bit over the top and simplistic while ""The Proposal"" offers little surprises and is one of those movies where you know what's going to happen but, the lovable cast and the random laughs make it a fun and fluffy pick for a relaxing family treat in front of TV during corona pandemic because it's not a bad way to spend a couple of hours.",/review/rw2096603/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2009,claudio_carvalho,7," Delightful Entertainment
","In New York, the Canadian Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) is the successful self-made chief-editor of the Ruick & Hunt Publishing and loathed by her coworkers. Margaret lost her parents when she was sixteen and is tough with the employees of the office. Her executive assistant and aspirant editor Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) has been working with her for three years without any recognition. When Margaret has problems with the immigration due to an expired visa and is threatened of deportation, she blackmails Andrew to accept to marry her; in return, he would be promoted to editor and she would publish his book. Meanwhile, the skeptical clerk of the immigration department Mr. Gilbertson (Denis O'Hare) schedules an interview with Margaret and Andrew after the weekend. The couple travels to Sitka, Alaska, to celebrate the ninetieth anniversary of Andrew's grandmother in their real estate and Margaret is welcomed by his warming family. Along the weekend, she gets closer to Andrew's family that asks her to marry Andrew in their barn, since it is a tradition in the Paxton family. And the tension increases when Mr. Gilbertson appears out of the blue in Sitka promising to charge Andrew for fraud.",/review/rw2096603/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2009,Jackpollins,4," Entertaining, but not good
","This is yet another predictable romantic comedy. The only difference is that Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock make it tolerable, and even a little entertaining. Ryan Reynolds stars as Andrew Paxton, a servant to Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock). They hate each other. But when Margaret figures out she's being deported since she's not an American citizen she turns to Andrew. They say they are getting married. Andrew's Grandma Annie (Betty White, the best part of the film) is turning 90, so they go to Alaska, where Annie and Andrew's parents live. We then enter the cliché parents. Grace (Mary Steenburgen), his wacky mother, and Joe (Craig T. Nelson), his uptight dad. This is not very entertaining. The laughs mostly come from Ryan Reynolds' calm personality. He just has a way of making me entertained. There's also Oscar Nunez, who plays Oscar on TV's The Office, playing Ramone. He will remind you of an aspect of Local Hero. This is not a good movie, but it might just be worth renting just for the mild entertainment. On second thought, you can just skip it.",/review/rw2096603/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2009,Danusha_Goska,3," Cast: First Rate. Script: A Crime
","""The Proposal"" has a stellar cast and a suicidal script. The script begins brilliantly: Margaret (Sandra Bullock) a master-of-the-universe publishing exec who also happens to be very beautiful, has a younger, very sexy assistant – Andrew (Ryan Reynolds) – whom she forces to marry her because her visa has expired and she's about to be deported. Sandra Bullock is fabulously, convincingly, hateful in her opening scenes. She makes the Meryl Streep character from ""The Devil Wears Prada"" look like a shar-pei puppy in comparison. You really want to see this character put through the wringer, that is, to grow and change in response to challenging events. Ryan Reynolds is, as ever, handsome, suave, understated, smart, and a very interesting actor. As buff as he is here, and he is very buff, (preparing for the lead in the next X-Man sequel) it's Reynolds' intelligence and acting chops that are most arresting. Reynolds is as good as the romantic comedy leads from the Golden Age; he just needs the right script to be part of a classic. The rest of the cast, with the exception of an obnoxious stripper who should have been left on the cutting room floor, is similarly brilliant: Mary Steenburgen, Craig T. Nelson, Denis O'hare and especially Betty White are all solid professionals who've been fantastic in other movies.",/review/rw2096603/?ref_=tt_urv

23 December 2016,sscarito,10," Romantic Comedy Yet With A Unique Touch and True Chemistry
","This movie surprised me, I have to say. While I did expect to be entertained, I did not expect to find a new favorite movie. What started out as watching it since my friend yelled at me, turned into me loving every moment of the movie. With characters that are both attractive in personality and looks, this movie stays on the track of the plot-line and has loads of character development. Each scene is planned carefully, and chemistry between the two is seen at the very start. The movie is in no way slow, and compliments it's attributes quite nicely. There was no moments where I believe the movie fell short. Their comedic scenes definitely cracked me up, which is very tough to do. Overall, I loved this movie, and I think it was done very nicely. I found myself watching a couple scenes over and over.",/review/rw2096603/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2009,j_lara_mendez,7," It was sweet
","Although the movie is predictable, like most romance comedies are, nevertheless it was sweet. Sure a bit unrealistic in terms of the time line of the whole plot takes place but this is why we have movies like this, so you can escape into the fantasy of romance and humor. If you are looking for realism then watch a 3 hour drama, but if you want to escape for awhile and just enjoy a movie you don't have to think too much about then it's worth your time. If you don't want to pay to go see it in the theater, then wait for it to come out on DVD. I saw it during a private screening as part of the ATL Film Festival, for close to two hours I thought of nothing else and laughed and even cried a bit. I would definitely see it again. It may not be the best romantic comedy I have seen but the movie still holds lots of charm.",/review/rw2096603/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2022,Paragon240,7," Had to see it a second time to be convinced, but The Proposal is a top-shelf rom-com!
","When I first saw this movie in theaters back when it came out, I was not impressed. But after rewatching it, I'm still trying to remember what I didn't like! I was laughing out loud and feeling my heartstrings pulled the entire time. The dog and eagle scene had me rolling! Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds are both romantic comedy veterans that prove their skills with the genre in this film. Reynold's quick wit and Bullock's physical comedy perfectly complement each other. The supporting cast and unique twist on the awkwardly forced marriage concept elevate this movie a little further, making The Proposal one of the best of its genre.",/review/rw2096603/?ref_=tt_urv
