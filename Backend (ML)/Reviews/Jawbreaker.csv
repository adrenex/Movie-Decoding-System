20 August 2022,cliftonofun,7," If it bleeds...
","Confession: I'm the guy who watched the original Predator way too many times thanks to the magic of VHS...but then never watched a single sequel afterwards. As far as I'm concerned ""Predator"" = jungles and body butter. So I fully admit that I have limited context here. That said, this movie kicked butt. I cared way more about Naru and her brother (not to mention her dog) than I did about anybody in the original. I found the cinematagrophy breathtaking, I found the characters compelling, and I'm kind of all in on seeing what happens when we transport modern franchises into different historical/cultural contexts. Plus, the callbacks were delightful. Nobody's going to give this movie an Oscar, but I'd rather watch a story like this than most movies with capes and poorly staged action sequences. I was sucked in from moment one, and Amber Midthunder completely captivated me for the whole runtime. It's nice to know that movies like this can still surprise me, not to mention make me stand up and cheer.",/review/rw8402457/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2022,gogoschka-1,," Review Of 'Prey'
","I didn't hate this movie but I thought the writing was very sloppy, considering the fantastic premise offered so much potential. Sorry if I start to ramble, but it really bugs me when I believe a film could have been greatly improved with a few tweaks of the script. So my problems are as follows (please hear me out - and excuse such a terribly long review, but I just can't help myself, lol):",/review/rw8402457/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2022,tresm87,8," Prey is a back to basics return to form with tremendous atmosphere and suspense that unfortunately won't be experienced in theater.
","As a lifelong fan of this franchise I am admittedly biased. Since the revolutionary classic first film, Fox/hollywood have made 4 sequels all of which I have thoroughly enjoyed/ still critiqued. A perfect sequel hasn't been made imo and may never be, but I can say this new film has the closest effective wilderness ambience/suspense to the first film and that warrants great praise.",/review/rw8402457/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2022,cyguration,3," Could Have Been Great Had They Kept It Realistic
","There are a lot of reviews here defending this film, calling it the ""Second best Predator film!"" in the franchise, and throwing around a lot of buzzwords for anyone who doesn't like the film. There are also an incalculable amount of individuals defending the main character, Naru, saying she relied on her wits and tactics to win fights, and that's what makes her believable. That's only partially true.",/review/rw8402457/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2022,jaimemedina-36288,8," A worthy prequel to the classic
","I think Prey did an excellent job at crafting a fresh new story. Let's face it, predictor sequels and spin-offs have felt more like a money grab. But here there's a real story that cleverly weaves a number of story lines together to spin up this intriguing edition.",/review/rw8402457/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2022,ericfield-53542,8," Who's the Prey and who's the Predator??
","I was only going to rate this until I decided to read some of the comments. This was easily the best one since the original. Not even close to me. I was hopefully when Shane Black did a ""reboot"" in 2018 I believe. I was disappointed. This was taking the franchise back to the basics and that was a good think! If you liked what Rogue One meant to Star Wars then this story will connect with you. I loved the cinematography. It was beautiful. The acting was really good. Don't worry that the lead actors aren't more well known. I was really not expecting much to be honest. The sequels since The Predator have been let downs. I only watched because the trailer had me with taking it so far back in time. At an hour and forty min it wasn't too short or too long. It was the perfect run time. I hope that you like Prey as much as me and that you rate and leave a comment. Happy hunting!",/review/rw8402457/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2022,mhorg2018,5," Just so-so (one spoiler)
","People really need to think when they write a screenplay. What could have been a great movie, perhaps as good as 1 and 2, rather than the pablum that followed, is just a foot note in predator history. The cast was ok, but the story fit the plot, not the other way around. The girl was a great tracker, ever yet fell right into a mud puddle. Why didn't the trap break her ankle? The movie was slow, too. Until the middle when it sped up. If I never watch this again, and, unlike 1 and 2 which I have and do watch I won't be sad. The unbelievable part was a 7 foot tall predator going toe to toe with a 5 foot tall woman. I know, empowerment, but believability on this was zero.",/review/rw8402457/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2022,halfxbreed23,5," Please don't believe the hype
","Its a good movie, HOWEVER when you've had a string of losses in the franchise, mediocrity can appear to be a masterpiece.",/review/rw8402457/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2022,nansjune,4," How does this get almost the same imdb score as the Arnie original?
","Watching the Hollywood machine take your favourite childhood movies, TV shows and books and butcher them over and over and over again. It's growing tiresome.",/review/rw8402457/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2022,IonicBreezeMachine,8," Prey marks a return to form for the Predator franchise with a unique take on the material and solid lead in Midthunder.
","Set in 1719 in The Great Northern Plains, Naru (Amber Midthunder) is a young Comanche woman who while trained as a healer has aspirations of being a hunter like her brother Taabe (Dakota Beavers). When Naru sees what she thinks is the ""thunderbird"" in the sky, she takes this as a sign she is ready to prove herself a hunter. As she joins a group lead by her brother set on taking down a mountain lion, they soon come across a creature more dangerous than they've encountered before.",/review/rw8402457/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2022,subxerogravity,8," Definitely worth your time!!
","Had to start a 30-day trial on Hulu just to watch it but It was pretty boss, so I'm not mad. The story was basic and took us back to the roots of the Predator franchise with its pre-America setting.",/review/rw8402457/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2022,anthonyjlangford,4," Lack of realistic characterisation
","Excellent production value, and it is very well made, can't save this film from falling into the all-too-common trap of having the central character without flaws, being able to achieve superhuman feats and general unrealistic portrayals that diminishes the films believability.",/review/rw8402457/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2022,phizzle21,4," Honest review: good setting but the rest is flawed and sloppy and doesn't do the greatest hunter in the galaxy justice..

24 August 2022,speedemon-11997,2," Made by another talentless modern privileged urbanized hipster...
","...aimed at priviliged urbanized gen Z hipsters lacking an identity of their own. Another movie that lacks soul, depth and storytelling like most modern made Predator themed flicks and putting in indigenous american hipster actors and actresses from the narcissistic hollywood elite doesn't give it any cred by default. The most interesting part in this flick was perhaps that girl's tomahawk skills, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was cgi too like most biological life in this film...",/review/rw8402457/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2022,bilismit,2," Predator Never Knew What Hit Him!
","Damn! Watching this movie i learned 1 thing, Arnie could learn a lot from this teenage girl! She could run circles around this old war veteran who lost his whole team of war veterans and had his ass kicked by the challenge-chasing-hunt-hungry-tech-savvy oversized alien! This little girl got all jacked up in just few days, she did something big old Arnie did in years and years of hard training and fighting! Put a string on a tomahawk and all your skills reach 100 in no time! And i get it, she could not be bothered trying to save her tribe members cause she had a thing to prove - That she could hunt! It doesn't matter if she had any other motive other than to prove a point! Also, can you really be called a tracker if you have a dog sniffing around? No no no, i won't go there! I told myself i would watch the new movies and just turn off my logic! Hollywood did that years ago so i should just adapt.",/review/rw8402457/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2022,gustheaffen,2," It was made well but totally woke and ridiculous premise
",Right a 12 year old little girl is the hero and all the tough manly males fail. Ridiculous. It wasn't badly made but the agenda is always in your face to put women over men and now children over men.,/review/rw8402457/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2022,therealjaysmoke,2," This was really awful
","Advanced alien vs primitives and you expected a fair fight?! The first half of the movie was totally pointless. What's an alien doing killing animals? What's he doing fighting a bear?! There was no suspense whatsoever. The fights were laughable. Plot was non-existent, cgi was below standard, and it was way longer than need be. And talk about the worst climax in any Predator series. I mean this is suppose to the the advent of Predator but man they could have at least come up with a better antagonist. This was just another ok movie not worthy of a second watch. So thoroughly disappointed.",/review/rw8402457/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2022,SnoopyStyle,8," great Predator film
",It's 1719 on the American plains. Naru (Amber Midthunder) is a young Comanche woman who wants to be a great hunter. Her brother Taabe is a natural born leader. The world of the white people is slowly intruding on their world. A strange thunder cloud announces a different unwelcomed extraterrestrial visitor. It's the Predator.,/review/rw8402457/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2022,room102,4," Boring and Pointless
","Probably the most ""serious"" film in the Predator series but might as well be the most boring one, except for the AVP abominations (if you consider them as part of the franchise). Even the awful ""The Predator"" has more to offer on terms of plot and excitement. I appreciate the filmmakers took the movie seriously and didn't make it the silly movie that is ""The Predators"" but that doesn't make this one good either. Sorry, I don't understand why people like it so much. I found it pretty dull and pointless. Also, the references to Predator 1 and 2 were pretty heavy handed.",/review/rw8402457/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2022,wolfiemn,1," Boring and Predictable
","So many people are saying this is a ""return to greatness"" for the franchise.",/review/rw8402457/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2022,kwenchow,1," Not as good as previous chapter! Full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Another big letdown!
","This film start with the narrator talking about a monster, and a woman waking up scene! As turnout, this film is about a woman ""Naru"", and her tribe need to survive from the killing of the ""Predator""! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the searching scene, overuse of the running scene, overuse of the arguing scene, overuse of the calling names scene, overuse of the staring scene, overuse of the long angle scenery scene, overuse of the blackout scene, overuse of the changing camera angle scene, and overuse of the training scene! Make the film unwatchable! All the action scene have blood at certain point, but overall portray by sideways, have slow motion, keep disappearing, and occur in too short of time! Make the film frustrated to watch! At the end, after the Predator been killed, Naru promoted as her tribe's leader! That's it! Another disappointed film!",/review/rw8402457/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2022,Littleman95,8," Everyone Knows How It Will End, And Yet It Was Very Entertaining
","Plot: easy and the end is totally predictable, still the development and getting through this fight of predators to see how the hunt is done, it was very entertaining. The end is a little bit forced, maybe you can pass on it.",/review/rw8402457/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2022,jtindahouse,4," Another misfire for this series
","The 'Predator' films are so consistently disappointing. Every time they get our hopes up, and every time when we finally see the movie they are shattered. I suspect the series doesn't know what it is anymore. They certainly don't feel like horror movies.",/review/rw8402457/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2022,ohroonoko,10," Watch the Comanche Dub version
","The Comanche dub version changes some of the subtitled dialogue compared with the English audio. The English audio dialog was too colloquial; it sounded too contemporary and literal, as if it could've been spoken in 2022 instead of 1719. The Comanche dub also pulls you into the movie more, and it improves the acting performances and the aesthetic of the film. It gives off a sort of an Apocalypto vibe. Bad or good accents have a big effect on a film. (Think Harrison Ford as a Russian submarine captain in K-19 The Widowmaker with his unapologetic American accent). I enjoyed Prey considerably more in Comanche dub than English audio.",/review/rw8402457/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2022,I_Ailurophile,10," Outstanding, thrilling, adrenaline-pumping excellence
","Not unlike the yautja themselves, the primary 'Predator' series has proven over now 35 years to be remarkably dexterous, and arguably more consistent than many other major franchises. The 1987 progenitor is a classic, and the first sequel surprisingly great despite an odd premise; 2010's 'Predators' is a dazzling thrill ride, and while 2018's 'The predator' is a bizarre sidestep (misstep?), I appreciate the daring to try something different. That's the key - ""something different""; even as the core tenets of the films remain the same, each new entry carries some spark to set it apart. From the start I was excited to learn about 2022's 'Prey.' The premise alone is enticing, hearkening back to a history hinted at in 'Predator 2'; the casting of actors with indigenous heritage is deeply gratifying in and of itself, and the casting of a woman as the lead no less so; and from what I've seen previously of Amber Midthunder, I couldn't want to see her in a major starring role. Suffice to say that my expectations were very high long before I ever sat to watch - but I'm ever so pleased to say that as far as I'm concerned, 'Prey' more than lives up to the hype I'd built up in my mind.",/review/rw8402457/?ref_=tt_urv
