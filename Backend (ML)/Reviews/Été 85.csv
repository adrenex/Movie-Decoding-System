25 December 2020,Xstal,9," Life Affirming, Every Minute of it...
","There are times during the first quarter when you may believe someone's spiked your drink with an hallucinogenic as Disney's innovative way of capturing our entrance and exit to the world is developed but, as you will find, this is a film to get you thinking and, more importantly, thinking about yourself - reflecting so to speak. Delivered with the usual Pixar excellence, if this doesn't make you realise that tomorrow is the first day of the rest of your life then rewind, pause and start again, because the message is universally important to all - and that includes you!!!",/review/rw6196124/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2021,TheLittleSongbird,10," Filled with soul
","Pixar is one of the finest animation studios to exist and one of the few studios today for anything to continually deliver. Sure they did become less consistent post-'Toy Story 3', but in the 90s and 2000s their work was of higher quality than Disney's generally and hit more than it missed. Pre-'Toy Story 3', the one slight disappointment was 'Cars', the others are very good to brilliant and even their lesser work is still watchable.",/review/rw6196124/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2020,black-wolf-rise,10," Soul might be Pixar's most grown up film yet.
",While I found myself thoroughly engrossed while watching this movie a funny thing happened around the half way point. I realized I hadn't laughed once. Sure I had smiled a few times at the low key humor but never was a joke thrown in my face that seemed like it was just thrown in there to make sure the film didn't lose the kiddos. Admittedly Pixar doesn't usually go out of its way to ensure kids laughing every second but this film REALLY doesn't have that on it's mind.,/review/rw6196124/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2021,BabelAlexandria,9," The Ambiguous Spirituality of Soul
","A fabulous story about a near-death experience, with some conventional and some interestingly non-conventional statements about life and the afterlife. I really appreciated the major lesson that Joe/Joe's Soul/22 learn over the course of the movie: that one's ""spark,"" or inner motivation, isn't the same as obsession about something (like getting a great gig), because obsession drives many people to become lost souls, despite still living. This observation is made explicitly by one of the ""Jerries:"" divine(?) beings who control the ""Great Before"" where souls go before their incarnation, whose straight-line forms suggest computer vector graphics; but they also appeal to quantum mechanics as if to a divine law. These angels of science aren't evil, per se, although the cosmic accountant Terry reminds me of a gnostic demiurge, a being of imperfect knowledge striving for ""justice"" rather than ""mercy."" In any case, Soul is enveloped by non-denominational, quasi-scientific, and morally ambiguous pre- and post-mortem realms and their governing angels.",/review/rw6196124/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2021,Filmiarvustus,8," Everyone in all ages deserves to watch this movie
","""Soul"" is about a musician who is transported out of his body and he must find his way back into actually living. This film is transcending the depths of Pixar's most introspective animations. Every facet comes together beautifully to create an emotional symphony, resulting in a heartbreakingly optimistic narrative. It feels like too much for kids, but the script allows it all to come together beautifully with the emotionally powerful third act, including a heartwarming tear-inducing score and a relatable, well-explored story about the meaning of life. ""Soul"" may not have the laugh-out-loud sense of humor as other Pixar greats do, but it will touch hearts nonetheless.",/review/rw6196124/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2020,adamstommy,10," Absolutely incredible.
","Pixar has done it again! This film is nothing short of amazing. The animation, story, and voice cast are all stunning.

26 December 2020,helvin3,10," Adults need to watch this movie
","This movie was, quite frankly, a wake up call. This is a Pixar film for adults and it comes with an incredibly important message. I loved it and I absolutely want to listen to that message. #Goodatwalking",/review/rw6196124/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2020,tmpsvita,7," Artistically it's a masterpiece, narratively it's a really good one it just needed more time
","Artistically it's a masterpiece without no doubt, it's incredibly inventive like most of the Pixar movies and deeply poetic like just their greatest ones.
It manages to use the animation to create and rationalize images, worlds, characters and concepts so complicated and imaginative that usually can only find their form inside minds.
But at the same time narratively it feels rushed and this makes it hard to be involved, moved and you find yourself detached; so many aspects about the main character, the dimensions he cross and about the philosophy behind them and the main story needed more attention, a more elaborated development, especially in the first half where the movie don't find the right rhythm running and running without a breath, a beautiful, essential breath.
Maybe it just needs to be watched a second time or even more to be fully appreciated.
Still it really is a good movie, even a masterpiece under some aspects as already mantioned, but it could have been a masterpiece under every aspect if it lasted longer.
It had so much to say and too little time to do it.",/review/rw6196124/?ref_=tt_urv

26 December 2020,TheRealistMax,10," Moved Me To Tears
","I can't put into words how close to home this movie hit for me. Not to sound pretentious, but it's more than a movie - it's a life lesson on how to live. It'll teach you that life isn't about careers, goals, passions, or achievements. It's about living, right here in this moment, exactly where you are.",/review/rw6196124/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2020,Bert08,8," Loved it almost to tears (and I'm a big man with a beard)
","Before explaining why I liked this movie, I'd like to point out that the main idea of the movie is *NOT* that you need find your purpose to have a happy life. It's the exact opposite! I'm not saying this just to be a professor, but because it's really important and that's why I loved the film so much. You don't need to be fixated about something to find a meaning in your life. You need to savour it and learn to enjoy the little moments instead of waiting for something big to happen to reach happiness. It's so profound and refreshing. A movie just about a guy waiting for his big moment and feeling fulfilled after having reached it would have been dull, boring, trite and most of all wrong, like pretty much all ""self-help"" advices.
Instead the opposite idea is presented and if you just pay attention to the dialogues -and the story, really- you'll understand what I mean and most importantly what you might apply to make your everyday life better.
But back to the movie I've got to say I almost cried as the end was approaching as much as I was going to turn off the tv when the movie started. The whole initial setting reminded me too much of Inside Out, a film I quite disliked, so I was worried it was a copy of it (it kind of is in the beginnin). But luckily the second half steered away from it and developed in one of the most moving film I've seen in a long time. Undoubtedly one of Pixar's best.",/review/rw6196124/?ref_=tt_urv

17 November 2021,planktonrules,8," I wouldn't show this one to kids...
","My summary is NOT because ""Soul"" is dirty or inappropriate for children. Instead, I say this because it's clearly marketed towards teens and, especially, adults. The usual cute sidekicks and kiddie stuff is missing from this CGI film and the jazz score also might be a bit off-putting to younger audience members.",/review/rw6196124/?ref_=tt_urv

9 April 2021,ironhorse_iv,7," Pixar truly put their heart and soul into this animated movie. For the most part, it kinda work.
","Watching protagonist Joe Gardner (Voiced by Jamie Foxx) try to escape the world of before life with the help of a young soul 22 (Voiced by Tina Fey) was a somewhat interesting character study. Although the mature philosophical themes about living may elude younger viewers. Even for adults, the movie can be a bit confusing at times with the spiritual elements of existential crisis involving the character's out of the body experience; along with the Catch-22 subplot of looking for a spark. After all, screenwriter and director Pete Docter along with co-writers Kemp Powers & Mike Jones didn't even know if the film should go with the nurture or nature route with the baffling unclear Eastern and New Age mediative. Having both themes just made the message of the picture a little more jarring & muddled. Then there is the fact that the movie can get a little too preachy and seriously heavy handed at times to the point that most of the humor takes a backseat. The jokes that were left for the audiences didn't really hit my funny bone. The montage of interactions with key historical figures trying to mentor 22 was somewhat insulting. I found the sassing bantering between Joe and the cynical, snarky and mischievous soul really annoying. Plus, the constant messing with people by 22 in the Zone probably caused at least a few fatalities. Truth be told, none of the souls in the Great Beyond doesn't really seem to care about the value of life; including the Jerries. After all they're the worse, openly willing to let megalomaniac' personalities go to Earth. Who knew that the manifestation of dynamic energies, appearing in a comprehensible form, albeit abstract could be so hypocritical? As for the 'Freaky Friday' body swap concept later on the film. I found those jokes a little more adorable. However, some animal lovers might find Mr. Mittens' out-of-body experience jab tasteless. Along with that, certain people of color might find the fact that Pixar's first movie with an African-American lead somewhat problematic. The film visually has Joe barely portray in his own body. As for me, I found everything about Gardner's urban surroundings felt authentic and real. The film so deeply ingrained into Afro-American culture that not seeing the protagonist in his human form for most of the runtime was no bother. After all, that concept beats the original idea of Joe as a Caucasian animator wanting to become a rock star. I really don't see that fitting the title that much. That said, the movie still fails to go into detail how Gardner could be ever be mistaken for Dr. Bjorn P. Börgensson. Honestly if the Jerries could tell the different between unborn souls with little more than vague circular blobs and few personalities, you would think that they would notice who the mentors are, through their distinctive features that those souls carry over. Bjorn and Joe truly don't match. The Jerries really are awful. Plus, did they ever found what happen to the good doctor in the end? I don't think he ever appeared in the movie. Shame that they didn't even use John Ratzenberger's voice for him. Anyways, I guess he's a mysterious throwaway character; along with odd mentions of Joe's unseen ex-girlfriend Lisa and missing posthumous father. Backstory on these three would had help the film a lot as they could had played more into the plot. Because of those unexplored character developments and the cop out ending, the movie wasn't as tear-jerking or cathartic as other similar Pixar flicks. There just weren't enough supporting characters with great voice performers to provoke a deeper and more resonant emotional response. As for the main cast. Those voice performers felt at times like they were holding back. Especially Foxx whom could deliver a very good emotional musical driven performance. The actor doesn't even provide all the jazz piano playing as that role went to pianist Jon Batiste. Since the film was centered around music and needed something to animate Joe's piano playing to, why not use Foxx! It would had been nice. The tune to 'Epiphany' with his singing voice could really stood out. Sadly, I hardly remember any of the score by composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. I found most of them forgettable. As for the animation. It's a mixed bag. Some of the visuals are breath taking vibrant. I do like the way the music notes looking Jerrys and Terry (Voiced by Rachel House) were traditionally animated; along with the abstract sound waves shapes the main character falls into from the musical staff conveyor belt. The blending of the 2D animation into a CGI world landscape was truly flawless. However, those scenes are far between with others designs failing by being little too unnatural. As for the after-credit zinger. That add on really doesn't make much sense now since many of the 2020 movies were impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic, forcing Disney to skip its theatrical release and debut on its streaming service instead. Nevertheless, the movie still certainly still worth checking even if fails to capture the greatness of other Pixar existential films like 2017's 'Coco' had. At least, the flick is not too much of a grinding, soul-crushing experience. It's decent at best.",/review/rw6196124/?ref_=tt_urv

","Joe voiced by Jamie Foxx is a jazz musician who teaches middle school band and has been waiting for his big break for years. He finally thinks he has gotten his break only to fall down a hole in the street and into the great before. What follows is Joe discovering life's lessons and what is really important in life with the help of a mentor named 22 voiced by Tina Fey. I really loved this movie and the message it has about life and really taking time to enjoy the little moments. I thought the animation was spectacular, the score was incredible and moving and the voice acting was great too. I really believe voice acting in animated films don't get enough credit. I thought the film has great funny dialogue and light moments and some really moving moments as well. I think this is one of Pixar's best ever films.",/review/rw6196124/?ref_=tt_urv
