18 March 2010,DICK STEEL,10," A Nutshell Review: How to Train Your Dragon
","If this is done following the same old beat up formula that Hollywood sticks to with regards to animation, then the dragons will be yakking non-stop. Thank goodness that this film, directed by Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, avoids this like the plague, and ",/review/rw2221260/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2010,The_Fifth_Echo,10," One of the most Breathtaking Animated Films of all time.
","I watched How to Train Your Dragon about 5 times now, and it never gets boring. It actually keeps on getting better and better with with more and more views. This is a huge accomplishment for DreamWorks Animation, it might actually be its Best Animated Feauture it yet. It is an amazing experience to watch this film in Cinema. The 3D is amazing and at times Breathtaking. I may of had the most fun that I've ever had in Cinema watching How to Train Your Dragon.",/review/rw2221260/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2010,Simon_Says_Movies,9," Will enamour kids and enthrall adults
","With a somewhat unwieldy tile and the lack of the winning Pixar storyline that has dominated the Oscars for a decade, Dreamworks animations latest could have been a clunker. Not only is How to Train Your Dragon the best film of the year so far, but it even eclipses the quality of last years duel academy award winner Up.",/review/rw2221260/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2010,tollini,10," Truly Moving Picture
","I saw this film in early March, of 2010 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture ""explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life."" Heartland gave that award to this film.",/review/rw2221260/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2018,AlsExGal,9," One of my favorite films of the last decade...
","...not that this is necessarily saying much, since the films of the past decade are either made for the Academy Awards with some social message that hits the audience over the head with a social justice sledgehammer, or they are action films with lots of car chases and explosions and comic book heroes or they are 50 shades of obscene. But I digress. ",/review/rw2221260/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2018,gogoschka-1,10," A Beautiful Tale Of Adventure And Friendship For People Of All Ages
","Warning: this beautifully animated tale is highly addictive! As soon as it's over you'll immediately want to watch it again. I'm a grown man, but somehow this movie managed to ignore all the layers of cynicism and fake toughness we grown-ups tend to build around ourselves to cope with life; it cut right through to the wide-eyed, adventure-loving boy in me, right through to the heart. It's impossible not to fall in love with this movie, with these characters - especially if you love wild animals. This beautiful story of a very unlikely friendship between a boy who's a bit of an outcast and a dragon is just so well done; it's never cheesy, yet full of passion, and there's simply not a dull moment in it.",/review/rw2221260/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2010,me_sterya,10," Wonderful movie, a must see 3D
","I saw the trailer and I enjoyed it but I was afraid that all the good parts from the movie will be there and that will be all, like it was with many films lately. That was certainly not the case. There are way better parts that were left to be discovered and I definitely congratulate the choice.",/review/rw2221260/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10," Amazing, the best Dreamworks film in a long time
","I love animation, always have done, always will do, and I was blown away by How to Train Your Dragon. Granted, not all Dreamworks movies are bad, Prince of Egypt is one of the most stirring and evocative films let alone animated films I have seen, Shrek was very original and funny and Spirit:Stallion of the Cimarron is their most underrated I feel. I will say too, How to Train Your Dragon along with Prince of Egypt is my absolute favourite of Dreamworks, and one of the best of 2010.",/review/rw2221260/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2010,zeletto,10," A heartfelt movie with a beautiful message
","There are a lot of excellent reviews out there, I will just discuss a single point. What got to me the most in this movie is the message I got out of it, I got it from a single line uttered by the hero and it just burned in my memory, it's about how when we look deep in the eyes of our enemies -the ones we fear the most- we will see that they are afraid of us just as we are afraid of them, we might realize their humanity and that they are not what we thought, monsters.",/review/rw2221260/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2011,claudio_carvalho,9," Delightful Animation with a Wonderful Message of Friendship, Intolerance, Misjudgment, Peace and Harmony
","In the Viking village of Berk, all the houses are new since the dwellers are in permanent fight against the dragons. The leader Stoik the Vast is unsuccessfully trying to destroy the fearful Night Fury and locate the dragon's nest to destroy them. His clumsy and inventive son Hiccup works as a blacksmith and dreams on becoming a dragon killer.",/review/rw2221260/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2010,drakula2005,10," More mature than ""Shrek""-probably one of the best animated features ever made.Worth seeing
","This was one of the moments, when you feel so overwhelmed by a movie, that you want to see it again immediately.And when i think of how the whole movie-going began-a theater, full of annoying, noisy kids, 3-th graders mostly.",/review/rw2221260/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2010,velvet_remedy,9," Genuinely superb and a step forward in 3D films
","HTTYD is the latest in a run of animated 3D films to hit the family market. One might be forgiven for feeling a little weary of this genre as the big production studios churn out one ""action-packed film with a cute central character and some pretty effects"" after another. But wait...",/review/rw2221260/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2010,planktonrules,10," It's so good it boggles the mind!
","When I saw this film tonight, I was completely bowled over from start to finish. I have simply never seen a better looking computer generated film nor a film that used 3-D to such wonderful effect. Finally--a film that doesn't look like the 3_D doesn't look like it was tossed in as an afterthought--but was clearly intended as one all along. However, I will warn you NOT to waste your time seeing it in 2-D---the film loses too much of its artistry. Now I know some of you will think I am a total sap for saying this, but the film literally brought tears to my eyes because it was so beautiful. I simply couldn't believe how special and artistic this movie was--it completely exceeded my expectations. This is because the advertising campaign make this movie look like it's just another kids' movie--and nothing more. But, with a lovely plot, interesting characters, the best CGI on Earth, a terrific sound track and lots of surprises, this simply is a joy to watch. Nornally when I review a film I try to talk about the film's flaws...but I simply couldn't find any. At last, a 3-D CGI film that actually manages to be better looking than last year's ""Up""! It is hard to imagine a film being any better--though I am sure five years from now, I will be seeing even better 3-D and computer generated films...and it boggles the mind! See this film!",/review/rw2221260/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2012,micz81,10," If you feel that Toy Story and Shreck are missing SOMETHING IMPORTANT - this movie is for you
","It's far better then all those Shrecks, Toy stories, Ratatoulies, Puss in boots, Mega-minds and other ""renewing"" concepts. Why? It's simple and honest. This movie doesn't TRY to be funny, modern, super-wise, and ""for all"". It's not one of those ""hey-let's-make-a-movie-about-cat-who-is-a-super-spy"" concepts. This movie JUST tells the simple yet very good story in the most proper way.",/review/rw2221260/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2010,movietaster,8," Most moving, spiritually enriched 3D movie you have ever seen!
","I am not at all interested in dragons and all such fantasy creatures. I don't like children movies with all their stupid messages. I saw this movie rather just to pass the time than to watch it for its sake. And Whoa! I was drawn in this river in first 5 minutes. And what a experience it has been! Right from the start as the narrator describes his world, you are immediately there. You feel yourself in the characters place. The movie does that for you. This is very uncommon movie and it has set a milestone for 3D, not because of its technical aspects, but because of the Depth this movie has. This movie is as much for a 7 year old as it is for an old man who has seen a lot of life. This movie will entertain each viewer in his own way. This is a masterpiece! This movie isn't what it sounds on the surface. It has layers of meanings attached to it. Look at just the title: How to train your Dragon!. If you see it carefully you will notice that there is more to it than meets the eye. Watch the movie and you will know what i mean. This movie cleverly comments on Human Fear, War, Friendship, prejudices, courage, Love. ........................... Don't miss this movie or you will miss one of the few periods when you really LIVE. Note: Just remember to carry your heart with you when you see this movie. It will fill your heart with nothing but what should truly belong there. 10/10.",/review/rw2221260/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2010,3xHCCH,10," Do Not Let the Trailer Discourage You. This is Very Good!
","The trailer of this movie was so unpromising and unattractive. It did not make me want to watch this, in 3D no less. However, my kids all wanted to watch it, so of course, my wife and I had to go with them.",/review/rw2221260/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2010,axel_foley,9," this is why you go to the movies
","incredible! certainly the front runner for the best animated film of the year. from the first to the last frame this film is as good as an animated film gets on almost every level. beautifully written, designed and executed. though an incredible movie, it's not quite perfection - probably due to time and budget limitations (is there ever enough of either?). that said, the problems i had are far too few to mention. if dragon doesn't absolutely slay at the box office i'll lose faith in middle America.

24 September 2019,sazzad_h_akm,10," Why I gave it 10
","I'm not a big fan of animation but I like this movie very much. I consider this is the greatest animation movie created so far. This movie is constituted by great story line, splendid background music, amazing animation and breathtaking brawls.
As for the story line, I can tell that it is very unique as well as heart touching. That's one thing, you will definitely enjoy while watching the movie. One will enjoy wild but growing friendship between Hiccup and the dragon. A good story line along with satisfactory and delightful background music makes this movie prominent.
On the other hand superb and impeccable animation will draw you into the chair until the movie is finished. Fight scenes are spectacular and humorous. I'm pretty sure that after watching this movie everyone will watch it multiple times.",/review/rw2221260/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2010,saarvardi,10," The best 2010 release I've seen so far – and one of the best animated films to hit theaters in a very long time
","I remember watching the adorable Disney flick Lilo & Stitch at the theater back in the summer of 2002, after a truly exhausting week. The film - which tells the story of a small girl that befriends a wacky alien she mistakes for a dog - managed to put an enormous smile on my face, and made me forget of all my other worries for a while.",/review/rw2221260/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2017,bans_004,10," Watched it a 100 times, and...
","it's still managed to make me smile, laugh, tear up and excited every time. And I can still watch it a hundred more times, even at this age loooong past my teens, and still be as entertained as the first time round. This has the perfect dosage of wit, humor, drama, action, scattered bits of suspense and...the perfect team of the six riders. The twins never cease to bring that giggle back, even with their old pathetic jokes. I mean, who would've thought to make a voice cast of Jay Baruchel...which has now become almost iconic! Such a perfect amount of time spent on the build-up; especially the bonding; and the climax. It has one of the best (thought through) story lines. Congratulations to the Dreamsworks team on a job well done. And of course to Cressida Crowell for her creations.",/review/rw2221260/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2010,kevinkeanmurphy,10," Hiccup a young Viking befriends Toothless, a young dragon.
","Hiccup a young Viking befriends Toothless, a young dragon. This is the best movie I've seen since the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Virtually everything about it is wonderful. Rarely have I been so drawn in to an animated movie. The 3D aspects are thrilling and the movie has a great story, amazing animation, non stop action and a positive and constructive message. It made me want to go out and get a pet dragon. This movie is perfect for people of all ages. Now I know what a feel good movie is. This movie will make everyone feel good. Congratulations to all who contributed to this amazing film. It will make toy dragons a popular gift item. Hope to see it again and again. 3D at it's best.",/review/rw2221260/?ref_=tt_urv

12 August 2017,mlitvinava,10," My favourite animated film
","There's a reason why I watched How To Train Your Dragon 7 times when it was still playing in theatres. No, it wasn't because I was young and didn't know how to better manage my money (although to be honest, it was a little bit of this). It's because HTTYD had a unique way of unfolding its story. A story about an unlikely relationship that truly moved my heart--between the now very well-known dynamic-duo, Hiccup and Toothless.",/review/rw2221260/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2010,tedg,," Night Fury; Flight
","The first major film where the agent takes a stake. This is sending shivers through CAA whose power resides in control of the performing talent. The old school agents and the performing talent have distorted the product. This business of animation studios and literary agents is likely to distort things in an equally damaging way. But for now, the shift is visible, welcome and exciting as getout.",/review/rw2221260/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2010,zahid_c,8," Visually Stunning
","An animated feast for the eyes is a brilliant description for this film. From the jaw-dropping visuals beautifully rendered in 3D, to the flawless animation of the characters and dragons, this was one film that didn't disappoint.",/review/rw2221260/?ref_=tt_urv
