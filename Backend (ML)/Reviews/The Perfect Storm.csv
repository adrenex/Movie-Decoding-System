24 April 2022,bosporan,8," The Rise of The Kid!
","An entertaining and well-made adaptation of the life and times of Billy the Kid. The style is ruggedly realistic, wonderfully depicting the harsh unfairness of life. The beauty of the landscape is in stark contrast to the selfish exploitation by the 'haves' of the 'have-nots'.",/review/rw8244350/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2022,lakings97,8," Nice Good Ole Western
","Billy The Kid is an EPIX series that stars Tom Blyth as William Bonney about the early years and upbringing of an Irish boy who turns to be the gunslinger. Michael Hirst co-wrote and created this series also was the person behind Vikings. The storyline is loosely based around the life and travels of Billy from Texas to New Mexico to Mexico. The first season ends up on a high note trapped between two rival merchants. Daniel Webber plays Jesse Evans who was Billy best friend when they fist started out. This was a good old western with a great cast, I highly recommend it. Can't wait to see what the second season brings to the small screen.",/review/rw8244350/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2022,pktexas,8," what's with all the hate? I like it
","The first 3 eps kept my attention, not sure how authentic it is but I like it so far. The lead actor is doing a good job, let's see where it goes! I disagree with all the negativity on here.",/review/rw8244350/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2022,squacakeit,9," Historical ???
",I'm an old west fan. Billy the kid is one of my favorites. Not much is known about his early years. Most is speculation. The show moves a little slow but is great. They do take some liberties with how things happened in Lincoln according to history. That happens with all shows or movies. The acting is solid. I never heard of Tom Blyth (Billy) before but he is doing a great job in my opinion.,/review/rw8244350/?ref_=tt_urv

12 June 2022,reedermike,10," Excellent take on the Billy the Kid story
","Having a little trouble understanding some of the negative reviews, because this is by any measure a well-crafted western series with terrific location scenes, authentic costuming and terrific acting from lead Tom Blyth and the entire supporting cast. Much of the first couple of episodes involved Billy's early life, which given the sketchy record remains somewhat speculative, but while the particulars can be questioned the overall circumstances of his upbringing it depicts are pretty close to what we know. This is not a documentary, and it doesn't pretend to be; it's a historical drama. But as a western history buff it seems to me that it's coming closer to the actual historical Billy than most prior films, much as ""Tombstone"" did with Wyatt Earp, despite some dramatic license. Billy was not the bloodthirsty killer depicted in dime novels. His first two killings are accurately depicted here as self-defense, and the Lincoln Co. War was a bloody mess all around, with the Kid getting the short-end of the stick from the crooked ring politicians running the state the second an armistice was declared. Much of the hyped legend of Billy comes from Pat Garrett's book, which was obviously intended to make Billy look bigger, badder and more vicious than he was in order to inflate Garrett's role in ending his career. Although that hasn't been treated yet by the series, there appear to be intimations of that in the early interactions between Garrett and the Kid in this movie. In any event, if you want pure history, go to a library and do research. But if you're looking for a good western with a gritty reflection of the times, top production values and terrific acting, this is a series you shouldn't miss.",/review/rw8244350/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2022,covington_c,8," Great but not exceptional...
","Tom Blythe is an exceptional fresh face. As far as his portrayal of Billy The Kid goes, he is solid. The supporting cast is good, as well. Overall, the acting from the entire cast is stellar. I thought the 1st season was extremely entertaining. I've read reviews where people complained about mumbling, sound & lighting, b/ I didn't have any problems w/ the production of the series. The acting, plot, cast & directing were solid. The only thing I didn't like was that it could have been more fact based, & the creative liberties that were taken seemed rather unnecessary. I see that the series has yet to be cancelled or renewed. BTK is certainly entertaining enough to deserve a 2nd season. I'd definitely be disappointed, if it weren't picked up for a 2nd season. I definitely green light it, before another absolutely & entirely pointless installment of Sharknado!",/review/rw8244350/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2022,Johnny_West,1," Billy the Riverdance Kid?
","This series is longer than Billy's actual life was, and a lot more boring. Take out the name of ""Billy the Kid"" and all you have left is a boring romance series.",/review/rw8244350/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2022,twodiamonds,8," have been enjoying
","This is a bit slow and probably could use some trimming, but i have enjoyed. Does anybody else see the lead as similar to a young bob dylan? Stick with this i think it will start heating up. To make a series like this requires some slowing down of the action to build the character story for billy the kid.",/review/rw8244350/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2022,TruthSeeker4Life,10," Extremely well done!!!
","The show has really grown on me and at first I thought it was gonna be a cheesy history channel type produced TV series with mediocre acting and bad writing. I was absolutely wrong, and the acting has been amazing, especially with Billy the kid and Jesse because those two actors really have done an spectacular job of playing their parts. The story is also really well written, and it's chronological, which really gives you a great understanding of who billy was, where he came from, and what he became. The way the film is shot is excellent, and I love the scenery, the lighting, and the location they chose to shoot. The casting is excellent and the actor that plays Billy the kid really did a lot of research, and practicing for the part because his eyes say so much throughout the series. The look that he gives and the energy he admits really capture the essence of what Billy the kid may have really been like. When I see this guy, I don't see an actor, I actually see somebody that is authentically being who he is attempting to imitate, and whatever he does to transform and become like that, whether it's method acting, or whatever he does, he really embodies the essence what he believes Billy the kid was like. To be honest, I was actually disappointed when I first saw that he was going to be the one playing Billy the kid, but after the second episode he really starting to grow on me as the main actor, and I could tell that he could really hold himself and the show on her shoulders, which for me was especially surprising because I don't remember seeing him in any other films, or TV shows, although he's probably been in them, I just haven't seen him.",/review/rw8244350/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2022,tilokaudaman,10," Totally entertaining
","This is truly one of the best of the best western epics I have seen in a long while. Tom Blyth is perfectly casted Billy. He is a mixture innocence, toughness and subtle erotic energy. The direction and period depiction could not have been better. The cinematography is fantastic. I'm hoping for a second season.",/review/rw8244350/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2022,orcinussr,5," I mean, it's not great, but I'm always up for a good western
",".. And Epix needs a win, unfortunately they chose to go up against the might of Taylor Sheridan's incredibly well written 'Yellowstone' and '1883' with a romantic adaptation of young William Bonney's love interest - which isn't really what intrigues me about his story - however it seems they may believe this could hit big with the younger viewers?? Hmm well.. We'll see I reckon.",/review/rw8244350/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2022,strizbiz-99429,2," Slow and lacking action
","The acting isn't bad, the script isn't terrible but it's really slow as far as westerns go and what I was expecting from a series about Billy the Kid. It doesn't need to be action packed but the action is almost non existent. I'm 2 1/2 episodes in and at this point I'm pretty much loosing interest.",/review/rw8244350/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2022,Xavier_Stone,2," Remove the western theme and this is teen drama
","The first episode is so slow that I ended up using the fast forward button not even 10 minutes into it. Stopped and played a few scenes here and there but nothing held my interest, nothing of note and pretty much got to the end quickly.",/review/rw8244350/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2022,Tweetienator,3," Billy Got the Blues
","Superb boredom supported by a supreme overload of melodramatic soap opera xtra-energy. The psychology and development of characters will never surpass the beginner level of 10-pence psychology. Acting and production are not to blame, but that writing staff - uninspired, boring, predictable, the story is just bad and most of the characters are just walking cliches.",/review/rw8244350/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2022,ivanasnuf,8," Love it!
","I love the storyline! Since I was a kid I liked the westerns, now that theres a new and modern one I am so happy! The acting may not be the best but it is really good. Played a bit to long in the past but that does create a pretty good fiew on the characters. Hoping for a lot of episodes and a season 2!",/review/rw8244350/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2022,frankie-08908,8," Give it time, it gets good
","I had to edit my review because I was a bit impatient with the ""gunslinger"" part of Billy the Kid. I understand trying to be historically accurate but, this isn't a history lesson or the History Channel, which by the way gets a lot wrong. There's a lot in this series that either didn't happen or they altered for entertainment purposes. Like I was saying, this is not a history lesson, sit back and enjoy the entertainment it's worth it.",/review/rw8244350/?ref_=tt_urv

15 May 2022,wmcauliffe-00425,8," Better than Vikings
",I've only watched 2 eps of this series so far but it seems closer to the truth that i know of Billy than Vikings the other series the creators made. I love how it shows his Irish background and the main actor does really look like him. Big problem is they make him right handed when he was probably a lefty. Well done by all involved i'll be watching the rest of the series.,/review/rw8244350/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2022,lasworsfold,9," Binge watched the lot 👍
","Definitely a space in the market for this kind of series. For me there is not enough of it on the small screen (or big screen for that matter) if done right. Is it historical fact? Who really knows, I for one am not to wrapped up in what is 100% true or not. I think this is made well, an like others have said although a slow burner at the start, it does drag you in and become a pretty good watch. I hope the few negative responses to this does not stop a season 2. War is coming to Lincoln, and season 2 is definitely needed.",/review/rw8244350/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2022,loulongstenoo,8," Really good and very enjoyable
",I like it so much that i wish they would not fully base it on the origin story where Billy dies in the prime of his age and fame as i feel like the story could go far.,/review/rw8244350/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2022,hfglover-84669,7," Watchable

6 May 2022,edparker-77933,3," This isn't Billy the Kid
","If you're looking for a good rendition of the Billy the Kid story this isn't it. It's not only slow AF they've also taken any and all edge out of the character. Throughout the 4 eps, which is all there are ATM, Billy is out drawn in literally every conflict and he's apparently incapable of violence even when it's fully justified. It's unfortunate because the series is well acted & produced. Their only mistake was co-opting the Billy the Kid legend. Call it something else and rename that character and they may have something.",/review/rw8244350/?ref_=tt_urv
