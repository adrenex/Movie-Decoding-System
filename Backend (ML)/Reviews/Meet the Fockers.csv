15 December 2016,david-569,9," Please, please bring this show back...
","I know. Pie in the sky request. But for whatever it is worth, felt the premise of the program to be most excellent. Scintillating. Tim Roth's performance was spot on. Just enough quirky, just enough over the top, just enough. Supporting cast also excellent. ",/review/rw4257363/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2009,fred-kolb,9," Excellent show with a great cast! I'm not lying!
","Lie to Me is a very interesting series, with a lot of humor and a very interesting premise in my opinion. In addition the 4 Cast members all play their role very good and add to the show's freshness.",/review/rw4257363/?ref_=tt_urv

","Imagine someone as abrasive and inappropriate as House, and you've got Tim Roth as Dr. Cal Lightman. ",/review/rw4257363/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2009,lopcar1993,7," One of those rare T.V. Show's
","Lie to me is a true rarity and gem among T.V. show's, it hasn't been done a million times over. Lie to me stars Tim Roth as Dr.Cal Lightman a doctor who specializes in body language and vocal patterns; together with his team of specially trained associates he helps the police and U.S. Government solve there toughest crimes. Lie to Me is a great show because it capitalizes on a whole new field of television, all you see on modern T.V. today is cop show's more cop show's and medical drama's. But this is refreshing it's much different then any show out there, yes it involves the police but in a small role there only around to keep things under control or to make arrest's. This show has a style and mind of it's own. It doesn't follow the extremely(and I mean that lightly) worn path of other show's that maybe similar or try to be like it. Take Castle for instance, it's a show about a murder mystery writer who helps' the police solve there case's; Now how many times has that been done? Lie to me is a completely original and highly entertaining show that I know that people will just love if they give it a chance.",/review/rw4257363/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2009,vastlypro,8," Amazing Show. I think I found another favorite besides House!
","An amazing show. I have always been a big fan of Tim Roth so when I heard he was doing a show I was very excited and I was hoping he would have strong writers to back him up. Lie to me is an excellent show with a highly original idea. It has it's own category. Numbers deals with math, House deals with diagnostics, Bones deals with forensic science and great character development for the most part, and Now Tim Roth is the human lie detector. The film is well acted and the chemistry between Tim Roth and his partner is excellent. The dialog is very strong while having slight moments of sarcastic humor. Blunt honesty tends to be very funny at times as well. The writing in the show makes the show seem more on edge as well and I am anxious for more. Lie to me is a wonderful show so far And I can't wait to see where they go with it this season.",/review/rw4257363/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2009,gort-8,10," Well done!
",So far I've only seen the pilot episode. I admit it. I've got a mad man-crush for this show.,/review/rw4257363/?ref_=tt_urv

",An absolute masterpiece that was canceled way before its time.,/review/rw4257363/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2011,Vic_max,," Great series ... but starting to drift
","When this series appeared in 2009, I'd have rated it a notch higher than today. As it stands, it is kind of a ""face-based"" CSI show. It's based on Paul Ekman's work on universal facial tells (""micromovements"") which reveal what a person is subconsciously feeling.",/review/rw4257363/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2009,CihanVercan,7," Revealing Hidden Lies out of Expressions
","When FBI hires a psychological specialist to derive benefit from developed interrogation techniques, detectives decide to cooperate with this specialist and his team. After a couple criminal suspects are interrogated within the usual method, Dr. Cal Lightman reveals his own method. Specifically focusing on facial expressions and gestures of the suspects, Dr. Lightman's techniques receive approval. Thus he takes his partner and a new trainee with him to settle down at the police head-quarters.",/review/rw4257363/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2019,gwenette-spann,10," Very thought provoking
",Great stories feel good endings in almost every episode. I wish I could learn to do what they do detect liars. Awesome TV series. I admire the writers. I'm Also a sucker for a British accent,/review/rw4257363/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2009,FlyingTriumph,9," So far, so good...
","Last night I watched the premiere of Lie to Me on Fox. I'd seen the previews for months, and when I saw that Tim Roth was coming to television, him being one of my favorite actors, I was both excited and dubious at the same time. Another of my favorite actors, Christian Slater, had made an awesome TV debut on My Own Worst Enemy. But the show had been canceled, and I honestly didn't want to see the same thing happen to as great an actor as Tim Roth.",/review/rw4257363/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2011,amitjusc,6," Canceled and for good cause
","This show burst out of the gates in the first season with some of the best television I had seen in a long time. This was a fantastic drama with great characters and a great concept. Unfortunately, the viewers for the pilot were over 12 million people, but had dropped by 4 million for the season finale. After that, the show started going off in new directions that did not mesh with the way the characters were being developed. One can only guess that Fox had a hand in this, pressuring the writers to bring in more viewers at all costs. AS you would expect, the results of that were not good, to say the least.",/review/rw4257363/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2010,Thorsten-Krings,4," Not convincing
",I find this show rather weak. Roth's performance is somewhere between hyperactive and self-satisfied so for me there was no way to emote to his character. The story lines are rather confused and try to pack too much into a short period of time. All in all there seems to me a lack of focus in the writing and direction of the show. It's also difficult to understand what he actually does as he reads body language but we never really get a full explanation as to what he deduces from which gesture or facial expression. I'm not sure if maybe the format of a TV show is too short for such a complex topics or if it's really the overall issue of too much plot for too short a time.,/review/rw4257363/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2011,littlebleue,," Downhill slope from the brilliant Season 1.
","It started off as a brilliant premise. The first episode gripped me with its ingenuity - it's a fantastic idea to analyse the body language and verbal nuances of not only criminals but regular people. Maybe a little far-fetched at times but incredibly interesting. Cal was eccentric, a British 'House' maybe, but I enjoyed his acting and although I usually don't like mixing British and American actors in one cast I thought that in Lie to Me, it worked swimmingly. It's somewhat reminiscent of the show 'Psych', but with better actors, fewer jokes and a different target audience.",/review/rw4257363/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2009,poprocks22-1,10," One word: Awesome.
","I think this show is awesome and is now my favorite. I've never seen anything like it, really. I've watched it about a zillion times and can't wait till every new episode coming up. I was actually starting to get tired of all the re-runs and boring shows on T.V. I don't know if it's the science behind the lies or just the idea of it, but I've simply fallen in love with it. But I don't think it's just the lies that interest me, I'm also very in love with the actors and characters. Especially Tim Roth. Aka Dr. Cal Lightman. If there were words that could explain my interest and love for his work I'd use it, but as far as I know, there isn't. Even in the new ""Incredible Hulk"" I was struck by his talent.",/review/rw4257363/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2009,igor-zalenski,10," Smart TV!
","If you haven't seen this series, get yourself to Hulu ASAP...it really is a terrific show by any standards but especially phenomenal for a Big 4 broadcaster.",/review/rw4257363/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2009,kevinpoirier712,10," An excellent beginning...
","Disregarding Reservoir Dogs, I think this has to be Roth's best work. Roth is extremely in touch with Dr. Lightman and you feel as if he truly enjoys playing this character. The show leaves you in total disbelief at points and instills a hunger for more and more episodes. I strongly suggest this show to anyone who is interested in an incredibly engaging and entertaining drama series as well as to anyone who is interested about Dr. Paul Ekman's work on facial expressions, and body languages as it relates to emotion. Solid television series. I look forward to the next few episodes. For anyone who has missed the first few episodes, the television series is now online at hulu.com. Highly recommend hulu as well.",/review/rw4257363/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2010,melwyn,1," Rubbish premise which undermines everything
","I wanted to like ""Lie to Me"". I really did. And I have tried, many times, but every attempt is thwarted by the ridiculous premise on which the show is based.",/review/rw4257363/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2009,stelstargirl,8," Fantistic start.
","This show remains episode in nature while keeping you fully intrigued by the characters and wanting to discover more about their back story. Tim Roth is intense, engaging and brilliant... kind of a milder version of House - he's willing to stop at nothing to get to the truth, and doesn't feel the need to over-rationalize his choices.

25 November 2021,shelbythuylinh,9," Should Had Lasted Longer

20 July 2018,themonkwithnoname,10," This goes hard!
","I think it is fair to say Lightman plays God. However the real people on godmode are the brilliant creators, producers, writers and creative minds behind this show.",/review/rw4257363/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2015,avocadess,9," Season 1 is one of the best TV series I have ever seen!

22 December 2011,clotblaster,5," Entertaining, if you want to give your mind a rest
","Modestly entertaining, but as with so many contemporary crime shows there just has to be a distracting, hard-to-believe gimmick. Unlike House, to which a reviewer alluded, the protagonist has a ""special gift"" that makes it easy for him to solve crimes. Yes, I said easy and I mean it. Not that House is free of an unbelievable gimmick--that being his knowing everything about medicine and his infinite knowledge springs into action when it is time to solve the medical problem. However, in House, there is just a glimmer of credibility and truth that his genius intelligence and remarkable intuition can solve medical mysteries. In the 8 episodes of Lie to Me that I endured, I hoped for improvement. Nada improvement. Lie to Me's premise is simply a subset of the supernatural. Many people want to believe that there are special powers that enable some people to solve crimes and do other wonderful things. Boring show.",/review/rw4257363/?ref_=tt_urv
