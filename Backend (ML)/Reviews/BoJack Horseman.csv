16 February 2014,SnoopyStyle,8," Hilarious Jonah Hill and the nerdy Michael Cera
","Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera) are high school best friends and nerdy outsiders. It's almost the end of high school, and they're going their separate ways. Their weird friend Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) claims to be getting a fake ID. Seth is hot for friendly Jules (Emma Stone). When Jules invites Seth to her party, he volunteers to buy the booze. He's counting on Fogell to get the alcohol, but his fake ID name says McLOVIN.",/review/rw1695285/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2018,Gordon-11,," Impressive
","Normally I don't like this kind of film about teenagers trying to act like adults, but this film really works. It is funny, it has brotherhood, friendship and romance all in one. It is impolite at times but it is not over the top. It doesn't feel annoying or stupid either, which is actually quite impressive.",/review/rw1695285/?ref_=tt_urv

27 April 2020,Instant_Palmer,8," Supergood Millennials Coming of Age Film
","A lot can happen in 24 hours when two best-buddy co-dependent outlier H/S Seniors get an invite to the ""big party"". Teaming up with a third-wheel friend getting his fake ID with just one name ""McLovin"" starts the ball rolling down a steep slippery slope of chaotic comic events, and rapidly turns into a day and night that will forever be ingrained in their memories.",/review/rw1695285/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2020,masonsaul,9," Incredibly funny comedy
","Superbad is an incredibly funny comedy that's heartwarming, hilarious and shocking. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera are incredible and have amazing chemistry. Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Emma Stone are great. Seth Rogen and Bill Harder are perfect, consistently hilarious throughout but unfortunately steal every scene even when they're not supposed to. Greg Mottola's direction is great, it's well filmed and well paced. The music by Lyle Workman and the soundtrack are both really good.",/review/rw1695285/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2014,kosmasp,9," Comedy Special
","Maybe back then you couldn't tell what would become of Jonah Hill eventually (an Oscar nominated actor, playing with/against Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio) ... actually if you told anyone back then this would happen, they'd have written that in the script, because it would have sounded hilarious.",/review/rw1695285/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2010,wwe7961,10," Hilarious and also in many ways heartwarming.
","This movie is one of the funniest of the 21st century. The jokes are hilarious, and it is spoken by a great cast. Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Seth Rogen, and others are excellent in their roles. The characters they play you really latch on to you. They are extremely likable in many ways. The dialogue is also superb. It's a fast moving script that gives many great lines by the end of the movie. Also at the end I sorta felt some happiness. It's one thing to make me laugh throughout, but to make a vulgar comedy like this actually make my heart warm is a very big plus. It's a film about friendship, and that message manages to find its way through all the vulgar stuff.",/review/rw1695285/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2008,MovieAddict2016,8," Definitely the best Apatow-group film yet
","I enjoyed ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"" but didn't feel it was entirely worthy of all the enormous acclaim it garnered. And for all the praise ""Knocked Up"" received, I thought it was fairly average. So I wasn't expecting much from ""Superbad."" However, I'd have to say it's the smartest and funniest Apatow film yet. I know he didn't direct it, but his influence is distinct. And in the past I've felt indifferent towards Apatow's brand of humour, but combined with Rogen's sensitivity towards the teen condition here, it works really well.",/review/rw1695285/?ref_=tt_urv

11 April 2012,StevePulaski,9," One teenage comedy with extra wit and soul
","Superbad is a parable of values and friendship, reminding us that a good and earnest moral upbringing will be able to safely glide us through life and make us achieve happiness much easier. Its characters are well-mannered and sweet, not to mention inherently likable, as well as everything being morally correct and admirable.",/review/rw1695285/?ref_=tt_urv
29 February 2020,rooprect,8," The most ambitious teen rompcom I've ever seen
","Yes, it's funny. It's silly, it's crass, it's irreverant, and it has all the makings of a mindless adolescent farce like the ones I grew up with from American Pie to Revenge of the Nerds and all their sequels. But when this movie ended and the credits rolled I was left speechless in awe. And not just because of all the penis drawings during the credits.",/review/rw1695285/?ref_=tt_urv

16 December 2010,gigan-92,10," Raunchy yet Hearfelt
","One of the best comedies ever served in m y opinion. The all-too familiar Greg Mottola is the man at work here, and where credit is due I'll award points to the writer s Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. However, this film would drop dead on its face without its hilarious cast undoubtedly, Jonah Hill and Christopher Mintz-Plasse being the two most unforgettable stars. Michael Cera is the kind of, I suppose, innocent-type guy who is both driven by hormones yet conflicted by almost inhuman genuine-ness and politeness. Not too many laughs coming from his way but when he did, he did so superbly. Bill Hader and Set Rogen were just top notch. I would also like to amend Emma Stone as Jules, who delivered the greatest ""what the f*ck?!"" in a good while.",/review/rw1695285/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2007,vovazhd,8," One of the best comedies of the year
","Superbad may look like a typical high-school movie on the cover, but its actually much more. It follows a trio of high-school seniors that decide to have one last party before leaving for college (and one last shot at grabbing a girl). The trio consists of Seth, Evan, and Fogell. They make a likable main cast that is very easy to compare to. Their acting style is ideal for this type of film. Joining them are several other intriguing characters. My favorite were the two police officers, Slater and Michaels. Pretty much every scene with them made me laugh; from their references to other movies to the spoofs on being an officer, its classic slapstick comedy.",/review/rw1695285/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2007,unscripted1,9," Funniest Movie I've Seen In A Long Time

14 April 2007,nrbucco-1,10," Absolutely hilarious!!!
","I have been lucky enough to see two advanced screenings of Superbad in Burbank. It is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. When I read the summary, I was a bit skeptical. The ""high school comedy"" is not exactly my cup of tea. My love for Michael Cera's performance in Arrested Development drove me to the theater and man was I glad I went. This is not your typical high school comedy. The writing is much smarter and funnier and the acting is superb. This movie so far transcends American Pie and its ilk that it cannot really even be compared. Go see this movie!!! I have a feeling it is going to go off the charts once the buzz gets around about how hilarious it is.",/review/rw1695285/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2007,Datura618,8," Surprisingly Hilarious
","I was able to catch a screening of 'Superbad' last night in NYC and I was very pleased with the movie. I'm sure most will compare this to an 'American Pie' like comedy, but it's so much more than that. There were some ""shock value"" moments, but very well done to tip the scale more to funny than to gross.",/review/rw1695285/?ref_=tt_urv

","(My Synopsis) Three teenage friends Seth (Jonah Hill), Evan (Michael Cera), and Fogell, AKA ""McLovin"" (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) have only two more weeks before they graduate from high school. They have one mission in life and that is to score with a hot chick before they graduate. The only problem with that scenario is that all three are geeky nerds. Yet there is light at the end of the tunnel when Seth and Evan are invited to a cool party at the house of a hot chick. However, the only way they can come is to buy the liquor for the party. Fogell comes to the rescue with a fake ID. All three are driven to make this a night to remember, and what happens to them over the next several hours will be burnt into their memories forever.",/review/rw1695285/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2009,smatysia,5," Pretty darn dull
","This was pretty darn dull. I never laughed or even really smiled throughout. Okay, I am not the target demographic for this film, left that behind a few decades ago, but even so, this film leaves much to be desired. I got the jokes and gags, they just didn't do anything for me. I can recall talking (to a point) like these kids do, and I did think it was cool at the time. Now I realize that it was boorish and idiotic. I do have to compliment a couple of the young actresses, Martha MacIsaac, who looked awfully nice, and Emma Stone, who pulled off that ""teenage girl who is sophisticated beyond her years"" role. The two cops were painful, and none of it clicked at all, and so was totally unfunny. There is really no reason to watch this movie.",/review/rw1695285/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2007,benmorse,8," Excellent, hilarious teen movie with likable characters, for a change.
","Superbad is a teen movie. It also will draw comparisons to American Pie, in it's ""losers try to get laid"" themes, and occasional gross-out comedy. But the comparison is unfair - Superbad is a funnier, more subversive and more importantly genuine movie than American Pie or any of it's awful sequels were. The three central characters have a believable, likable relationship, that the film takes time to establish. Cera, Hill (who deserves special praise, for turning what could have been a really unlikeable character into a sweet, if loud-mouthed and crass, teenager) and Mintz-Plasse bounce of each other perfectly. The movie creates some funny situations, and more importantly, hilarious dialogue throughout. Aside from one comedic misfire - an overly long (and poorly judged) gross out sight gag involving a pair of trousers and a dance - Superbad had me laughing constantly. It's sweet, it's funny as hell, and it's established a load of new talent.",/review/rw1695285/?ref_=tt_urv
