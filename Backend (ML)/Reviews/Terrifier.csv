1 January 2021,TokyoGyaru,5," Too dumb to live, apparently.
",Do you ever watch a slasher film and the characters make SO MANY DUMB CHOICES that you stop hoping they'll get out of it and hope they're put out of their misery instead?,/review/rw4664716/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2018,horrorgasm,," Decent mindless slasher
","Yes there is almost no plot and it's very nihilistic and gratuitous, but it makes up for that with a truly creepy villain and some very well done and incredibly brutal gore effects. ",/review/rw4664716/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2021,Fella_shibby,7," Brutal n gory with sufficient atmosphere.
",I was not keen on seein this as i haven't seen any of the director's previous films. (Cos the killer in this movie is a spinoff).,/review/rw4664716/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2021,Coventry,8," Alright, I'll admit it, the clown is terrifying!
","Next to zombies, killer/evil clowns are the most dreadfully overused type of villains in horror cinema. So overused, I daresay, that we even reached a point where - like zombies - the clown has become a lame caricature that isn't the least bit menacing or scary anymore.",/review/rw4664716/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2022,Xstal,6," All the Fun of the Unfair...
","Here is a film that will induce a big frown, as a marauding psycho wanders around town, with oversized boots and a dark crooked smile, a bag full of tools to remove and restyle, expresses emotions with gesture and mime, will take all you've got when you've just reached your prime, no mercy or pity, as you beg and you plead, feasting on all features, as you drain and you bleed.",/review/rw4664716/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2018,claudio_carvalho,4," Promising Beginning, Terrible Collection of Stupidities and Clichés
","The overrated ""Terrifier"" is a horror film with a promising and funny beginning, with the alcoholic Dawn acting like a stupid and the clown accepting the silliness. Until the moment Tara and Dawn are abducted, the film works reasonably well. However, when Victoria drives to give a ride to her sister and Dawn, she hears that there is a serial killer in the area. But even being aware of the dangerous situation, she begins to take a series of very stupid e clichés attitudes culminating in the awful conclusion. My vote is four.",/review/rw4664716/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2018,derekjager,4," Like watching hide & seek for 90 mins; tedious & a bit dull
","This film really needed a PLOT. And characters, some people to root for. Instead, the poor pacing, lack of tension and suspense made for a kind of dull film experience. Yes, Art is a crazy, vicious clown killer. If that's all you want, then you'll see it here as he wounds, kills and dismembers people. The problem is, he will injure someone--a woman's ankle is almost torn out--and the next scene, she's running. People have their heads bashed in...and later, are able to get up and function. It really doesn't make a lot of sense and since Art seems to pop up in more places than possible, he's never really a surprise--he's overused. Clearly the director knew the story was thin, so every few minutes, Art pops up to attack someone. It really is disappointing since the short films showed some potential but when a whole film is given to Art, he's boring and predictable. I'm sure there will be another one--I hope the screenplay is given as much attention as the gore effects.",/review/rw4664716/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2022,deloudelouvain,2," Bad is an understatement.
","After reading all the fuzz of people fainting and/or vomiting, leaving the theater for Terrifier 2 I have to admit I was curious about the whole thing. I do like a little gore movie every now and then and my wife is terrified of clowns so that's a good reason to watch that movie. But first I decided to watch this one, the first one, just to be into the story and to be sure not missing anything from the whole plot. Well that was a big mistake. What a piece of crap this was and like I said before I do like gory movies but this one was so dumb I got bored after only fifteen minutes. Damien Leone gets two stars from me for the butchering parts that were okay considering the extremely low budget this movie must have. But the story, if you can call it that, was just so annoying to watch I already don't feel like watching the sequel. If it's of the same level I will probably not leave the room terrified but bored to death. I get it that this one was low budget but that doesn't necessarily mean you need to have bad actors but in this case you get your fair portion of very mediocre actors. The worst one was by far Pooya Mohseni. Please find another job and spare us from this garbage in the future. I hear McDonalds is hiring so there you go, there still hope for you. I will watch the sequel but to be honest I don't have high hopes. Hopefully I'm wrong. Verdict tomorrow...",/review/rw4664716/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2019,Platypuschow,5," Terrifier: Brutal but generic
","Art the Clown started back in 2011 with a short movie by the same name, truth be told I didn't like it. The creator Damien Leone would keep Art around in his feature film All Hallows' Eve (2013) but as a small role.",/review/rw4664716/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2018,spyroskonst,5," Wasted opportunity....
","Off to the good stuff first.
* The killer clown is the creepiest and scariest i have ever seen.
* Considering its budget, the cinematography, gore, effects and make up are outstanding.
* The killings are amazingly enjoyable. In this part the movie does not hold back!
* It starts out very promising.",/review/rw4664716/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2020,Leofwine_draca,2," Sleazy junk
","TERRIFIER is a filmic spin-off from an indie horror anthology called ALL HALLOWS' EVE. One of that film's segments featured a sadistic clown murdering women so here we have the same ""plot"" for an hour and a half. I might have appreciated this kind of back-to-basics slasher format back in the 1980s, but nowadays it just seems trite and sleazy, a film seemingly made by morons for morons. A mute clown wanders around, indestructible as usual, and kills everyone else in the film off. Plenty of effort has gone into elaborate and nasty gore effects, but there's no discernable characterisation, wit, plot, atmosphere, suspense or viewer involvement. In addition, the scene of the naked girl being dismembered goes way beyond the boundaries of good taste. Not for me.",/review/rw4664716/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2018,TheLittleSongbird,6," One will be terrified of this clown
","'Terrifier's' cover looked very cool and eerie. Furthermore, the concept was really intriguing and one of the best for any film personally seen recently. There are some halfway decent killer clown films out there and have an appreciation for horror. So yes 'Terrifier' was watched with some anticipation and want to like it, as well as some apprehension with so many wastes of potential on recent film viewings. ",/review/rw4664716/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2019,stuartvanlinden,8," Doesn't try to be anything other than what it is
","If you love old school gory psycho killer horror fare this is unmissable. ""Terrifier "" has no interest whatsoever in being smart, satirical or post modern, it just wants to wear its mean spirited, gory grindhouse heart on its sleeve - and good for it.",/review/rw4664716/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2020,matthewnoorman,2," Terrible
","How the heck are people giving this a good rating? The film has zero story line, piss poor acting, and the most overuse of gore in such a generic and unscary way, this film is so predictable its sad. And this film sets the record for most cliches in a horror movie and one of the dumbest protagonist in history.
Terrifier has no suspense, no fright, and in no way at all is this a good film.
Please if you gave this a good review please never review a film again. You don't know anything about it.",/review/rw4664716/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2018,papadeltazulu,9," Has its flaws but still one of the creepiest killer clown movies out there
","This obviously low budget killer clown flick had me in two minds. Finding out it was a re-imagining of the horror short or the same name, that eventually found its way into the horror anthology film ""All hallows eve"" kind of put me off. I saw that film a while ago and although Art the clown was a terrifying clown to look at, the film itself did nothing for me. ",/review/rw4664716/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2020,Clive_W,1," Damn haha

12 April 2018,BA_Harrison,9," Move over Pennywise.
","Expanded from director Damien Leone's 2011 short of the same name, Terrifier stars David Howard Thornton as silent psycho killer Art the Clown, who turns Halloween into a nightmare for several unfortunate victims, including friends Tara and Dawn (Jenna Kanell and Catherine Corcoran), and Dawn's big sister Victoria (Samantha Scaffidi).",/review/rw4664716/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2018,guambrat1,8," Loved it!
","This movie was insane. I am a horror lover and I don't see a lot of horror movies that actually deserve to be called a horror movie. This one does. It definitely has some of a B movie vibe, but not at all in a bad way. I actually enjoyed that aspect because it felt like it added to the film. This movie is definitely twisted and graphic, but it delivers.",/review/rw4664716/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2018,nunya6552,9," Listen, I get it...seems like garbage, but hear me out
","I think this movie is kind of like an homage to the grunge horror of the 1970's. There's no backstory. It really doesn't need one. The point is to horrify and it is absolutely terrifying. The actor that plays the clown is an actual mime, and he is so very good at being the creepiest thing you can imagine. His facial expressions, his walk, his body movements. Like, what the hell? Taps into that sort of fear. Ya know? Creepy smiles and no speaking? Standing still with an evil grin and then randomly moving fast as hell. No, ma'am. I'm a horror fanatic and I can see the downfalls of this movie, however, if you like a good B horror...give it a go!!",/review/rw4664716/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2018,spammer-08884,6," Better than expected
","I didn't hold out much hope for this movie. Was expecting the usual bad acting and shoddy plot. However I was mildly surprised. If you like gore, a little bit of nudity and a killer clown that kind off pulls of crazy without saying a word then this could be for you. Don't expect a Spielberg plot though.

7 September 2018,bfp13108,1," What the clown was this abomination?
",Worse movie of all times. Wanted to rate -10 but couldn't find option. Would rather have dissected myself with rusty saw but couldn't locate saw. Trapped in shame spiral for the ridiculous waste of 90 minutes. RUN! Save yourselves! It's too late for me.,/review/rw4664716/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2018,danocaster,2," Total Crap!
","What a waste. The movie starts out pretty good, with decent cinematography but quickly turns into a tedious bore. The killer clown is eerie at first but then it becomes apparent he's gonna be another Jason or Michael Myers, meaning you can't kill him no matter what you do. However, where the filmmakers really screwed up is by (SPOILER ALERT!). killing off the best character in the movie by far, Tara, the dark haired girl. I thought that the actress was very good and sympathetic and by killing her off in the first half it just wrecked it. We had no one else to care about.. After that all you have is super clown killing everybody. Some of the reviews make you think that you're seeing another great horror classic but I don't think so. A lot of work went into the gore effects but I wish they would have spent as much time on the story. It really goes bad in the second half and I was happy to see it end.",/review/rw4664716/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2018,elmoslively,2," What is the purpose of this film?
","This is a terrible film, full of gratuitous violence, bad acting and no real plot. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was in support of it's makeup, which were gross, but not that bad.",/review/rw4664716/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2019,umimelectric,1," Brainless Trash
","Complete trash, even by indie-horror standards. I don't understand how this has any positive reviews because the acting is garbage supreme, the dialogue is brainless, & the film is an hour and a half of unnecessary torture porn for wannabe future serial killers to watch in mom's basement. If you want to see an unfrightening, predictable clown continuously win against innocent people (mostly women) in disgusting fashion, then look no further. Horror films like this are detrimental to my favorite genre; contributing nothing new, while poisoning people's minds.",/review/rw4664716/?ref_=tt_urv
