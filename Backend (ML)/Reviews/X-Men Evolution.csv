27 June 2016,Leofwine_draca,8," Cheesy, derivative...and huge fun
","DOOMSDAY is one huge mess of a movie, but in a good way. Neil Marshall, the Scottish director of such low budget but entertaining fare as DOG SOLDIERS and THE DESCENT, apparently decided to make a good old-fashioned post apocalypse movie while paying tribute to his favourite movies along the way. Some might call this film a rip off of the popular '80s sci fi films, some might call it a pastiche, while others might call it a homage. For me, DOOMSDAY is original enough to be entertaining throughout, even if the story is all over the place and frequently unbelievable (even by genre stakes) and the epilogue is a damp squib compared to what's come before.",/review/rw1938470/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2010,Cujo108,," Homage to the post-apocalyptic
","It's April 2008, and a sudden viral outbreak has hit Scotland hard. To contain the deadly bug (dubbed the Reaper Virus), the British government works quickly to build a containment wall around the afflicted country. The possibility of the disease spreading to the rest of the world appears to have been effectively stopped in it's tracks. Fast forward 30 years and the virus has reappeared, this time in London. Satellite monitoring has picked up images of apparent survivors in the hot zone, which leads the government to suspect the potential for a cure. Desperate to put an end to the reborn plague, the Brits send a team of soldiers into the walled off country in the hopes that they can find the cure that may not even exist.",/review/rw1938470/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2008,Superunknovvn,6," A fun but deliberately dumb movie with nothing original
","Like Greg Mclean, director of ""Wolf Creek"" and another great white hope for the horror genre, Neil Marshall followed a very promising horror flick with a deliberately trashy project. Where Mclean directed his attention to a murderous crocodile, Marshall took a bow to two of his favorite movies, ""Escape From New York"" and ""Mad Max"". ""Doomsday"" is not just influenced by those two movies, it's practically a mash-up with the female heroine from ""Underworld"" thrown-in. So, the first thing you should forget about when you pop in this movie is originality. Marshall makes no excuses for paying homage to his heroes George Miller and John Carpenter (hell, he even named two characters in this movie after them).",/review/rw1938470/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2008,Prof-Hieronymos-Grost,6," Crazy plagiaristic fun
","A deadly virus of unknown origin has spread rapidly through Glasgow, Scotland, killing its victims rapidly. The British government has built a 12 foot steel wall the whole length of the Scottish/English Border in super quick time, so that nobody can get in or out and so the Scots can rot away to their hearts content. 20 years later in London and there is another outbreak and so the government is forced to act, they know that there are still survivors beyond the wall and so they send a crack team of experts in, to find out if they possibly have immunity and to find the mysterious Dr Kane a scientist they believe might have been working on a cure. The leader of this expedition is Maj. Eden Sinclair, a one eyed woman who as a child had been saved by soldiers at the last moment before the wall closed for the last time. her motives are to see her family home and perhaps find her mother.",/review/rw1938470/?ref_=tt_urv

22 March 2008,angelynx-2,8," Gonzo mix of Mad Max, Escape from NY and 28 Days Later
","What an insane movie! I saw it in a criminally tiny Saturday afternoon audience (four people) and we all had a terrific time. Don't expect sense, great acting or original dialogue, just go for the kicks and enjoy. A totally deranged, over-the-top splatfest with hideous viral deaths galore, some of the best post-holocaust punk makeup and chase scenes since Road Warrior, brilliant use of 1980's dance music (Adam and the Ants, Frankie Goes to Hollywood--the placement of Siouxie and the Banshees' ""Spellbound"" and a Fine Young Cannibals track at the punk barbecue is simply inspired), a coliseum battle-to-the-death, a bizarre interlude in a Scottish fiefdom that feels as if the movie took a fast detour into the Shire, and the coolest star turn by a UK car since Harry Potter's posse made one fly. All of it snapping and crackling with so much kinetic energy and wild creative freedom that it's hugely exhilarating. We were still giggling like maniacs an hour after the movie.=) It's just such fun to see a director decide to go full-speed over the edge like this. It's not great art, but trust me, if you enjoyed Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, Planet Terror, Escape from New York/L.A., and/or any recent zombie movie, you can't miss this one.",/review/rw1938470/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2008,mirwais-orbit,9," Maybe ridiculous, but an interesting action thing

28 May 2011,bob_bear,4," Been Done Before And Better = What was the point?
","In my experience, you know you're onto a loser from the get-go when the film starts with a voice over. In this case, one that goes on and on, filling you in on the back-story. Film is a visual medium. If the director cannot set up the film without a lengthy spoken intro then he is not much of a director in my humble opinion.",/review/rw1938470/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2008,dee.reid,9," ""Doomsday"" - The end is nigh!
","""Doomsday,"" the third feature from British ""B""-movie tour de force writer-director Neil Marshall, is a rehash of several distant cult movies, including both of Marshall's previous films, which are also considered cult classics. Yet, that doesn't make ""Doomsday"" even remotely bad, but it does make it very interesting not just to follow the story along, but to also point out the many references to films past.",/review/rw1938470/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2009,ma-cortes,6," A futuristic movie full of kinetic energy and amazing stunt work
","This thunderous picture begins in Great Britain, 2007 . A deadly virus spreads causing hundreds of thousands infecting . The government evacuates people and builds an impregnable wall along with the Wall of Adriano, impeding the access . London, 2035 recent time, the reaper virus breaks out again. Then , various authorities, P.M (Alexander Siddig) and Canaris(David O'Hara)decide to send a specialists team. Nelson(Bob Hoskins) assigns the dangerous mission to Major Eden (Rhona Mitra). She along with a crack group (Adrian Lester, Sean Petwee, among others)are urgently dispatched into quarantined Scotland to meet Doctor Kane (Malcolm McDowell)who allegedly has a cure. In the near-future Glascow city, they'll have to fight against cutthroats, a band of depraved crazies thirsty for blood and survive some battles to-the-death.",/review/rw1938470/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2008,brains-19,," Doomsday
","If you enjoyed 28 Days Later, Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome and  Gladiator, this might be the film for you. Writer and Director Neil  Marshall (Dog Soldiers, The Descent) an obvious student of genre  movies, has managed to smoothly craft together a cinematic  Frankenstein's monster of sci-fi action clichés. Gratuitous blood  geysers? Check. Insane, post-apocalyptic punks? Check. Buff, beautiful,  uber-bad-ass heroine that can kill without a moment's hesitation but  still possesses superior morals to those that command her? Check.  Ego-maniacal bad guy played by Malcolm McDowell? Check. Ticking clock  to doomsday? Check.  Marshall has skillfully engineered what is truly an homage to the genre  movie and an action buffet for moviegoers with appropriate kitsch and  over-the-topness without lowering himself to the realm of spoof.  If you're looking for high cinema don't look here, but if you're  looking for excitement, humor and an overall really good time, Doomsday  will certainly fit the bill.",/review/rw1938470/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2008,Jonny_Numb,5," Don't forget Excalibur when you Escape from New York 28 Days Later
","A bubble of such near-impenetrable critical praise surrounded ""The Descent"" back in 2006 that any argument of its greatness became moot, and for good reason: not since ""The Blair Witch Project"" had a horror film been given such unanimous praise. And while I don't hold ""The Descent"" on a master's level (I think the claustrophobic horror bests the creature-driven stuff), I still think it was a confident effort from Neil Marshall, who bucked the torture-porn trend to deliver something tense and effective. Even its winks toward genre favorites like ""Alien"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" seemed like fitting Valentines from one film-making generation to another.",/review/rw1938470/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2008,bob the moo,," Marshall goes ""all in"" with a gamble that doesn't pay off but is surprisingly entertaining
","A lethal virus has hit the UK (we just can't get a break, can we?) and the Government has taken the drastic measures of quarantining the infected by shutting off Scotland and part of the North of England and simply leaving it to die. In terms of those outside of the quarantine zone the measures are successful  or at least it appears this way for several decades, until the virus again manifests itself in a major city. With evidence of survivors inside the quarantine zone, the authorities realise that some form of cure must have been found and dispatch a military unit led by Major Eden Sinclair, to retrieve it.",/review/rw1938470/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2008,SimonHeide,1," Embarrassing experience to watch....

1 April 2008,Coventry,9," Fancy a trip to the beautiful Scottish Highlands?
","Neil Marshall, the multi-talented British director who previously made the gory but nevertheless tasteful ""Dog Soldiers"" and ""The Descent"", surprises and primarily pleases his fan-base audiences with this mega-outrageous, campy and tasteless SciFi-horror-action hybrid that is simply destined to become a cult classic within the next couple of years already. I was lucky enough to see the film during a national film festival, where Neil Marshall was at guest himself to single-handedly present his film to anxious Belgian genre fans. Marshall described his own film in only a few words, but it was much better than any film-critic could ever do it in his place. He openly admitted that ""Doomsday"" is principally a direct love letter to all the movies he grew up with and that he deliberately stuffed the screenplay with numerous tributes and hidden references towards the paranoid and apocalyptic Sci-Fi (road-) movies of the early 80's. It only requires a glimpse at the screen and you immediately know Marshall is right. ""Doomsday"" catapults you straight back to the glorious days of cheesy exploitation where literally everything was possible and plot-logic and coherence weren't necessities. The two main inspirations for the film are obviously ""Mad Max"" and ""Escape from N.Y."", but talking in terms of absurd plot twists, OTT set pieces and flamboyant costume designs, uncompromising gore, deliberately bad acting performances and insane character drawings, ""Doomsday"" is actually far more reminiscent to the (mainly Italian) rip-off industry of that time. Apart from the aforementioned and acclaimed landmarks, I also recognized bits and pieces  though I may be mistaken of course - of far more obscure titles like ""The Atlantis Interceptors"", ""After the Fall of New York"", ""2033: The New Gladiators"", ""The Bronx Warriors"", ""Warriors of the Wasteland"" and countless of others.",/review/rw1938470/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2010,Theo Robertson,6," Unoriginal , Bizarre But Watchable Post Apocalyptic Thriller
","I remember both DOG SOLDIERS and THE DESCENT , two very different horror movies in both tone and feel . I wondered how writer/director would follow up on this . DOOMSDAY came along and got slaughtered by the critics and bombed at the box office so I made no attempt to see it until it came along on Sky movies recently . Whilst the critics are right to a certain degree it's nowhere bad as some of them claimed . It's certainly far from a masterpiece of course but is far more enjoyable than I was expecting ",/review/rw1938470/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2008,Mysticum,1," Unintentionally Hilarious
","This is, without a doubt, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is so fantastically bad, I could talk for hours and hours about each and every little atrociously bad element of the movie. I am no stranger to the incredible or the suspension of disbelief required of any sci-fi fan wishing to be entertained. I love outlandish and outrageous things! I cannot, however, abide things which are literally UN-BELIEVABLE, and which conflict with ANY world, fictional or not.",/review/rw1938470/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2008,diseriq,8," ridiculously retarded B movie that is fun fun fun!
","OK, like before DOOMSDAY, Neil Marshall made two great films, DOG SOILDERS and THE DESCENT, so going into this, i had high expectations. then i heard all of the negative buzz on the internet for months and months. so then i had low expectations. and the trailer sucked. basically, if you go into this film expecting anything serious at all, then yeah, you're going to be disappointed, because this is in no way a serious movie sci-fi action future apocalypse thriller. what it is - a tongue in cheek splatter fest homage to the great John Carpenter movies of the 80s and with a bunch of mad max thrown in. if you loved PLANET TERROR, then you will dig on this. really this flick reminded me of the vibe of BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA or CRANK. i'm not sure why more people weren't laughing, cause this film is simply hilarious. it just gets more and more over the top! cannibalistic punks BBQ one of our heroes to Siouxsie and the Banshees ""Spellbound."" and they have a GIMP!! little furry bunnies get blown up, and cows are squashed via tanks! oh yeah, look at you now, all covered in virus infected blood prime minister. what did you say, who is that guy? oh yeah! it's Dr Bashir from Star Trek Deep Space Nine, yes!!!

14 March 2008,Quinoa1984,4," ...Neil Marshall made this?
","It seemed a little circumspect from the outset that Doomsday could be a disappointment. Despite a trailer that looked kind of 'rad', mostly for its wild bits of action and throwbacks to Mad Max and Escape from New York, it was not screened for any critics. For most horror or other genre features I could understand. But Neil Marshall? This was the same man who provided us with the Descent, one of the great horror films of the past decade (I have yet to see Dog Soldiers, his Scottish werewolf movie). There must have been some mistake.",/review/rw1938470/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2008,jeepcj5guy,3," Mad Max Meets a Big Pile of Lame
","I certainly didn't rent this movie expecting anything good, just something mildly entertaining. What I received was slightly less than entertaining. In this Mad Max wannabe film, mohawked road-warriors have simply been replaced with slightly more stylish, punk-looking freaks with equally overdone mohawks, copious piercings and unrealistically flawless tattoos. How these people got ahold of all the tattoo guns and yet have no actual firearms is beyond me. How these club-swinging, Molotov-throwing ruffians are somehow starving and forced to subsist on human flesh yet the protagonists drive through a herd of cattle prior to entering post-apocalyptic Glasgow is also beyond my comprehension.",/review/rw1938470/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2008,MrGoodB,2," 28 Years Later: Escape from LV-246
","Now this one is what you see when you look up ""letdown"" in a dictionary. It started out decent, even promising, with a suitably gloomy introduction that, while not exactly what I would call innovative, set the mood very nicely: in the near future, the fatal Reaper virus decimated Scotland and now threatens to makes all human life in the UK a thing of the past. Extreme conditions demand extreme responses, and so the government revives the time-honored British tradition of building humongous barriers across the country. Hadrian's Wall 2.0 is finally finished, the gates are welded shut, the automated sentry guns come online (much to the dismay of the local fauna), what's left of Scotland is sealed off from the rest of the world and everyone is happy.
