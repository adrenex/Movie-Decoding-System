13 December 2021,southdavid,2," A tragedy, in every sense.
","Taste is, of course, a unique thing. As I write this review ""House of Gucci"" has a score of 6.9 which is baffling to me, as the film I sat through last Saturday was an unmitigated disaster. One that's story is too boring to even allow you to enjoy the hilariously bad performances.",/review/rw7583591/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2022,kellielulu,7," First rate cast, popcorn movie
",It's not nearly as bad as some feel it is but it isn't necessarily at the level it was expected to be.,/review/rw7583591/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2021,TheLittleSongbird,6," Very odd and uneven but also quite fun and intriguing
","There were quite a number of reasons for wanting to see 'House of Gucci'. The advertising did intrigue and did suggest a film that would be over the top but entertaining in its own way. Ridley Scott's filmography is hit and miss, brilliant at his best like with 'Alien' and 'Blade Runner' though some of his films, such as 'GI Jane' and 'Robin Hood' ('Legend' is underrated in my view), are not too great. The main draw though was the cast, with Lady Gaga (an immensely gifted performer and inspirational person) being a big selling point for many.",/review/rw7583591/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2022,SnoopyStyle,6," all about the accent
",It's 1978 Milan. Patrizia Reggiani (Lady Gaga) meets Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver) at a nightclub. He is the heir to a large portion of the fashion house Gucci but his father disapproves of her supposed mafia family although they only own a small trucking company. He marries her anyways and his father disowns him.,/review/rw7583591/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2021,movieman6-413-929510,5," With more detail, different casting, and definitely better script writers, the movie could have been better.

27 November 2021,lovemichaeljordan,7," Impressive visuals but underwhelming conclusion
","""House of Gucci"" is a beautifully shot picture with great people involved. It is somewhat underwhelming and a tad too long, but there are great moments sprinkled throughout the movie.",/review/rw7583591/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2022,Sleepin_Dragon,6," A baffling story, a very long film.
","House of Gucci is probably the most stylish film of 2021, it looked awesome, this was beautifully made, the quality of production and direction is phenomenal. It isn't just style over substance though, it's well made, generally well acted, it tells a fascinating and twisted story.",/review/rw7583591/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2022,CinemaClown,," A Tonal Nightmare With A Mind Of Its Own
","A film so out of its mind that it is operating entirely on impulses, House of Gucci makes for a wild, inconsistent & unabashedly over-the-top biographical crime drama that chronicles the downfall of the Gucci family dynasty without any intent or interest and is surprisingly fuelled by absolutely unhinged performances, each functioning on a separate wavelength and pointed in a different direction.",/review/rw7583591/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2021,fciocca,5," A movie with a lot of potential, completely wasted. Many sequences feel odd, empty and unnecessary.
","""House of Gucci"" portrays Maurizio Gucci and Patrizia Reggiani, trying to expand the family business. Gucci in the 60s was already a big empire and as an outsider that never really cared about fashion, I am not really sure what was the point of this motion picture. The film shows how Maurizio took over the company with his unethical methods, but aside from ruining completely the relationship with his own family members, it seems that he did not accomplish anything. He improved nothing in the business and took the enterprise to the verge of bankruptcy, so he did more harm than good. Patrizia Reggiani was for the whole time so manipulative, and I hated her character for the whole time. She was in fact after the Gucci money. Maurizio should have listened to his father. The beginning of their relationship is portrayed in such a childish and immature way. I refuse to believe that this is what really happened between the two. At this point I would have preferred to watch a film about Aldo Gucci, and how he managed to transform a small business into such a big and rich company. It would have been way more interesting and at least I would have walked out of the theatre with a little bit more knowledge.",/review/rw7583591/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2021,ferguson-6,7," the joys of family
","Greetings again from the darkness. I've never purchased or owned anything Gucci, but that didn't prevent me from enjoying the heck out of Ridley Scott's film that brings the longest, most expensive and dangerous real life episode of 'Family Feud' to the big screen. It's co-written by Becky Johnston and Roberto Bentivegna, and is based on the 2001 book, ""House of Gucci: A Sensational Story of Murder, Madness, Glamour, and Greed"" by Sara Gay Forden. Brace yourself for a (mostly) true wild ride, and for what is likely to be one of the year's most divisive films - plenty of love and hate (just like the actual story).",/review/rw7583591/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2021,severindringel,5," When Americans pretend to be Italian...
","The second Ridley Scott film of this year is here! After his medieval epic The Last Duel flopped brilliantly at the box office, he can expect more in this respect with House of Gucci. Not only is Gucci one of the most famous and prestigious fashion brands, Lady Gaga is also in the lead role. I guess the strong fanbase of the singer will not be asked a second time. In the film, she suddenly finds herself part of the Gucci dynasty and becomes the protagonist of a toxic power struggle.",/review/rw7583591/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2021,bastille-852-731547,5," Bloated Gucci epic doesn't fully satisfy
","Ridley Scott assembled an all-star cast for his period crime drama ""House of Gucci,"" but unfortunately the film's quality doesn't match the talents of those involved. The film tells the story of the relationship between Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver) and Patrizia Reggiani (Lady Gaga,) as Maurizio tries to exert greater control over Gucci and expand its financial footing. Despite what the trailers may have you believe, most of the movie isn't about the assassination of Maurizio. While the film tries to settle on a variety of tones and plot points to emphasize, it ends up being a giant mess on many levels.",/review/rw7583591/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2021,eagandersongil,7," Post production problems
","'A Casa Gucci', new film by the award-winning and great director Ridley Scott is a film with good moments but with several problems, especially in the script, we have many great characters that are left without construction while we have repetitive scenes, the more than two and a half hours of film are poorly used, the chronological transitions are painful and the story that is contacted, at least in my personal opinion, was not what we expected, I wanted to see the history of the brand as a whole and we see only 20 years of it focused on the couple that acted partially in command of the operation, this large zoom in a small part of a great journey leaves a lot to be desired, we have no explanation of the climax, we do not have the construction of important facts, often, great events simply happen and change the direction of the film without any impact to the viewer.",/review/rw7583591/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2021,bob-the-movie-man,6," An Accent-uated study of family strife.
","As I'm on holiday at the moment in Portugal, this was seen as ""Casa de Gucci"". But the soundtrack was English with Portuguese subtitles. At least, I *think* it was English!",/review/rw7583591/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2021,dierregi,5," Decent fictional biopic, sloppy soundtrack
","Based on true events usually means that the true events are fictionalized and made more spectacular. Since I am Italian, I already knew what happened between Patrizia Reggiani and Maurizio Gucci, because at the time their lurid story occupied headlines in national newspapers. The real story seemed to have gone more or less as described, with Patrizia being a vulgar gold digger, who used to consult fortune tellers and ended up hiring her killer via her ""clairvoyant"" BFF, once Maurizio dumped her.",/review/rw7583591/?ref_=tt_urv

25 March 2022,trimblair,1," Most boring movie of 2021
","Wow .. awards? Is it a trophy for biggest waste of film? Most boring movie? The ""Star Wars"" guy was great. Gaga did little. Just a long, slow March to nowhere. People were walking out. I should have joined them.",/review/rw7583591/?ref_=tt_urv

28 November 2021,sunildaswaney-63642,6," TOO LONG!
","This movie would have been a much better movie if it was edited more tightly as at 2.37 hrs running time it was definitely too long and thus very slow and dreary.

24 November 2021,robfollower,8," House of Gucci (2021)
","Gaga delivers a stellar performance as Patrizia, melodramatic, yet full of charisma, loaded with personality, undeniable magnetism, and total commitment to her character.
