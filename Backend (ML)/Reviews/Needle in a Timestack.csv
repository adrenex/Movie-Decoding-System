",This post apocalypse movie is good one. It has that right amount of thrill at right moments. You will feel like you have seen movies like it but trust me it is a good and fresh movie surely. A good watch for thriller fans.,/review/rw5598508/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2018,tresm87,7," More believable and realistic than most post apocalyptic films.
","Overall this was a very solid story that held some nice emotional depth between the main couple surviving the insanity with some fantastic action packed thrills , and truly awesome post apocalyptic atmosphere that was shot brilliantly. I definitely recommend this and predict it will become a realistic foretelling post apocalyptic cult classic. I loved that it was set in northern Minnesota and Wisconsin.",/review/rw5598508/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2018,Top_Dawg_Critic,9," One of the better B-grade movies I've seen!
","One doorknob reviewer gave this film a 2 because it's a B-grade film. So what, clearly just because it's not a huge Hollywood blockbuster production with A-list actors doesn't make this film worth a 2/10.",/review/rw5598508/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2018,petera00,9," Don't read these nerds quoting Supergirl and Superman - it's a good flick
","For too long IMDB has fallen into the hands of nerds obessesed with the new CW DC comics bug... Or the genre hype that unfortunately horror has become. This movie is legit and extremely entertaining. I wouldn't compare this to the Purge at all, but more off Walter Hill's Warriors meets Mad Max. I have a problem with critics from IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes because these people wouldn't know the difference from Bergman, Truffaut to Fulci, Bava and Argento. They misquote every genre film now and expect it to be something that it isn't. Honestly don't go into this picture thinking it's like this years hit Hereditary - because it's not. It's pure entertainment and not some bloated indie crap that they're trying to elevate as elevated horror. Honestly this has more off a grindhouse sploitation feel to it. So stop listening to these nerds belittling it and saying it doesn't make any sense... Go into it with the fresh approach that it's just fun and entertaining... Because that's what film's and especially genre films should be... FUN. And this my friends is one of the better films that doesn't care about social crap that''s come out this year.",/review/rw5598508/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2018,deloudelouvain,7," Mixture of The Warriors and Mad Max
","I don't know anything about the director Mike P. Nelson except that he was clearly inspired by movies that I loved when I was young. There is no doubt in my mind that he was inspired by The Warriors (1979) from Walter Hill and by Mad Max (1979) from George Miller. By The Warriors for the narrating radio voice that warns about the different gangs operating in different sectors, and by Mad Max for the apocalyptic view of the world and the customized vehicles. I couldn't stop thinking about that while watching the movie and apparently I'm not the only one since I read another review thinking the same. I loved The Warriors, and I still do after all those years, so to me it was easy to like The Domestics, because in a way it brought back those memories. But The Domestics was just inspired by it, for the rest it's a totally different movie and story. I can get that people don't like it. Those people would probably not like The Warriors and Mad Max either. But if you did like those I'm sure you will like this one as well. The acting was certainly not bad for a so-called B-movie. I'm aware that the story doesn't make much logic sometimes but I was not expecting that either with this kind of post-apocalytic story. I's just a bit of easy entertainment, the kind I like everynow and then.",/review/rw5598508/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2018,Chrispearce2,6," 6 is about right
",Not sure how anyone can rate this 9 or 10. It's not godfather or shawshank. It's an average film that's good for a Sunday afternoon hangover. No more and no less.,/review/rw5598508/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2018,nogodnomasters,7," Go big or go home.
","For some reason, the government killed off most of the population and ceased to exist. Not sure of the premise. We are about three years into the apocalypse. Some of the names of the gangs are Cherry, Gamblers, Plowboys, and Nailers. One wears animal heads which has to smell and be uncomfortable. The state of Wisconsin is divided into gang territories. One home had a generator while others had unexplained electricity. Mark (Tyler Hoechlin) and Nina (Kate Bosworth) a couple on the fritz, decide they are going to travel 192 miles to Milwaukee to visit her parents who haven't answered their shortwave in a while. They take the long way to avoid the gangs along the main road only to encounter them on the side roads. It appears Wisconsin has enough beer, gas, and guns for the apocalypse but is short on women.",/review/rw5598508/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2021,surfisfun,7," very decent horror with black comedy.
","Good sets .cartoonish action.
great first full length movie from this director.
good costumes.
some questionable lengthy moments .
still a good mix of road warriors/ the Warriors on a budget.
recommended",/review/rw5598508/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2018,awfulketchup,7," Pretty fun and over the top
","So people kept telling me that this was The Purge meets Mad Max.
I can't really say i'm a fan of The purge, but however i very much adore Mad Max
and post-apocalyptic themes.",/review/rw5598508/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2018,roxalien,8," Decent flick
",I have no idea what the low rating people were expecting. It obviously is not an Oscar movie and doesn't want to be. It also did not want to have some grand plot. It's just a nicely done action and gore move in a post-apocalyptic setting. ,/review/rw5598508/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2018,claudio_carvalho,3," Garbage with Fake Reviews
","IMDb used to be a serious site about cinema; however it is impressive the number of fake reviews some films have after the recent modification of this site. ""The Domestics"" is one of them. There are reviews promoting this garbage with the intention of luring the unwary reader. ",/review/rw5598508/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2018,dfibuchuk-32795,5," Seriously?
","I don't really mind rubbish films, it passes the time. But what I don't get is how the wife is all like ""I just want to hide and go home to mommy"" for most of the movie, then she listens to some rock record, has a drink, shoots couple of rounds at a dummy and suddenly she's frigging Lara Croft shooting everyone and asking her husband to ""cover me""! Her acting is just terrible and I seriously hate her character. Other than that movie was ok.",/review/rw5598508/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2019,UniqueParticle,10," Love love love this movie, great concept and masks are awesome!
",I wish I was saw this sooner so glad it's on Hulu! I relish so much about a story like this and I am sure the creators had fun making a paranoid world full of loonies and pure badass characters. I know I will be among very few to enjoy this action/horror survival extravaganza but f it man everyone is different for good reasons; there's some sweet parts like when Kate Bosworth dances to some intense music while some weird sadistic stuff takes place upstairs from her. Solid love it or hate it type.,/review/rw5598508/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2018,mhorg2018,1," Beyond terrible
","I'm really beginning to think that a lot of the reviews on IMDB are by the filmmakers family and friends. I don't see how anyone could rate this silliness beyond a 1. A little movie review. Recently I watched 2018 Post-Apocalyptic movie called ""The Domestics."" Let me be honest here, it should have been called The Dumbestics. It's everything I hate in a Post-Apocalyptic movie. Most of all, it's a movie where there's no logic at all. This is a problem with most films of this type. First, we learn that the US Government has gassed most of the populace, killing off 97 percent of the populace. 97 percent! Yet there are all kinds of gangs running about. There's no kind of timeline, so we don't know how long things have progressed. The main characters are a husband and wife whose marriage is on the collapse. So to save it, they head to Milwaukee where her parents are. They run into and get out of many problems - problem is - none of it's believable. In a space of about four days, wife goes from nimrod barely able to survive, to valkyrie. There's a mystery woman who saves them time and again before she... no that would be telling. Finally, like most films that really annoy me - it just ends. There's also an annoying as hell Radio announcer (much like the 70's film Vanishing Point). It's just a dull mish-mosh of ideas with very little thought behind it. It's like a paint by numbers of how NOT to do a post-apocalyptic movie.",/review/rw5598508/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2018,simoncrunch,5," what was that?
","The movie should be called ""two people who don't realize the world is now dangerous & act like idiots..oh, and the guy keeps getting his gun taken away""",/review/rw5598508/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2020,bgar-80932,6," Not bad
",This is a typical post apocalyptic film with all the goofy gangs and such that show up. Don't get me wrong I do think gangs would appear but they're always so over the top in these type of movies (wearing animals heads and spinning to decide if someone lives for example). This one wasn't bad though and followed a couple that was in the process of divorce before they had to start fighting for survival together. The couple is endearing which is what makes this work. Doesn't re-invent the wheel but if you have an hour and a half to kill you can do worse.,/review/rw5598508/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2018,psychposters,5," its exactly how you think its gonna be
","I thought oh...another Purge-esq film, which is not a far shot . but i did get a warriors, vanishing point roadtrip vibe. this film kinda fits in sowmewhere with other post apoc films somehere between the first mad mad and road warrior in terms of the worlds timeline this film inhabits.. i didnt think it was afwul or unentertaining just doesnt do anything new with it. had no problems with the actors either, think it is exactly what it is in the trailer, nothing more nothing less. probably couldve used some more horror and suspense as it stands now its like something youd see on syfy channel late at night. nothing new really. would i watch it again? probably not unless they dig up an alternate cut of the film that has more action.. but once was ok for the genre post apocalypse crowd.",/review/rw5598508/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2018,stevelomas-69401,5," A dispointing dystopia.

29 October 2018,Molly1916,5," Wife made the movie annoying
","I'm only 20 minutes in and I'm hoping the wife gets killed. The husband is her doormat. Let me explain...
A post apocalyptic world run by murderous gangs but the couple are living in a relatively safe area.
However to 'save their marriage' they're going on a road trip to see her parents 😐. Because that's your concern when your trying to stay alive right? Your marriage. Holy jayzus!",/review/rw5598508/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2018,vetourproductions,8," Modern day ""warriors""
","That's a bold statement, I know, but remember as excellent as ""warriors"" was, it was also silly at times and limited in the action sequences. Domestics took the premise and ran with it. This is a story of a couple meandering their way through uncharted terroritories, with a menagerie or exaggerated gangs to contend with. From the ""sheets"" to the ""gamblers"" I was impressed with their individual designs. (That's about it for warriors similarities) Decent gore, not over the top, leaves room for surprising disgust moments. Some Kills off camera, some exploding faces... plot holes and bad cuts peppered throughout, yet the acting is well done for minimal back story fueled motivations. Definitely a fun watch but know what you're going into.",/review/rw5598508/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2018,markhappyboy,6," A fun ride!
","I'm not a fan of post apocalyptic movies by any means Mad Max
being the exception ( I hated The Road ) it's a genre I find almost
always a bit depressing, but I had so much fun watching this movie!

7 July 2018,seacargm,1," Terrible
","More plot holes that I can count, weak premise and unrelatable characters, the list of flaws for this is endless. And the unrelenting march of unexplained details was ridiculous: Every world government decided to kill off their population simultaneously? Gasoline still works after 900 days? The wife talked to her mother on the radio every day despite them being almost 200 miles apart and using what appears to be a CB with a maximum range of about 5 miles.

1 April 2020,ten-thousand-marbles,7," Better than most post apocalyptic movies
","Do some implausible things happen? Of course. It's a post apocalyptic movie. This is forgiven due to the fact that it's well put together vs what the norm is. The scripts and acting are decent The characters are fairly well thought out and there's plenty going on with the story and action factor to keep you engaged. I might have liked to have seen a few things switched up, but overall there's not much to complain about. Can't say that for a lot of the movies in this genre.",/review/rw5598508/?ref_=tt_urv
