15 July 2017,pyrocitor,10," Welcome home, web-head
","Spider-Fans are a thick-skinned lot. And, in watching his attempts to crawl onto the big screen, we've taken some gut-punches. From the early, fun-but-twee Sam Raimi days to the murky, Marc Webb hipster days (to say nothing of the nightmare of 'Dancing Emo Peter' - a farce of idiocy the character will be lucky to ever shrug off), we've watched our boy take more beats than a bout with Doctor Octopus. So, even finally(!) reacquainted with his REAL parents - a Marvellous accomplishment in itself - dare we hope? In the face of so much misguided corporate overreach, hackneyed tonal imbalance, flagrant disregard for comic backstory, and (shudder) hip-thrusts, dare we dream the dream of a half-decent cinematic Spider-Man, for the first time in more than some viewers' lifetimes?

31 January 2020,filipemanuelneto,9," Pleasant to the eyes and ears, this film tried to escape a little from the standard of the comic strip films.
","This film marks the third film in the Spiderman franchise, under the seal of Marvel. In this film, young Peter Parker tries to harmonize his normal teenage life with the action and risks of a masked hero. Contrary to the other films, where he makes memorable actions thanks to luck and a handful of skill, in this film they are the problems that come to Peter.",/review/rw3749595/?ref_=tt_urv

",Good movie for a Spider man. We already know the big events of Peter Parker and its still nice to see new faces. Some moments are pretty great and have some dramatic tension. Its pretty good but classic for Spider-man story.,/review/rw3749595/?ref_=tt_urv

","Spider-Man: Homecoming continues with the adventures of Peter Parker/Spider-Man(Tom Holland), following the events of Captain America: Civil War(2016). Peter juggles his high school life & his crime fighting life, as Spider-Man. He has help from Tony Stark/Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.). Peter's life gets complicated when Spider- Man faces his most formidable adversary yet, Adrian Toomes/Vulture(Michael Keaton). Now, it is up to Spider-Man to stop the Vulture, before it's too late.

","I saw this movie in theaters and wasn't even looking forward to it that much. I didn't think that it was going to be bad, I just hadn't been carried away by the internet hype before I watched it.

29 June 2020,andrewnmiller,10," A breath of fresh air for Marvel's prodigal son.
","Following the massive underperformance of the Amazing Spiderman 2 in 2014, Sony Pictures was in a difficult position as while the Spiderman films were still making good money at the box-office, something needed to be done to shake things up on the filmmaking side of things as the company had no intent to sell the Spiderman rights to Marvel due to their own financial problems but with fan support for Peter Parker to join the MCU growing louder, it became obvious that Sony would need help with the future of Spiderman on film. As it turned out, Marvel Studios was already willing to lead Sony a helping hand long before any of their shared universe plans could be put into motion. Due to their grip on the Spiderman merchandise, Disney was far more willing to promote the Spiderman films that Sony was making then they were with the X-Men and Fantastic 4 films 20th Century Fox were making at the time. Nevertheless, Marvel still had an interest in binging the webhead into their cinematic universe in order to provide a strong foundation for the MCU after the end of Phase 3. Despite being reluctant to work with Marvel, Sony head honchos Tom Rothman and Amy Pascal decided that a deal where Spiderman would appear in an MCU film in return for an MCU character making a camo in one of their Spiderman spin-off films would be perfect as this would allow Marvel Studios to produce a trio of Spiderman films for Sony all while allowing them to maintain creative control, marketing, and distribution as well as breathing new life back into the brand. However, a massive rift of corporate safety was about to force Sony to make a deal between them and Marvel.",/review/rw3749595/?ref_=tt_urv

","And I mean that, it wasn't as violent or cheesy as the Sam Raimi films. There are people on here that are whining and saying, ""Spider-Man 2"" was better!

30 June 2019,tomtalbotty,10," Loved the plot really has revitalised Spider Man
","This seems to get to the action instead of messing around telling the same story over again and it is great that Peter is still in school who has got his eye on someone else Liz who is a nice girl, nevertheless the romance damsel in distress does not get in the way of the film like the previous Spider Man. I like the way that the have changed Mary Jane Watson to Michelle Jones as her friend call her ""MJ"" that we find that out at the end of the film draftee her starting to come out of he shell and open up to Peter A Bit. MJ is completely different character in so many ways a bit of a diva at times and a strong independent girl who keeps to herself and has a shy side and is really lovely and kind when she takes down her barrier and you get to know her, which really does build up the plot, which is instead of putting the typical MJ And Peter Parker love Story together that is just not reality. Loved the Father And Son relationship between Peter Parker And Tony Stark really shows him as a father figure and really does connote the next few films. I would strongly recommend watching this as they have done an amazing job of getting the story right after those other failed moves and the bad guy in this movie is kind of a reference to the green goblin with the green eyes but instead with wings who perter does not know that is so interesting to watch that unfold. Spider Man in the MCU as an Avenger is about time well done Tom Holland And Zendaya and the rest of the cast and crew for doing such an amazing job as all my doubts are gone now and Spider Man is one of my favourite Super Heroes out of the MCU next to Iron Man what a call duo. Peter Parker and his friend Ned is hilarious and how he find out Peter Parker secret identity too as Spider Man is so hilarious too.",/review/rw3749595/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2020,robfollower,8," Spider-Man: Homecoming
","This Spider-Man movie is the first Spider-Man movie in the Marvel canon. The prior two Spider-Man franchises are irrelevant to this series. Spider-Man, introduced in Captain America: Civil War, is part of the final phase of the Marvel Universe leading up to Avengers: The Infinity War/End Game. Marvel opted to skip the origin story of Spider-Man and instead, framed this film to be more of a coming of age tale for Peter Parker (Tom Holland) and his quest to become part of the Avengers.",/review/rw3749595/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is the worst Spider Man ever made, totally overrated, long, boring and unfunny. The annoying lead actor Tom Holland, has an irritating tone of voice.

13 June 2019,rileymarshall-01062,10," Top tier MCU movie
","SpiderMan Homecoming is one of the most fun, exciting, and easily rewatchable films in the entire MCU. Tom Holland has a great performance as a young, inexperienced adaptation of Peter Parker. And that's a great new direction for the character. I've always thought that SpiderMan shouldn't be great at being SpiderMan at first. Tobey Maguires adaptation gets bitten by a spider and within a day or two masters all of his powers. But this movie hinges on the fact that Peter is still learning how to be a hero. That's perfect.",/review/rw3749595/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2021,amooorales,8," Not bad but not amazing
","As someone who grew up watching sam rainis Spider-Man everyday, I can appreciate what these movies are trying to do. First off, there are a lot of negative reviews and I don't understand why, and a lot of them are just pointing out the differences between this movie and Sam rainis Spider-Man. This movie wasn't trying to copy the same formula that's been done, it was trying to be different, I can understand that it can throw some people off, I felt the same why when I first watched this movie in theaters. But you have to realize that they're trying to make a more younger, fresher spider man, most comic readers say this is a spider man that's more faithful to the comics, which I extremely appreciate. Some characters are weak in this movie like flash and Liz, but I don't think they wanted to repeat the same story would've already seen. Especially since it's goes with mcu, they went for a lighter, innocent tone. Some parts can be extremely cheesy, but that's Spider-Man because in reality he is meant to be a teenager. I think this movie is great for what they were trying to accomplish and I can tell much care went into this movie. And the VULTURE!!! One of my personal favorite villains from a Spider-Man, glad he finally got his spotlight and his design in the movie is amazing he looks like some pilot from the future which is really cool.",/review/rw3749595/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2017,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,8," Welcome home
","Being a teenager is hard. So's making a good movie about that existence, and this is thankfully the exception. If you have superpowers, and you think you could escape your awkward, meandering high school(which this one is actually about, only took 6 tries... and 1 for the MCU) life, yet can't seem to make it, it's all the more difficult. Peter Parker(Holland, awed, spot-on) is struggling to balance it all. When The Vulture(Keaton, psychopathic and sometimes charming, complex, one of the franchise's great villains), a gun-runner, starts moving product made up of alien tech left over by fights involving The Avengers, our lead knows he has to stop him.",/review/rw3749595/?ref_=tt_urv
