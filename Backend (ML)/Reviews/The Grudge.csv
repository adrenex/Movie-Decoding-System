3 February 2020,olivewahh,7," It's still good after so many years
","With the new release of The Grudge, I went back and rewatched this original to see if it was as good as I had remembered.",/review/rw2202695/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2017,areatw,7," This movie has always creeped me out
","'The Grudge' isn't the best horror film and it isn't the scariest either, but there's something about it that always manages to get to me. From the very first scene, which is appropriately bizarre, to the last, 'The Grudge' is a very creepy movie and I can't quite put my finger on why.",/review/rw2202695/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2013,OllieSuave-007,8," The most scariest ghost/horror movie I have seen.
","""The Grudge"" is quite possibly the most scariest ghost/horror movie I have ever seen. Sarah Michelle Gellar takes on the main role as nurse Karen living and working in Tokyo. While working she is exposed to a supernatural curse involving a vengeful spirit which locks a person in a powerful rage before claiming his/her life and spreading its curse to another person.",/review/rw2202695/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2005,BrandtSponseller,9," Just as good as the Japanese films (but with an ending rant against remakes of foreign films)
","Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar), an exchange student in Japan who is just beginning to do some social work, is sent to aid an elderly semi-catatonic woman, Emma (Grace Zabriskie), after her previous caretaker, Yoko (Yoko Maki), disappears. Karen soon learns that something is not right in Emma's home, and she attempts to ""see how deep the rabbit hole goes"".",/review/rw2202695/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2004,TheMovieMark,," Creepier than having someone stare at you in a bathroom stall!
","According to The Grudge, there's a Japanese belief that when someone dies in a powerful grip of rage, then a curse is left behind. It's a ""stain"" that forever becomes a part of the place where the death occurred, and it will kill everything it touches. All I can say is if that were true then the movie-going public better hope I never die in a theater. The audience at this movie was probably the most obnoxious crowd I've ever had the displeasure of watching a movie with. Talk about being in a powerful grip of rage. More on that later.",/review/rw2202695/?ref_=tt_urv

15 March 2005,nycritic,6," Disastrous Remake.
","It helps seeing both the original, JU ON, and THE GRUDGE back to back to see why remakes just don't work most of the time and what one should never do in a horror film if the first version was already perfect. Rarely have they ever done so: except for Hitchcock's own re-telling of THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH in 1956, most of the times they have failed miserably. This one retells the same story, eliminating two major plot arcs from the first (the three missing students who were at the house with the haunted detective's daughter, and Mariko's storyline who served to expand on the curse, here served by Bill Pullman's storyline), and adding a boyfriend to Sarah Michelle Gellar's Karen, as well as creating yet another brief role in the beginning -- the caretaker of the old lady, unseen in the first.",/review/rw2202695/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2004,dbborroughs,6," If you've seen the Japanese originals, you've already seen this film.
","This review is really a word of warning, if you've seen any of the earlier Japanese versions of this story you've seen this movie before. If you've seen all four of the earlier films, you've really seen everything (except the frightening opening with Bill Pullman) and you'd best wait for home video.",/review/rw2202695/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2004,MLDinTN,," a creepy horror movie with little plot
","I liked this movie a lot. The plot is that whoever goes into this house dies. That's it. The movie begins with a shocking scene involving Bill Pullman; it pulls the viewer in. Then, it shows the house; and when the caretaker Yoko goes to investigate a noise upstairs, it was scary. And it really makes you jump out of your seat. Karen, played by Gellar, lives in Japan with her boyfriend studying abroad. She is sent to the house when Yoko doesn't show up for work, and the movie goes from there. There are a lot of creepy things that happen as the ghost stalks those that had been in the house. And the film shows flashbacks of what happened to the family that just moved into the house. And toward the end we find out what terrible thing happened that caused the house to be haunted.",/review/rw2202695/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2005,Azrael269,10," Hats off
","Massive multiple chills down the spine! I'm surprised there's people who didn't like it! I saw it at 10 o'clock in the morning and still got scared stiff! And I've seen hundreds of thrillers/horror movies! For crying out loud,I'm 22!!! I mean, OK, voice acting, not particularly good, probably even b-movie-ish. But the genuine look of terror, the sound effects, the flow! From the very start, hitting you again and again with relentless, unforgiving, terrorising scenes! So many clich√©s yet none fails to surprise/scare! You know it's coming, it's coming, it's coming, BOO! and you still jump off the chair. Grab a pillow and a blanket, call your closest friend over and do not watch it at night! Hats off to the Japanese!",/review/rw2202695/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2006,udar55,1," Nail in the coffin for Japanese horror
","I hate to throw out lines like this, but in this case I feel like I have to: the American remake of THE GRUDGE is by far the worst film I have seen in theaters in the last 5 years. There, I said it. And now that I have gotten that out of my system, please let me explain why.",/review/rw2202695/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2004,merrittjr,10," I was pleasantly shocked
","I went to this movie expecting an artsy scary film. What I got was scare after scare. It's a horror film at it's core. It's not dull like other horror films where a haunted house just has ghosts and gore. This film doesn't even show you the majority of the deaths it shows the fear of the characters. I think one of the best things about the concept where it's not just the house thats haunted its whoever goes into the house. They become haunted no matter where they are. Office buildings, police stations, hotel rooms... etc. After reading some of the external reviews I am really surprised that critics didn't like this film. I am going to see it again this week and am excited about it.",/review/rw2202695/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2004,Aaron1375,8," A bit like ""Ring"", but a tad more creepy...the story however could have used some work.
","For the most part I liked this movie...it was a film with many creepy images and quite a few killings as well. Still though the story just was not up to ""The Ring's"" story. In this movie there really is no motivation for the killings to occur they say things about rage and despair, but the only one who would have felt that really was not part of the supernatural side of the movie. Still though it was entertaining enough and I love the fact it was set in Japan. It also makes me want to see the Japanese version as I know it will be better as this one was probably Americanized quite a lot. I preferred ""Ringu"" to ""Ring"" also. All in all though I enjoyed it, though I wished they would just release the Japanese versions here. Also, there is one part of the movie where one woman is having a hard time finding here way around Japan and I found this a little hard to believe. Many Japanese are rather good at English if not fluent and many things there are written in both English and Japanese (I notice this when watching other movies from there).",/review/rw2202695/?ref_=tt_urv

20 November 2004,CuriosityKilledShawn,1," I Grudge paying for this
","Ugh! What nonsense. American remakes of Japanese horrors are all the rage at the moment. Between this, The Ring and a forthcoming remake of the rather weak Dark Water it seems as if Hollywood has tapped into a new well of unimagination.",/review/rw2202695/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2005,claudio_carvalho,6," A Different Haunted House Movie
","In Tokyo, when the American student Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is called by a Japanese social support agency to replace her Japanese colleague Yoko (Yoko Maki) in the assistance of the American sick woman Emma (Grace Zabriskie), she realizes that something supernatural lives in the huge house. Inspector Nakagawa (Ryo Ishibashi) investigates a series of deaths of visitors of the subjected house, and based on a Japanese belief, he convinces himself that the place is cursed.",/review/rw2202695/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2005,Rooster99,8," Much better than I thought it would be.
","This was great. When I saw the Japanese version first, it was probably the scariest movie I had ever seen. It was not blood and guts, it was eerie, atmospheric and terrifying. When the mother ghost lent over the bed in the Japanese version, I nearly had a heart attack... I was concerned that the American version would be watered down, and that Buffy would take away from the dark creepy nuances of the original version. I needn't have been concerned. The makers of this movie wisely kept the same Japanese people who were involved with the original movie on hand, and gave the direction of the movie to the same man. They also set it in Japan in the same location, in the same house. In fact, the Japanese director took pains to remake the same movie as it was in the original, the only difference was the casting of American actors. That actually turned into a benefit as it added the element of ""Strangers in a Strange Land"" to the overall horror. Not only were they being haunted by an absolutely terrifying and relentless ghost, but they were also stuck in a completely foreign land, having difficulty integrating into society. It just added to the overall anxiety built into the movie and I thought it was an excellent touch.",/review/rw2202695/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2005,aatx1154,8," The Grudge Hits All Cylinders....
","The Grudge, a horror movie based on the Japanese original but starring Americans. Now usually this genre and these types of films never work. However by keeping the original director of the film this film works. Based on the premise of restless spirits and curses this could have easily turned into a cheesy or over the top horror film. However due to surprises and sounds that are not common for American moviegoers it works. What also helps is that the way the story is laid out in fragment and the audience has to put the pieces together. It is not in a linear fashion. The acting was really good on all accounts with genuine performances by Sarah Michelle Gellar. Plenty of disturbing images and scares thrown in. The DVD contains several extras and previews. This is a good quality movie that I would recommend.",/review/rw2202695/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2018,paulclaassen,3," I tried so hard to enjoy this, but I couldn't...
","More than just a bit confusing, to say the least. Jumping between couples and time also adds to the confusion. The film plays like a bunch of random ideas thrown into a blender and mixed together. The child character is oh-so-cliched, as are the 'stalking' images on the victim's photographs. During the climax the heroin is so passive, its as if she simply allows everything to happen without any resistance whatsoever. Yawn.",/review/rw2202695/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2013,LeonLouisRicci,5," Certainly Unremarkable
","This Movie was a Mega-Hit. Going for it was a ticket friendly PG-13 Rating and that forever Adolescent wanting to be scared at the Movies. It seems that all you need is an eerie visual or two that is slightly unsettling and creepy, an unworldly sound effect or two, jumble the Films chronology (for that most Modern of Style) and Millions of Bucks can be yours.",/review/rw2202695/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2007,gavin6942,5," Bland Film... Not Sure Why So Much Money Was Earned

16 February 2005,Smells_Like_Cheese,1," I don't know which is worse, getting a root canal or watching this film!
","Sarah Michelle Gellar! What has happened to you?! Did you loose your acting ability when you left ""Buffy""? *SOB!!!* I'm so sick of these stupid un-scary Japanese flicks. The trailer looked so cool. I was excited to see this film, but now I wish I just saved my money for another movie. The characters have no development in the film, and the ""scary"" moments are not exciting. 92% of the film is silent. I thought I would go crazy from this film. I would never recommend this movie in a million years. I am saddened by Sarah! You have brought shame to my life! OK, I'm a dork.",/review/rw2202695/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2004,rustysettler,5," Loses something
","This movie definitely loses something in the translation. Unlike ""The Ring"" which equaled and even improved on the original story in some ways, this one just meanders along in an uninspired fashion.",/review/rw2202695/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2007,petra_ste,5," The drudge
","Japanese folklore features a wide array of different monsters, or Y≈çkai, but you'd never know from Hollywood movies. This remake is another horror about one of those black-eyed, ghostly kids crawling on walls, meowing and killing a score of one-dimensional characters. It has three or four unsettling moments - which worked better in the original Ju-On - but also a paper-thin plot and an utter lack of characterization. These are not people, they are walking props for the next jump scare.",/review/rw2202695/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2010,AlsExGal,6," Doesn't translate well to an American audience
","The main theme of this movie is that a powerful negative force inhabits a place after someone has died a violent death, and that this negative force consumes all who touch the place in which the violent act occurred. This idea is not new, and many conjecture that what people believe are ""ghosts"" are in fact leftover energy from just such traumatic events. However, most American audiences want the ""wronged parties"" or ""ghosts"" to produce a moral outcome- either the punishment of the murderer(s) or the revelation of how the victims died. What most Americans don't really ""get"" or appreciate is this malevolent force striking out at random victims- the current occupants of the house, whoever they may be, however transient. This just spawns more innocent victims and seems pointless.",/review/rw2202695/?ref_=tt_urv
