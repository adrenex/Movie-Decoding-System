","Encino Man is a comedy influenced by the wackiness of the grunge generation. The young cast, which stars Astin, Shore, and Fraser, is likely to be a major draw for teenagers and younger viewers, who will likely enjoy this movie. ",/review/rw2012651/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'm not sure why, but still to this day I love to sit down to Encino Man. I think because I just loved it as a child and it's like that blankie you can't get rid off. Also, you need those comedies that you can just sit down too and just have fun and relax. Yes, it has Pauly Shore which granted can be scare-E! :D But he's actually amusing as well in the film.",/review/rw2012651/?ref_=tt_urv

","I really like this movie. Maybe its ending is a little predictable, still it's good fun, easygoing and one of these movies you can watch over and over again. The characters are brilliant, Brendan Fraser's performance as an unfrozen stoneage guy in modern California is simply great. my absolute favourite scene is the one in the bathroom - no matter how often i watch it, it always makes me laugh.",/review/rw2012651/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2008,Karl Self,8," Homo Encino
","I expected the usual stoner-gross-out-high-school-comedy and had also heard that Pauly Shore was a comedic one-trick-pony (I'd read about all those Razzies he had been awarded). Also, the premise of high-school kids finding a thawed-up ""cro-magnon"" man and becoming friends with him didn't bide well, so I kind of watched this out of completism and deep-rooted cinematic masochism. Turns out I was way off the mark. ""Encino Man"" is thoroughly enjoyable, and one of the best movies of its genre. And Pauly Shore is my god now, he really made this movie. Well, he may be a one-trick-comedian, but at least at he's the godfather of this one trick. The stoner-surfer-dude has been done ad nauseam in high-school comedies, but Pauly Shore is the stoner-surfer-dude to rule all other stoner-surfer-dudes. His figure is not just funny and dude-ish, but also eccentric and frail (almost a bit camp). When I read that he comes from a family of comedians, I wasn't surprised. I see a lot of comedic and dramatic talent in him, and it's a shame that he seems to have fallen out of favour recently.",/review/rw2012651/?ref_=tt_urv

","On weekends, after a long day of partying, I feel ready for a laugh. So, I put ENCINO MAN in the VCR and laugh myself silly. I have seen this movie so many times, that I could probably mimic the entire thing. Pauly Shore is a riot. And even better that they have him casted as a high school student. He's about ten years out of high school. But he is what makes the movie. Brendan Fraser wasn't really known all that well when he made this one. It pretty much began his career. See this if you are in a mood where everything seems funny to you. Those are the kinds of moods that make you pass out from laughing too hard. This one is definitely good for a laugh.....5/5.",/review/rw2012651/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie is one of my all time favorite comedies and is one of my favorite movies over all of all time. This movie might be hilarious for you, or it could absolutely horrible. What I mean is that some people might like this and some people might not. I just happen to be somebody that loves it. I can understand why people do not like this movie. They probably don't like it because of the story and the acting and the script and the fact that it just isn't realistic. But people like me love this movie because its funny and we think that it could be a believable story. I loved this movie when I was 4 when I first saw it and I am 13 today, and I still love it. I think that it is hilarious. I think that Pauly Shore was funny in this. This isn't like one of his bad movies that he makes all the time. This movie is funny. So, in the end, you might like it, like me, or you might hate it, like most people. I love this movie. It is funny. This was a good movie. 10/10.",/review/rw2012651/?ref_=tt_urv

2 April 2011,StevePulaski,8," The Wieze, the Hobbit, and the quiet American
","The buddy comedies critics hate I wind up liking or loving. Encino Man is the case of bad reception from critics, but cult following from Pauly fans. I've been a fan of Pauly's work for a while. I really enjoyed Bio-Dome, I liked In The Army Now, I liked Adopted, I liked Pauly Shore is Dead, but I wasn't so happy with Jury Duty. Yes Pauly Shore is overly goofy, but he defines the early nineties. Nostalgia - that kind of thing makes people go nuts.",/review/rw2012651/?ref_=tt_urv

","Obviously, any time that you have a story involving two Southern California teenagers (think Bill and Ted), you know that the story's going to be completely goofy. ""Encino Man"" is a prime example. While high school dudes Dave (Sean Astin) and Stoney (Pauly Shore) are searching their backyard for pre-historic artifacts, they come across a caveman (Brendan Fraser) encapsulated in ice. They put the guy next to a furnace to thaw him out while they're at school, only he turns out to be alive. So, they proceed to try and teach him the early '90s, with varying degrees of success.",/review/rw2012651/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2015,raulfaust,6," Hot as Ice
","Well, a movie from the nineties starring Brendan Fraser is surely nothing to be taken seriously, and ""Encino Man"" just proves why. In here, we have two teenagers that achieve in rising a caveman, in order to try to become popular in their school; teenagers... The plot is full of teen movie clichés, but that is something totally expected from this kind of picture. What makes it occasionally interesting is the relationship between these young boys, which is full of youth desires. On the other hand, the comical aspect of this isn't well executed, reason why I don't remember having a single laugh while watching it. If you like this kind of entertainment, especially those made in the nineties, I'd recommend you 1992's ""Stop! Or my mom will shoot, which is a better choice, even if not perfect as well.",/review/rw2012651/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have loved California Man for a long, long time. Pauly Shore has got to be the favourite, and with his own added 'unique weasel' it just makes the film for me. It seems this is where Brendan Fraser started his usual 'big, dumb, lovable' characters, but still he plays it to perfection. Sean Astin is quite cute in it, but doesn't add that much to the film.

11 August 2005,bob the moo,," Predictable and uninspired high-school slacker comedy
","While digging a pool in his backyard, Dave Morgan uncovers a stone-age artifact and realises that this is his way out of geekdom (the irony of that escaping him totally). However he is even more shocked to find a stone-age man frozen in a big block of ice. While trying to work out what to do with this discovery, the discovery defrosts and sets off around the locality  bewildered and confused. Dave and his friend Stoney catch him up and decide that the only way to keep him safe is to pass him off as a high-school exchange student  a plan that produces hilarious consequences! My plot summary is pretty accurate right up until the final two words because this uninspired teenage slacker comedy is nothing new, nothing special and nothing particularly funny. The film appears to have been created to try and ride the wave of such comedies that had been started by Bill & Ted and Wayne's World, however it forgets to reproduce the laughs of those films and just settles into easy scenarios, basic ""fish out of water"" gags and a narrative that is about as old as the prehistoric title character. In this regard it failed to engage me and never tried to be anything other than basic and it rewards viewers who are only happy with it working at this level but will likely just come off as rather tiresome to those that expect more. Laughs are rare and require you to be in the mood rather than doing the work to actually put you in the mood and the plot, like I said, goes exactly where you know it will after about 10 minutes.",/review/rw2012651/?ref_=tt_urv

","California teens Astin and Shore want to build a pool as a way to gain popularity before the end of their senior year and find caveman Fraser buried beneath the soil in which they're digging their pool on. They introduce and groom him into the modern life of a Cali teen; and when everything seems go to as planned, the free-spirited caveman who's helping the teens build popularity, is getting a bit too popular. Fraser is a pleasure to watch, and Pauly Shore is well, Paul Shore--this could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your interest for watching the film. Where the film falls short is with Astin as Dave; who's a vain, shallow and selfish little punk, striving to have his own page in the yearbook no wonder you're unpopular, Dave. Dave's tendencies of a sociopath become even more evident when he attempts to abandon the caveman because the girl who Dave likes has a crush on the caveman. It's not an overall unpleasant film, but still incredibly frustrating when one of your protagonists is extremely unlikable.",/review/rw2012651/?ref_=tt_urv

10 November 2019,RhapsodyReviews,7," Funny Dumb Comedy.
","Review:
'Encino Man' is a comedy film directed by Les Mayfield.
This movie may be a dumb comedy, but I also think that it's one of the most underrated comedy films of all time. It's a smart and easy storyline and it gets pulled off perfectly by its lead actors. It's not a perfect movie by any means, but it's one of those comedies you can watch multiple times and still enjoy the 10th time through.
The plot revolves around two geeky teenagers from Encino, Los Angeles, California - played by played by Sean Astin and Pauly Shore - who discover a caveman in Morgan's backyard frozen in a block of ice - played by Brendan Fraser.
Astin, Shore and Fraser are great in this movie. It almost feels like three friends got together to make a movie, but in a good way. I have never been a big fan of Pauly Shore, I like a couple of his movies but this one stands out to me the most. I like the hippie vibe he creates in this movie and everything that comes out of his mouth is hilarious. I like Brendan Fraser in everything I have seen him in, and Sean Astin seems to always play the same character in movies, the dork. A lot of things that happen don't seem realistic, even the world that this film is coming from, and I could have done without the whole romance between Sean Astin and Megan Ward's characters.
I like that throughout this movie Brendan Fraser only learns to say a few words. It makes sense being the fact that he is a caveman, and the movie only takes place over a couple days. He adapts to his surroundings a little too quickly, but this movie being what it is I am fine with that.
Overall, it's goofy, it's at times stupid, but it's all around funny! Just one of those little movies that if you will allow yourself to put reality on hold for 90 minutes, it can and will charm the socks off you.
