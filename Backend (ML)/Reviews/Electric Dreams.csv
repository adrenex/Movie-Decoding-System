12 April 2017,MstrsRaina,3," Started off great BUT.....
","When this show first came out I was so excited! I grew up with BMW and wanted to share my joy of the old program with my younger cousins. At first, this series was seemed enjoyable and I thought that it would be somewhat model from BMW. But as the series went on, I found myself, and my family members losing excitement fast. The show tried to be WAY too deep. Every episode tried so hard to be deep. In every scene the show tried to push some major deep wisdom and epiphany, even in the simplest sense.

24 June 2015,alv790,," Pretty awful
","Where to begin? There seems to be an unwritten rule that Disney Channel sitcoms must be mindless and badly-written. Yes, I know they are not intended for adults, but children are actually intelligent beings. As a kid I loved Wonder Years, which was an excellent show, very well-written. I also liked Boy Meets World, although even back then I could see that it was clearly worse than Wonder Years. Still, it was meant to be sillier and it had enough heart and integrity to make you care about the characters and be willing to accompany them as they grew up and learned life's lessons.",/review/rw3054661/?ref_=tt_urv

27 June 2014,zack_wall,10," A Great Spin off
","Finally! A Disney show that doesn't completely suck! Girl Meets World might not be everything Boy Meets World fans were hoping for, but it certainly isn't too disappointing. The two main friends are basically female versions of Shawn and Cory, which is awesome. We also have adult versions of Shawn and Topanga as the parents, which definitely makes the show worth watching. For kids growing up today who missed out on Boy Meets World, I think this ""reboot"" will more than make up for that loss. It's got great writing, a good cast of child actors (after all, it's pretty hard to find amazing child actors), and an enjoyable atmosphere. It will be interesting to see what sort of life lessons this show instills on today's kids, and how they compare to the many lessons Boy Meets World taught us growing up. I for one am excited to see where this goes. ",/review/rw3054661/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2014,alexanderharris144,6," Very Similar to other teen Disney Shows
","While Boy Meets World targeted pre-teens to adults, Girl Meets World is strictly for the pre-teens to teen age bracket. With silly story lines, Girl Meets World is much more like a Hannah Montana, ICarly, or Wizards of Waverly, than it is to the original Boy Meets World. While the format of learning a life lesson is still there, it is found in a much sillier way. ",/review/rw3054661/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2015,Ddey65,," Sweet and atypical of the standard Disney Channel programming
","What happens when Ben Savage and Danielle Fishel get it on? According to Michael Jacobs and April Kelly, you get Rowan Blanchard and August Maturo. While many have incorrectly labeled ""Boy Meets World"" as a Disney Channel series, simply because it was shown in reruns on DC late at night years ago, the production actually pre-dates Disney's acquisition of ABC and its former parent company Capital Cities Communications Industries. And though I was well past the age of the main character and his supporting cast when that series aired, it was impossible to ignore all the kids who either grew up in the 1990's and saw this, or just saw the reruns who have been clamoring for something reminiscent of that series. Obviously, it came in the form of ""Girl Meets World.""",/review/rw3054661/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2019,MSD13,4," Fun.. but limitations proved too much
","This show is fun in small doses, having watched it after being a huge Boy Meets World fan it is hard to live up to those expectations. The first 2 seasons show the kids in middle school and are a bit easier to understand the state of the show, however once they reach midway through season 2 it goes downhill rather fast.",/review/rw3054661/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2016,lanafastlake,4," To staged for a show that's a girl going through life.
",I think this show could be good. And its honestly fun to watch but its so staged for a show that's kinda like a person going head on with life. The acting is terrible but some of the story line i like. I'm 13 years old and i feel like they should add more of what a real teen is like. And what they are going through. But i do enjoy watching it because its actually quite emotionally sometimes. :) I like when they talk about the environment.Or how they go through hard times but they are always find a way through.This show is very accurate to a teens life though so i do like that. (sorry for the terrible way i explained it I tried my best.),/review/rw3054661/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2014,sarahbeth333,10," New and Nostalgic at the same time
","I grew up on Boy Meets World. I tuned in to ABC every week to see what was new with Cory, Shawn, Topanga, Eric, and the rest of the gang, and I still watch it on ABC Family. Since finding out about the reboot of the show through Girl Meets World, I knew it could go one of two ways. 1. It will be down-right awful. Sure, sometimes BMW could get a little cheesy, but this is Disney, it could be cheesy to the 100th power. It could be over-acted, pay no homage to all that made BMW great, be poorly written, and just be ridiculous... ORRRRRRR 2. It will be awesome. It will draw older viewers (who may now be parents of the show's target audience) in with the nostalgia of BMW, not only with cameos of stars from the original series, but also through plot lines, quotes, and details that any BMW fan would instantly grasp. It will be appropriately acted, and well written.",/review/rw3054661/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2016,destineexoxo,2," Worst reinvention.
","I absolutely hate this show. It's a cute concept, but growing up with boy meets world was completely different. Disney did not do a good job reinventing the show. What I loved about boy meets world was that it was real, it was similar to what someone was going through.at the end of the episode still taught a lesson. Girl meets world is nothing like that. this ""remake"" is overly dramatic for my taste. No teen deals with things in the manner they place them in the show. It's not realistically relatable and there's a lot of dry tasteless humor and the whole show is confusing, it's like watching a novella. I think the only thing I like about it is seeing all the original characters once again.",/review/rw3054661/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2014,tsunley13-114-247987,10," Love this show!!
","I'm a fan of just about all the shows on Disney Channel but this is hands down my favorite! Spin-offs are always risky, but GMW has it all! Great story line, great actors and you walk away from every show with a ""life lesson"". I don't care if I am 38, this is one of the best family shows on TV. :) Disney shows remind me of the TV shows I used to watch when I was younger. Growing Pains, Who's the Boss?, Boy Meets World, Family Ties, Head of the Class, Blossom, etc. They were all funny and hokey and Disney has recaptured it with their shows. A good TV show doesn't have to have cursing and half naked individuals to be ""good"". The values that GMW and other Disney shows portray are everything we're lacking in regular prime time television.",/review/rw3054661/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2015,schwucss,4," Flat And Cringe-Worthy....
","I'm giving it a minimum of four for Topanga and Cory alone. Weaving ""Lisa"" from ""Sister, Sister"" into the first episode was also a nice touch (especially for the older fans). The acting on the show however, is poor and clichÃ©. The characters have little to no personality and are over-scripted (as expected with modern Disney shows). Absolutely vapid writing. Had potential if they gave it substance. A real shame. Has some valid humor to it but those moments are few and far between. Would not recommend it if you're hoping it will be similar to Boy Meets World. Would recommend it for toddlers though or a maximum of age 8 or MAYBE 9. You have to remember, back when Boy Meets World came out, their target audience was set for 8-17 (roughly). This would be difficult to sit through for anyone above 9 ,as the target audience for this show and modern Disney in general is clearly set low in age.",/review/rw3054661/?ref_=tt_urv

29 July 2017,moviestargurlss,3," Not the best spin off
","Okay so before ""Girl Meets World"" was out there was Boy meet world and it took place in the 90's , I was born in 2004 so I didn't know nothing about Boy meets world until Disney came up with Girl meets world and they had played reruns and I actually had liked BMW and I still do ! So when girl meets world came out the first season , it was actually pretty good and the kids were adorable and the characters well some were original but as it went to the next season the character riley was kinda getting annoying and I stopped watching it for a while because of that ! Then farkel who was supposed to be the son of mankis became a rebel or whatever you want to call it even though he was still the smart kid ... that made the show get kinda off in my opinion and then the character Lucas oh boy ðŸ™„ His character looked older then the character Riley ! Riley was about 14 or 13 and Lucas was 17 or 16 and their relationship to me was getting annoying... the only reason I actually enjoyed the show was because Cory and topanga and auggy and Ava and zay and the guest stars they actually made the show worth looking at ! In my opinion the only characters that were friends with Riley that was interesting was Zay to be honest ... but the show had got annoying because of all the depressions, the actor who played Riley was getting annoying because she was too perky . But even though I didn't grow up with Boy Meets World I honestly have to say that I like that show a lot better. If they had got different actors and if it wasn't on Disney channel it probably would of been better because Disney channel made it corny ! But let me go finish watching Boy meets world ðŸ˜Š",/review/rw3054661/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2016,Umberto88,3," Unbearable
","Yeah, the acting is mostly wooden, but what really kills this show is the script. It seems that the kids do nothing but sit around and deliver to each other unbearably long and preachy moralizing lectures. I can't imagine anybody, whether you are an adult or a 13-year-old girl, actually enjoying watching THIS. It feels like the script has been written by a committee of lawyers and PR experts, not by actual writers. Disney shows are supposed to be sanitized and maximally inoffensive, but any semblance of real life has been so completely sucked out of this show, there is literally nothing left to watch here.",/review/rw3054661/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2014,monstermayhem32,9," A great continuation
",Being a fan of the original boy meets world I will admit that I had some doubt about the spin off. However it turns out to be a real delight since the series picks up nearly 15 years after the the original series ended in which Cory and topanga are now living in New York with a daughter Riley and son auggie. Riley fills the role that was once Cory in which she is trying to find her eon place in the place in the world just like her father once did. Maya is the female equivalent of the way Shawn was in which both characters seem to come from broken families and use their witty sarcasm as a way of hiding their pain. The girls seem to have an unrequited love from a boy Farkle who happens to be the son of Stuart minkus. The new transfer student Lucas is the potential love interest for Riley. It is great to see Ben savage and Danielle fishel back in their signature roles again as though they never left. I look forward to see where the series takes off.,/review/rw3054661/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2017,ll-costa,8," Girl Meets World wrecked Boy Meets Worls through the disappointment of how bad this show is
","Hated this show, mainly because it absolutely wrecked the original series of Boy Meets World. For one fact, they tried to recreate many Boy Meets World story lines, miserably failed making it 100 times more overdramitic and cheesy, not only this but some things, for example the ski lodge was exactly the same, what is the point of watching that all twice. They make Cory and Topanga out to be childish parents, yes they are continuing with some attributes from their last roles but these personality attributes are over exaggerated, making them out to be hopeless parents. Their children were over exaggerated in their personalities too. And don't get me started on how this show wrecked the image of Shawn and Angela reuniting because of that Katie chick. It wrecked Jack and Rachel's relationship. Eric was some extra character, and of course he was the most unbelieavable but funny character in boy meets world, they exaggerated this as well making it 100 times worse again. Horrible, i love boy meets world and I refuse to believe these two shows are even remotely related. Cory and Topanga should not have been painted out like they have been in Girl Meets World, no they were couple goals af and were the right amount of best-friend joking and romantic bf and gf. This show took everything too far, and was wayy to G rated, i mean it felt like it was for 6-10 yr olds where as boy meets world were for teens to adolescents. Ugh I will just never understand how that was supposed to be a run on from Boy Meets World, yes same actors but how could they actually wreck what was already made during a 7 year process, well guess what, Girl Meets World managed to do so.",/review/rw3054661/?ref_=tt_urv

27 February 2017,snperera,7," I will love this show for what it was and what it could've been.
","When I first saw that Boy Meets World was having a sequel, I was so excited! My childhood was coming back I thought. Then when I saw that it was going to be on the Disney Channel I got a little worried cause Boy Meets World talked about real life issues that can't be discussed on the Disney Channel. But I watched all 3 seasons of it and I love it. Sure some of the comedy is awkward and it doesn't make sense and it is slow and boring at times but overall this show has heart, has great characters, great messages, and I hope it gets picked up by a different network.",/review/rw3054661/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2015,Virtual15,9," Fourteen Years Later, It's Girl's Turn to Meet the World!
","When I first heard that Boy Meets World was going to have a spin-off show on how life is going for the Matthews family 14 years later, I was overjoyed. Watching Cory and Topanga on Boy Meets World was a huge pastime for me, especially when I was a freshman in High School. I was also eager for the introduction to Cory and Topanga's children, Riley and Auggie; as well as Riley's classmates which include her best friend Maya, her friend from Texas in Lucas, and her brainy friend Farkle. I really like Maya and Farkle's personalities, while Lucas can be bland yet still possibly redeemable (in terms of developing into a more interesting personality, that is).",/review/rw3054661/?ref_=tt_urv

I can't believe the same people who wrote and created Boy Meets World are doing this show. The writing is awful and can't stand on it's own.

13 August 2014,bravesfan35,1," Lame!
","My wife and I watched Boy Meets World all the time. We were big fans of that show and we were looking forward to checking out this spin-off in the hopes that it would be just as good. We managed to suffer through one episode and that did it for us. The show is terrible! Boy Meets World dealt with real-life issues of love, life, and family. This show is too much like all the other Disney Channel shows: cheesy, poppy, and unfunny. It probably seems like the greatest show ever if you're 13 or under. If you're expecting it to be anything like Boy Meets World, you will be very much disappointed. It's pretty much a Hannah Montana/I Carly mix and that's not a good thing.",/review/rw3054661/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2017,tonydimasofilms,1," Ghastly in the WORST way imaginable! POTENTIAL SPOILER (Maybe, maybe not)
","I'm proud to say that I'm a True Boy Meets World Fan! That show has been, and ALWAYS will be one of my favorites. I learned a lot from that show, and it was Beyond Funny! I have Every Season! And I'm re-watching them all one by one. Then comes along this piece of TRASH. Not only is this show absolute trash... it's NOT Funny! It's NOT Realistic! (In some scenarios maybe, but not all), it's Extremely Feminist towards Men! I can keep going on. I have nothing against Danielle at all playing Topanga, I really don't, but I'm disgusted that her character is NOTHING like her character on BMW. Not only that... but the chemistry between her and Corey throughout the show.... just Awful. Not only that... but Corey is being talked down to constantly by his own wife and daughter multiple times... I felt so bad for Ben Savage as an Actor. Speaking of Actors... Ben as Corey... did Amazing! Ryder as Shawn... Excellent! William as Eric... Wonderful! And who can forget... FEENAY! Absolutely Legendary! Danielle did a great job I will admit... but I can't say that her character in this MISTAKE of a show did any good. There are life lessons sure... but A LOT are NOT realistic solutions in the real world, and I feel so bad for this year's generation of kids watching this show. Only because while they're learning from absolutely cheesy and corny solutions from this show... it is NOT teaching them FULLY about how the real world is. Like I said before, sometimes there are good life lessons learned here... but I highly suggest they learn these at home, or in the REAL WORLD so they're not being led to FAKE SOLUTIONS. Parents! Do yourself a favor! If this show is on TV... switch the channel! Or better yet... buy the DVD Box Sets of Boy Meets World! Your children will learn much more from that show...
