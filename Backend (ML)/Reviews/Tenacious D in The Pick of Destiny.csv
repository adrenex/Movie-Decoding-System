28 August 2009,intelearts,9," Dignified and understated and thus deeply inspirational
","The Ben Carson Story never set out to a major film: this is obviously a film that appealed to Oscar winner Cuba Gooding Jr and he plays it very straight, and underacts, without underplaying.",/review/rw8467345/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2009,chad-440,8," TNT They definitely know drama!
","To summarize this story in a nutshell, it's about an amazing neurologist named Ben Carson, who started off with nothing. He was dumb and unimaginative with a very low self esteem. As he goes through the years some things get worse with relationships and such, as others get better, like knowledge, but he grows up to be this neurologist, the best in the world and his jobs range from checking over babies to stopping daily seizures. The movie goes through all his good times and his bad times from start to finish.",/review/rw8467345/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2010,froglady99,10," Amazing story!
","I grew up hearing about some of Ben Carson's amazing surgeries and remember reading about him when I was a teenager, probably, so I was excited when I heard about this movie. I just watched it for the first time, and it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. I can't believe it was a made-for-TV movie! This movie tells the story of how Ben Carson went from being a kid who was a failure in school and had a very low self-esteem to a famous, gifted surgeon. It tells some about his family life and about two of his famous surgeries. This movie kept me glued to it all the way through--it was like a good book you can't put down!",/review/rw8467345/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2015,classicsoncall,8," ""You weren't meant to be a failure Bennie"" - Ben Carson's mother
","As I write this, the prior most recent posting about this movie is from December 2014, well before Ben Carson made his announcement to run for the Presidency. To my mind, there's no finer human being on the planet than Carson, a soft spoken individual who strikes a chord with people when he speaks, especially with the common sense approach he takes to issues that plague current society. It will be interesting to see how far he goes in his quest and what tangible impact he makes on the political scene.",/review/rw8467345/?ref_=tt_urv

2 September 2009,nimicas,10," Amazing And Shocking Drama Left Me Speechless.
","Now this is what i call a true drama, a masterpiece performed by Thomas Carter and Cuba Gooding Jr. The story begins with biography of Ben Carson which was made quit interesting and fascinating. Young boy (Ben Carson) was between two chooses to admit a false fact that he is dumber than other kids in school or to be encouraged by his mother and start new saga in his personal life. When he begun reading books and understood that the new things he read can be used in life he was like in paradise and on the toped place on podium. Mom (Kimberly Elise) really supported her sons in all ways and dramatically wanted them to be more the she was in her life, when husband died she was prostrated but life for her and little Carsons was still going on. Ben Carson had to face another big problem in his life - a flush of anger which was eliminated from his life by the help of church and God. Ben Carson in his youth had a potential of choosing lots of different professions from the musician to the tops of physics or chemistry, but amazed by the fact that human mind can do so amazing thinks he chose a neurology . The movie was made quite dramatic and in high quality of acting, i've just missed one detail , when Candy Carson lost their Babbie twins i've missed some more drama from Ben Carson, it was like a non - matter fact in his life,despite the fact this movie was one of the best drama's i've seen in 2009. Applause goes to John Pielmeier, Thomas Carter, Cuba Gooding Jr.. 10/10. P.S sorry Sorry for some grammatical mistakes in this comment but it was wrote from heart :).",/review/rw8467345/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2009,TxMike,," Superb drama, and a true story of Ben Carson, surgeon.
","When you look over the roles that Cuba Gooding Jr. has had over the years, seeing the diversity in the characters, you realize what a gifted actor he is. He shows it clearly in this role, as Ben Carson, gifted surgeon from very humble beginnings.",/review/rw8467345/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2009,BronzeKeilani26,10," Powerful film! One of Cuba's best
","As usual, Cuba Gooding was fantastic in this drama! He's as good in comedies also! No one else comes to mind for playing Dr Ben Carson with the passion he projects throughout the movie. This is a man's man. Torn between his loyalty to his skills as a surgeon and a lack of faith in himself made this film all the more realistic! Cuba and Elise give performances that are amazing to watch! Comments to another forum express their objections to the way the race relations play in the movie while at the school...""but"" it can't get any realer than that. I've seen it with my own eyes while attending colleges & this film really puts it down. Very emotional & inspiring film. Thanks to everyone involved for bringing us this fantastic true story!",/review/rw8467345/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2022,cathyannemoore-66196,4," Interesting not compelling though
","It is interesting how Ben Carson was raised and how he was educated. But as a biography the film is not that balanced. Although his anger issue was touched on it was quickly glossed over. Similarly - it was a phenomenal achievement to separate the Binder twins - surgically. However, the film and the end narrative imply that the twins survived to live a normal life. The truth is far from that.",/review/rw8467345/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2009,Blossom0777,10," Fabulous True Story That Leaves You Amazed!
","Tremendous movie of taking what's thought impossible and showing how to try and then do it. Of how Ben Carson went from believing he was stupid to understanding we can do miracles. How that belief put him on a path few get to have as he impacts lives. I'm watching it the second time around on it's TNT premiere tonight and give it 10 stars for transformative potential, excitement, drama, character development, subject and actors. Thank you for this movie! I called my friends & told them to watch. Cuba Gooding is so good as lead character that I forget he is acting:-) The mother character keeps people on their toes as she hides her secrets. Others are also excellent. I laughed, cried, was awed and at times sat on the edge of my seat not knowing what came next. Am touched throughout this movie as I wonder if spirit trumps all. Everyone should watch this!",/review/rw8467345/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2009,dbborroughs,7," Cuba Gooding shines
","Story of Ben Carson head of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins. The film stars Cuba Gooding Jr., in his best performance in a long time, as Carson . It's a performance that doesn't make you question his Oscar win for Jerry McGuire all those years ago. The story is structured around Carson 's attempt to separate Siamese Twins who are joined at the head. Carson is hesitant to do so since anytime a similar operation had been tried one or both of the children had died. As the doctor tries to find out a way of saving both children the story flashes back to events in his life to show us how he got to where he is today. Its an uplifting story and if the film occasionally plays like a movie of the week you really don't mind since the performances are so strong that everything is smoothed over. I really liked this movie a great deal and was completely blindsided by it, I really didn't think I was going to like it. Worth a look.",/review/rw8467345/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2016,mike48128,4," A ""doctored"" biography that manipulates the truth
","Most of the movie is incredibly slow moving, as we follow Ben and his brother from elementary school through high school, in ""dreadful"" Detroit. It feels compelled to show his terrible temper. Half way into the movie, after courting his wife, he is accepted to John Hopkins Hospital as a intern and specializes in head trauma and brain surgery. He pioneered the revival of hemispherical surgery in profound cases of epileptic seizures, where the malfunctioning half of the brain is removed. In 1987, the famous German Binder twins (renamed here as the ""Rousch Twins"") were separated. Both had separate brains though conjoined skulls. They never thrived and remained far from normal (one vegetative) and both ended up institutionalized. In the movie the operation is a full success. Is it entertaining? Cuba Gooding Jr. does a fair portrayal as Ben Carson in a very uneven film. Quite graphic at times. I did not enjoy it.",/review/rw8467345/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2009,bush68,10," Excellent, beautiful story.
","I am so pleased that we randomly chose to watch Gifted Hands on Sat. Feb. 7. This is a well done movie, a beautiful story about an amazing man. After sharing about the movie with our dear friends, whose child had sustained a brain injury as an unborn, we were amazed to discover that this is the Dr who performed surgery on their child shortly after the twins from Germany. Thank you for the opportunity to get to know about this wonderful man. This was our first choice for afternoon viewing because of Cuba Gooding, Jr portraying the doctor. He usually does an excellent job in wholesome movies and this was not a disappointment in any way.",/review/rw8467345/?ref_=tt_urv

9 September 2012,spheckma,9," A Rise to Prominence
","Dr. Ben Carson is a 'real life' doctor who overcame many, many hardships and disadvantages to reach the level of Neuro-surgeon at John Hopkins Hospital where he still practices. The primary actor, Cuba Gooding Jr. as Dr. Carson and Kimberly Elise as the single mother of two boys are played extremely well. As they grow up in not the best of circumstances she is their constant motivator even thought, at first, she is illiterate. As a youngster and teen he is constantly pushed by her to succeed and in the end succeed and succeed he does, to the top of his field while his brother goes on to become and engineer. The story is brilliantly told and realistically shot, well directed and as the actors ages advance we see the portrayed by the next actor in a realistic manner. All in all a great movie to watch and in the end as about as rewarding to have seen as it gets.",/review/rw8467345/?ref_=tt_urv

","A movie about life, about the decisions you have to make from childhood to became something in your life. I recommend this movie to all, one of the best movies ever. It's not boring at all and Cuba Gooding Jr. make the character so real even if he doesn't look like an neurosurgeon or even a doctor. His mother and her education made a explosive turning in Ben life and like he said "" I pray everyday "" helped to reach his goal to became an doctor and not any doctor an devoted and respected neurosurgeon.",/review/rw8467345/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2009,superlo,10," His Gifted Hands Were His Gift To The World
","This is the life story of Dr. Ben Carson, chief of pediatric surgery at Johns Hopkins University and considered the world's best pediatric surgeon. The story begins with Dr. Carson being asked to consider operating on the two sons of a German couple who are joined at the abdomen and skull. No one has ever performed this surgery successfully with both children surviving. The film then flashes back to the childhood of Dr. Carson. He was raised by an illiterate but very loving and determined single mother who married at the age of 13 and was divorced soon after when she discovered her husband was married at the same time to another woman with another family. She was determined that her two sons would not turn out the same way she did. It is an amazing story of this mother and her love and determination. Ben, not realizing he needed glasses, consistently performed way below the other students in class until his mother used all their savings to get him a pair. That, along with her firm hand in making the two boys read two books a week from the library (along with written reports) as well as limiting TV watching to two programs a week turned Ben into the student of the year in 8th grade. Even that, however, was tainted, as a teacher at the award ceremony berated the other students for letting a boy of color with serious disadvantages and a single mother outperform them. The story continues with his achievements and struggles through high school and his scholarship years at Yale and on to his residency at Johns Hopkins. The story then takes us back to the conclusion of the decision whether or not to operate on the German twins. It is an incredible story of someone who not had the 'gifted hands' needed to be a great surgeon but also the determination, humility and faith to make a life of great service to his fellow humans against great odds. The acting is outstanding. I would encourage everyone and every family to make this a 'must watch'. I would also highly recommend SOMETHING THE LORD MADE, another story about a great African-American surgeon, Dr. Vivian Thomas, who was born 30 years too early to be able to have the same opportunities as Dr. Carson, but nevertheless made a great contribution to medicine that is still being used today.",/review/rw8467345/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2020,andreeatiron,2," Boring and unrealistic
","If this wanted to send a powerful and motivation message, well, it failed. All of the character struggles were literally solved by ""God, help me"" or ""you are smart, you can totally do it"". And sincerely after trying really hard to make a character (even though it is supposed to be a real biography) likeable by not showing him doing any real mistakes with real consequences, we see this doctor more times in front of cameras than in front of actual books. Also, there isn't a single character that truly stands out besides Ben, because obviously they tried really hard to show how great he is, but it was boring and offending to see how the two female characters devoting their lives to him and all his college teachers and fellow doctors being men... Also incredibly prectictable, even the surgeries.",/review/rw8467345/?ref_=tt_urv
