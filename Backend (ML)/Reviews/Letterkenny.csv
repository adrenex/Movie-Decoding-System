8 February 2003,LebowskiT1000,9," Fun movie, good comedy.
","No, this isn't the best or funniest comedy in the world, but I certainly enjoyed it.  There is a fair amount of really good comedy in the film to keep you entertained.  ...And of course there's Elizabeth Hurley...need I say more?",/review/rw0698263/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2007,ccthemovieman-1,8," 'George Of The Jungle' Meets Satan
","Here's a fun film with a number of good laughs. It is stupid? Yeah, in parts. Is the theology sound? Hardly, but there was more truth than fiction uttered in this film, believe it or not. Is the Devil made to look attractive? Well, yeah, I'd say Elizabeth Hurley is pretty attractive!",/review/rw0698263/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2006,pachl,9," A comedy with warmth, wit, and style
","I originally saw this movie because it stars Brendan Fraser, an actor who can't seem to make a bad movie, and often makes great movies, such as ""Blast From the Past"".",/review/rw0698263/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2001,=G=,7," Hurley and O'Connor in the same movie? There must be a God!
","""Bedazzled"" tells of a tech support geek (need I say more?) who sells his soul to the devil (Hurley) for seven wishes which he attempts to use to get close to a girl at work (O'Connor). The flick is a situational comedy which takes the audience on a fun ride as Fraser's wishes turn him into one exaggerated comic-book-type caricature after another. A cute flick sans slapstick, pratfalls, and jokes, ""Bedazzled"" offers lots of outrageous situations, some sentimental moments, and a whiff of philosophy. A fun watch with a cute ending, lots of eye candy for the guys, and Fraser doing what he does best playing a big, naive, smiling guy.",/review/rw0698263/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2000,Shiva-11,," How unusual - a comedy that's funny.
","Wealth.  Power.  Admiration.  They all sound pretty enticing.  Indeed many people spend their life in pursuit of these or similar goals and are willing to sacrifice anything and everything in the process.  But what if there was an easy way to do it, say, selling your soul?  You're not really using it anyways .As the saying goes, the day I decided to do it there'd probably be a glut on the market.",/review/rw0698263/?ref_=tt_urv

13 October 2001,SmileysWorld,7," Basic comedy,great character acting
","The makers of Bedazzled were not out to make a classic comedy,they were simply trying to make us laugh.Their mission was a successful one.Bedazzled is full of laughs and great character acting by Brendan Fraser and Frances O'Connor.After many forgettable roles in several forgettable films,Brendan Fraser has really graduated into one of cinemas' big time players in just the last couple of years.As I said,Bedazzled will probably not go down as a comedy classic,it's just your basic comedy filled with laughs from start to finish,and that's good enough for me.It would be a worthy addition to the comedy section of anyone's home library.Thumbs up!",/review/rw0698263/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2016,Red-Barracuda,8," Fraser is funny and Hurley is sexy as hell. What more do you want?
","This Harold Ramis movie is a remake of a 60's cult movie which I have never actually seen. It's based on the Faust legend where we have a terminally annoying man who is in love with a girl who works in the same office as him but who barely knows he exists. After a humiliating encounter with her he inadvertently casts up the devil who grants him seven wishes in his quest to win the girl over. The set-up in this one results in a film with a very episodic structure. With the central character wishing to be different in various ways which leads him to be reincarnated as a South American drug lord, a man intensely in touch with his sensitive side, a colossal basketball player, a respected writer, and the President of the USA. The fun comes from the fact that the devil has sneaked in a catch to every new persona and this inevitably leads to disasters for the central character and some hilarity for us. And that's the thing, it's actually a genuinely laugh out loud funny movie on several occasions, some standout moments being the over-sensitive man unable to avoid crying at a sunset or the half-witted giant basketball player who can't seem to string a sentence together without saying 'pretty good' while sweat literally pours from his head. Brendan Fraser is key to the comedy here. He puts in a genuinely good comic turn in a role that allows him to play a variety of characters with the help of some amusing make-up.",/review/rw0698263/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2000,G-Man-25,," Not Like The Original, But Pleasant Enough
","The 1967 original, starring Dudley Moor and Peter Cook and directed by Stanley Donen was a droll dark comedy that bombed when it was first released to theatres but has developed a very strong cult following over the years. This 2000 version, directed by Harold Ramis is not so much a remake as a latter-day re-imagining of the story.  Aside from the basic premise, the two films share little else in common.  This new version is a wacky, fast-paced farce that makes up in some giddily amusing moments what it lacks in true wickedness.",/review/rw0698263/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2004,Doylenf,," Episodic, semi-successful comedy with Fraser at comic best...
","Ever since GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE I've been convinced that BRENDAN FRASER is one of the brightest new talents to come along in ages. He gets a chance to show how clever he is at concealing his real self in BEDAZZLED, starting as a nerdy office worker and going through a series of changes in an effort to make a pact with The Devil (Elizabeth Hurley). None of his wishes are successful because each one has a hitch devised by the cunning Hurley to backfire. ",/review/rw0698263/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2016,BA_Harrison,7," Get thee in front of me, Satan.
","Elizabeth Hurley, still best known for her '90s relationship with Hugh Grant, and Brendan Fraser, star of Furry Vengeance, team up for this 2000 remake of Dudley Moore and Peter Cook's acerbic 1967 comedy Bedazzled: it sounds like a recipe for disaster, but even though the style of comedy is far removed from the original, Bedazzled 2000 succeeds in delivering its fair share of laughs, as well plenty of sexiness courtesy of Hurley.",/review/rw0698263/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2004,Smells_Like_Cheese,7," It's cute
","I never saw the original ""Bedazzled"", so I can't compaire really. To tell the truth, I didn't even know there was an original. But I thought this ""Bedazzled"" was very good. Elizabeth Hurly makes a great devil. She's sexy, funny, and intelligent. Brandon Frasier does a good job as well with his stereotypical roles. Caveman, tough guy, and now a nerd. Nothing oscar material. But he always does his best, despite that I think he'll never get out of these roles. ""Bedazzled"" has some funny moments. I would recommend this if it's a rainy day. Other than that, it's nothing too special you'd make time for. But I would recommend it.",/review/rw0698263/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2016,Tweekums,6," Liz Hurley is one sexy Devil
","Elliot Richardson is not the most dynamic of protagonists; he is the sort of guy who tries too hard to be popular making him more annoying than likable and the woman he loves, co-worker Alison, is barely aware that he exists. Then one day he says he'd do anything if she would like him the next thing he knows a stunning woman, who claims to be the Devil, offers him seven wishes in exchange for his soul. He doesn't take much persuasion. Unfortunately while his wishes are granted they aren't quite granted how he'd hoped; for example he wants to be rich, powerful and married to Alison he becomes a drug lord, she is having an affair and hates him. The other wishes are similarly disastrous and ultimately he realises that perhaps making selfish wishes isn't a good way to get what you want.",/review/rw0698263/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2004,george.schmidt,," I'd sell my soul to Hurley! Yowsa!
","BEDAZZLED (2000) **1/2 Brendan Fraser, Elizabeth Hurley, Frances O' Connor, Miriam Shor, Orlando Jones, Paul Adelstein, Toby Huss.  (Dir: Harold Ramis) The old adage: `Be careful what you wish for, For you might receive it' clearly applies to this remake of the 1967 cult Brit classic starring Dudley Moore and Peter Cook in this updated farce of the old `Faust' legend, but this time with a formidable lead actor and a director of fine comedic pedigree. The former being Fraser cast as a hopeless schlub named Elliot who works as a computer techie in a San Francisco conglomerate where he is disdained by his fellow employees as his self-deluded friends and is equally hapless in love with another co-worker (well let's be frank, some babe who also works in the skyscraper that he spoke to once 4 years ago).  Obviously inept at the social graces he makes a boob of himself one night at the local watering hole summoning up the gumption to speak to the fair Alison (O'Connor) with only a tight smile of constrained indifference and when he looks to his friends for a moment, she simply leaves him in his wake walking out of the bar. Speaking to himself and wishing to do anything to have the lady of his dreams fall madly for him sets up the chain of events involving the Devil in A Red Dress (the sultry Hurley having some fun here) to proposition the dorky Elliot into selling his soul to Her for 7 wishes/chances in gaining Alison to be his. The set ups are uneven at best but humorous thanks largely to the always game and amiable Fraser who has a finely tuned comedic grace and delves into his seven incarnations with gusto. Hurley, who is no doubt about it devilishly hot in her many form fitting costumes of debauchery, fumbles a bit here and there but she drips sexuality that sadly the pretty O' Connor fails to elicit for her character (it's vexing to have the fantasy girl of the protagonist's desires to be standard when you have the bodacious Hurley as Satan Herself, popping out of her barely-there outfits). The second part of what makes the re-shaping of the farce is Ramis (who co-wrote the screenplay with his longtime creative partner Peter Tolan and icon scribe Larry Gelbart, who's career encompasses everything from The Golden Age of Television Comedy with Sid Caesar to `Tootsie' and tv's `M*A*S*H' not to mention the 180 equivalent of this flick, `Oh, God!' with George Burns as The Almighty) whose sublime, low-key approach allows the one-liners and slapstick congeal into one substantial mold whereby the characters you care about and the humor rings a beat after it delivers.  That is the signature of a true master of the genre but sad to say it isn't consistent throughout and equally troubling is that you can almost see where each variation of Elliot is heading (and largely you don't sense any true menace from the seemingly harmless Hurley - well at least until there is one knee-knocking moment where she's a giantess in a flame-red bikini top clearly getting to the point of not fooling with Ol' Scratch; oh baby!) The loophole laden premise is amusing to watch unspool on the two-steps behind Elliot but the journey itself becomes tiring and that is what makes this naughty comedy two steps behind being hellaciously hilarious.",/review/rw0698263/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2022,studioAT,7," Bedazzled

24 June 2005,jboothmillard,6," Bedazzled
","This is quite an amusing comedy about the life of an ordinary guy who has his life changed. Ordinary and unpopular Elliot Richards (Brendan Fraser) does not have any real friends, and now he is in love with a work mate Alison Gardener (Frances O'Connor). He tells God ""I would do anything to have that girl"", and instead, he gets his wish from The Devil (Elizabeth Hurley). She says he has seven wishes (like seven deadly sins) if he sells his soul. He also has a dialler to phone 666 (the Devil's sign) if his wish isn't going the way he wants. Throughout, he wishes to be many different personalities, including (unintentionally) a powerful Spanish drug dealer, an overly-sensitive nature lover, a professional basketball player with a ""little"" problem, a great book writer who turns out to be gay and President Abrham Lincoln, all wishes certain to have something go wrong, it's the Devil, what do you expect? When he gets to his final wish he does not want it and he eventually gets let off after a non-personal wish. In the end, it turns out it is not Alison that he was to be with, but a lookalike with dark hair named Nicole (yes, it's still O'Connor). Also starring Orlando Jones as Daniel, Paul Adelstein as Bob, Toby Huss as Jerry and Gabriel Casseus as Elliot's Cellmate. It may be cheesy at times, and not have the biggest laughs, but it's still fun to watch. Good!",/review/rw0698263/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2010,napierslogs,7," Making a pact with the devil can be fun
","In ""Bedazzled"", Brendan Fraser stars as Elliot, a likable loser who tries hard but just doesn't have many friends, and he hopelessly pines for Allison (Frances O'Connor). Then the devil shows up. The devil is Elizabeth Hurley in sexy outfits who, in exchange for his soul, will grant him wishes.",/review/rw0698263/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2001,wamba1,10," Loopy humor, down-to-earth wisdom
","Someone in Movie Heaven dropped a feather down on Ramis, the director of such good time romps as Ghostbusters and Stripes. His remake of this 1967 classic rides on the slumped shoulders of Elliot (Brendan Fraser at his best), a pathetically geeky loner who is so socially unskilled that he makes our skin crawl a little. When we first meet him, Elliot is trying to glom onto his co-workers' after-hours social scene by using such tried-and-true means as showing photos of his speakers (from all sides), a truly awful blue-eyed soul brother act, and plain old stalking.",/review/rw0698263/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2004,whpratt1,10," Elizabeth Hurley was a Hot DEVIL!!
","This film was very entertaining and lots of laughs, and you can hardly be critical of a film which is meant to be UNBELIVEABLE!!! Stories about the devil and the wishes he or she grants is always an eye catcher, the struggle between Good & Evil.  Elizabeth Hurley (The Devil),""Bad Boy"",'02 was very sexy as a devil and almost kept Brendon Fraser(Elliot Richards),""Monkey Bone"",'01 from meeting his true love Francis O'Connor,(Alison Gardner),""Book of Love"",'04. Elliot truly loved Alison and even told the devil,""I JUST WANT ALISON TO HAVE A HAPPY LIFE"", which made The Devil quite mad.   If you just want to enjoy a film and be entertained, don't miss this crazy comedy!",/review/rw0698263/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2001,BaronBl00d,," Side-Splitting, Knee-Slapping Fun!
","Based on the 1960's film starring Dudley Moore and the late great Peter Cook, Bedazzled tells the story of a nerdy man who is, in his estimation, a failure in life and love.  One day this man meets the devil, and a bargain is struck for seven wishes for a soul.  Bedazzled is one of those films that is out-and-out sheer lunacy.  It is one ridiculous premise after another, heightened by some superb comedy writing, directing, and performing. Elizabeth Hurley easily makes the most seductive, lust-inspiring demon to grace any film.  She oozes sex in every word and body swish.  Throughout the course of the film, she and the wardrobe department have obvious fun as she squeezes into some amazing outfits that leave little to the imagination. Aside from her apparent beauty and sex-appeal, she also can act!  Brendan Fraser plays the nerdy and socially incompetent Elliot.  Fraser is one of those actors that is very likable and has a natural sense of charm and humour.  He changes looks during each wish, and just seeing how the make-up department changes him each time is amazing.  Fraser is the comic soul of this film, and it is his ability to take the material at hand and transform it into laughs that really made the film an enjoyable experience.  Some highlights include him playing an over-sensitive man who cries at the sunset.  He turns into President Lincoln and flinches as a champagne cork pops at a play.  He plays a basketball star that sweats gallons.  And there are so many more.  I can honestly say that this film made me laugh long and hard.  Not an easy feat to do, especially in a world filled with adolescent tripe.  Bedazzled is humourous on many levels.  Is it better than its original?  I don't think so, but that was a different kind of comedy.  It was much more philosophical.  This film is going for the jugular comedy vein, and it gets it early and holds on till the end.  Director Harold Ramis does an incredible job pacing the laughs.",/review/rw0698263/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2004,bob the moo,," Broad sketches, sexy outfits but no real laughs and very episodic
","Elliot is lonely and finds it very hard to make friends in his workplace - displaying an acute lack of social skills anytime he tries.  When he is approached by the Devil in a bar he ends up signing away his soul in exchange for seven wishes.  Everything appears to be great - he can have the woman of his dreams and anything else he wants, but his wishes don't quite go the way he expected them to.",/review/rw0698263/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2014,ogdendc,9," One of my guilty pleasures
","This film is one of my guilty pleasures. You know, one of those films that you shouldn't really like but actually do. I guess it helps that I've always had a bit of a thing about Liz Hurley and her role here as the devil suits her perfectly, and her limitations as an actress don't really matter here.",/review/rw0698263/?ref_=tt_urv

8 July 2001,Buddy-51,," Bedraggled
","In the inaptly named `Bedazzled' - a virtually laughless remake of a 1967 Peter Cook/Dudley Moore comedy - the old Faust legend takes one of its severest beatings ever.  I've seen the original film only once before  at a revival theatre in the mid 70's  and remember finding it to be a fresh, original and occasionally laugh-out-loud hilarious British comedy. Unfortunately, none of those adjectives can be applied to this newest version, which strands Brandan Fraser and the stunning Elizabeth Hurley in 90-minutes worth of repetitious humorless nonsense.",/review/rw0698263/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2002,Philby-3,," Pete and Dud meet the devil in California - and she's English
","The Faust legend is a robust story. Although selling one's soul to the Devil is serious stuff, Peter Cook and Dudley Moore managed to make a light-hearted movie of it in 'Bedazzled' back in the swinging sixties. Here, a featherweight Hollywood director Harold Ramis ('Caddyshack,' 'Ghostbusters', Groundhog Day') has remade it, shifting the location from London to San Francisco. However an English actor, Elizabeth Hurley, still plays the Devil , this time tempting a nerdish Brendan Fraser.",/review/rw0698263/?ref_=tt_urv
