14 May 2021,ThomDerd,6," Not bad. 1st part of a trilogy.
","Great visuals, excellent fight scenes, good choices on most of the cast (e.g Kano, Scorpion, Sub-Zero) and just a fun movie overall. If you are familiar with the game, you will like it.",/review/rw6843597/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2021,Leofwine_draca,5," I hoped for more
","16 years after the last Hollywood version we get another MORTAL KOMBAT video game adaptation and funnily enough it's about the same quality as the last one. Grittier to begin with and Hiroyuki Sanada is one of those guys who automatically lifts the quality of the thing by his presence alone, but then it ends up turning into the usual CGI dominated cheese fest by the climax. They try to make sense of some kind of plot here which is quite excruciating but by the end it's just the usual intercutting of heavily stylised fights between the player characters. Kudos for the copious gore FX and the CGI isn't as bad as it could have been, but I was hoping for more.",/review/rw6843597/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2021,cyrax-92742,7," A valiant effort but exactly what you expect
","Great action and fight choreography as was to be expected from a movie with this title, special effects regarding characters and their abilities were also very well done especially considering the budget constraints this movie had. Storyline was predictable from the beginning and the writing itself isn't gonna win any awards, characters say their catchphrases from the games in key moments of the film, however, one big surprise for me was the character of Kano. He was the biggest and funniest comic relief character in the whole movie, constantly throwing jokes and insults at other characters. Probably one of the funniest, self aware movie characters I've seen in a long time.",/review/rw6843597/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2021,alvarax,7," Pretty good overall but the lack of a tournament annoyed me.
","I enjoyed MK overall, it was funny, action packed and generally quite faithful as an adaptation. The acting was also really good, with Joe Taslim as Subzero being the highlight for me. I was very disappointed however with the lack of an actual tournament, the fights were either ambush's or quick come and go brawls, there was no structure or rules, which I expected for the first mortal Kombat movie.",/review/rw6843597/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2021,educallejero,7," Amazing for fans (but improvable). For the rest... probably less so.
","The good: the story mostly works, the characterizations are insanely good (from costumes to personalities), and the movie is as gory and brutal as needed, actually way funnier than expected, and the CGI for the powers really great.",/review/rw6843597/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2021,patriciajohnson-22048,7," Not too bad...main character ruined it for me
","I've seen the older movies of Mortal Kombat, and as cheesy and bad CGI as it was, the fights/tournaments, music, and plots were great. I was excited to see this new movie, and it wasn't that bad, but was still left unsatisfied. I was surprised that I fell in love with Kano; he was charming, hilarious, and prob the best character. Following him, I enjoyed SubZero and his fight scenes. Sonya Blade wasn't too bad too. One character that i had no interest in was the main guy, Cole. He was just boring and unnecessary. Even his ""power"" was....blah. I wish they had Liu Kang as the main guy, his story is more interesting. Another disappointment in this was the lack of tournaments in this movie, that was supposed to be the main plot of the whole movie. In addition, they did Goro dirty in this. His fight scene was short and missed the mark, and even though he was the big villain in the first movie, they showed him for less than 5 minutes in this one. Hopefully they bring him back somehow for a better fight in the 2nd movie. If they do, I'm excited to see my boy Johnny Cage!",/review/rw6843597/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2021,Calicodreamin,8," Hell yea!
","I actually quite enjoyed watching this movie! The action was awesome, the jokes were actually funny, and the storyline was fairly well developed. The main characters were badass, and the CGI was stunningly good. I went in with no expectations and was rewarded with a good time. Finish them!",/review/rw6843597/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2021,SnoopyStyle,6," B-movie reboot
","Earth is on the verge of annihilation. After nine victories by Outworld, they are one loss away from the Earth being conquered. Cole Young (Lewis Tan), Sonya Blade (Jessica McNamee), and Liu Kang (Ludi Lin) must defeat the warriors of ruthless Outworld Emperor Shang Tsung (Chin Han).",/review/rw6843597/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2021,jota-b,7," 2021 Special Effects, 1990 storyline
","I believe that I'm speaking for most fans when I say that I was expecting this to be loyal to the original storyline - a thought that the movie trailer ended right away. Instead we were presented with lots of deviations, and a sort of ""prequel"" that states a hope to build a cinematic universe around Mortal Kombat for the coming years, which don't get me wrong, is a very good thing. What I do think it's bad is the general acting - regarding some exceptions - along with character build up. Outworld characters appear to fall from the sky with little to no storyline attached to who they are and where they came from, when there was a lot to tell, especially about Shang Tsung, Mileena and Kabal. Actors playing Liu Kang, Kung Lao and particularly Raiden were close to average, along with their argument which was little to none. Kabal's voice was also not adequate to its figure. The guy's breathing through a metal mask and is stuck in an ""iron lung"" and sounds like a young wannabe highschool bully.",/review/rw6843597/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2021,Fella_shibby,9," The death sequence of Nitara deserves an 8 alone. I tried the mighty clap with a watermelon at home.
",I enjoyed this tremendously. I got what i wanted. Fast paced non stop action.,/review/rw6843597/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2021,zorba-36271,10," Finally a Rated R Mortal Kombat!! And it was great
","Violent and gory, just like the game! Non stop action. Great fights and a ton of blood. Nicely paced and I love that it harkens to parts of the game. You'll love it!",/review/rw6843597/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2021,Phil_M_A_Kerr,10," They spelt Kombat wrong
","As an old fart, I was surprised at how engaging this new take was. The 1995 version was good fun and this effort maintains the rage. The right mix of kung fu & fantasy. Plenty of laughs, gore, & deliciously cheesy, heartfelt moments.",/review/rw6843597/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2021,FinalSmash1689,5," Such a missed opportunity
","Pros:
",/review/rw6843597/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2021,FeastMode,3," sighhhhhhhhhhhhh
","Things i liked: the opening scene was amazing. The fighting was awesome, beautifully shot, a few too many cuts but i could still see everything. And basically anything with subzero or scorpion was great. And cano was a fun and funny character",/review/rw6843597/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2021,Xstal,4," Fatal Disengagement...
","Ticking all the wrong boxes, with appalling acting, action and special defects through a disjointed and disconnected story, you will find it challenging to get to the end and wish you hadn't when you do.",/review/rw6843597/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2021,Darwinskid,," And this was the best they could come up with?
","I am not that biggest Mortal Kombat fanatic, I would at best describe myself as a casual fan of the property, I played the first three games endlessly as a kid and watched the short lived animated series, short lived live-action TV series, and the original 1995 feature film adaptation multiple times. A new big screen version seemed appropriate in this day and age with technology becoming more advanced and the franchise's mythology becoming more complex but honestly after watching this latest attempt I am left scratching my head as to how and why this was considered to be the best possible version they could have made. Story-wise it's pretty boring, its essentially a 'set-up' tale that stuck in first act mode throughout its entire runtime, it moves pretty fast and its a little hard to invest yourself to the characters because of it. The humor is really mean spirited and completely overdone, I like Kano as a character but often I found myself yelling ""shut up!"" at the screen. The action I have to say is not very impressive, a lot of it is pretty cut heavy and you do not really feel any sense of excitement or feel there is any danger for the heroic characters in this. Visually, it looks and feels a lot like a series from The CW, very few times really feel it warranted a big screen release on a cinematographic level. Honestly, that it was R rated is the one aspect they got right, everything else however...No.",/review/rw6843597/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2021,viantyara,7," Fun, gory but could be better!
","I don't really play Mortal Kombat or even follow the concept behind it. But even so, I enjoyed this movie. The fighting choreography is top notch! The costume, the cgi is also worth the hype. I love that they decided to make it rated R. But there's also some things that bothered me, like some bad cinematography, cheesy dialogues, and the somehow boring protagonist. The act 3 of the movie really felt rushed like the writers only had 5 minutes left to finish the script. I hope the sequel will have a better act 3.",/review/rw6843597/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2021,MikeHunt1075,4," Weak pathetic fools.
","Who green lit this to be made this way? I guess New Line figured if it could contain blood and gore it would succeed, but even that is lackluster here.",/review/rw6843597/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2021,Healing_Process,4," I realize peoples perception is highly skewed and it pains me that they justify it
",People giving this movie a 6+ needs to surely either evaluate their tastes or look deep within themselves to understand what they like in movies. Mortal Kombat Annihilation from 1997 was as cheesy as they come and I can swallow and appreciate the tropes that that movie made compared to the tropes of this one. The post covid sets with the inclusive cast mixed with the marvel universe non-serious humor really left a bad taste in my mouth.,/review/rw6843597/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2021,ryanlion-38514,5," Decent but most will agree original is better
",I appreciated some aspects of the film. Sub-Zero and Raiden I thought were great. Still like the previous ones better. Otherwise I felt alot of the characters were bland. Too much attetion to some characters like Kano who I felt talked too much took too much time and again original character was better. Some scenes just overdrawn or not necessary. It makes me want to view the original again. Why was Raiden so different? Some characters like Johnny Cage missing and others added like other reviewers stated like maim character not good. I agree should of been centered around johny cage or liu kang. It is still watchable. It was one of the better 2020-2021 movies so far as they have been very few anf far in between.,/review/rw6843597/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2021,alanhowden-86367,3," A bad movie by any measure
","Even by the standards of films based on video games this is not good. I've played the games since MK2 so I know the franchise has a stupid story but since the film seems happy taking some big liberties with it it should have been made better, not worse (who TF is the main character anyway and why is his super power having an armoured shirt- there are 80 character on the MK roster there was no need to create Cole blandy Mcbland face).",/review/rw6843597/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2021,Wikkid_Gamez,10," Excellent start to what will hopefully end up a trilogy....
","I see a lot of people talking about the lack of certain things like the actual tournament, to much groundwork on background for certain characters and other characters completely missing from the movie, characters not looking the same etc, as well as people saying they wish there had been more action than only about 40-50% of the movie.",/review/rw6843597/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2021,and_shove_it_up_your_butt,7," Solid movie on the ""Mortal Kombat/Street Fighter"" scale
","First things first - I'm super pissed they didn't yell MOORRTTAALLLL KOOMMMBBAAATTT"" even once during the movie. I waited to hear it and was so disappointed *insert thug tear here*",/review/rw6843597/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2021,specopswolfmp,7," 7 for nostalgia 6 for a movie as a whole
","I believe I was 12 years old when the first Mortal Kombat came out at the arcades, I would stand in lines meticulously destroying my competition. Watching this movie brought back memories that I hadn't thought about since I was young . To make this short, The nostalgia was perfect, they had all the old champions with a few new mixed in..The beginning was awesome, I really thought it was going to be a different Mortal Kombat movie, However, the beginning is the only drama you see after that its all fights. WHICH WERE AWESOME, but for people looking to see some sort of drama or decent script writing it falls very short.",/review/rw6843597/?ref_=tt_urv
