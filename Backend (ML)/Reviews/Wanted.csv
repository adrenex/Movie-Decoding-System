1 January 2021,BoydudeReviews,7," A fun, dramatic, fantasty gulity pleasure.
","As a 23 year old black dude, I actually liked this show. I honestly thought it was going to be a full on comedy, but it actually had a lot of dramatic themes. I won't lie when i watched the first two episodes, I was very, very confused as to why there were alot of black royals. I thought for a second that this was true, but if memories served me right, it wasn't. But then I began to understand that this is all fiction and a made-up fantasy on what if life was like this.",/review/rw8047217/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2021,TV_viewerno1223455678910,1," Cringeworthy and embarrassing
","What is the point of this show in 2020/21? It has nothing to offer except for being a awful version of a Jane Austin novel. The writing is poor, the script awful and acting stunted. I'm black British and found it too cringey to watch.",/review/rw8047217/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2020,star_hazard,8," Mainstream Wattpad Historical Romance
","Let me just start that I am a fan of the books so I am watching this as I did when I watched all the live actions of Pride and Prejudice, with eyes finally getting my wish of seeing my fave books come to life, and I was not disappointed. Is it a masterpiece? NOT AT ALL. Is it accurate to the books? Not so much but they did get the heart of it. There's a lot of issue I find with it but somehow I still find myself watching it because I love the genre.",/review/rw8047217/?ref_=tt_urv

",If you're going to be historically inaccurate in a period romance for the sake of politically correct diversity - fine. You can be forgiven for that.,/review/rw8047217/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2022,nofitatjam,1," Far below downtown abbey
",The fact that this drama need a lot of adult scenes to boost the views said it all. Shallow stories and plot. Nothing like it was supposed to be in the timeline of the story.,/review/rw8047217/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2020,valeriorinaldi-36361,1," To Be Avoided At All Costs
",Bridgerton is a reimagining of Regency London and it deals with a young aristocratic woman looking for love and a financially adequate husband in her aristocratic circle. I was fooled by the trailer and yesterday I gave it a shot.,/review/rw8047217/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2021,korodim,1," Walt Disney approach on Regency era
","I think American producers should stop making shows set in a European time or place, it's an insult to the whole continent. Anyone with a pinch of knowledge on English history or literature will find this show ridiculous. The dialogoues are overwritten, yet shallow, characters annoying, costumes are weird for the era (like everyone wears corsets, but the dresses show no waistline), I'm no expert on historical dressing, but I'm almost entirely sure that none of the costumes are even close to their time. This is a very soapy and very wrong take on a period where title and wealth was everything and rigid rules determined the life of upper class. I wouldn't be aginst pretend history if it was funny or entertaining, not just putting different races and sex scenes in the show. This era was nowhere near how they depict it, but for this much distortion it's boring and shallow. It really is like a teen (or American) version of Downton Abbey.",/review/rw8047217/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2022,jewellz48,8," Escapist fun
","This is the tv equivalent of delicious cake topped with swirls of frosting. Sweet and fluffy and beautiful to look at. This isn't historically accurate and isn't trying to be. It is as meaningful as any of the myriad of superhero shows out there, which somehow elicit far less vitriol than this. Hmmm. Wonder why? If you're looking for meaning or history, this ain't it. If you're looking for an absolute visual treat of pretty people and prettier costumes and a bodice ripper brought to life, then this is a winner. Enjoy it for what it is, escapist fun, or move on!",/review/rw8047217/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2022,sophiakjaer,1," this is just not jane austen
","The miscast cast (which is already common on netflix) makes this show almost a parody of so unreal LOL and to make matters worse it has bad acting and bad plot lines that are just plain silly and lack any depth don't waste your time watching this nonsense that has nothing ""british"" and even less jane austen!",/review/rw8047217/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2020,Hellooo1234321,," Loved it 7/10, Season 2 is better than season 1. Better acting, better storyline. Not too much sex and not too much overacting. The right balance is in season 2.
","March 2022: season 2 is better, the acting is so much better and the storyline as well. The actor who plays Anthony (Jonathan Bailey, he deserves bigger on-screen roles) is an outstanding actor. Skip season 1, only watch season 2. This season has the right balance of drama, laughter, character development, and build up. Season 1 was too much s*x, season 2 is good and not too much s*x. Season 1 is worth max a 6 because of the bad acting. Season 2 is worth a 7.5/10. The chemistry that Anthony and Kate had in Season 2 was amazing üòç, I didn't feel that with Daphne + Simon something was off (without the intimacy that was scripted/coached they looked like friends).",/review/rw8047217/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2022,katefrichardson,6," I mean...
","The costumes are magnificent. The casting is unique and the acting is decent. The set design is very colorful and wonderful to look at. Also, the orchestral version of modern songs is a nice take, as well as having Dame Julie Andrews to narrate. But, even the second season couldn't save this overall extremely stuffy script. I feel like I can finally see some elements of Jane Austen... but why does it still feel SO... meh?! üò¨",/review/rw8047217/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2022,prashant-63677,1," Unreal, a lie, an insult.
","I am not British, but this is an insult to the colored people of Britain. Their mistreatment during those days being 'white washed' in this blatant manner. This dumb show is also unfair to all discerning viewers who understand that its a one shameful lie, and part of woke agenda. Its just a pathetic soap opera which doesn't do justice to anyone, least of all the viewers who are victims of this travesty.",/review/rw8047217/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2022,TheDyingGirl,5," Dreadful!
","Mind you I rated s1 a 10. I just loved it. Everything worked. Nothing wrong the actors in this one. I think they did a good job actually, considering what they were working with. Whoever wrote the script must have been high on meth cause huh?. Unlike s1 this one took a whole different course unrelated to the book that it was supposed to be about. I was so disappointed. They should have stuck to the books. Hopefully moving forward they will go back and at least incorporate 80% of the storyline in the following books.",/review/rw8047217/?ref_=tt_urv

25 February 2021,janecreates-1,8," If you are daft enough to even think this is anything but fantasy...
",This series has nothing to do with history or making political statements and was VERY clearly designed as a fun piece of escapism with equal job opportunities for all races. Given that context it really shines as pandemic escapism fun! Anyone who takes it any other way should stick to bbc accurate dramas/documentaries on the period and get out of their own pompous back sides,/review/rw8047217/?ref_=tt_urv

31 March 2022,sublimeintentions,10," To those with no imagination
","The fact that most of the low reviews are for the ""historical inaccuracy"" it is so beyond laughable. To compare this show to a historically accurate drama would the equivalent of saying that the Lord of the Rings is a documentary . One can not fathom the ineptitude of you withering minds. Of course your comatose racism has been jolted awake in your zealous defence of history and accuracy. Ha I say to you ha! History for the most is made of fantastical manipulations by hose who concurred and won the wars. But I digress since that is besides the point. The point is, this is fantasy . It is a genre. Google it.",/review/rw8047217/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2022,teja-49372,9," 2nd Season
","Usually I find myself disappointed by second seasons of shows, especially when the first is so good, and as such did not have the highest of hopes heading into season 2. Having recently completed it I can confidently say that it's better than season one. What about it made it better I cannot say, though I am a sucker for forbidden romance and the removal of those awful sideburns made Anthony 10x hotter. The second season is a must watch with a thrilling slow burn and an incising story. I cannot wait to see how this show plays out and stand witness to each Bridgerton siblings season and the pages of gossip it will bring.",/review/rw8047217/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2020,refinerychick,9," Thoroughly Enjoyed it!!
","Knowing nothing about the books or what to expect from the show, I gotta admit that the diversity threw me in the beginning. By the second episode, I became colorblind and grew completely enchanted by it all that I didn't want it to end.
Although I loved it, to be quite frank, in a way it made me sad. All the diversity.. well, it made me see how the world COULD have been and needs to be.
I eagerly await the second season!",/review/rw8047217/?ref_=tt_urv

","I was able to cope with the ethnic angle of characters, but the directing is terrible, for example, the cardboard promenade scenes by the river are filmed as though the director has just shouted, ""and action!"" there is some awful acting and truly the worst editing I've ever seen.",/review/rw8047217/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2022,jacquelinesandra-34671,1," How can anyone think it is good???
","Could barely watch the end of episode 1.....
a bad soap opera trying to make a 19th century love story modern...omg this is so ridiculous my eyes are still bleeding! If you like it it you need to explain why coz I really don't get it!",/review/rw8047217/?ref_=tt_urv
