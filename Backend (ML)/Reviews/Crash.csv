","I just want to stand up for this show everyone is dumping on. It is not suppose to be a realistic view on life in a boarding school. It's suppose to be fun, and for the most part it delivers the goods. I think the leading lady is rock solid in her role. She's not always perfect, like when she stood up for Dustin against a bully and also when she tried to baby him, sure life in the school is unrealistic, but that is the case for most, if not all? situation comedies of this sort. Examples, High School Musical 1 and two, Hannah Montana ex cetera, so just strap yourself in and enjoy the ride. The last of shows seem to have a lack of focus. The producers seem to be stepping away from the comedy and focusing more on serious stuff. The Haunting of pca by the ghost was very weird like the concept wasn't entirely thought through, if want more drama in the show the characters have to be deeper.",/review/rw2292289/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2017,irma-95,6," Quite entertaining but why?
","Zoey is a very popular girl at PCA and everything seems to be happening to her but she always can find the right thing to do to solve every problem. She is blond, she is Britney Spears' little sister and she is Chase Matthews' crush since the first season. Many reviews state that because of these reasons, this show is very bad.

","As somebody who grew up on Pete and Pete, Clarissa, Salute Your Shorts, and all the other classic Nick shows, I hold a fond place in my heart for Nickelodeon. But that place has, generally, been reserved for anything before All That appeared. In my (not-so) humble opinion, that's the moment at which the network started to go downhill.",/review/rw2292289/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2005,sarah_91,," Hokey and Unrealistic...so why do I watch it?
","I'll admit that I watch this show whenever I get the chance to and whenever I wake up early enough (it's on kind of early for us here in Canada) but every time I do I get even more mad at it. I do like the wide variety of characters, but the show, to me, is too unrealistic for normal standards. The school is perfect, with its Sushi Bar (yes, a SUSHI BAR) and hardly any rules (for example, the guys seem to always be allowed in the girls' dorms - wouldn't happen). Anyways, what bothers me even more is that the main character Zoey (Spears) is perfect, also. She is SO popular, everyone in the whole school seems to know her and completely love her. Example, the episode with the exams. EVERYONE asks Zoey to help her, as if she is the only smart one in the school. Please. And the episode with the backpacks, amazingly, she makes about a hundred of them with those radio things in like what, less than two days...? It always seems like she has an idea for everything, and in the end the whole cast congratulates her and loves her even more. It really bothers me a lot.",/review/rw2292289/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2008,Zaptharo,1," It falls flat on it's face...
","For any fan of Nickelodeon who used to watch the network in the 80s and 90s, there was always something good on. You had entertaining acts like You Can't Do That on Television. You had weird but good shows like Pete & Pete. You even had cartoons that taught morals like Doug. But just like Disney, Nickelodeon has fallen down the tubes, limiting their demographic to shallow preteens and giving us poor excuses to come up with new, innovative shows. As I tried watching Zoey 101, I just shook my head in disgust.",/review/rw2292289/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2014,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,9," Excellent Nickelodeon show
","""ZOEY 101,"" in my opinion, is an excellent Nickelodeon show. I watch it with my 9-year-old nephew from time to time. I always smile and laugh whenever a mishap occurs. I would have to say that the funniest ones are everything that happens one time when Zoey (Jamie Lynn Spears) has some friends over at her house. If you ask me, she always know just what to say and do to make the audience laugh. The writing is always strong, the performances are always good, and everything else about the show is good. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that if you don't have basic cable, you should get it. Now, in conclusion, I hope this will be on Nickelodeon for many years yet.",/review/rw2292289/?ref_=tt_urv

","Everybody is basically bashing this show for the same reason. The show is not supposed to be realistic! If you want a 'realistic' show then make one yourself, because even reality shows are scripted. In reality we work, go to school and do stupid things, or watch Netflix all day. Do you really want to watch a show like that? They made it unrealistic because that's what kids and teens like and that's what makes the show exciting. Who cares if you don't like the show? The show is actually really popular so your opinion doesn't matter, people are still gonna watch the show regardless.. I know I do. Sure, zoey 101 gives us high expectations and all but then again, it's a show. it's made up. You all want realistic but what's the point of 'acting'if it's realistic? Acting is supposed to be fun, not boring. The show is awesome.",/review/rw2292289/?ref_=tt_urv

13 September 2005,leonardshelby17-1,," Zoey 101 Hits Puberty
","I can honestly admit that I really enjoyed season one of Zoey 101, I can also admit that the reason I gave the show a chance was because I've been a huge fan of Britney Spears for years, and trying out her little sister's series seemed like a fine idea. I absolutely love the charm and cheesiness of season one, with a cast of very likable characters and a very ""Lizzie like"" bushy haired sorta dorky kid who tries his hardest to get Zoey to notice him as more of a friend. After season one's end, I really looked forward to season 2, which just premiered, although after watching the first episode, I noticed something was different, the cast went from kids to teenagers, of course it may seem silly that I said that cause all kids grow up, but it really changes the whole mood, where even the bushy haired kid isn't as dorky anymore. I still love it, and I won't stop, despite all the criticism it gets, but I have a feeling season 2 will bring along with it a completely different energy.",/review/rw2292289/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2005,tinkerbell_bubbles36,," Surprised
","I watched the premier of this because there was nothing else worth watching on TV. I expected it to be another ""Unfabulous"" or another ""Lizzie McGuire"" or a copy of some other show but this show is totally original. It's about a girl named Zoey who starts going to a boarding school in CA that allows girls to attend for the first time in its history. The characters are very realistic. My favorite character is Chase. He obviously likes Zoey but is too shy to admit it. It's cute. But anyway, like I said this show is very entertaining and I can't wait to see future ""Zoey 101"" episodes! I would definitely recommend this show for anyone! 9/10",/review/rw2292289/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2006,nat_mermaid,1," Britney's Sister's Show
","I have tried to like this show, I really have, but I can't find a reason why anyone would like it. The story lines are weak, the acting is weak and unbelievable. Every cast member seems to have been picked up off the street at random. And it seems to me that the whole show is just a vehicle for Jamie Lynn Spears to be able to move on to movies. Every episode shows Zoey as the girl that every girl wants to be her best friend and that every boy wants to date. She's always perfect and no one is like that in real life. How can people relate to a character that is just a Barbie doll? Jamie Lynn's acting is fair but she is not a strong enough actress to have the lead role in a series. All the show's fans are just young girls who don't know any better. I'm sorry if you think my comments are too harsh but if you can find a meaningful and deep moment in this series that isn't quickly directed to a beach party - please accept my opinions and find something worthwhile to watch.",/review/rw2292289/?ref_=tt_urv

15 January 2020,NickSchedules,8," A Schneider show with a different format/feel
","Ah, this show was something else, even for Nickelodeon and Dan Schneider standards. For starters, it was done in a single camera style meaning that there's no laugh track involved. And since it was mostly set at an educational place, it was shot on location at an university in Malibu. This is the most unique Schneider show ever because of this. And the show has a cult following mostly due to starring Britney Spears' sister Jamie who was a cast member for the 2000s revival of All That. If you want to watch a comedy-drama without having to endure laugh tracks, Zoey 101 is something I would recommend. Especially if you wanted to go to a place like PCA. Like Ned's Declassified, majority of the show conflict happens at the campus. While it's not as consistently well written as Ned's, Zoey 101 does a good job with characters interaction mans storytelling (especially in the middle seasons). It also got a memorable cast. While not the greatest character, Zoey is alright protagonist and while she can come off as a live action and female version of Arnold Shortman, I've seen worse main characters. Her brother, Dustin, however, is the least memorable character of the show because of his limited screentime (he's the youngest, but I don't know if his actor was busy during the episodes he was absent in or the lack of budget). I'm not the biggest fan of Chase nor James since they exist for ship bait, but they're likable at least. Can't say the same for Logan however since most of the conflicts are usually caused by him and it's always satisfying to see him suffer, even if karma goes too far sometimes. Michael is the funniest character in the show. It helps that his actor is actually the brother of the boy who played Corey Baxter. Dana is actually my least favorite main female character because she came off as arrogant and didn't had other traits besides being the tough girl. Her replacement Lola is much better and have a better chemistry with the characters. Being played by Victoria Justice made it better. Nicole wasn't bad but she can be a nuisance at times and doesn't add up to the plot (doesn't help her actress was fired after season 2). Quinn is actually my favorite female character in the show. She developed a lot and her character from season 1 to season 4 is a far cry from the weird nerd stereotypical character. (Though I gotta say that one episode just didn't do for it for its predictable and forced setup when it comes to her dating game) In my opinion, the show started off rather weak because it was Schneider's first attempt of making it a drama (and trying his best to make sure the humor isn't too much like Amanda and Drake and Josh). Like I said, Dana didn't do the first season any favors because I just outright didn't liked her. The plots were also cliched and they these kind of stories you'll see in a million tv shows (such as two friends fighting, boy getting bullied, School play, etc). I only really enjoyed a few of episodes, and that's about it. Season 2 picks up the quality even if there were a few predictable contenders (Back to PCA, Election, and Girls Will Be Boys). But the good episodes are really exciting to watch and it's what makes this show interesting with character development (Time Capsule, Robot Wars, Haunted House, Quinn's Alpaca, and Spring BreakUp). Season 3 continues the consistent quality and it's without a doubt my favorite season of the show. There's only a few weak spots, but the writing this season is so strong and the characters are probably at their best as well. This season is home to Curse of PCA, my favorite episode of the entire show. Unfortunately, season 4 is a step down because of a few things. Chase is reduced to guest star role because he accidentally went to England without knowing that Zoey came back to PCA. So in the meantime we get a blander replacement of him played by Austin Butler. The first few episodes were still good, but the absence of Chase made it not as interesting as before. But then there's a few episodes in the second half where the writers didn't know what to know with their characters so they just randomly make these little subplots to give them clout. Yes I'm talking about a plot twist of an unlikely couple, but I'll spoil the surprise if I mention it. Rollercoaster was the best episode in the second half due to how relatable it was, and sadly the next episode which is the finale, wasn't as impactful as Drake and Josh's or ICarly's finales. All in all, while Zoey 101 was a nice break from the laugh track filled show, I still recommend it even if the quality is inconsistent throughout its 3 years run.",/review/rw2292289/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2006,roldanjb918-1,1," This show is bad...
","This is the absolutely worst show in the history of Nickelodeon. First of all, no boarding school has a Sushi Bar, Flat screen TVs, and gives every student a laptop. This makes the show so unrealistic, and boring. The plots are pointless, and incredibly boring. The actors are so bad, it makes me want to take my own life. I really hate the fact that in the show, Zoey is the most popular girl in school, and the prettiest, and smartest, and gets the best grades without doing any work. She never has any real problems, and every guy wants to date her. She is so perfect. There isn't anyone like that. Also, I hate that everyone would do anything for her, and everyone picks her for every team, or club. It is so annoying. Quinn is so obnoxious. Her experiments are pathetic, pointless, and fake. Chase is such a wimp. He says he loves Zoey, but if he told her, it would ruin their friendship. How pathetic. Michael tries to be funny, but he never accomplishes anything. Nichole is so perky, and screams a lot. She is never seen doing any work, or studying, but she is a straight A student. Lola thinks she is an actress, but she sucks (Excuse my language). Need I say more? I think no. For your own good, stay away from this show at all costs.",/review/rw2292289/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2005,clairebolton101,," good show
","As i said with unfabulous, this show is aimed for teenagers, therefore it isn't exactly going to be realistic is it?! as its showing on a teenage/kids channel its meant for comedy and appeal to kids. and personally i don't mind the show and enjoy watching it. and I'm sure many kids feel the same way. when i watch it i get a few laughs from it and think most of the story lines are actually funny and good. I'm not saying the show is the best series I've ever seen but I'm not saying its the worst either, and just because it has Jamie Lynn spears in doesn't mean its automatically awful and bad acting. it seems to me nobody gives the relatives of actors shows a chance! but i think people and actually the kids who its aims at should. and if the people who give bad reviews hate it so much just don't watch the show and go and watch a documentary instead if you have no sense of humour or imagination.

26 June 2006,rosannamariastead,4," Obviosly only because she is who she is
","I've seen this programme a few times and the more a see of it, the less I like it. Jamie Lynn Spears was approached to do this because of the fact that she is Britney's sister and I'm sorry to say that that in the show is obvious. They've created the character Zoey to be everything people want to believe Jamie Lynn is, clever, original, smart, pretty, popular etc. The characters around her are only there to make her look better, by being smarter then them, more popular than them, more wanted by boys then them. There is nothing original about this and it's poured with money, so every kid there has the coolest of fashions and stuff. I also have to say, for a 13 year old girl (or however old she is, can't be much older) she wears very mature clothing, those short skirts are too short, it makes young people want to wear them, and all that make-up, this adds to the rising problems of why young girls get into so much trouble. The only thing I will say is that the opening credits are sung by Jamie Lynn and, given her age, isn't bad at all, much better than her sister anyway when it comes to vocal ability. Sorry, it's too mature and yet too dumbed down. It's poorly acted with predictable story lines and there is far too much stereotyping going on too.",/review/rw2292289/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2007,starry_eyed_girlxox,6," Supporting Cast makes up for main character
","Every time I watch Zoey 101, I find myself more interested in the subplots than the main plot. Why? Because the subplots are more about the other characters on the show, rather than the queen bee Zoey (Jamie-Lynn). Let's face it- Miss Spears cannot act. The only reason that she is the lead is because of her celebrity connections, not her acting ability. It's really a shame because some of the more supporting characters on the show are my favorites. For example, the characters of Quinn and Logan are very much underused, and it's a shame. Therefore, I would've given this show a three if it weren't for the great supporting cast that are just waiting in Ms.Spears' shadow.",/review/rw2292289/?ref_=tt_urv

","I just recently discovered Zoey 101 on Family Channel and watched several episodes during their Non-Stop Zoey special they had last weekend. In my opinion, this is definitely one of the better comedies that Family Channel has on its roster. In fact, next to the kiddies shows (which I ceased being interested in some time ago), it's one of the better shows on Family period! It's too bad that all the actors are American, since Family Channel is a Canadian channel. But nonetheless, I really like the acting, and most of the time, I find the characters' antics to be absolutely hilarious.",/review/rw2292289/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2006,Birstyjr,1," A Very Original Idea. Too Bad It's Mediocre.
","Shopping, sunny skies, beaches, boarding school for rich teenagers and perfectly happy endings. Welcome to the life of Zoey Brooks and her friends. Zoey Brooks is portrayed by Jamie Lynn Spears, the self proclaimed actress who got her claim to fame by being the younger sister of the international pop star Britney Spears. With her lovely blond wig in the first season and an attempt at hiding her monotonous country accent, it's confirmed that Nickelodeon has indeed gone to the dogs with nepotism. When Kristin Herrera, the actress who portrayed Dana Cruz in the first season, left the show, all hope vanquished as she was the only decent actress. The female casting is a complete disgrace but the male casting has potential for a teenage media. If they continue to pursue Jamie Lynn Spears as the picture of perfection, very many people will have to lower their standards. With hope, they will soon find that you can't make a career out of nothing. Jamie Lynn Spears is useless for acting, singing and anything else she attempts for that downward spiral she calls a career. There is no wondering why she is a self-proclaimed actress. Critics would most definitely proclaim her as something other than that.",/review/rw2292289/?ref_=tt_urv

","When I first watched Zoey101 with my sister we thought it was a piece of garbage. No one is that rich and lives at a dorm off the pacific coast. In the show, Zoey is a mega popular rich girl that everyone always go to her for advice. Zoey is always the one with the good idea and everyone agrees with her no matter how stupid her idea is. She is always perfect at everything including her perfect figure. And she is such a dietetic freak she talks about carbs like she knows what they are. When she sees that her friends are eating chocolate she confiscates it. And another thing that ticks me off is that she is always chewing a piece of spearmint every time you look at her. And everyone wants something do with her, for example in one episode that Logan guy bid $4,000 to have her and her friends cheer for everything he does in his pathetic life. And her friend Nicole is an overly perky freak that screams a lot.And Lola dresses like a hoochie Houdini lady. 80s called they want there bushy hair back.Might as well shave off the hair chase.

Reasons why I gave this show a 3: 1. The acting is horrible.Sometimes I just want to hurt the people who put these untalented actresses(especially victoria justice) on television. 2. The characters are unbelievable and mismatched. You have your typical popular girl. A peppy, shallow, stupid ,stereotypical, girl who is portrayed by a horrible actress. Then you have a typical jock guy who is somewhat normal and actually nice.Then the stereotyped smart girl who is a freak and obviously does not fit in with the perfect popular friends of hers. Then a stuck up rich pretty boy that would be happier gazing into a mirror all day. Then the wanna be actress who is played by another stinky actress. And last a normal nerd person guy. 3. The plot is boring, and lame. 4. I hate how spoiled these characters are. Can't they just be normal! 5.
