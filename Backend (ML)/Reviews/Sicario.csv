18 May 2020,dworldeater,8," ""I got a train to catch""
","It was a shame that this was dumped to direct to video by Lions gate. I remember seeing a trailer for it at the theater when watching another movie. Although it didn't get the theatrical run it deserved, The Midnight Meat train is a fantastic adaptation of a short story by Clive Barker. Japanese director Ryuhei Kitamura did a nice job in his American debut. This is a very original story that was executed well on the big screen. The film was nicely shot, well acted with lots of gore and nice atmosphere. Bradley Cooper gives a really strong early performance as the lead and Vinny Jones was fantastic as the iconic butcher Mahogany. This is a pretty dark and disturbing horror flick that is very brutal, but still comes across as a classy production. Some of the CG effects are a little cringeworthy, but as a whole this film looks great and is massively underrated in my opinion.",/review/rw1994308/?ref_=tt_urv

31 October 2020,UniqueParticle,10," Masterful horror
","I guess I'm one of very few that loves Midnight Meat Train! Beautiful cinematography, great cast, incredible grisly deaths, and decent story about a photographer that finds out some twisted things happening in New York. Bradley Cooper and Vinnie Jones are great I'm surprised neither haven't done more horror projects. I'm shocked a few hated this movie there's definitely terrible movies and this isn't one of them!",/review/rw1994308/?ref_=tt_urv

28 August 2016,Fella_shibby,9," Stylishly brutal, violent n awesome direction n camera shots.
","I saw this in 2009 on a DVD. A very good film. Horror fans will not be disappointed. It is sylishly scary n brutal. One of the plus point of this flick was the angry looking Vinnie Jones. Very good adaptation of Clive barkers story. It is an atmospheric and eerie film with stylish & cool cinematography by Jonathan Sela, as the camera is placed in various positions & CGI is used to provide some memorable shots. There are some awesome shots and camera viewpoints. In one scene you take on the victim's point of view as she is decapitated. The violence is very graphic but there is no over abundance of gore but it's brutal. The killer Jones is well built, mean, brutal n pure psycho. There's no chance that anyone can stand a fight against him. There is an excellent fight scene that involve Vinnie Jones n Quinton 'Rampage' Jackson (MMA fighter n wrestler). Awesome direction by Ryûhei Kitamura. Not so good acting by Bradley cooper (this film was b4 his Hangover stardom) n then there is Ted Raimi in a small role.",/review/rw1994308/?ref_=tt_urv

","That was the funniest line in the movie, and sadly the movie is just OK. I was upset when I heard that Lions Gate was going to dump this flick on DVD. I even wrote Joe Drake an email pleading that it get a regular release. (he's probably laughing at me right now) I stood in line with a butt load of folks to see the midnight screening last night at the Nuart in Los Angeles. I stood next to the director. I was standing near the writer too (who seemed either drunk or stoned when he first walked in, but then, maybe that's just how he is on the regular). I was excited. This was the one time it would play in a theater near me.",/review/rw1994308/?ref_=tt_urv

22 January 2010,Theo Robertson,6," Good Horror Let Down By The Ending
","20 years ago Clive Barker was the second biggest name in the world of horror behind Stephen King . Weave World topped the fiction best sellers in Britain and HELLRAISER was a big box office hit both sides of the Atlantic . The 1990s saw a dip in his fortunes however starting with the disappointing cinema receipts of NIGHTBREED . Film adaptations such as CANDYMAN didn't fare any better and by the end of the decade it was becoming clear that the HELLRAISER franchise was ruining the original's reputation rather than enhancing it and by the time SAINT SINNER came along I was left thinking HELLRAISER might have been a fluke on the part of Barker rather than the sign of a horror genius . Thankfully THE MIDNIGHT MEAT TRAIN rescues Barker's reputation somewhat , though sadly it's no HELLRAISER ",/review/rw1994308/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2008,DICK STEEL,8," A Nutshell Review: The Midnight Meat Train
","Given that this month's the Lunar Seventh Month where the Chinese believe that spirits roam our world as their month long vacation from purgatory, my friend has so far kept this running joke about my unfortunate bumping into them given I spend my journey home on late night buses and trains. The Midnight Meat Train, as the title suggests, tells of the last train in the system where passengers inexplicably disappears, and I thought that Japanese director Ryuhei Kitamura managed to put a somewhat refreshing spin to the entire slasher and torture porn genre.",/review/rw1994308/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2008,movedout,7," One of the best adaptations of Clive Barker's stories
","Clive Barker's more sanguinary inclinations are paid tribute here through a hulking golem, a malevolent meat merchant in his dapper best, named Mahogany (Vinnie Jones) who smashes, eviscerates and cleaves through unsuspecting commuters on the last train home. Adapted from Barker's seminal anthology, ""Books of Blood"", the similarly named ""The Midnight Meat Train"" is more than just an opportunity for some sophomoric snickering over its title but one of Barker's most revered short stories about a supernatural serial killer that ekes out fascination, fear and obsession from a lone photographer, Leon Kaufman (Bradley Cooper) stumbling upon the butcher's late night deliveries.",/review/rw1994308/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2008,chaos-rampant,," MMT is exactly what the title implies - fast and brutal
","There's something deeply disturbing about the 'show biz' politics and intrigues that managed to exile such a well made film to the 'dollar theaters'. On the other hand, horror purists of all calibre will probably get a kick out of seeing the visceral shocks and convoluted twists Riuhei Kitamura and Clibe Barker have prepared for our enjoyment in the environment of a seedy, rundown theater. If the disturbed denizens of 42nd Street have all but disappeared, scared away by the gloss and glitz of the cineplex and the popcorn munching crowd that inhabits it, perhaps the final bastion of grindhouse cinema can be found in watching a brutal, bloody shock horror film in an empty theater with row upon row of sticky floor and no one but a handful of genre enthusiasts there with you.",/review/rw1994308/?ref_=tt_urv

","In Los Angeles, the photographer Leon (Bradley Cooper) lives with his girlfriend and waitress Maya (Leslie Bibb) waiting for a chance to get in the photo business. When Maya contacts their friend Jurgis (Roger Bart), he schedules a meeting for Leon with the successful owner of arts gallery Susan Hoff (Brooke Shields); she analyzes Leon's work and asks him to improve the quality of his photos. During the night, the upset Leon decides to wander on the streets taking pictures with his camera, and he follows three punks down to the subway station; when the gang attacks a young woman, Leon defends her and the guys move on. On the next morning, Leon discovers that the woman is missing. He goes to the police station, but Detective Lynn Hadley (Barbara Eve Harris) does not give much attention to him and discredits his statement. Leon becomes obsessed to find what happened with the stranger and he watches the subway station. When he sees the elegant butcher Mahogany (Vinnie Jones) in the train, Leon believes he might be a murderer and stalks him everywhere, in the beginning of his journey to the darkness.",/review/rw1994308/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2018,george_revell,9," seemingly mindlessgoret initially gore transforms into A masterpiece of a dark, disturbing nightmarish unique horror masterpiece
","When I heard the imdb summary I was put off, I only ended up watching the movie because I had nothing better to do that evening ... but as the movie unravels, the mindless gore turns into the most astoundingly dark, disturbing masterpieces of horror that will promise to give goosebumps to even veterans of the horror genre such as myself. A very good horror movie I recommend to any horror fan. Especially the last third of the movie is just utterly brilliant combination of unraveling and unforeseen twists with dark and disturbing excellently executed content. If you like horror, you must watch this one. As scary as the original French martyrs.",/review/rw1994308/?ref_=tt_urv

","I saw this movie just now at a local discount theater, and I certainly can't say that I wanted my dollar back.

","Before he achieved his great fame with ""The Hangover"", Bradley Cooper starred in this energetic adaptation of a Clive Barker story. Cooper plays Leon, a struggling photographer in NYC encouraged to do more exploration of the dark side of life by a prospective boss, Susan (Brooke Shields). And during his night time wanderings, he becomes aware of the existence of an unsmiling, imposing stranger, ""Mahogany"" (the well cast Vinnie Jones, who has an undeniable presence), an early morning subway rider with an ever present black bag who's responsible for the disappearances of other commuters, using such implements as a meat pounder and showing off some absolute brutality.",/review/rw1994308/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2018,undeaddt,7," Unique.
","All I have to say is that this movie is very underrated, as I am seeing the Box Office... (15 mill. budget, 3 mill. box office). First of all, the story, altho nothing breathtaking, is unique at least. Second of all, it's been long since we've seen a classic slash/horror movie that lives to the definition SLASH/HORROR. Third, the style is beautiful, dark atmosphere, quite dialog, gothic colours. The acting cast is on point with the story, altho I have never seen Bradley Cooper in a role like this, which works out pretty well in the end ( actually, he should try and do more roles like this one, it suites him pretty well). The only down side for me is the ending, which lost me a bit, altho it's a logical one, since the meat could not be found anywhere. 6-7/10 Worth a watch.",/review/rw1994308/?ref_=tt_urv

",A great movie i must say. Its been a long time there comes a movie that hits you in head. I mean literally. This is perhaps the most under-rated horror movies of the 2008. The reason might be the gruesome violence and the nature of it. Surely this is not for the faint of heart. The movie has a great storyline and the more you see you more you are involved within and you have to see the ending. I won;t comment much on the story. You have to see it to believe it. But i will say that it is not to be missed. and trust me you will think twice travelling in subway at midnight after watching this great piece of horror genre.,/review/rw1994308/?ref_=tt_urv
