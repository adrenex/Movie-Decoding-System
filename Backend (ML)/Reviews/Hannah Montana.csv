17 October 2006,Western,10," intriguing, draws viewer in
","Watching THIRD WATCH is like reading a good book I just can't put down. I'm not one to ""get hooked"" on programs, like soaps, but THIRD WATCH got me good! I only wish I'd seen the original airings. I don't want to miss a single episode of this action packed series. The viewer is drawn in to the actors' characters causes and effects. The lives of the characters are deeply affected by their jobs as fire fighters, police person, or paramedics. The cast are excellent actors and perfect choices for their characters. It's difficult to pick a favorite character as all the interactions and relationships are just perfect. I can't say enough good about this drama, except it's terrible it was canceled after the 6th season. However, give everyone involved with the program credit for putting an ending to the series. Knowing the ending doesn't made a difference with wanting to watch the previous episodes.",/review/rw2223421/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2000,slim-44,," Smart, crisp, nailbiter
","Third Watch is a fast paced, enjoyable show that I hope will stick around. I have to agree with another reviewer that NBC has jerked this show around by moving it around the schedule.  What are they going to do in fall 2000--when Monday night football comes back?  Anyway, I feel that ER has run its course and this show has the makings of picking up the ""high adrenaline show"" mantle and running off with it.  Good show!",/review/rw2223421/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2004,babysisv,," Excellent Show
","Third watch is a great show. It's nice to have something to watch that isn't so predicable and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Let's all be honest...there's a lot of crap on t.v. therefore, third watch is a life saver 10/10",/review/rw2223421/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2002,xeneize007,," The best
","take NYPD Blue and mix it it with ER and some firemen TV show and you'll get 3rd W. I specially like the politically incorrect characters and how they complement each other, and the way they treated the 9/11 stuff without much patriotism and low punches. The best in US TV nowadays",/review/rw2223421/?ref_=tt_urv

6 January 2003,Anewactor,," A Third Watch Fan
","I've been a fan of Third Watch for quite a while, as it consists of a very culturally diverse and talented cast. As an actor myself, I was once fortunate enough to be an extra on the show and found it to be a most enjoyable experience, meeting some of the cast who were not only professional but also very friendly. I'm also a City University of New York Campus Peace Officer and find the show to successfully incorporate real issues within each episode, such as relationship situations (between the officers of the various departments), personal issues like child care concerns, marital problems, etc., as well as most of the official procedures which the uniformed Officers (Police, Fire & Emergency Medical Technicians) utilize in the performance of their duties. The portrayals of the characters by the cast is wonderful, as they succeed in bringing each character to 3 dimensional life! You get the feeling that these are real folks you could actually run into while walking down a New York City street. (Yes, all their performances are that good!!) The action in the show is great, combining the perfect amount of gritty realism and excitement with (at times), a dash of humor. I enjoy the show very much & hope it continues to have a nice long run!! I really like this show and feel that it is the best hour of quality viewing on televsion. Fantastic work by all the cast and crew!!",/review/rw2223421/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2004,KWYJIBO7611,," Where is the DVD??
","Third Watch is a great show. I have been waiting for so long for it to become available on DVD! Does anyone know why the DVDs are available in Japan and not is the U.S.? I don't plan on doing anything on Fridays because that is Third Watch Night in my house. Even as some characters leave or die and new ones are introduced, my family has remained loyal to it. When it was on Mondays, my husband gave up an hr of watching MNF to watch 3rd Watch. If there is anyone out there who reads this and can do anything to help bring it to DVD, PLEASE HELP! With so many other crappy shows out of DVD after a season (uh..Nick & Jessica?) how can anyone let this show go on this long without releasing it on DVD!?",/review/rw2223421/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2003,Totallyrad80,," The show still rules on NBC for 5 seasons and counting on Monday nights
","I know I was going to check out the show when I heard John Welles was doing which his shows are good and I am a fan of Eddie Cibrian (going back to his days from ""The Young and the Restless""), which was another factor to draw me to watch this show and have to always let shows get time to develop about the characters, but I was hooked. The actors (besides Eddie and Michael Beach) I never knew of so it wasn't any big names but they pulled themselves as this group and it was never amateur. ",/review/rw2223421/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2006,lindafatheree,10," Come Back To Us !!
","I loved this show. I lived to watch this show every week. It had action, compassion, love, hate, thrills, you name it. Why was this show taken off the air? My god. They leave the soap operas on for years and years and then you get a wonderful show like this and they take it off. I don't understand. There was never a dull moment on this show. Always something going on. I sure wish they would start it up again. It would be sooooo great. I always wanted Bosco to hook up with Faith. Now that would have been so great. They had a chemistry going. That let me down when they did not at least kiss. You know they wanted to...haha Sad in Louisiana, Linda",/review/rw2223421/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2003,JLJ061,," Very good show
","I have been a big fan of Third Watch since day one. Though it has had its ups and downs I will remain loyal to the end, which I hope will not be anytime soon! It's tough to see characters come and go on the show, I enjoyed seeing Alex and Lt. Johnson (both killed off last season), but Sasha Monroe (Nia Long) makes a great partner for Bosco; not many people can match his kind of mentality! Many people will argue that the show does not match the every day realism of the NYPD/FDNY, but then again, what show does?",/review/rw2223421/?ref_=tt_urv

2 September 2008,sengleaboy,10," A Masterpiece
","I do not usually watch TV shows which are longer than a couple of episodes as I hate to be tied up but this one really got me stuck. Here in Malta I watch it on Italian TV, two episodes which start at 2.30am and end at 4.30am and still it is all worth it. Forget Lost and Prison Break which have promising starts but then end up boring you to death, Third Watch is a real masterpiece and the characters really get you involved especially Boscorelli and Yokas. This show also gives a touch of reality of what its like to be a police officer in NY and the toll this job can have on one's private life. Well done to all those involved in this masterpiece of a show.",/review/rw2223421/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2019,AngelHonesty,8," Good Show!
","As Paramedic/Cop/Firefighter shows go, this is one of the best I have seen. The cast chosen do an amazing job with their parts; Molly Price and Jason Wiles play off of each other spectacularly. The show its self gives a good view into the daily job of a Paramedic and Officer; the struggles they endure in the job itself and how it effects their personal lives. Most shows get caught up in the personal aspect, but this one focus more on their daily jobs; showing how they save people on a daily basis. The only downfall is that it can get exhausting after awhile with the fast pace of the show. But I highly recommend it if you have an interest in watching show about Paramedics, cops and firefighters!",/review/rw2223421/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2022,joriethomas,10," Best show ever to grace the screen
","I used to watch this with my mom who was a retired police officer and she said no other show nailed the reality better than this one. The stories and characters were handled so well and never one dimensional. I laughed, I cried, I was left with an impact. The fact that there were real firemen and officers in the show definitely shone through. I can't believe it only lasted 6 seasons, I'd still be watching it if it were on. Of all the shows that deserve a revival, this one is the most. So glad I found all seasons on Roku, in case you're looking for it.",/review/rw2223421/?ref_=tt_urv

10 December 2000,White Dolphin,," Perhaps my favorite drama
","While others beg to differ, I myself think that ""Third Watch"" is better than ""ER"". For starters there's much more diversity- firemen, policemen, paramedics... and also an ER doctor. Basically anyone you would dial 911 for. It's nice to not be stuck in the emergency room of a hospital in Chicago all the time. Also the ""ER"" cast are starting to get on my nerves- the moment you get used to a character and remember their name they yank them out and put someone new in.",/review/rw2223421/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2009,Xtrackstar,10," Third Watch- what a series!
","What an absolutely amazing show!!! I followed it religiously! Great, creative writers, talented actors, amazing consistency, great medical accuracy combined with amazing attention to detail made Third Watch unique. Captivating story lines mixing the absolute extreme with normal everyday issues. Realistic, multidimensional, diverse characters from various age groups and socioeconomic backgrounds showing the different complex relationships they had with one another and how they And the relationships changed over time. I love the raw human emotions this show evoked. The humour injected was intelligent. I loved how the story lines tied together. I was so disappointed when this show came off the air. Glad to know there is still a large fan base. I still think I must be one of the shows biggest fans!",/review/rw2223421/?ref_=tt_urv

","After having seen the first episode I was hooked on the show, (love at first sight). The blend of cops, firefighters and paramedics, and all the human aspects of life, like: loyalty, friendship, e.c.t. made this series # 1 on my list. Well, I have to say, there are not many series that can keep me interested season after season, but THIRD WATCH was/is one of them, it's only getting better and better.",/review/rw2223421/?ref_=tt_urv

1 October 2006,indigochronicles15,10," A great show with exceptionally talented, underrated actors and actresses.
","This is my favorite television show to watch, even though it ended its run over a year ago. I never watched the show during its run, and came across it one night when I couldn't sleep. After watching a few episodes over a few consecutive nights, I found myself liking the show and the characters, and began watching and taping the show on a regular basis. The characters are great. You really find yourself caring about them, and hated to see them hurt. The most endearing characters to me were Monte 'Doc' Parker, Faith Yokas, Ty Davis Jr., Bobby Caffey, Maurice 'Bosco' Boscorelli, Jimmy Doherty, and Kim Zambrano. The actors on the show are all exceptional as well. Coby Bell is my favorite actor from the show and is very underrated. He's an incredible actor. Molly Price is also extraordinarily talented, and yet she's not a household name. She's great. Michael Beach also, as Doc, was really good. The rest of the cast, also, was just impeccable. The writing on the show was some of the best I've seen on TV. The story lines were compelling and completely sucked you in for sixty minutes each episode. Then, you're left waiting on the edge of your seat for the next episode. The show had a devoted following, but was inexplicably cancelled by NBC in March of 2005. With the NBC network really struggling right now, they should really be kicking themselves for cancelling such a great show. I guess 132 episodes on A&E will have to be enough.",/review/rw2223421/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2005,Rocky63215,10," Cruz's Illness
","I wonder what kind of disease Cruz has. Obviously she knows what she has because of the way she acted when the doctor wanted to talk with her. Now, this could be one of the reasons why Cruz isn't the friendliest to everybody. The only thing I can think of how she could get a disease in the show is when she was raped by that guy when she was pretending to be a nurse. Now, I don't care what every girl thats going through puberty says about Boscoe leaving and they are not going to watch the show. Cry me a river even if Boscoe wasn't in the show and they had a different person playing the role of Boscoe the show would be good. This season has been the best by far and I only wish they could put the show on DVD. Everybody leaves a show eventually Frasier, Friends, Seinfeld,etc... What makes Third Watch great is that you can actually sympathize with the characters and whats going on.",/review/rw2223421/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2007,fourfortysixpack,10," DVDs
","I've often wondered why Third Watch is only on DVD in Asia, but I'm told by some connected friends it has to do with copyright and royalty issues with the music. Since Third Watch has mainstream music by big, established artists, they need to pay them more to use the music on DVD. Asia has more lax laws governing this. A good example of this is the Married... With Children DVDs. Notice the theme song ""Love and Marriage"" is replaced by some generic keyboard music? Other shows didn't have this problem, as there were fewer artists and songs used (Like Tour of Duty - Most in-show music was original scores, and the theme song ""Paint it Black"" was and always will be connected to Tour of Duty). Once they pay the artists, we'll get our DVDs. Oh, btw - Third Watch introduced this old rocker to The Crystal Method (Theme song Keep Hope Alive, also used in the Tomb Raider movies, but will ALWAYS be identified as the Third Watch theme. Best recording ever of this tune is on the Family Values Tour '99 CD, recorded live in Biloxi, Mississippi). I say ""NBC, pay the artists/labels/whoever the money, I guarantee you'll profit huge when you release the DVDs! Then, sell the show to a movie studio, and make a Third Watch feature film, using the cast from the final episode!""",/review/rw2223421/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2004,rabol,10," Some spoilers inside !!
","'Third Watch' is a drama series about a group of cops, fire fighters and paramedics. They do what real cops/firemen/paramedics usually do, and that way they create the best drama tv series ever - in my opinion. What i love the most about this show is the fact that it's unpredictable. You never know what's gonna happen next, i found myself shocked many many times by the events taking place in the show. The producers always manage to suprise and shock us. For example, one of the main characters is absolutely fine, has some minor issues, but who doesn't ? And then all of a sudden in the next episode he goes crazy and does something absolutely unexpected and shocking. It happens all the time in 'Third Watch'.Speaking of characters - they're all very well written, and the cast is very talented. This is basically all i have to say about this show, it love it, if you haven't seen it before, give it a shot, you'll love it too :)",/review/rw2223421/?ref_=tt_urv
