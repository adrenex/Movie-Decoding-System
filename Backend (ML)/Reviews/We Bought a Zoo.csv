23 March 2022,ferguson-6,6," silly and formulaic by design
","Greetings again from the darkness. It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, ""The best stories are rooted in reality.""",/review/rw8011953/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2022,guskeller,5," Pieces that work and pieces that don't
","The Lost City has pieces that work and pieces that don't. Placing pretenders into an actual adventure is good for laughs and heart, yet much of this script is generic. Unimaginative MacGuffins, flat villains, and predictable romances are individually forgivable, but together, they override the premise's charm. Furthermore, the dialogue, humor, and plot devices are subpar. The cast enhances the material (especially Pitt and Radcliffe), but some scenes are groaners. Tatum's charisma shines through and Pitt's cameo provides flavor, but that isn't enough to pull The Lost City out of mediocrity. It isn't painful, but The Lost City misses more than it hits.",/review/rw8011953/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2022,Sleepin_Dragon,7," Good fun.
","I wasn't expecting to enjoy this, but on the whole, I did, some bits of it were pretty silly, but there were some nice moments, and a few bits that had me in stitches. Some of the sweeter, romance moments were maybe a little corny, but that's what was expected I guess.",/review/rw8011953/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2022,FeastMode,6," Enjoyable and amusing
","The first half of this movie is really funny. I was laughing more than most in the theater. There are so many well-written jokes and situational humor with about an 80% hit rate, including a few hilarious moments. The characters are fleshed out enough for me to care. The story is formulaic and relatively weak compared to the other aspects, but that's easily forgiven when it's making me laugh.",/review/rw8011953/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2022,kjproulx,7," A Solid, Throwback Comedy
","Mainstream comedies that actually make it to theatres are slim to none these days. I remember a time when there was possibly a big comedy coming out every one or two months, with at least half of them being good, but in today's climate, humour is just tough to get right. I was very happy to see that Paramount would be taking a chance and releasing a big comedy in The Lost City this year, but I truly didn't know to what to expect from it. After seeing it in theatres, I'm happy to say that I had a good time with it. It's not great, but it felt like a throwback comedy, just with a modern twist.",/review/rw8011953/?ref_=tt_urv

1 October 2022,Roman-pc,8," Better than the user rating on Imdb right now
","Bonkers that this film is rated only 6.1 on Imdb right now--it's better than that. Proof that folks who rate movies on here are sometimes guilty of the same crime that professional critics frequently make--looking the gift horse in the mouth. As you can see folks, this is not an art-house film--it's pure entertainment, and it delivers on that count.",/review/rw8011953/?ref_=tt_urv

","A cute and funny enough rom com, a few more of the jokes were stale than I would have liked, but overall it accomplished its goal. A few laughs, a few ""awhs"", and a whole lotta ""omg is Channing Tatum hot""'d.",/review/rw8011953/?ref_=tt_urv

12 May 2022,KOOLAIDBRO,1," Uggggggggghhhhhhh
","This was rough. I guess I put my expectations too high from the previews. The part with Brad Pitt was fine the rest a typical Sandra Bullock overreacting to mild inconveniences and complete stupidity. Shoutout to the marketing team for making this look like something I would enjoy when I knew better, but thought maybe? Just maybe? Well I knew better. This is terrible.",/review/rw8011953/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2022,jdesando,," An enjoyable knockoff of Indiana Jones et al. Romantic and goofy.
","Yes, The Lost City is a sometime dimwitted, formulaic romantic adventure like Romancing the Stone and Indiana Jones with not much creativity that I could tell. No, it is not totally boring because it offers a relaxing antidote to COVID anxieties plaguing us for two years. The cutthroat island shenanigans, with reclusive romance novelist Loretta (Sandra Bullock) and her cover model Alan (Channing Tatum) are kidnapped looking for buried treasure.",/review/rw8011953/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2022,garethwooduk,4," Mediocre at best...
","Great line up, but this film tries to hard to be funny with cringy and unforgettable action scenes... Felt like a total gimmick and clone of Romance in the Stone & Jewel in the Nile that both captured romance, action & humour so very well!",/review/rw8011953/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2022,jmc4769,1," One of Bullock's and Tatum's worst movies
","I've seen a lot of enjoyable Sandra Bullock movies and quite a few enjoyable Channing Tatum movies. They are both appealing popcorn movie stars. But this movie was like every stupid, unfunny, cringey, annoying scene that they've ever been in, all rolled into one movie. The screenplay was embarrassingly bad, and it brought out all of Bullock's and Tatum's worst tendencies. Daniel Radcliffe was a bland villain, and Da'Vine Joy Randolph's scenes were practically unwatchable. Brad Pitt's character was about the only good thing in the movie. I actually laughed when he was onscreen. But when he got literally blasted out of the picture early on, it drained all of the life out of him and the movie.",/review/rw8011953/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2022,kosmasp,9," Moving on
","I try to avoid watching trailers before I see a movie. Sometimes it is inevitable - you can't escape certain trailers. So while I still managed not to see everything the trailer revealed, I already knew from the looks of it, that I would like the movie. And lo and behold the movie delivers the goods.",/review/rw8011953/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2022,TruthSeeker4Life,1," Truly a waste of time and talent
","I can't quite understand how these actors would choose to make such a unfunny comedy. The humor is so basic and simple that I can't believe the actors thought this would work. With movies like these it feels as though mainstream Hollywood is intentionally trying to dumb down the population or they have become so arrogant they think they can throw a few good actors together in a film that's made with 110% cheese! It's a cheese party and laughs and humor weren't invited! And the prized guests of the party were signs and facepalms whilst shaking ones head. Was this to make a quick buck? Maybe help out a fellow producer or writer who is a friend? Or maybe they just rely on the names to bring in the money, but I don't see how any of the stars in the film can actually watch this film and feel at all good about themselves and the product they've put out. It's just a complete and utter fail from the very beginning. All I was wondering throughout the film is ""why?""",/review/rw8011953/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2022,UniqueParticle,8," Very fun despite some of the ridiculous bits
",Got to see the early ish screening considered date night on the regal app that was great time! One of the funniest things set up in the is experience was showing a short trailer of the movie 6 times that's never been a thing and there was feature before the movie started mostly talking about the red dress being a character itself that was silly. Didn't expect as much comedy as there was and highly entertaining action even an excellent soundtrack! I don't know about others but I loved the movie.,/review/rw8011953/?ref_=tt_urv

2 June 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,7," A fun and entertaining one time watch
","Novice writers and directors brother duo the Nee's did an impressive job with this full length feature film, especially considering their previous works were mainly shorts. The 112 runtime was used up well, although a little faster pacing and/or some scenes trimmed down would've shown better. Casting and performances were excellent, especially Channing Tatum who was the main source of laughs. The story is not revolutionary, but did have some refreshing changes to the genre. It's a fun and entertaining one time watch, especially if you're a fan of any of the lead cast.",/review/rw8011953/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2022,PrairieCal,1," Jungle Dung Complete with Clich√©s & Stereotypes
","The amazing thing about this film -- despite the fact that it was made at all and that there isn't an original thought or idea throughout -- is that it's rated so highly on .imdb. It's also amazing that the talented actors ever agreed to be in this piece of jungle dung. The writing is terrible, amateurish, the dialogue silly, and the jokes totally unfunny. A total waste of talent.",/review/rw8011953/?ref_=tt_urv

27 March 2022,baxterkw,7," Needs more Brad Pitt
","The chemistry between Bullock and Pitt is beyond words even though for only a minute or two. It's so powerful that it dulls the chemistry between Channing and Bullock. It's too bad that Brad wasn't given a much larger role as he has a real knack for comedy. It was likely to keep costs down or maybe he couldn't commit to more shooting days. If budget wasn't an issue I would have written a few more Pitt scenes in and maybe less goat. They tried to milk the goat bit (sorry) and it just wasn't funny. Radcliffe was good too and again he could have used a few more scenes. Still, money well spent just to watch Brad for a few minutes as he stole the entire movie.",/review/rw8011953/?ref_=tt_urv

16 May 2022,nigepitz,1," What a hapless abomination
","The makers of this movie are not a stupid as you would think having watched this garbage because they were smart enough to overplay Bratt Pitt's role which is 90% of the trailer and 1% of the film, the only good 1%. The writing is horrific, the acting wooden, the dialogue embarrassing and the plot stolen from Romancing The Stone. Sandra Bullock is awful, Channing Tatum, charmless and Daniel Radcliffe so bad it hurt my eyes to watch him. It is a truly awful film. It has no charm, no wit and no chemistry between the leads. I am angry at myself for wasting two hours on it.",/review/rw8011953/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2022,DarkVulcan29,8," Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum amazingly click
","It would be easy to call this a knockoff of Indiana Jones, but in some ways it kind of knows it, has a fun self aware vibe to it. It's merely just a satire of those treasure adventure films.",/review/rw8011953/?ref_=tt_urv
