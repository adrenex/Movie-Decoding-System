28 January 2023,UniqueParticle,9," Deeply unsettling, unique, and unlike anything I've seen before!
","Well Infinity Pool was absolutely demented and came from a mind of Brandon Croenberg he seems truly effed in the head for creating this film; great for horror fans and I loved everything regardless. The imagery belongs in hell! This film is something very odd, trippy, filled with madness, and not for everyone. The Cronenberg's have a common horror weirdness they are fairly brilliant. To me the movie gets praise because it's art despite being ghoulish and bonkers there's a lot to enjoy like the writing is incredible, flow of the story is great, and highly entertaining throughout I especially love the masks used in several scenes. I recommend and hope anyone appreciates my opinions.",/review/rw8832055/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2023,kikilangmore319,8," Infinity Pool is a layered piece of bizarre and atmospheric horror that gives Mia Goth and Alexander Skarsg책rd a perfect platform to showcase their talents.
",This movie is incredibly well made. The music works perfectly and sets the tone from the start. The locations and setting are stunning and compliment the distinct cinematography that impressed me throughout the movie. The atmosphere of the idyllic resort is beautifully immersive and adds a lot to the dread and isolation of being in an unfamiliar country experiencing chaos.,/review/rw8832055/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2023,brideaujeremy,10," Mia Goth x Brandon Cronenberg x Alexander Skarsg책rd = what we needed.
","I went into this movie with low expectations considering I wasn't a massive fan of possessor! I'm a big Mia Goth fan I figured she'd deliver a unreal performance and she did! But the movie ended up being way better then I'd ever expect! Alexander Skarsg책rd delivered a unforgettable performance as well. The movie's extremely unique I don't give 10/10s often and I've seen 2000+ movies I've probably given out about 30 10/10s I really do think it's that good. Some people will find the movie to strange for them, and some people will embrace the madness. Congratulations Brandon,Mia & Alexander for making a unforgettable masterpiece of a horror.",/review/rw8832055/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2023,drownsoda90,9," A lush, rotten vacation through the nine circles of hell
","""Infinity Pool"" follows James Foster, a struggling writer vacationing with his wife Em at a posh resort in a fictional third-world country. There, he meets Gabi and her husband, Alban. When an illicit trip outside the resort's gates leads to a tragic accident, James is faced with execution; or, as an alternative, the execution of a ""double"", a clone of himself, whose sacrifice he must bear witness to. What ensues is a rapid psychological downslide into vengeance, self-abasement, and debauchery.",/review/rw8832055/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2023,klwalthour,9," The power of sound editing shines here
","First thing I noticed, as it was first in the film, is the haunting effect that the sound has on the overall ""vibe"". It made those initial beautiful resort scenes have me on the edge of my seat!",/review/rw8832055/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2023,FeastMode,7," Wow, what an experience
","I ask this in the best way possible: what did I just watch? Infinity Pool is so weird in the exact way I love. And as usual, I went in knowing nothing about the movie (don't watch the trailer, it gives away so much). This is the exact kind of movie to experience this way.",/review/rw8832055/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2023,nicolasroop,3," This film is unpleasant to sit through, but not for the reasons Cronenberg would want
","This film had the potential to be something new and creative in the horror genre, but wirter/director Brandon Cronenberg settles for more of the same of his usual style with little in the way of an understanding of why these events are occuring or even caring that they are happening. Now, I am a fan of his. Antiviral and Possessor are fantastic films that benefit from his particular brand of trippy visuals and existential analysis. The difference between those films and his latest effort is he does little to help build tension and does nothing to make us care for any of the characters he has written. They are all terrible people, not one of them worth redemption.",/review/rw8832055/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2023,rdoyle29,9," Brilliant satire
","Unsuccessful author Alexander Skarsg책rd is on vacation with his wealthy wife Cleopatra Coleman, who foots all the bills, at a resort in an unnamed, fictional vaguely European country seeking inspiration for his second novel that stubbornly fails to materialize. He meets Mia Goth, who claims to be a huge fan of his book, and soon the couple is socializing with Goth and her husband Jalil Lespert.",/review/rw8832055/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2023,zachary-carrier92,5," Made for Crtics
","Look, I'm sure plenty of people will whip up well written reviews that dive into all the meaning that underpins this movie. Personally, I though it was boring. I couldn't have been less invested in the story or the characters. And strangely it was simultaneously too indulgent and pulling punches on the disturbing front. Aside from an interminable psychedelic orgy scene that just wouldn't end, the movie didn't take the violence and depravity far enough. Anyway, bursting at the seams with supposed depth doesn't do away with the need to make an entertaining product. I was happy when the movie ended.",/review/rw8832055/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2023,demonblade-37792,7," Sick, Twisted, and Fun!
","Infinity Pool is a good horror film filled with good acting, murders, and the story. The story with it being that a rich couple named James (Alexander Skarsgard) and Em (Cleopatra Coleman) are vacationing in a resort, but in a foreign country. They eventually meet another couple named Gabi (Mia Goth) and Alban (Jalil Lespert) that the four of them have fun partying. Until one night, James drives them back to the resort, but commits a hit and run that he gets sentenced to jail. In the foreign country, the only way is to escape is death. Although, James has a double clone executed and murdered instead while he and his wife watches. Until that execution, James is slowly pleasuring murder and all hell breaks loose.",/review/rw8832055/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2023,michaelmcdowell-97337,9," Depraved, Disgusting, Beautiful
","I think this is my new favorite of Brandon's Cronenberg's films. I enjoyed Possessor and Antiviral but this landed in a way I did not expect. I would also say that this is a more accessible film than the others. It's twisted and gives you what you want and expect. If you enjoyed his other films you will enjoy this and if you didn't, than you probably won't. Cronenberg's direction really came through and I feel he really has carved out his own style. It's definitely not for everyone but for those it's for, it's a satisfying, psychedelic descent into madness. I look forward to Cronenberg's future films with anxious anticipation. I'm ready to be disturbed again.",/review/rw8832055/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2023,kevin_robbins,8," This is a unique and very well done movie that needed a little more depth to be a masterpiece
","Infinity Pool (2023) is a movie that my wife and I caught in theaters this evening. The storyline follows a couple that head to an exotic upscale resort. They meet some people by the pool and decide to do a couples day trip. The trip gets out of hand and leads to them getting in trouble with the law. They have to make a deal with law enforcement to buy the husbands freedom but that sets off a series of events that changes the husbands perspectives of his wife, his life and himself.",/review/rw8832055/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2023,dmerette,1," Zero point Zeroooo
","I give this a big fat zero star. Just when I thought I had seen the worst movie, I decided to go see this one. Its just awful. How can this be? This movie has all the elements of a great movie, but it has no real story, or the story it tries to tell gets lost in drug induced crazy ville. I did enjoy the first quarter, but wanted to leave at the half mark. The wife is annoying and the other woman is just beyond terrible. I don't understand why someone thought this was a good idea? It reminded me of the stupid movies made in the 60s for some reason. I just want to warn people that have issues with crazy drug induced violence and sex scenes then this movie isn't for you. I just think half of it could be edited out.",/review/rw8832055/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2023,IncoherentRamblings,3," A confused movie that doesn't know what it wants to be
","Infinity Pool can't decide it's theme or what it wants to be. Reviewers speak to its satire and atmospheric horror, but the film struggles to deliver a visual or narrative approach befitting of either genre. It's caught between being an art house film project, a vacation horror, and a cultural mirror/satire.",/review/rw8832055/?ref_=tt_urv

",LIKES:,/review/rw8832055/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2023,birdieputt-2,3," Interesting premise, terribly executed
","The concept behind the plot is interesting, but it is so poorly executed I almost walked out. It was shot like it was a done by a film student trying to use every non-standard technique he's learned. From weird framing to odd psychedelic scenes, it's way too much. Additionally the acting was just plain bad, but having seen Alexander Skarsgard in other things, I'll blame the director for that too. And the female antagonist was just soooooo annoying that I found it hard to believe the main character would go along with anything she wanted. Had this movie been in more capable hands, it might have been OK, but as it is don't bother seeing it.",/review/rw8832055/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2023,calypsokidd,1," This film is total crap.
","Infinity Pool is one of the weirdest films that I have ever seen, and not in a good way. If you have seen The Human Centipede or Midsommar you might be prepared for the level of weirdness you'll experience. At least those films had some redeeming qualities but this one is just a mess. A poorly written story with huge plot holes and totally unbelievable to the point that 'suspension of disbelief' doesn't even begin to cover it. There's not a single likeable character to be found anywhere in the main cast and you just want the film to be over. Even when you finally get to the end it is highly unsatisfying. This may be the worst film that I have ever seen.",/review/rw8832055/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2023,brodddg,6," Infinity pool has depth, but lacks cohesion
","To quickly summarize the plot and themes, infinity pool is a peek into the lives of rich people on holiday in poor countries. They outright disrespect and abuse everything around them, from the culture and customs of the country they're in to the other tourists, and they never face consequences.",/review/rw8832055/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2023,cgearheart,4," Tries way too hard; ends up being silly
","I'm upset that I'm giving this such a low review. I just felt like it didn't really amount to anything except for shock for the sake of shock and weirdness for the sake of weirdness. The movie didn't really accomplish anything that wasn't previously accomplished by superior films in similar veins such as Speak No Evil. The visuals were admittedly cool and the overall aesthetic of the movie was well done, but what was the point? It ultimately just amounted to being a very pretentious, try hard, extreme film for commercial audiences. I felt like it tried very hard to be thought provoking when it was really just leaving out details and not really finishing anything it started with. On top of that, the ending scenes with Mia Goth freaking out were very hard to take seriously. I wasn't sure if the director meant for it to be comedic or not.",/review/rw8832055/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2023,dlmiley,5," Overrated and ultimately annoying
","I saw ""Infinity Pool"" last night in the theatre. It is a very strange movie directed by Brandon Cronenberg, the son of David Cronenberg (""Videodrome"", ""The Fly"", etc.) It is about a couple (Alexander Skarsg책rd and Cleopatra Coleman) who travel to a luxury resort in a repressive dictatorship. They meet another couple (Jalil Lespert and Mia Goth) who convince them to travel off the grounds of the resort, even though it is prohibited by the rules of the resort and country. Soon a tragedy occurs, and the couple is thrust into a fever dream of drugs, sex and violence. Mia Goth is excellent as the temptress who pushes Skarsg책rd's character into doing things he would never think of doing. Skarsg책rd is wasted in this role and his character takes actions that defy common sense. And while some have praised Brandon Cronenberg's direction - I found some of the strange angles and quirks he uses to be more annoying than ingenious. There is a surfeit of sex, violence and gore for those who enjoy that, but I cannot say that it really added anything to a convoluted plot that really makes no sense. Only recommended for Mia Goth's standout performance - wait for cable or Netflix on this one. 5/10.",/review/rw8832055/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2023,cdcrb,1," you'll have a better time with m3gan.
","7.1. Seriously. All those 10's? Listen up. Here it is only jan 23 and we have the worst movie of the year. Top to bottom, this thing stinks. Briefly, a couple on vacation in some exotic and dangerous place find themselves in trouble right off the bat. Things go down hill fast, especially with a husband as stupid as this guy. There is a great deal of so called psychedelic gobbly gook, which takes up a lot of screen time and requires zero acting. I kept wondering if this skarsgard is the same one i have liked so often. Maybe he's one of the duplicates from the film. If this is art, we are in for a very long year. I heard that this was a terrifying experience. Laughable, would be a better description, . Except there are no laughs.",/review/rw8832055/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2023,lukebohn,6," Some people will love it, others will hate it
","I walked into this movie knowing little to nothing other than Brandon Cronenberg was at the helm, and Mia Goth was staring. I heard it was artsy, and ""disturbing"" but that should've meant it was right up my alley. What I found out was that, while the film's acting + visuals + base story concept were good....it just felt a little underwhelming.",/review/rw8832055/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2023,scootm16,2," What A Snoozefest!
","How is this movie unique, unsettling or original? And why is this labeled as a horror movie? It's not scary, suspenseful or unnerving, but it is extremely boring. This is one of the most excrutuating theater experiences I've had to suffer through in a while. Multiple people in the crowd (including myself) checked their phone numerous times to see how much was left in this slog of a film. Almost nothing happens this entire movie, and when every character is unlikable, that nothingness is amplified tenfold.",/review/rw8832055/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2023,simsar-68602,1," This is the absolute worst movie ever made
","What's even the plot? What was the purpose of making this movie? So you're basically allowed to kill and do whatever you want and the only consequence is making you a double? There were so many fillers, there was an orgy scene that lasted 15 minutes for no reason whatsoever. The story doesn't lead anywhere and the ending doesn't make any sense. How is he even staying at the hotel? Who's paying for it when he doesn't even work and he left his wife apparently. Anymore can summarize the entire story in 5 minutes and the person listening to the story will still be as confused as the one who watched it. Don't watch this garbage movie. It's disgusting, annoying, boring, doesn't have a plot. 0/10 not even a 1. A waste of time.",/review/rw8832055/?ref_=tt_urv
