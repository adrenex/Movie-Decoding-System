",I streamed this soley because of the very high 7.1 rating. Too ad the ratings must be fake because this movie is horrible.,/review/rw8675764/?ref_=tt_urv

","Greetings again from the darkness. I have always assumed the familiar phrase ""green with envy"" was somehow related to green being the color most associated with money. Director Kestrin Pantera's latest film does nothing but reinforce this. The script and story come from co-writers Britt Rentschler, Michael Tennant, and Charlotte Ubben, each who also play a key character in the film.",/review/rw8675764/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2022,angelty-40507,10," Hilarious with heart!
","While this movie has a lot of heart, I laughed out loud through most of it! The characters are so unique and funny! My heart went out to Lindz and Jack because they had no idea what they were getting into when they accepted the invitation to vacation with people who are so rich they have lost touch with reality, but not with the same human problems that tie all the classes together. I rooted for Lindz and Jack and really wanted them to come together in the end (no spoilers!). Overall, this movie is so entertaining and I will definitely watch it multiple times - it's just that good! It's ""Bridesmaids"" funny!",/review/rw8675764/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2022,nsavago,10," Freshly funny
","I usually scroll my phone while I watch movies but luckily I left my phone in another room when I started this movie because so much of the humor is physical comedy - stolen glances, sudden shifts in eye contact or body language serve up the punchlines to really hit.",/review/rw8675764/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2022,meagherthomas,9," Pretty People - Dumb with an Edge
","Movie location - three/four/five years ago, this region had weird wildfires that burned wineries and took out hundreds of houses. It is great this film captures the beauty that remained and is regaining in Sonoma County California.",/review/rw8675764/?ref_=tt_urv
