7 December 2000,FlickJunkie-2,8," Unoriginal but hilarious
","Despite the fact that this film is a totally unoriginal and predictable retread of a dozen `losers to winners' sports stories, it is so hysterically funny that I didn't even care.  The story is thin at best.  The NFL is having a players strike and scabs are called in to finish the season.  Our heroes are low on ability but high on desire and peculiarity.  The quarterback, Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), once had a promising career, but he fell apart psychologically when his team was pummelled in a college bowl game and he was labelled a player that folds in the big game.  Of course, while visiting the NFL, Shane falls in love with the head cheerleader (Brooke Langton) who never dates players (except of course this once).",/review/rw5664244/?ref_=tt_urv

21 January 2001,Tynne,8," Entertainment for the fun of it
","This movie was made purely for entertainment.  What a breath of fresh air. With all the extremely dramatic, be it important, films being made lately (Life is Beautiful,etc), it's nice to watch a film that is just entertaining.  The supporting cast was amazing, as an ensemble they worked together as a team should.  And Keanu Reeves gave a wonderful performance - he is often under appreciated as an actor because he is attractive - but he gave a solid performance.  Gene Hackman was good - that goes without saying, but I think this is the first time I've ever seen him portray a character I actually liked.",/review/rw5664244/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2020,acedj,8," Do you hear footsteps Falco?
","Based on the NFL strike in the 80s, the Replacements is a movie of a bunch of people that missed their chance to play in the NFL getting to do that as replacement players or scabs. Keanu Reeves stars as quaterback Shane ""footsteps"" Falco, Gene Hackman is a master in his role of the coach Jimmy McGinty. The rest of the cast is very well done as well from Jon Favreau as the over excited defensive player to Rhys Ifans as Nigel ""the leg"" Gruff the kicker. Almost every actor seems born to play the role they have. The team, led by Falco starts off rough but soon finds their groove and become a force. It all comes down to the last regular season game and the announcement that the players and the NFL have come to a deal. Will Falco finish the season with the team he built, or will he bow out?",/review/rw5664244/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2002,Theoriginaltruebrit,," Brilliant, fuzzy, feel good movie.
","I haven't bothered watching professional football since Joe Montana retired but this movie got me interested again.  While I can appreciate the comments of other reviewers that it is a formula movie and has many inaccuracies when it comes to the football action it is pure and unadulterated fun.  The bottom line is this movie is downright funny, from start to finish.  The cast are absolutely wonderful and the casting director did a brilliant job of bringing this gang together.  Gene Hackman of course is perfect as the coach.... ""I'll pull you off the field you spoiled son of a bitch"".... Rhys Ifans absolute perfection as Gruff (after a **** you remark from Jimbo) ""You'll have to find your dick first Shamu"", to the shoot em up bros from the hood, to ""get me the ball, get me the ball""  The acting was absolutely wonderful in this movie.  I have to admit I didn't like the guy that played Martell but perhaps that's because I wasn't supposed to like him, perhaps it shows what a good job he did.  And Keanu, dear, sweet, so maligned Keanu, I read a reviewer once who said of Keanu's acting that it is ""almost transparent"" and in this movie it is, he doesn't eat scenery he just does his job, low key, perfectly in character, and for those who know anything at all about acting all you have to do is watch his eyes.  He has a Harrison Ford like quality of being able to express a wealth of emotions with his eyes and in this movie he pulls it off perfectly.  I also read somewhere that during the making of this movie it was discovered that Keanu really did have ""an arm"" and at one point threw a 69 yard pass.  I have seen this movie in excess of 20 times and will no doubt see it 20 more times, it is the best feel-good movie I have ever seen.  When I want drama and suspense I will watch ""The Green Mile"" when I want simple, comedy that just leaves me with a huge grin I will watch the replacements.  Oh yeah and I just want to kiss the person who put Keanu in a No. 16 uniform *S*",/review/rw5664244/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2000,wrygrass,10," Expected storyline, but completely unexpected hilarity
","To work, comedy has to be unexpected. And that is just what makes ""The Replacements"" work so well. Oh, not that the storyline is unexpected, for from it. But the actual comedy embedded in that plot is often delightfully quirky and quite unusual in this extremely good-natured and entertaining film. The very first scene, for example, takes place in a completely unexpected setting and proceeds in a really odd-ball way.",/review/rw5664244/?ref_=tt_urv

It's the Major League of football movies. Sure, it's not gonna win an Oscar, but it's entertaining. A good movie to kill 2 hours. You want drama in a football movie, check out Any Given Sunday.

27 July 2000,lizettemejia98,10," A must see laugh a minute movie, that make you feel good!!
","This is one of those movies that you'll pick to go see for a few reasons. Gene Hackman, Keanu Reeves (Wow), football, babes,& yada yada. I went to see a sneak preview, so it didn't really matter to me if it was going to be good, because I didn't have to pay for it. Well, I would pay to see it again!! Not only is this movie beyond funny, real funny, the story is terrific, acting wonderfully strong , the dialogue so real, and it leaves you wanting more. Gene Hackman can do anything, so him playing a coach, and choosing him for the role was right on the mark. Keanu Reeves, what can I say. He's so easy on the eyes. ALL you want to do is watch him play the role as quarterback, (as if he was one), and enjoy looking at him being ""FALCO"". The chemistry between him and Annabell is so cute & mushy. It's a movie for anyone who wants to laugh, is rooting for the under dog, likes football or not, or who just wants to go to a movie and be completely entertained!! W.B. has truly captured what it is we all go to the movie for. I can guarantee you, when you see this movie, not only will you walk out wanting to see it again, but you'll tell anyone you know, to go see it and have a BLAST!! This movie is a winner!",/review/rw5664244/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2005,ijonesiii,8," Hackman's Presence Again Raises the Bar
","In the tradition of SLAPSHOT and THE LONGEST YARD, THE REPLACEMENTS was a charming and laugh-out loud sports film about a group of scabs for an on strike, fictional pro football team brought together by a long out of work coach (Gene Hackman) and long ago disgraced quarterback (Keanu Reeves) coaxed into a comeback. There's nothing new or original here and the film is, for the most part, pretty predictable, but what makes the film special is the presence of Gene Hackman and the stylish professionalism he brings to the role of Jimmy McGinty. Hackman underplays the role so beautifully and allows the over the top performances by Jon Favreau and Orlando Jones among others, to shine in the appropriate moments without ever allowing himself to be pushed in the background. Hackman is so adept at doing this that you don't even see him doing it. The casting of Hackman as Jimmy McGinty was a stroke of genius because it brought an element of class and charm that would have otherwise have been missing and made this just another slapstick sports comedy, but Hackman's presence and charisma takes the film to a more quality level.",/review/rw5664244/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2000,jhclues,9," Keanu Scores Big Time
","When professional football players go on strike, the owners decide to continue on with the season by putting together teams made up of the best players they can find.  The owner of the Seattle franchise, O'Neil (Jack Warden), hires former coach McGinty (Gene Hackman) to take charge and field a team that can take them to the playoffs which, with four games left, is within their grasp.  `The Replacements,' directed by Howard Deutch, are guys whose careers had been cut short or sidelined for one reason or another, and now because of the strike are given a rare opportunity in the life of an athlete:  A second chance.  But it's more than just a shot at the brass ring; it's a chance to heal, to shed the stigma of loss, failure and disappointment they've all carried with them, in one way or another, since their playing days abruptly and prematurely ended.  For quarterback Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), it's being able to shake the memory of a grueling forty-five point defeat in the Sugar Bowl, which has seemingly defined him since, plaguing him even during his very brief pro career.",/review/rw5664244/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2000,Pinky-7,10," Great movie!
","I have to admit, my boyfriend had to drag me to this movie, and I went along with it, telling myself that at the very least I could spend the next couple of hours admiring Keanu's cuteness, even if he isn't the best actor. BOY was I suprised! This was a really funny, really sweet movie that made me laugh and laugh. Keanu's acting was better than I've ever seen, the supporting cast did a GREAT job. I go to a LOT of movies, and it has been a long while since I've seen a movie that i enjoyed this much, so I really encourage you to give it a try.",/review/rw5664244/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2004,Coventry,6," The ideal ""sit back and relax""-comedy
","I think it's pretty obvious you don't have to choose The Replacements if you're interested in seeing a unique and/or innovating cinema experience. The Replacements perfectly delivers what you expect...A good hour and a half of pure fun and laughs. It's a delightful little comedy with decent acting performances, hilarious situations and terrific quote material. The film uses all the typical clichés and about every character is stereotypical, but maybe that's the charm of it all. We get to see a textbook Sumo-wrestler, a blond cheerleader who can't even spell right and even the vulgar Welsh guy who smokes and curses on the field. The script is so utterly predictable and the feel-good message is shoved down your throat shamelessly, but still you can't resist to keep watching. There's a terrific light-hearted atmosphere hanging around the entire movie and sometimes, that's just all it takes to be satisfied with a movie. Keanu Reeves is a heck of lot more watchable in these type of comedies than he is as an action hero and Gene Hackman is great as usual. Even though he's clearly directing on automatic pilot, he never fails to impress. There are also good side roles by Jon Favreau, Orlando Jones, Rhys Ifans and even Art LaFleur ( it's been a while since I last saw him ).Naturally, the good guys win from the arrogant bullies, the development of the love-story was unavoidable as well and the use of typical Football-songs - like Rock 'N Roll part 2 - bring a smile to your face. The Replacements is the kind of movie that requires a few beers and popcorn...than you've got yourself a good old-fashioned brainless viewing.",/review/rw5664244/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2000,stevie7,9," Replacements ROCKS
","""The Replacements"" is more than an ""it does for football what ""Major League"" did for baseball"" kind of movie.  ""Replacements"" is funnier than that film, for one thing. It's more in the league of ""Slapshot"" with Gene Hackman providing the weight that Paul Newman brought to that film. Also, like the hockey scenes in ""Slapshot,"" the actual football sequences are really bone crunching. While there is a lot to look at in ""Replacements,"" like Keanu Reeves (who is also really good in this role, playing it for drama amid all the wackiness) getting the hell beat out of him, or like the replacement cheerleaders carted in from local strip clubs to really get the fans pumped for the game (is this what the XFL is going to be like?), this movie works as more than all that stuff.  More than the sum of it's parts, as they say. ""Replacements"" has a good heart. Bottom line, I'm going to see it again.",/review/rw5664244/?ref_=tt_urv

10 October 2021,sjw1029,6," Fun underdog sports movie
",This movie is like Little Giants for adults. It's fun watching this brand of misfits come together and win football games. Gene Hackman is channeling his Hoosiers performance. It's easy to root for these guys. Where I wish the movie was better was with the actual football scenes. There are many times where the logic and editing of the games is way off (like taking a timeout after a kickoff to stop the clock). That was a bit distracting to me but I otherwise liked it.,/review/rw5664244/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2003,grace_bunch,," Pain heals, Chicks dig scars, Glory last forever
","The Replacements works good as a Comedy and as a good drama fight for the underdog.  The humor really made me chuckle a few times.  It's not knee-slapping, but there might be some fanny-smacking clowning around. Orlando Jones contributes to a large portion of this humor.  Brooke Langton really knows how to make a guy smile, and feel good about himself, and does an excellent job as the female attraction.",/review/rw5664244/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2001,firefighter4113,9," I laughed until I cried!!!!!!!
","It is about time they put out a movie that you can watch just to feel good about something and have a good laugh. The last movie that was close to this was ""Major League"" which this was very similar to, but there were some aspects that made this better. It was the most unique roll I have ever seen Gene Hackman in and it was a very refreshing one at that. Even the music set the tone perfectly. You will love the closing, naturally I do not want to give it away but the music in the closing scene of the movie was just perfect in setting the mood and emotion. I could watch it over and over.",/review/rw5664244/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2019,jasminn_tan,8," Hilarious Team Of Replacements!
","I thought this would be another one of those serious and dramatic sports movies but I'm so glad that it isn't. I laughed out loud so much that my sibling had to ask me if I was alright. The replacements were a mixed bag of people who only had 4 games to play and they weren't funny individually but together, they were a riot. The dynamics between the team members were so varied, which made this into such a fun movie. Plus, they were united by 2 things in common: they played football and Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves) was an incredible leader. It was so fun to watch these strangers grow close to each other as they gained respect for one another, so they could win the game. And of course the underdogs won!",/review/rw5664244/?ref_=tt_urv

9 February 2011,inkblot11,9," A champion in the realm of sports films! So funny, so honest!
","Jimmy (Gene Hackman) has been offered a less than stellar job. Its the late eighties and the professional football league's players are on strike. It will be Jimmy's job, if he accepts it, to coach a crew of ""scab players"" for a team called the Washingon Sentinels. Unconventional anyway, Jimmy signs on, but, only on the promise that he will be given total control from the owner (Jack Warden). It is so. From there, Jimmy starts to assemble a team, which includes a once promising quarterback, Shane (Keanu Reeves), a Welsh kicker (Rhys Ifans), a slow-witted-but-mighty tackle (Jon Favreau) and so on. Jim evens gets a lineman who resembles a sumo wrestler. Naturally, the players are pelted with eggs when there bus arrives at the stadium and doom is predicted. Even the regular cheerleaders honor the strike, so the new leader (Brooke Langton), has to recruit her own squad, picking ladies from the local strip parlor, since no one else can dance. So, it begins. Before long, the Sentinels are doing well, surprising even John Madden and Pat Somerall, who cover the games. Also, Shane has eyes for the head cheerleader but she is a tough sell. However, the lady may protest too much. Then, too, rumors abounds about the return of the official players. How will this rough-and-tumble season go? This adorable film is a champion in the realm of sports films and BEYOND. It is very, very funny, from the cheerleader who can't spell to the footballer (Favreau) who can run folks over but has to have strategies explained numerous times. If you are looking for a demeanor elevator, this one is first rate. Its also very honest in its look at the world of football, romance, and human nature in general. Kudos to all responsible. As for the cast, this is definitely one of Reeves' best movies. He is strikingly handsome, humorous and turns up the heat in the kissing scenes. Whew. Hackman, Warden, Orlando Jones, Langton, Favreau, Ifans and ALL of the others do superior work as well. In fact, they are all too comical for words. Also fine are the costumes, sets (Reeves lives on a houseboat), script and go-for-broke direction. Turn off the daily rerun offerings and replace them with a showing of this great flick. The Replacements is a minor classic.",/review/rw5664244/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2001,jre9,10," Excellent.
","I had never heard of this movie before I saw it. Maybe something to do with the fact that Movies about American Football hardly ever reach UK cinemas. I bought an American DVD copy and think it's the most entertaining comedy I have seen in years. The usual story of the underdogs who must defeat the best team.(You can guess the rest.)The fast flowing humour as well as plenty of action makes this a must see for anyone. Not being  biased in anyway, I think rising Welsh star Rhys Ifans puts in an excellent performance as Gruff and I loved the humour about the character he plays being Welsh. It's about time the U.S adknowledged the fact that the U.K makes up 4 countries and is not just England!!! The rest of the cast is excellent too, the performance of the movie has to go to John Favreau who totally steals the show as the crazy SWAT team leader who floors anyone that's in his way. Orlando Jones makes an impressive and very funny performance. Keanu Reeves and Gene Hackman are the credited as the main stars, however the supporting cast in my opinion provided all of the laughs.",/review/rw5664244/?ref_=tt_urv
