30 October 2015,gogoschka-1,," Fantastic show for fans of the original Evil Dead trilogy and newcomers alike: the perfect mix of laughs, scares and gore
","Well, we've had to be patient for nearly a quarter of a century to finally see Ash wield his chainsaw again, but trust me: it was well worth the wait. Ash vs. Evil Dead fires on all cylinders.",/review/rw4445117/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2018,MoistMovies,10," HOW THE F HAS THIS BEEN CANCELED????????? incredible, out of 156 reviews. Only 3 1 stars and 5 under 6 stars. If this show ever get canceled ill be shocked.
","Edit22/4/18 - its pure insanity that this series got the can. someone at stars needs to be fired. what other 'great' series do they have going for them. They hardly promote ash vs evil dead outside of america. but here in australia theres a big fan base. this is not groovy. not at all.
This series should be given how ever many seasons it wants to tell the story it wants to. No rushing. No messing with what Rami has in mind. No other series, EVER. Has continued a story so well from movies bring brought to tv and retaining the same feel. This show in some ways is historic for TV and should be setting presidents for all other rebooting/continuation whatever hollywood is doing right now. IT shows that new generation still likes real entertainment along with the old wanting more of the same great stuff they grew up with. Im in the middle ground at 28. And its just.. this show puts such a big smile on my face when i watch it. Its really rare for even straight up comedies to make me grin this hard",/review/rw4445117/?ref_=tt_urv

","Fan of the Evil Dead series and you still haven't started this series yet? Then you're wasting your time reading IMDB - you'd better get Netflix if you haven't already, and start watching this hippodrome of gore and giggles, like right now.",/review/rw4445117/?ref_=tt_urv

29 November 2018,kosmasp,8," 30 years going strong
","There had been so much talk about a follow up to the Evil Dead movie series, but to be honest I didn't think they'll do a fourth movie. So much time had passed - and in a way I was right. But I'm also happy to have been sort of wrong too. Never thought they'd make a TV show out of it, but here we are. And it is really good. You do get some of the original cast throughout the course of the 3 seasons the show is running as an added bonus.",/review/rw4445117/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2018,brentstansfield,8," Cancelled!!! What a shame.
","I love this show, it's funny. the effects are great and the cast works well together. I recently have seen that they are cancelling this show after 3 seasons. I personally think this is a huge mistake. While the ratings may not be what is expected (none are now that there are 200 channels to choose from) I always watched the show following this one. Well alas, no more. For those of you that are into the Walking dead, this is a show I personally think you would enjoy. The only difference is the comedic aspect and the shorter time allotment. Such a shame to see it go. It and the show following it were the only shows I watched on the Starz network. ",/review/rw4445117/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2018,hammer-20151,10," Brilliant in every way!
","Very few times a classic like the original Evil Dead can not only be duplicated but transformed into a series. They stayed old school and only made it better. The directing, the writing and especially the acting is some of the best ever for this genre . I will debate anybody otherwise .",/review/rw4445117/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2019,tohkwongweng,9," What an absolute riot!
","Loved it loved it loved it. The original Evil Dead movie is still one of my favourite horror movies of all time! 2 and 3 combined humour with horror which was ground breaking back then. Always wanted an Evil Dead 4 and this 30 episode follow up 30 years later did not disappoint! Loved the combination of humour and bloodiness. Completely over the top with the spillage of blood and guts! Definitely my cup of tea. And Dana Delorenzo is so smoking hot as Kelly. Loved the bad girl vibe. It's just a pity that it all had to end. Come on Sam Raimi! Let's see more of what you got, all horror movie fans want more!",/review/rw4445117/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2019,pieterluxman,10," Awesome horror series, one of my favorite series
","It has been a blast watching this series.
I rarely watch series, except when they are exceptionally captivating.
This series was fun, it never really got boring, and if it did some crazy gore made it awesome again. The great thing is that the series does not take itself too serious, too many series taking themselves too seriously these days.",/review/rw4445117/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2019,PCT1970,8," Ash Is Back
","The Raimi brothers and Spezialy have created a sublime dark comedy series. It's so special to see Ash back again fighting the Evil Dead since Raimi's cult classic of the same name over nearly four decades ago. This series has excellent direction, writing, cinematography, special effects and acting. Campbell, DeLorenzo, Santiago and Lawless deliver superlative performances and compliment eachother perfectly. The plot revolves around Ash returning after a 30 year hiatus to battle the Evil Dead after he accidentally unleashes a Deadite plague. This time however Ash isn't doing battle in a cabin secluded in the middle of the woods. The battles occur in civilization. The joy ride starts there as Ash fights off Deadites and duplicit characters from every angle.
The series is clever, uproarious, zany, action packed, violent, bloody, and outlandish. It stays true to the outrageous but brilliant original film on which the series is based. It's truly a fun filled series and is at the top in it's genre.",/review/rw4445117/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2023,Supermanfan-13,8," Such a ridiculously fun show!
",I didn't know what to expect from Ash vs. Evil having never seen any of the movies. The reviews and ratings were so good and the trailer looked pretty good so I thought I'd give it a chance. I'm glad I did because I had a blast watching this. Being a big Burn Notice fan I'm a fan of Bruce Campbell but he really shined here. It's too bad the series only lasted 3 seasons but it was long enough and didn't overstay its welcome. I never watched it when it was in and just binged the entire series in like a week. If you're looking for a ridiculously fun show where you can just turn your brain off then give this a try. You won't be disappointed.,/review/rw4445117/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2023,DiCaprioFan13,8," Ended too soon
","Ash Vs. Evil Dead was such a pleasant surprise. It takes place thirty years after the movies. It follows Ash Williams as he continues to be mankind's only hope to fight evil. It stars Bruce Campbell in a career performance and a very solid supporting cast led by Ray Santiago, Dana DeLorenzo, Lucy Lawless and Arielle Carver-O'Neil. This show is not like most horror shows, it's more of a comedy. It's absolutely bananas but in a good way, it knows exactly what kind of show it wants to be and never strays. It had such a cult following when it was on and has a 8.4 rating so people seemed to really like it so the only thing I'm disappointed about is that it only lasted 3 seasons.",/review/rw4445117/?ref_=tt_urv

24 May 2018,throbert,9," How stupid you have to be to cancel this show?
","Let's see. What was the problem? 8.5 on IMDB? Lot of episodes above 9? Solid fanbase? Millions of viewers around the globe? This show was getting better and better... And Grey's Anatomy is continued for the 15th season. What is wrong with the world? How many demons GA has? Exactly zero? How many ripped off heads? Also zero? And how many chainsaws? Yep, 0. Ok, it has fake blood, but still Ash wins by miles there, too.
This show is great, it is a solid 9 and that is rare. Let's hope that a network, with white collars' IQ above 60, will buy the franchise and continue till the cows come home.",/review/rw4445117/?ref_=tt_urv

27 November 2022,Tweetienator,10," Groovy Monster Fun Machine
","Fantastic and funtastic show, somehow I missed to write a review on Ash vs Evil Dead (or it was deleted, I dunno), but well, better late than never. Ash vs Evil Dead got everything right - lots of creepy demons, a good shot of gore, and than, last but not least, a good shot of humor too - and of course Bruce Campbell, the great Ashley 'Ash' J. Williams. The ""sidekicks"" too are remarkable and deliver a fine work - Dana Delorenzo, Lucy Lawless, Ray Santiago are just gorgeous, the rest of the cast does well. One cannot deny - the whole cast did have a great time making this show. Anyway, it is really a shame that this show was cancelled after three brilliant seasons, but there is hope, as the last episosw leaves room for new things to come. Epic. Best of the best regarding horror shows. Ever.",/review/rw4445117/?ref_=tt_urv

1 May 2018,backslapjones,10," A Creative Horror Comedy Show
","First off, this show was cancelled too soon after one of its best seasons, and that will forever piss me off. Second, this is a great continuation of the Evil Dead franchise. It explores the Book of the Dead and all the different demons it can summon, and has some really badass gore scenes. Some are gross, most are hilarious, and all of them have this twisted creativity that make this show stand out. After following this show from the beginning, I'm really sad to see it go. But even though Bruce Campbell is retiring the role, I know the deadite-slaying Ash Williams will live on eternally.",/review/rw4445117/?ref_=tt_urv

","Really, what more could you ask for? This gory merry go round is the perfect action/horror/comedy series I could have hoped for going in.

This series will live on and come back to life again someday, and I sure hope it comes back with this same ghost beaters team members.",/review/rw4445117/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2022,pughspencer,9," Bigger, bloodier, and groovier
","This show takes everything that was great about those first three Evil Dead movies and cranks it up to 11. Bruce Campbell returns to his iconic role as the chainsaw welding Boomstick blowing Ash Williams. Despite now being middle-aged he's still the same old smooth talking one liner spitting chin wonder we know and love him as. It's like if Harrison Ford played Han Solo again but instead of him being more wiser like he was in Force awakens he's still like he was in Empire Strikes Back. The show honestly develops Ash more as a character than any of the movies did. By season 2 we got to see his hometown, meet his dad, and even discovered he had a daughter that he himself didn't even know about. Not to mention watching him pull off a lot more action scenes with his chainsaw and boomstick. Along for the ride are two new additions, Pablo and Kelly. It made sense to give Ash supporting characters cuz it wouldve been weird if the whole show was just him talking to himself. Both are played excellent by Ray Santiago & Dana DeLorenzo who much like Ash go through their own tragedy and come out as badass deadite slayers. Or as pablo calls them ghost beaters.",/review/rw4445117/?ref_=tt_urv
