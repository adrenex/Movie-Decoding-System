27 May 2014,planktonrules,6," Turn your brain off and enjoy...
","At this time, there are already 530 reviews for ""Now You See It"", so I'll try to be brief. The film is about a group of four magicians and mentalists who have been given a brilliant plan by an unseen genius. Again and again, the quartet perform seemingly impossible stunts and always seem many steps ahead of the police. And, in the process, they do HUGE magic tricks that are pretty much impossible. The presentation is VERY smooth and very slick and the overall production looks great. It has great music and effects. But, on the negative side none of this really makes a lot of sense and there is no way you can enjoy it if you think. This is especially true at the end (where there is a profession of love that comes from absolutely no where!!)--which is a gigantic cliché and made no sense whatsoever. The bottom line is that if you turn off you brain and enjoy it on a very superficial level, you'll enjoy it. If you try to make sense of it all, your head will explode. 'Nuff said.",/review/rw6863446/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2013,Robert_duder,4," Now you see me...but I wish I hadn't
","I remember seeing the trailers for this and I thought it really looked great. Reading some of the reviews on here, many of them ""claim"" that people with a low IQ dislike the film. Well, I don't mean to toot my own horn but I don't think I'm a stupid individual and I've seen thousands of movies...more than your average joe because I love movies. However, this was a stone cold dud. Decent cast, some real twists and turns but a blatantly complicated plot line that makes little sense and tries way too hard just to be complex. A truly smart film can be smart and tricky without trying SO hard. Now You See Me just throws in all kinds of tricks and twists without any build up or thinking about whether or not it makes sense. It was a very interesting experience when the big final twist of the movie was revealed and everyone in the theatre I was in gasped and then that was immediately followed by many people whispering ""That's dumb,"" ""That doesn't make sense."" They are exactly right. The big twist has no groundwork laid for it and makes no sense at all but by that time you are so completely lost in the silly story that you won't care that it doesn't make sense.",/review/rw6863446/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2013,HelenMary,6," trying desperately hard to be more intelligent than it is
","Overall a showman of a film. Flashy, loud with bells and whistles and big personalities, an exciting premise... illusionists rob banks using (supposed) magic but the four horsemen are just puppets in a game, but the hype is more than the substance of the film itself.",/review/rw6863446/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2013,SnoopyStyle,4," Now We Fool You
","Four magicians answer a mysterious call to work for an obscure secret society. A year later, they call themselves the Four Horseman, and create havoc with their magic. Their first trick to rob a bank, drawing the FBI and Interpol into a cat and mouse game. J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson), Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher), and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) are the four magicians. Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) is the FBI agent.",/review/rw6863446/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2013,Wizard-8,," Promising idea sunk in key areas
","""Now You See Me"" came out of nowhere and became the sleeper hit of 2013, getting good word of mouth during its theatrical run. Having seen the movie for myself, I am kind of puzzled by its popularity. Certainly, the movie is far from the worst movies I have ever seen - it's colorful, and doesn't have a dead spot despite running almost two hours long. ",/review/rw6863446/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2013,pinkled5,6," Watchable but lacks depth & substance
","This is one of those movies that is somewhat entertaining upon first viewing but is easily forgettable and has nothing of substance to make a second viewing possible to enjoy. The plot is convoluted as we don't know what the main characters are doing or why. In fact, everything we know about the 4 magicians is revealed in the first 10 minutes of the movie and after that there is ZERO character development! The entire movie appears to have been made solely for the sake of the ending and yet it was so cliché that I was actually a little angry about the way they did it. It's unfortunate that in the filmmaker's attempts to be clever they neglected the most fundamental elements of storytelling: plot and character.",/review/rw6863446/?ref_=tt_urv

31 May 2013,griffolyon12,8," Like a Vegas Show, Entertaining but Lacking of Much Else
","Imagine Now You See Me as Ocean's Eleven meets The Prestige and you sort of get what director Louis Leterrier was going for with this film. Is Now You See Me as successful as the aforementioned films? Not necessarily, but it's a fun movie that deconstructs the acts of modern magicians.",/review/rw6863446/?ref_=tt_urv

24 August 2013,svenhaadem,3," The greatest trick ever pulled is to make anyone believe this film has a coherent story.
",I believe the target audience (and maybe even the writer) are all 14 year old boys who think magicians can do anything they want. I love a good sci-fi setting and I can accept some really fringe premises if the movie exploit them in a good way. This movie just relies on the audience swallowing everything and never questioning anything. If you start to pull any of the many loose ends it all falls apart faster than you can say bullshit.,/review/rw6863446/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2013,vicarious_tool,5," All bark no bite.
","If you like strong and logical plots, you are likely to dislike this one. It's all about appearances and show in this one, rather than actually being brilliant, the characters and story just ask you take their brilliance for granted. ",/review/rw6863446/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2013,markvanderpool,2," I went in hopeful and left feeling insulted.
","""Now You See Me"" has a stellar cast, a fun and intriguing premise and themes (showdown of rival magicians combined with a heist), delightful smart-assery and cunning tactics -- especially in those scenes dominated by Jesse Eisenberg or Woody Harrelson. Oh, and it has quite dazzling action sequences. All the best parts of this film are well-packaged and sold in the gripping theatrical trailer.",/review/rw6863446/?ref_=tt_urv

16 August 2013,andyreynolds-1,2," Disappointing
","In all fairness, I had been warned. A movie review show said this was less than impressive and the write-ups in print were ""luke-warm"" but when the missus said lets go watch a movie, I wanted to give it a try because the cast was impressive and come on, who doesn't like magic tricks???? Let's begin with the positives. It runs for 115 minutes which compared to The Long Ranger and anything Peter Jackson hands in is almost preview length so that was good. Unless the result of decent editing is a lack of character depth then perhaps it wasn't.... but we'll get to that shortly.",/review/rw6863446/?ref_=tt_urv

3 June 2013,rannynm,10," Unique, Keeps You on the Edge of Your Seat with All its Twists and Turns
","I absolutely love this film. ""Now You See Me"" is like nothing I've ever seen before. ""Now You See Me"" tells the story of a group of magicians called The Four Horsemen who use their skills to pull off some of the greatest international robberies of their generation. Featuring Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt McKenny (Woody Harrelson), Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher) and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco), the Four Horsemen make a dream team of street magicians. Since they have made their stunts public, allowing the world to ""witness"" the robberies, authorities are in hot pursuit of the four, now wanted criminals. Detective Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) is accompanied in his search for the illusive magicians by Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) and French detective Alma Dray (Melanie Laurent). Will the Four Horsemen be able to pull of their final act without being caught, or will it be curtains for the criminal performers?",/review/rw6863446/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2013,Michael-96,5," Incredibly contrived, lazy script wastes the acting talent
","Now You See Me starts off promisingly, but sadly spirals downhill very quickly. Nonsensical ""magic trick"" after nonsensical ""magic trick"" goes completely unexplained, and save for one minor trick near the start of the movie, the explanations behind those few for which explanations are attempted become more and more nonsensical. Few films ask you to suspend disbelief to this degree, and the rare few which do are universally terrible.",/review/rw6863446/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2016,Leofwine_draca,4," Great, if you like ridiculous films
","Hollywood seems obsessed by making films about magicians where the magicians turn out to have real magical powers. I've seen a certain mainstream film in the past that did the same thing and I hated it for cheating the viewer. NOW YOU SEE ME isn't as blatant as that, but it still has one ridiculous scene after another which would have been physically impossible in real life, thus making this a delusional fantasy of a film. Having all the magic done in-camera without cutting away would have done much to remedy this situation.",/review/rw6863446/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2018,nogodnomasters,10," The closer you look the less you see
","The film opens with four quick character introductions of ""street"" magicians. Daniel (Jesse Eisenberg) uses street magic to meet pretty women. His former assistant Henley (Isla ""Legs"" Fisher) does a stage act. McKinney (Woody Harrelson) is a hypnotist who uses his ability to shake down people. Jack (Dave Franco) uses his slight of hand to pick pocket people.",/review/rw6863446/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2013,bob the moo,," Slick all-star nonsense is still nonsense
","Now You See Me starts out really well. A group of illusionists are brought together and within a year they are playing Vegas together and appear to rob a bank in Paris remotely. This draws in the FBI and Interpol but how can they prove anything when it all seems so impossible and so hard to prove? This setup offers a twisty and engaging plot but sadly it is one that never gets delivered upon. Instead what we get is a constantly moving film that is loaded with stars, money and special effects but nothing of nay real substance.",/review/rw6863446/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2013,jim-littlewood,1," Shazam!!
",This film is about four magicians brought together to perform the ultimate trick...to rob a bank (or so they would have you believe). I think that's as far as anyone really got with the plot apart from a few obvious twists along the way. Each of the four magicians is drafted in for their individual talents however these aren't really highlighted or explored during the film in any detail. In fact there is no character development at all which is more disappointing given the fact that the cast includes Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman among others. ,/review/rw6863446/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2016,Mr-Fusion,4," Shockingly disappointing
","""Now You See Me"" has such a great hook - an illusionist ""Ocean's Eleven"" - but it also has serious problems. One of them is that for such a sterling cast, there's very little in the way of likable characters. One, actually, and he takes the fall in the end. But it's hard to see good actors playing awful characters (Woody Harrelson's the one who escapes largely unscathed because he's Woody Harrelson) and it speaks to the flimsy writing. This movie plays fast and loose with internal consistency, straining credibility way beyond acceptable limits. I could even stomach the completely artificial ending if the rest of the movie was grounded in some kind of reality. But all of the tricks and sleights of hand are just flashy effects - these people are more superheroes than magicians.",/review/rw6863446/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2016,Horst_In_Translation,6," Only good if you see it as a fantasy film
","""Now You See Me"" is a French/American co-production from 3 years ago and probably so far the most known work by French director Louis Leterrier. He sure got a whole bunch of big names lined up for this project, including Oscar winners and Oscar nominees. The outcome is not a failure, but still disappointing. Films about magic are not too frequent these days, even if there is Brody's ""Houdini"" and Christopher Nolan's ""The Prestige"" of course. And you could call this film here a poor man's ""The Prestige"". Not only does the cast have Micael Caine in common, but it also tries to be controversial and mind-blowing from start to finish, but almost never succeeds. One main reason for this may be Jesse Eisenberg, who is probably the lead actor or at least the one who fits the description the most. In 90% of his films he plays a super-smart, smug young adult and his shtick has really gotten repetitive by now. I wish he would take other paths again like in ""Zombieland"" for example. By the way, it's a ""Zombieland"" reunion with Harrelson, who is fun as usual in here. Unfortunately the other 2 members of the gang are very forgettable too. Isla Fisher only stands out because she is the only woman from the quartet and Dave Franco, brother to James, proves that he is not even close to his famous sibling in terms of talent. Then again, the way the character is written was pretty disastrous too. He is totally irrelevant for pretty much the entire film and when we are supposed to be shocked he is alive, I honestly couldn't care less.",/review/rw6863446/?ref_=tt_urv
