11 August 2014,gogoschka-1,9," The old west brought back to life
","If you want to experience the – real – old west first hand, look no further; you'll find it in 'Deadwood'. There has never been a show or a film that came as close to showing what life must have been like in those lawless young towns that got built nearly over night wherever gold was found. A magnet for all kind of fortune seekers (gold diggers, whores, outlaws – but also settlers who were just hoping to build a better life), the town of Deadwood was notorious even by the standards of the time. In the show, this ""cesspool of vice"" is brought back to life with great attention to historical detail. You'll find no romanticised view of pioneers who lived and died by ""the code of honour"", but real people whose moral standards are – in most cases – murky at best. And the world they inhabit is a rough, dirty, violent place where only the fiercest – and the most cunning – survive. ",/review/rw1158235/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2020,Supermanfan-13,9," Truly is a special show!
","Deadwood truly is a special show! It is more than just a great western show, it's just a flat out great show in general! Everything about it is top notch. It's so good they even had to come back and make a movie over 15 years after it aired! Deadwood is on just about every ""best show ever"" list that you can find for a reason...because it is!",/review/rw1158235/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2020,numenorsniper-66396,10," A perfect series
","Perfect is a word that should pretty much never be used. Yet, this series Deadwood is indeed perfect (in my opinion of course).",/review/rw1158235/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," One of the most underrated shows!
","When you look up most underrated shows of all-time I guarantee you that you'll find Deadwood near the top of every list you find. This is truly a special show! Deadwood takes place in a fictional mining town in the U. S. post Civil War years. It's a lawless town that attracts people that like it doesn't have organized law and people looking to strike it rich after a huge gold strike. It is more than just a great western show, it's just a flat out great show in general! Everything about it is top notch. It's so good they even had to come back and make a movie over 15 years after it aired! Deadwood is not only on every most ""underrated show ever"" list that you'll find but you'll also find it on just about every ""best show ever"" list too. If you're a fan of westerns and looking for a great show to binge then give this a try.",/review/rw1158235/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2006,garynorton,10," A Hell of a place to make your fortune...
","This stands out for me as one of the best series I have ever seen hit the small screen. The attention to detail,story and character is second to none. Deadwood is brought to life by the good, the bad and the very ugly- with some of the most wonderfully theatrically profane, but ultra-realistic dialogue of any western. True, you could question some of the dialogue for exactly how accurate it is to the time it is set- but it sounds absolutely convincing in the world they have managed to build. Lets face it- not too many Westerns even bothered all that much in the first place! The 3 series have impeccable standards of production, weaving some of the real historical events of the time into a fictional Old West testament. The degradation, ill manners, costumes, dirt, mud and profanities are all present and accounted for.",/review/rw1158235/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2007,nick-1896,10," TV doesn't get any better than this
","Absolutely superb. I don't think I've ever given anything a 10/10 before, but for a TV show, Deadwood is excellent - and given the crap we're generally subjected to on the box, absolutely outstanding. The sets, the research, the directing, the characters, the acting - all shine. And without wanting to sound gushy, the script is close to Shakespearian in its prosaic yet pragmatic tone. The juxtaposition of the grit and dirt and blood of the real 'Wild West' with formal Victorian language is genius. Even the opening credits are beautiful. It may not be everyone's cup of tea (the language and content can be a little 'strong' although entirely appropriate and in context) but anyone who's a fan of quality entertainment, shouldn't go past it.",/review/rw1158235/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2022,latinfineart,10," As good as it gets
","I have always described this show as Shakespeare in Tombstone. The writing is absolutely brilliant. There are more quotable lines, than in any other show in the past 20 years. And this is likely the best western TV series, ever. The cast is awe inspiring, the direction is outstanding, the characters are well drawn, and the show is standing up to the test to time, as I have recently started re-watching the entire series. Amazing work.",/review/rw1158235/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2006,classicsoncall,10," ""A hell of a place to make your fortune""
","First off, the Western is my favorite film genre, however ""Deadwood"" transcends that genre so completely that it seems like a new one altogether. If you can, try to get your hands on the Season I DVD set with the special features disc. I was surprised to learn that many of the main and supporting characters beyond Wild Bill and Calamity were in fact also based on real life people. Al Swearengen ran an operation that took in between four and six thousand dollars a night, while other notables with a true history include Doc Cochran and the Reverend Henry Smith. Though the story playing out in the series is often a product of creator David Milch's 'imaginative reality', that in no way lessens it's impact as a narrative of the Dakotas and it's overly rich history of villainy, debauchery and profanity.",/review/rw1158235/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2019,mattoid-45605,10," Television's finest hour
","Hands down the best show ever written! Sopranos, Breaking Bad, The Wire are fantastic, well written shows as well but Deadwood beats them all hands down. The Deadwood movie premieres tomorrow night. I'm sure it won't disappoint.",/review/rw1158235/?ref_=tt_urv

19 February 2022,stevebondi,9," Realistic, gritty, high-production western! :-)
","All the characters are awesome with great western dialog and sleaziness! :-) Timothy Olyphant perfected the old-town sheriff standard in this millenium, and Ian McShane perfected the old-town villain with multiple dimensions!",/review/rw1158235/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2022,travola-35109,10," Unappreciated
","One of the best shows ever made and arguably the best western ever made. Top notch acting with perfect casting even the simplest storylines and conversations are captivating in this show. It's incredibly witty and even hilarious at times especially characters E. B., Dan, and Richardson who have some genuinely laugh out loud moments. The realism of everyday life in the old west is interesting to watch as well and they used modern cursing and language to bring it to life for the modern crowd. I'm glad they ruled out using old time language and insults because that would have taken away from fierceness and comedy the show brings in certain moments.",/review/rw1158235/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2022,wavecat13,9," The westward expansion, as rough and gritty as it gets
","The story meanders some, but I have that complaint about a lot of those long series. It is a gritty look at the ""Wild West"", which is here presented as a very rough place where civilized society had to struggle to get a toehold.",/review/rw1158235/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2004,smokehill retrievers,," Rough, gritty, realistic portrayal of Western history
","Judging by other comments, the realistic portrayal of the crude language and immorality may be a bit too much for those used to tame, glossy horse operas where the Good are very, very good and the Bad are very, very bad.",/review/rw1158235/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2014,kosmasp,9," Even when you get so little, you'll be yearning for more
","Three seasons do not seem to be a short term for a TV show. Look at other shows like Firefly who didn't even get that much time on air. But as with some of the other shows, after this is over, you'll be wanting more. And it is obvious that there was more planned, but it is very doubtful if this ever sees the light of day (maybe in a comic book/graphic novel incarnation).",/review/rw1158235/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2018,dafoat,10," My All Time Favorite
","Deadwood is my favorite television drama of all time. I can't think of another show with such depth, complexity and humanity. Throughout its original run I was consistently surprised and impressed. I return to the series every few years, and my fondness for it just grows. Every performance on this show is a revelation. It has the most consistently talented ensemble cast I've ever seen. My only regret is that it was cancelled before it came to a proper resolution.",/review/rw1158235/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2004,killgore86,10," They finally got the western right!
","Don't get me wrong, there have been great westerns to come before Deadwood, but none of them really got it right. There is just a reality that some people aren't willing to deal that after 50 years of our history being whitewashed through film and TV, we're finally starting to see the truth. David Milch has done his research and discovered the wonderfully bizarre contradiction of languages used in the old west. Watching the cast of Deadwood converse with a combination of old world English laced with profanity straight from the gutter is incredible and feels right for the first time. Where do people think our language came from? People always want to think that they were the first to do something, when things like profanity, substance abuse and prostitution have been around since before man walked erect.",/review/rw1158235/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2004,AnneOBrienRice,," Very simply magnificent
","Ian McShane as the evil Al has established himself as one of the greatest actors of the moment and of the time. He's up there with Pacino, DeNiro and Keitel. The magnificent writing and directing of Deadwood support him completely in mesmerizing the audience. This is for my money the finest work being done on television today. The show has a sure moral compass and a daring to take the violence to the level of Shakespeare or the Greek Tragedy while maintaining verisimilitude with brilliant dialogue and perfect art and set direction, as well as a flawless supporting cast each of whom engages us immediately and convincingly no matter how intimate or distant the focus might be. I can't get enough of this show. I want to see it all in reruns, to cherish it later on DVD. Each episode is fresh and surprising and at times astonishing. But Ian McShane steals the show, no question of it. His face is profoundly expressive and his lines are so marvelous that some of them surely must be ad lib. The guy's a scoundrel but my heart's breaking for him. The Season Finale was the single greatest television drama I've ever seen. We have here a villain who isn't morally bankrupt. And thank heaven, we have a show runner and a writer who isn't morally bankrupt either. Bravo!! I've run out of superlatives. Please, more. And more. And more.",/review/rw1158235/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2020,UniqueParticle,9," Better than I expected
","So damn good especially to me who's barely a western fan Deadwood is exquisite! The type of show that gets better as it goes on, I admit it I had to give Deadwood a few chances. Awesome cast, sound design, cinematography throughout and well written! Deserves the praise it got, murky and immersive which is a glorious benefit to me.",/review/rw1158235/?ref_=tt_urv

26 March 2022,njfilmsyndicate,10," Hands down my favorite show of all time
","This in my opinion is the greatest show ever created. I know that's a bold statement but when you combine the linguistic poetry of David Milch with acting greats like Ian McShane, Powers Boothe, Gerald McRaney, Brian Cox and others the result is magic. I enjoyed the 2019 movie that wrapped the show up but nothing would been better than spending another full season or two in the Deadwood camp. If you enjoy compelling stories and great acting Deadwood is the show you need to check out.",/review/rw1158235/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2022,florinradulescu-37298,8," Great but incomplete
","A gritty western with mostly fantastic characters, story and acting. It feels very authentic to the period it's set in and it has a sort of raw nature at its core that you cannot move away from. Every episode leaves you wanting for more of the schemes, grime and roughness of the whole thing. There aren't really any other shows that can offer you the same quality of production, with this setting and period, bolstered by such compelling writing.",/review/rw1158235/?ref_=tt_urv
