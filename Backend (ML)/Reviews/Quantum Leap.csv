5 September 2022,Supermanfan-13,8," Pretty good sci-fi series!
","The 100 was so much better than I expected it to be. Besides the ending, I thought it was a great sci-fi series that i would recommend to any fan of sci-fi. The 100 starts off on a spaceship in the future after the world is destroyed by a nuclear Armageddon. Their are 4,000 passengers in the ship but the resources are dwindling and can't support them anymore. Looking for a solution they send 100 juvenile prisoners back to earth to see if it's livable. Having only lived in space they are unprepared for what is it come, including other human survivors. This show is far from perfect but it is definitely entertaining and worth watching. I enjoyed every season up until the last. It's hard to end a good show and most fail at it and this one is no different. I still would recommend watching it if you're a sci-fi fan though.",/review/rw6103742/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Will keep you entertained!
","I thought The 100 was a show that was only going to be directed only towards teens but I couldn't have been more wrong. I ended up liking it a lot more than I originally thought I would, except for the last season (which isn't very good at all, especially the last episode). They completely destroyed Bellamy's character in the last season which I just don't get it at all. Everything these characters are doing the last season goes completely against what we learned about them for the first six seasons. Eliza Taylor (Clarke) & Bob Morley (Bellamy) have shown themselves to be up and coming stars. The two of them were both great throughout the series and led an all around good cast!",/review/rw6103742/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2020,nicolasmaczk,4," I had to stop watching mid season 5
","I had to stop watching mid season 5, because everything became laughable. The plot is always the same but slightly switched. Each character switches from hero to mass murderer every 3 episodes, each one of them goes through a god complex to feeling like crap the next episode, they're all the same character. The show goes from interesting, to okay, to slightly laughable, to bad, then so bad it's funny to unbearable. Every single one of the character takes the worst decision that kills everybody, and it never stops, and they always give that line : ""there are no good guys"", I mean, they're all the dumbest people on earth, literally. It ended up as a mish mash of the dumbest ideas, I can't believe I thought I'd watch it all, I'm angry I had to stop. S5 started well, I even thought S3 and S4 were slight misses that can happen, I had great hopes after the 3 first episodes of S5 because they were decent... what a disappointment. I have no idea how the writers lost track that much, every story feels like coming from another tv show, there's no glue",/review/rw6103742/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2020,Splarke22,5," Season 7 ruined the entire show
","Seasons 1-4 were phenomenal. Seasons 5-6 weren't as good, but still really solid seasons with some fantastic episodes. Season 7 started out great with its first two episodes & a few other gems, but for the most part was downright horrendous. The 100's final season ruined the entire show arguably more than Game of Thrones' 8th season did for itself. It's as though everything that made The 100 what it was for the first 6 seasons got thrown out of the window in favor of spiteful, terrible writing. What was once my favorite show has no rewatchability after Season 7.",/review/rw6103742/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2022,Tweetienator,4," Went Downhill Fast
","The 100 (like The Walking Dead) is a fine example the way too many shows take - the show starts entertaining and because it got some success the producers add one season after another and everything just goes downhill. The 100 was never a very logical show (the plot holes are much bigger than the solar system) but at least the first season was interesting. Than more and more the ""universe"" of The 100 fell apart while the writers tried to figure out how to prolong the story infinite. For teens only.",/review/rw6103742/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2021,frankblack-79961,4," The dumbest characters ever. Not for intelligent viewers.
","Hard to get into a show where everyone is so treacherous all the time. Add complete and utter stupidity from Clark and most of the 100. Super bad decisions that get made over and over again by everyone. By the end of season 3 this show is becoming near unwatchable. Usually i stay the course with shows I begin, but this one will be ending for me if it gets much worse.",/review/rw6103742/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2021,Johnny_West,1," 100 Jerks
","The 100 biggest jerks in the universe get sent on some pods to repopulate the planet Earth. Talk about pollution. It was like the Kardashians and Jenner trash spent 97 years in space creating the worst of humanity, and then dropped it back down to Earth.",/review/rw6103742/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2020,sahildhull-97561,3," Awesome story with pathetic writing
","Perfect example of a show with amazing concept but very pathetic screenwriting. The story is so so so good. I mean it is outstanding. But screenwriting meh... Were the writers drunk during writing tue script. The characters written are so shallow. And Clarke.. She is the most irritating person in the group. She just degraded the show. Who the hell she thinks she is. From season 1, she acted like she is the boss of the 100. She is taking decisions. Only character worth applause is Raven. In every season it is only her who saved people in the end. And people are killing each other for no reason. The decisions taken by the leaders are so pointless. Seriously, this show would have done wonders if the character writing and the scripts were better. The story is so so so so good. Such a fresh and different concept. But writing. Oh my god. Save us. If you have already started watching the show, then you cant resist yourselves from watching because of the story. But the writing is very very very very bad.. Yuck. I mean there is no such thing as sepsis. People are pumping the pateints heart that too without any aseptic precautions. That was the funniest part of the show. No blood group matching before giving the blood. Wow. Hahahaha..",/review/rw6103742/?ref_=tt_urv

15 September 2022,mrspecttra,8," Very very good, but very very flawed
","This is one of the best shows I have ever watched. I watched it twice actually. It is very fast paced, the scene changes every season, new plots, new characters, BUT it is also very flawed. Looking back at it the second time, I am actually having a hard time remembering why I loved it so much. I still like it, it is still one of the best shows out there, but still it has SO MANY flaws:",/review/rw6103742/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2021,lboogy9,7," Season 7 ruined it for me...would be a 9 otherwise...other seasons were good.
","From 1-4 it was a great show, 5-6 a little different but still in the line of the show. What the heck happened to season 7 ? Did they change the writers ?",/review/rw6103742/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2016,ahmetkozan,8," A good science fiction television series...

31 October 2020,koga-judo,3," Poor and predictable
","Poor content, poor backdrops, scenes without a meaning, predictable outcomes and a plot that is a recycled loop. If it's gonna be one of the first series you will ever see it might look good. Otherwise naaaaah!",/review/rw6103742/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2019,Halopalo,3," Season 2 was it's peak. Now it just feels meaningless and repetitive because of the bad writing

25 March 2015,Reviewer746,1," this show is why IMDb needs an option for negative ratings
","This show is unimaginably stupid. The only thing that amazes me more than the fact that it was renewed for a second season is the fact that some people actually consider this science fiction. With their laughable portrayal of conditional gravity in orbit and magic radiation on the surface of the planet, the writers appear to harbor not only ignorance but an active disdain for basic science. The list of plot holes in this show is unending. The writers seem to delight in throwing them out there just to see if the audience is even paying enough attention to catch them or is too distracted by Paige Turco's holographic eye mascara.",/review/rw6103742/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2021,brettgozza,5," Good and silly
","Clarke Griffen will go down as one of the worst characters in tv history. Schizophrenic at best, her continual jumping back and forth makes her , in my opinion, the most selfish character to grace a tv screen. She'd do anything for ""her people"" until it didn't suit her.
The show could have been much better without the ""Clarke the saviour/villain"" aspect. By the end, all I wanted was for her to disappear.",/review/rw6103742/?ref_=tt_urv

22 May 2014,isabelle-frater,," It's not that bad
","The reason why I'm writing this review is because I see so many negative ones. True, the first few episodes were odd, and had their problems, but the following episodes cleared things up a lot, and also developed the whole thing. This show didn't start out too well. Some concepts were odd. Like the technological inconsistencies. However, as you learn more about the Ark, it becomes obvious that the resource situation is hard. Make-up. Well, most shows suffer from everyone having make-up, when they shouldn't. It's a TV thing. What is important is the story. What I like about it is how the teens on Earth are still teens. They have their love life and general angst, but they are also trying to be adults. Sometimes it's almost ""Lord of the Flies"", but then the characters stiffen their spine and make the hard choices. In a way, it's like a study of society and people. Though times sometimes bring out the worst or the best in people. With all the hormones coursing through their young bodies, it's even worse. One thing is for sure with this show. It's not boring.",/review/rw6103742/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2020,robinmosley-47812,9," Give it a chance
","This series is not flawless. It hasn't oscar-winnig performances, but solid actors who are not bad at all. Sometimes it's a little melodramatic, but hey, they're still teenagers.
This series has good and likeable characters, a cool and unique style and really, i mean really good moments you shouldn't miss. I totally enjoy watching it. I would recommend it. Binge-worthy.",/review/rw6103742/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2017,thursdaysrecords,4," Initially intriguing, soon drops to generic teenage angst marathon
","The pilot episode of this post-apocalyptic sci-fi series promises a fresh and interesting story, but soon loses the initial luster. In a mixture of Logan's Run and Lord of the Flies, we end up with an unsophisticated version of Peter Pan. A floating space-city of only a few hundred human survivors of an Earthly atomic apocalypse depends on resources from Planet Earth in order to avoid extinction. A group of 100 juvenile delinquents are sent on a mission to Earth to explore whether 100 years after radioactive fallout the planet is fit again to sustain human life. The adults on the floating space colony meanwhile are trying to monitor the progress via electronic bracelets attached to each of the 100 human guinea pigs, and engage in various political infighting and back stabbing for leadership positions. The teens are also forming groups and have their own problems with who should be in charge. Lots of gratuitous action scenes and climactic moments where team work is required to come to the aid of peers in peril. - The story wears thin, and seems more like a never ending after-school special. The target audience is clearly high school level. The dialog is without much wit and requires minimal thought of the audience. It's a poor imitation of Star Trek, Lost in Space and similar been there/done that shows. Great pilot. Good first few episodes...after that forgettable.",/review/rw6103742/?ref_=tt_urv

27 March 2014,bartning,10," Along the Lines of Earth 2, Deserves a Chance
","The first two episodes have piqued my interest so far and are good sci-fi. It's a best series out there right now, and it's the only current one I've watched lately. I just hope it doesn't have too many moral twists in it, but going back to watch ones that do is the norm too.",/review/rw6103742/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2020,Abdulxoxo,7," My humble opinion about this show
","S7 is a trainwreck, it totally lacked a good direction. the storylines are disjointed and confusing, some main characters were killed off with little to no reason. tho I got to admit, the finale is not bad, it managed to wrap things up nicely tho it needs some more explanation but it's good considering the prenultimate and the other last few episodes were bad.",/review/rw6103742/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2020,ryanmkincaid,5," Clark needs to die
","Not sure I've ever watched a show where the lead character needs to die at the end of the series in order to be satisfied. Every story needs to have a moral compass, but these last 3 years have seen characters be absolved too easily for acts that are too large to come back from. It takes away from the drama of true redemption and ultimately the viewer will start to turn on the lead. Clark has committed so many of these acts and betrayed so many of her allegiances that you start to hate her by season 5. Season 7 you'll down right root for her demise. I've come to the conclusion that the only satisfactory ending is if she's killed off.",/review/rw6103742/?ref_=tt_urv
