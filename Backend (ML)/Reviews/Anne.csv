15 February 2020,classicsoncall,8," ""We're gonna build a race car.""
","You don't have to be a race car enthusiast to enjoy this film. I'm certainly not, having neither the desire or the patience to watch daring motor cars race around a track at mind boggling speeds. Though you do have to credit the drivers who enjoy the profession; it takes a certain amount of bravura and stamina to withstand the pace and stress forces that go with the territory. Without knowing the story in advance, I thought it was going to pit Matt Damon against Christian Bale as opposing drivers, but that idea was quickly put to rest. The legendary Carroll Shelby (Damon) is in the spotlight here as the former racer and design engineer recruited by the Ford Motor Company to build a championship vehicle. In no small measure was it Ford's response to a snub by Italian car maker, Enzo Ferrari, who turned down a merger with the American company in a fit of pique. Had he gone along, the end result in the picture may never have occurred.",/review/rw5390603/?ref_=tt_urv

","Biopics can be a hard sell at times. Whether you're diving into the troubled life of an addict or exploring someone's sexuality, there are many touchy subjects these days. With that said, I feel there are also those that will stand the test of time, in terms of being able to please a wide audience. Ford v Ferrari is one of the latest true stories out of Hollywood that will be hitting the big screen soon, and here's why I believe it absolutely deserves attention.",/review/rw5390603/?ref_=tt_urv

","A lot of notes were hit by Ford v Ferrari. The characters are fleshed out very well and give you the emotional attachment you're looking for in a movie. Bale and Damon's performances are great; they pull you into the story and completely disappear into their roles. James Mangold proves, once again, to be a master behind the camera.

","""Ford v Ferrari"" is an engaging action film based on a true story, when the American manufacturer Ford decided to build the racing car Ford GT40 to defeat the Italian Ferrari at the ""24 Hours of Le Mans"" in 1966. The plot is dramatic, funny, highly entertaining and not historically accurate (in accordance with those that are fans of car racing), with Matt Damon and the magnificent Christian Bale in the lead roles.

'Le Mans 66' was a very eagerly anticipated film, due to liking the lead actors and loving 'Rush' that this has been compared to by some, and one of the year's (quite hit and miss) more acclaimed films, so there was not any doubt about seeing it.",/review/rw5390603/?ref_=tt_urv

","Ford V Ferrari is one of the best movies I've seen this year, and for someone who has little interest in cars besides minivans and SUVs, that's saying a lot. Just like the race cars produced by its namesakes, Ford v. Ferrari is sleek and fast; a powerful and expensive machine.

12 January 2020,agm_tcr,8," Racing with a soul
","As a Ferrari fan I was pleasantly on the side of a Ford driver, all because of the soul Christian Bale was able to portrayed as Ken Miles, a sports car racing engineer who's hart was beaten in unison with an engine of a race car. Aside of the fact that he lose several kg for the role, but being a method actor it cling a viewer to the screen. Excitement and rage can be feel in every scene. The passion take us to the circuit and made us push the accelerator. What I miss is the surprise of the plot since I knew the story. The cast is brilliant, and finally in one Americans movie I have the pleasure to see casted Italians brilliants actor for the roles of the Ferrari Team, speaking perfect Italian, as oppose as being disappointed when they cannot.

14 February 2020,jordanucsd,8," ""I had no idea. If only my dad were alive to see this.""
","I've seen a lot of car movies, as a self-professed car nut. As such I judge them harshly, and immediately dismiss entries that don't provide enough reason to care about what is more important than the car: the driver. Think of the Fast and Furious and Transformers franchise. If you care about the driver, and the driver cares about the car, you care about the car. The car is a tool, an extension of the hero's body, and gains provenance with the audience when it helps the hero on their personal journey. Movies that come to mind that do this effectively include Gone in 60 Seconds, Bullitt, Need For Speed, The Italian Job, Batman Begins, and The Bourne Identity. Some of the James Bond movies do it well, like Goldfinger, The Spy Who Loves Me, The Living Daylights, and SkyFall, but many do not because of the lack of character arc in the story. We cannot forget about perhaps the greatest car movie of all time, Back to the Future. The shining example of how to make the car a proper star.",/review/rw5390603/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2019,nickfarf-42699,10," As close as possible to the truth but!
","I was at the Philadelphia Film center premiere on 11/11/19 to view this terrific movie. At the age of 68 and a tifoso of Ferrari since age 8, ( 1959 ), this movie hit a nerve. Truth vs Fiction. This was a David vs Goliath movie, however Goliath wins. The movie recreates a golden era of auto Racing. It was seriously dangerous with death and injury a guarantee at every race. These drivers were absolute warriors and we're fearless. Now Ferrari winning LeMans six straight years in a row from 1960-1965 is actually the David in this movie. Ferrari for all their dominant winning form was still a tiny company that sold fancy $15,000 sportcars to support his racing team. Winning LeMans was a $16,500 team prize. These Ferrari drivers were salaried. The prototype class at that time was wide open with no upper limit on engine size. There was an under 2 liter class that Porsche and Ferrari dino control, but the over 2 liter was unlimited. I read carefully about the Ford move to acquire Ferrari, as daily news reports would cross the associated press. The movie is spot-on about Ford cars lacking desire back then. Chevrolet had the Corvette, Corvair and sporty looking Impala and Chevelle. Now Ford is the Goliath in this movie. They are the big corporate giant with unlimited resources. Ford paid for the Ford GT. It was really a Lola Gt with a Ford badge put on it. Ford put their name on every innovation provided by all the racing/equipment suppliers that went into that race car. Unlike Ferrari being designed, engineered and built handmade in that Italian factory. Ford spent more money on developing a racecar than the total price to buy Ferrari outright. Hired every Nascar team to provide expert pit crews, engine builders and offered 80,000-100,000 to each driver for one race . Now the movie, it's a movie that non race cars fans can and will enjoy. It shows how Shelby and Miles are really the heroes of the winning team. This was true. Their relationship is spot on in the movie and they know what is needed to win. They battle off the track against Ford executives and against Ferrari on the track. What is not disclosed in the movie is the quitting of the Ferrari ace driver John Surtees. When he left Ferrari, the team was devastated. He along with Ford's Ken Miles were two true warriors. Also not shown but lightly covered in the movie is the three years of disastrous outing for the Ford racing team. Did Shelby steal the Ferrari pits stop watches? Did Shelby actually throw spear lug nuts into the Ferrari pit lane to make the Ferrari pit crew think that the race car was missing a nut on the car out on the track? Did Enzo Ferrari actually tip his hat to honor Ken Miles? Who really knows. Everybody is dead. I remember the lug nut rumour in the 1960s, as that was a southern stock car trick. I never heard about the theft of Ferrari stop watches by Shelby. As far as Ferrari tipping his hat. Ferrari was known for or not attending many races. All that aside, did I as a Ferrari fan enjoy this movie. My answer is a Yes, Yes, Yes. With the exception of James Garner in Grand Prix, this is the best movie to deal with the sport of autoracing. Bonus is that it is also a great human interest story and they create the mood of the sixties as U vividly remember it. I rate this movie a ten and should be nominated for Oscars.",/review/rw5390603/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2020,Kikisaurus,8," I know nothing of cars or racing, nor do I care about either yet....
","To start off, I have always hated racing. Yes, hated. It think it's a ridiculous waste of resources, and boring to watch. I have zero interest in cars - and thus I know absolutely nothing of the history. I knew nothing of this film beyond reading the blurb before I started watching it, so I was very interested to see whether I would like it at all. I did. Despite being so uninterested in the subject, the film got me interested in the story, and especially during the final race I was on the edge of seat not knowing what would happen. Fantastic acting job from both Damon and Bale, usual. They never disappoint. Excellent writing, directing, cutting, sound editing.. A very whole package overall.",/review/rw5390603/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2020,garethcrook,9," Stunning!
","This film is like the cars it portrays. Slick on the surface, but complicated underneath. Yes it's a story born of corporate ambition in horn rimmed glasses and dark suits, driven by pride and stubbornness, but the heart of it is pure racing, to hell with money, marketing, good looks, any of that. I've watched half of this with my foot planted to the floor. The driving scenes are awesome, the roar of untamed engines (turn your sound up as loud as you dare!), shifting gears into blindness inducing speeds. Fast cars alone though can't carry a film, but thankfully the cast here is as great as the cars. Damon is very good as the lynchpin Shelby, as he drags Ford away from mass production and onto the racetrack to challenge Ferrari's dominance. Bale though, Bale is magnificent. His portrayal of somewhat renegade driver Ken Miles is the oil in the engine, the comic undertones with a 'my way or the highway' attitude. He literally drives this. The pacing is spot on, balancing the boardroom with the tarmac perfectly, all done with some Oceans 11 style slick, good ol rock n roll blasting out as men do manly things. It's a show piece with Ferrari painted as the bad guy. I'm fine with that. Yes the cars look sexy, ""If this were a beauty pageant, we just lost"", but gimme the brute force of the Ford GT40 any day. There's a ton of excitement and energy before the cars even get to Le Mans, but seeing that GT tear up the French countryside gets the heart pounding. Doesn't matter that I already knew the outcome, it's still exhilarating with some of the best racing scenes in any film, ever!",/review/rw5390603/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is one of this year's best, from the cast's performance, the story, and the cinematography. It has good visuals feeling that you are really in the 60s. Bale and Damon's acting were commendable. I really did not expect to love this one a lot because I'm mainly not a fan of action movies. I expect this to be at least nominated for Oscars.",/review/rw5390603/?ref_=tt_urv
