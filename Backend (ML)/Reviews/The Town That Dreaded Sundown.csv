22 December 2020,view_and_review,9," I Can't Explain Why I Like It
","I don't even think I can rationalize my enjoyment of this show. It was so crazy, so wacky, so off-the-wall that I loved it. Shake was just a loose cannon, scheming, lying, motor mouth I couldn't get enough of him. Meatwad was just a simple being. And Frylock was the voice of reason in it all and had eye lasers for sticky situations. But, I can't forget about their hairy loser neighbor Carl. He was just as ridiculous as the meal he lived next door to.",/review/rw0997587/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2004,film-critic,," I was not put on this earth to listen to meat!
","Whether it is the opening segments with Dr. Weird or the strange ending credit sequence with Abe Lincoln, Aqua Teen Hunger Force will make your mind boggle as you try to wrap your mind around about twenty minutes of some of the most brilliant animation EVER! I first found this while visiting a friend in Oregon. Let's say that we were not thinking clearly when we put it in, but as the opening rap sequence began, all I could do was laugh. The next morning, I thought perhaps it was just a fluke. Nothing could be as funny as characters like Master Shake, Meatwad, Frylock, and my personal favorite Carl! Boy, was I mistaken.

27 July 2004,jellyneckr,," Incredible!
","If you are expecting a great cartoon with exciting plotlines and lots of drama, this is not the show for you. If you are expecting a hilarious cartoon filled with lots of random, witty humor, this IS the show for you. There is not one way that one can fully describe AQUA TEEN HUNGER FORCE. Just take a look at the title; it is random and makes no sense. That is what is so amazing about this show. AQUA TEEN HUNGER FORCE follows the adventures of Meatwad, a meatball, Frylock, a floating order of fries, and Master Shake, a milkshake. They live in a house next-door to Carl. That is basically the premise of the show. Anyway, AQUA TEEN HUNGERFORCE is an incredible show that I recommend to anyone who is looking for a funny cartoon to watch, besides THE SIMPSONS and FAMILY GUY. AQUA TEEN HUNGER FORCE currently airs on Cartoon Network's adult programming block, Adult Swim, at 12 and 12:15 AM.",/review/rw0997587/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2002,bobbyknightmare,," Oh, this is freakin' great!
","This is the reason I watch ""Adult Swim"" every week, on the chance that ATHF are in the line-up. An incompetent but egotistical shake, a super intelligent box of fries and a happy-go-lucky meatball spend the day outwitting the most incompetent gang of villains this side of the Amoeba Boys and tormenting their loser neighbor to the point where you can actually feel sorry for the poor, no class, unemployable, grouchy slob.",/review/rw0997587/?ref_=tt_urv

12 November 2008,amateur100,," Look deeper, beneath the absurdity.
","Firstly I'd like to say that ""Aqua Teen"" is one of the funniest animated shows, mixing absurd situations with absurd characters who do absurd things. But great comedies (which this is) are more than simply absurd, they're smart. They bring us into the world of the cartoon and have us relate to each character. So I'm going to look into why this is a ""great"" animated comedy, merely because of its characterization.",/review/rw0997587/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2020,thescholar22,9," Truly They Were An Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Number 1 in the Hood G!
",I remember watching this show when Adult Swim first came out in 2001. Watching this as a kid I didn't quite get the humor but now I understand the humor better and feel like this show has aged gracefully like a fine wine now. While some or most adult cartoons feel like they are just dick and fart joke after dick and fart joke. Just doesn't FEEL like an ADULT cartoon also might just use dick and fart jokes or bad slapstick because they just want you watch them and not listen to them. Or mention things around their era that will probably be real dated in the future after the show ends.,/review/rw0997587/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2004,csi621,," NUMBER ONE IN THE HOOD, G!
","Rarely is it that we are graced with such an odd series that seems like such a painfully stupid idea that works so well.  Aqua Teen Hunger Force details the lives of three roommates that fight evil forces.  The odd thing about these roommates however, is that they are a milkshake (Master Shake), a box of fries (Frylock), and a wad of uncooked meat (Meatwad).  Yes, it sounds completely stupid.  And you need to see more than one episode to appreciate it.  But it is surprisingly one of the funniest shows on television.  My only complaint: that each episode is only about 11 minutes long.  Aqua Teen Hunger Force really is ""number one in the hood""!  A+",/review/rw0997587/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2014,ben-798-604758,10," One of the greatest shows of all time
","Aqua teen hunger force is an amazing comedy. Yes, this is true. But this is not the only reason they are the one of the greatest shows of all time. They were the first ever to do anything remotely like this. Their brand of offbeat, surreal comedy inspired much of the future programming that would become adult swims signature style. Its nonsensical, non canonical story lines and overly absurd characters to the point of parody (if only we could figure out what it was supposed to parody) earned it a cult following and many if not all of the ""villains"" are instantly memorable for their own individual quirks. Its without a doubt one of the greatest cartoons of all time, and it hasn't grown soft in its later years. 10 seasons in, and its still going strong. Thats probably because there is a practically infinite potential for their extremely absurdist format, a show that can feature a talking watermelon one episode and a closet to a narnia like fantasy land the next.",/review/rw0997587/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2003,cfisanick,," Instant masterpiece in the classic style!
","If you really think about it, ""ATHF"" subscribes to the classic sitcom format, just like ""Seinfeld.""  There's the brains of the outfit, Frylock (Jerry), the selfish jerk, Master Shake (George), and the eccentric goofball, Meatwad (Kramer).  But what sets this show up there in the pantheon of great cartoons is the one-of-a-kind, surreal, stream-of-consciousness dialogue.  Take a look at the ""Dumber Dolls"" episode with the incomparable David Cross as the most depressed talking doll ever. And his counterpart, Jiggle Billy, a dancing hillbilly doll has a musket, moonshine, and nightvision goggles.  There's the classic comedy writing technique of the ""three's""--with night vision goggles!  That makes me chuckle just writing it.  Or the hilariously obscure pop culture references, e.g., ""Tangerine Dream"" and the Atari 2600...  The smarter you are, the funnier this show is.",/review/rw0997587/?ref_=tt_urv

30 August 2004,Moved_To_TMDB_Org,7," Deliciously Funny
",ATHF has become the favorite late night entertainment snack for my family. The DVD set does introduce each segment with the now infectious rap song that describes each of the Superheroes. The humor is all over the map and comes in the form of dialog and visual pratfalls. The art is done in a quirky style on the cheap but the humor is still rich. All heroes HAVE to have a great bad guy. My favorites are the Mooninites along with Oglethorpe and Emory. MC P Pants and Sir Loin are also very good.,/review/rw0997587/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2010,Aaron1375,8," One of the funnier shows on adult swim.
","I enjoy this show that comes on cartoon network's adult swims. It has been a mainstay during this period of time for cartoon network for a long time, but it really shows no signs of weakening even to this day. The show centers around Master Shake, Frylock, and Meatwad. Master shake is a milkshake, frylock a box of fries and Meatwad, he is self explanatory. During the first couple of episodes they were like this crime fighting mystery solving team, but that did not last long as they have since mainly stayed around the house occasionally bothering their neighbor Carl who loathes the sight of them for the most part. The show is funny, took me the longest to finally realize Master Shake was the actual leader of the team, though one can understand my confusion as no one really listens to him and he is rather self serving for the most part. During the course of their adventures they have had to endure their fair share of villains, though most of these 'villains' are harmless to the rest of the world for the most part. They are also way to numerous to list here. My favorite character in the show has to be Carl though. Do not get me wrong, I like the main three, but there is just something so funny about Carl as he has to put up with the strange threesome next door. Though I saw some episode where a family of robots moved in next door as the Aqua Team got taken away by some vampire dude and I do believe he would prefer them to this very annoying family of robots, though I loved it when he pulled out the mini-gun. The show usually hits the mark there are a few shows that are not as good, but usually every episode has its fair share of laughs.",/review/rw0997587/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2011,runamokprods,8," As weird as it gets, and I mean that in the best way
","While the series has worn off a bit for me from when I was first enthralled by it's sheer dada- esque insanity, the best episodes still transcend to inspired levels of bizarre, gross, tweaked humor. ",/review/rw0997587/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2018,Better_TV,8," An Adult Swim Classic, With Some Frustratingly Lazy Writing
","It's hard to quibble with a show that's only 11-12 minutes length per episode, but Aqua Teen Hunger Force really can be very funny - plenty of surreal situations, witty one-liners, and marvelous voice acting.",/review/rw0997587/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2020,briancham1994,8," Crazy
","Absolutely nothing makes sense here, nothing is explained and nothing is consistent. It eschews traditional storytelling in favour of a surreal humour that throws all conventions out the window. This style makes it very unique and amusing. The sheer insanity is impressive.",/review/rw0997587/?ref_=tt_urv

7 August 2004,ZiM389,," One of the greatest shows ever created!!!!
","You could be the smartest person alive, or the dumbest person alive, and this show will make you laugh. The complete and total randomness to the comedy makes it a masterpiece. I would like to shake the hand of the man that created this show. One of my personal favorite episodes was the ""Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past"". I bought both volumes on DVD and I'm hoping like hell that they release all the episodes on DVD. Sadly, there has been an announcment that the last episode of ATHF will be shown sometime in August. I don't know what they are going to get to replace ATHF, but whatever it is, it better be good. I'd go freakin' crazy if they put some crap on instead of this comedic masterpiece.",/review/rw0997587/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2004,HappyBunny2087,," Do they ever stop crime? No. But that doesn't make it any less of a TV show...
","In the very beginning of the show, during the opening song, you see Frylock, (Master) Shake, and Meatwad fighting the bad guys and quite possibly kicking some butt. During the actual show, though, they argue and basically cause some problems for themselves and their in-desperate-need-of-anger-management neighbor, Carl.",/review/rw0997587/?ref_=tt_urv

12 January 2005,1babelfish,," As Memorable As It Is Dumb
","Aqua Teen Hunger Force is quite possibly the stupidest show currently on television. This doesn't mean it's bad in any way, it just takes the dumbest approach to any situation. There are 4 main characters who all live in New Jersey somewhere. The most prominent of which is Master Shake. Shake is the one of the most rude characters that you will find on any show. He cares for no one but himself and is constantly inconveniencing others for his own comfort. For example, he burnt down his neighbor Carl's house because he cut his lawn with matches. Carl, is the everyman, in the sense that he brings out the worst attributes in people. There is also Frylock,the smart one and meatwad, the... dumb one? All in all this show is completely retarded which, surprisingly, is what makes it so great. (SIDENOTE: This show has nothing to do with crime fighting)",/review/rw0997587/?ref_=tt_urv
