4 January 1999,SMK-4,10," Erotic and explicit
","The story of erotic films in the 1990s is largely a very sad one.  American main stream cinema seems to avoid the subject altogether, B movies are obsessed with coupling sex with violence and death, and the typical porno is as exciting as drying paint.  But there are a few exceptions, most notably the films of Tinto Brass, and this film here is a prime example.",/review/rw5167074/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have never seen an erotic movie like this before, nor have I ever found any to be as satisfying, even though I had to put up with English subtitles. The Tinto Brass perspective on female anatomy is quite uncommon in American porn.",/review/rw5167074/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2008,Nodriesrespect,8," Brass Balls
","Revered among aficionados of erotic cinema , director Giovanni ""Tinto"" Brass remains something of an acquired taste for the rest of the movie-going mundo. From his semi-respectable beginnings with the likes of COL CUORE IN GOLA (a/k/a I AM WHAT I AM) and NEROSUBIANCO  which memorably did the rounds of stateside theaters as THE ARTFUL PENETRATION OF BARBARA before settling onto the more literal and less censor-baiting BLACK ON WHITE  to his devil may care paeans to the female rump such as COSI FAN TUTTE, TRASGREDIRE and P.O. BOX TINTO BRASS, Brass has provided considerable grist to the mill of his detractors, still legion among the critical community, who consider him little more than a hack without interest beyond the prurient. As if to cater to those who didn't have the balls to fess up to their girlie watcher's inclination, he would occasionally craft something a bit more ambitious, drawing from historical fact (SALON KITTY, CALIGULA) or literary source (LA CHIAVE, SENSO '45), temporarily placating the highbrows while already preparing an upcoming unapologetic skin fest.",/review/rw5167074/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2013,itamarscomix,7," The Voyeour
","While it's hard to take a Tinto Brass film as anything more than a guilty pleasure, L'uomo che guarda may be the closest he ever came to making a film with real depth and it succeeds in juggling campy erotica with character study and a statement about human nature. While the blatant sexuality and skimpy outfits often border on the absurd, and often make it difficult to take the story seriously - especially in the scenes with Dodo's father and his assistant - this isn't as extreme as in Brass's recent work, especially the hilarious Cosi fan tutte. And in several other scenes - the one with the bisexual photographer stands out, as well as the nudist beach dream sequence - the nudity and sex are used in a more mature, and even disturbing fashion. Brass isn't known for subtlety or minimalism in his sex scenes, and this film is no exception, but he uses it more smartly this time, constructing an interesting and complex character in Dodo and saying something more interesting than usual about voyeurism in human sexuality and, as an extension, in film. A smart erotic film that tries to make the viewer think rather than just turn them on, and definitely one worth checking out for anyone not offended by nudity and blatant sexuality.",/review/rw5167074/?ref_=tt_urv

","I expected some piece of fluff along the lines of ""Emanuele"" but this goes farther, alighting somewhere on the border of soft-core and hard porn.",/review/rw5167074/?ref_=tt_urv

6 October 2019,erioncubi-39919,10," Fantastic Erotic Movie and one of my favourite Tinto Brass Movies
","I love Voyeur. Everything about it is amazing. Story, actors and nudity. You can get the uncut or cut versions of this movie. Also for sale on dvd and Blu Ray Uncut which I own. The leading woman is gorgeous and the nudity is a turn on for any man. Not in a dirty way but appreciating the female beauty. I wont spoil the story but I love it. Son and Father story and with Italian Erotica you can expect great stuff. Tinto Brass is an amazing director as well. Everything in the movie is thought very well.",/review/rw5167074/?ref_=tt_urv
