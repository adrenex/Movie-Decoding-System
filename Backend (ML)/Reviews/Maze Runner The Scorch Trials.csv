","Years ago I saw a documentary that included a scene from a never-released Orson Welles film, The Other Side of the Wind. It was remarkably modern, a kaleidoscopic, eccentric work that was surprising for someone Welles age.",/review/rw4450617/?ref_=tt_urv

","The Other Side of the Wind is not a perfect film, but perhaps the perfect film to punctuate Orson Welles' incredible and monolithic career, and certainly the most appropriate film to leave unfinished due to difficulty in production. Or perhaps it is the genius of Welles to have left the film unfinished on purpose?",/review/rw4450617/?ref_=tt_urv

1 November 2018,ferguson-6,8," film nerds unite!
","Greetings again from the darkness. Film nerds unite! Most of us who (proudly) wear that label have known that filmmaker Orson Welles left a few unfinished projects when he died in 1985. The most famous - or infamous - of these was THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WIND. It was to be the comeback film for Mr. Welles, who had slipped from the artistic throne with his run of TV projects, shorts, and unsuccessful features during the 1960's. Known as a perfectionist, and as someone more dedicated to the filmmaking part more than the ""finishing"" part, Welles filmed scenes for the movie from 1970-1976, and then picked it back up in the early 1980's to begin the editing process ... a process he never finished.",/review/rw4450617/?ref_=tt_urv

","Some films are hard to judge, especially something like this, that may be very close to what Welles intended, but never finished and never really seemed to be really satisfied with (see also the documentary about Welles from 2018, which is really good). Now there are things in here that may seem redundant to some or annoying. Or even pretentious to some extend. If that rings true to you or not, it doesn't mean you are right or wrong, one way or the other. It just means you have feeling and maybe knowledge and that's why you lean to a particular way or side.",/review/rw4450617/?ref_=tt_urv

12 May 2020,aciessi,6," A Master's Last Stand.
","It took 40 years to make. Orson Welles never lived to see it completed. It's sad, but in retrospect, I see why. The Other Side of the Wind is brilliant in it's own little way, but it's far too esoteric. This film was for an audience, but we certainly aren't it. This is Orson Welles, and his film cohorts, fed up with the Hollywood system, and throwing up their middle fingers at them. At the same time, Welles was searching to make a masterpiece far ahead of it's time. What we get is the story of the premiere of a legendary filmmaker's last film. The film-within-the-film, also titled The Other Side of the Wind, is a colorful and erotic psychedelic fever dream about a Native American woman. I enjoyed this portion much more. You can see the imagination and enthusiasm for making something new and far-out from these scenes. The scenes that wrap around the film-within-a-film are in the style of a documentary, as we see industry folks and journalists quipping and arguing with each other. John Huston stars as Jake Hannaford, the jaded has been hot shot director who is obviously supposed to represent Welles himself. Huston is the brightest part of these scenes. On the whole, they are less imaginative, and feel so insular. It's unbalanced, and that's what really took me out of it. Historically, this is really fascinating stuff. To better understand it, I must consult the making-of companion doc on Netflix.",/review/rw4450617/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2018,MogwaiMovieReviews,5," Much More 'F For Fake' than 'Citizen Kane'

13 November 2018,pierceborchardt,9," Not your father's Orson Welles movie
","This is not a movie for everyone. Orson Welles knows exactly who will enjoy this movie. Those who will enjoy this movie are exactly who Orson Welles wants to connect with, people like him, those who truly love Cinema. The art of this movie is evident. It is wholly original in its progression and cinematography. It captures the essience and mind of surrealist directors especially in the 1970s beautifully. It's a virtual time capsule of a movie. It is unintentionally a period piece, love letter to an era now long dead. Yet, this movie is very intentionally trying to put off a chaotic, disorderly, and untidy attitude. It does so very pleasingly. I love this movie. It is pure cinema.",/review/rw4450617/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2018,CinePendejo,9," Yeah, let's see how Charlie Kaufman can top this.
","Not only is THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WIND a striking achievement in film history - a nearly faithful assembly of the infamously scrapped project by THE Orson Welles - but it's also an impressive statement on movie-making itself. How film isn't always defined by one lens. How approaching movies as autobiographies makes a directors life less valuable. How a desperate production hell takes its toll on a legends vision. And how sexual or psychological baggage bite you in the ass as the years pass by. You'd also see how he's deconstructing himself as he makes his movie, which probably started as this avante-garde film starring two people, then a story about how a legendary director makes this avante-garde film, then the issues he deals with in showing this movie to a fanbase that may or may not hold him too high of a standard.",/review/rw4450617/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2020,vonnoosh,8," Orson Welles' Eyes Wide Shut
","If you became a major fan of Welles' work, you know all about the aborted projects. Don Quixote, The Deep (later made by a different director as Dead Calm), and The Other Side of the Wind. Well, Don Quixote started and stopped so many times until Francisco Reiguera and Akim Tamiroff passed away, The Deep allegedly was completely done except for the filming of an explosion, and The Other Side of The Wind allegedly had footage financed by the Shah of Iran and that footage was caught up in the political turmoil in '79. I've read all about these sorts of things over 20 years ago. Now we have Welles' Eyes Wide Shut. A movie like Kubrick's last movie, released after the director's death with some aspects of it incomplete. Maybe the film would have ended up differently than what the compilers of this footage came up with or what a studio may've settled on without the director's input, maybe not. I know neither movie is considered Welles' or Kubrick's best work.",/review/rw4450617/?ref_=tt_urv

4 November 2018,jake_fantom,2," A Bitter Disappointment
","Let me start by saying that I am a major Orson Welles fan. With a few notable exceptions, his films are true classics. And he continued making great films into the late 50s. In Touch of Evil, released in 1958, Welles continued to expand our cinematic vocabulary with astonishing camera work and dialog techniques. I was so excited by the prospect of a ""new"" Welles release that instead of waiting for the Netflix release, I paid 20 bucks times two to see this at a film festival with my better half. Oh. My. God. What a colossal stinky mess of a movie! Atrocious script (half of which is attributed to Welle's lady friend, Oja Kodar, whose expressionless acting is also featured in the film). Hugely self-conscious, stilted performances by Peter Bogdanovich, Edmund O'Brien, Cameron Mitchell and John Huston, to name just a few. And shaky artsy-fartsy camera work that is edited in such a frenetic style that I started looking for the closest exit after only a couple of minutes. The simple fact is, Welles' greatest work was done while he was under the control, or at least supervision, of the big studios. Somehow, that tension produced fascinating, character-driven films. Later, operating on his own, with no one but himself to answer to, Welles drifted on to ""message"" films - like F is for Fake, another turkey, although not as big a turkey as the work at hand. It is hard to say how much of the blame here lies with Bogdanovich and those others who took it upon themselves to complete the master's last film. Clearly, they made a hash of it, although my suspicion is they really didn't have much to work with. I cannot think of a single scene in the entire film that came across as relevant or believable. It pains me to say it, but this one would have been better left to disintegrate in the can.",/review/rw4450617/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2019,clanciai,10," Orson Welles' last film is no freak show
","He was not allowed to complete this film in his lifetime, like many of his film projects also earlier had been obstructed by financial difficulties, censure or uncooperative producers. More than 30 years after his death this film was completed by arduous work of his friends and followers, piecing together an enormour amount of left over materials and making a film of it, but it definitely still carries the stamp of Orson Welles. You feel his direction in the structure, in the character of the leading character (John Huston) making his last film before death and in the enormous ensemble play. Many great old actors make themselves reminded here again like in a last chance show, like Edmond O'Brien at the end of his tether, Cameron Mitchell, while the one charcter standing out in in a great personality of integrity by herself is Lilli Palmer, whom John Huston calls 'mother'. The plot is a muddle, all the characters keep interfering with each other and talking a lot of nonsense, it's a mess of intrigue and chaotic interceptions, but ultimately the structure gets into shape and reaches the ordinary Orson Welles height of impression. It will take some time to digest this film, there is too much in it, but the ultimate impression must be of yet another Orson Welles masterpiece.",/review/rw4450617/?ref_=tt_urv

","Welles had something to say that only people like him would understand. That is insiders of the movie making world .
To me it makes sense he was unable to obtain finances to complete the film . It was a project of personal indulgence. It comes across pretentious.
The best thing about this movie is the use of black and white , aspect ratio , and colour .
As a Netflix movie probably best place for it since it would have bombed in the theatres .",/review/rw4450617/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2020,yrussell,10," A beautiful depiction of the death of hope
","This is a densely-packed and multi-layered film. The first time you watch it, you feel like you've been thrown into somebody else's life, with very little explanation of who these people are. Nobody is around to explain the interrelationships (the loves, hates, and histories) among this avalanche of new faces that hits you within the first five minutes of the movie (in that sense, it mimics how - in real life - you need to figure these things out yourself). To really understand the film, one should watch it at least ten times. Then, you begin to discern the weight of the tragedy that is unfolding amidst the drunken merriment. This is a movie about the disastrous end of Jake Hannaford's life. The story is set during a party, a truly epic shindig organised by an important woman from his past named Zarah (we never learn why Zarah chose to organise the party; their past relationship is kept a mystery). The aim of the party was to celebrate Hannaford's birthday, celebrate his life, and - most importantly - renew his career. Yet, the whole thing backfires. There's numerous hints throughout the film that Hannaford is a Hollywood legend with a directorial career stretching back at least forty years. In the party, Hannaford is held up as a figure of worship and adulation. Yet, the man behind the legend - when his moment in the spotlight has finally come - is utterly incapable of living up to his ideal. In fact, the real Hannaford is a nasty piece of work. His macho façade is like the Great Pyramid of Cheops, built up over many years, and now totally unchangeable. Hiding his weakness and insecurity under his pyramid of machismo, Hannaford plays up the reckless, hard drinking, womanising persona with barely a realisation about how pathetic he looks in front of the young party crowd. Eventually, he dies three deaths in one night - a social death, a financial death, and finally his real death.",/review/rw4450617/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2018,Tail_End_Charlie,," Worth the Ride
","Other reviews have shed light on the challenges and controversy surrounding the creation of this film, so I will not cover that. The initial scenes are haphazard, but after a short while, the plot adopts a firmer grasp. Some scenes were shot in b/w, and other in color, and the mix of the various film stocks does work, for the most part. Shrewd, biting humor infuse the entire film, which skewers the Hollywood studio system and offers glimpses of hangers-on, while highlighting the sordid nature of fame.",/review/rw4450617/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2021,RonellSowes,5," Final Tragic Entry Into Welles' Career
","The Other Side Of The Wind follows the events leading up to the death of an aging, great director as he worked to try and finish a film that would be his comeback. The plot of the film mirrors the actual one of Orson Welles' life. What the picture means to Huston's character in the film, is what this film was to Orson. It was his last attempt to make something that would bring him back into the light. It's a tragedy someone as brilliant as him was diminished to making films like this by the end of his career.",/review/rw4450617/?ref_=tt_urv

6 September 2019,hollywoodshack,5," Mr. Arkadin meets This is Your Life
","I haven't seen the whole movie yet, and this is one problem with it. It drags along into so many small characters and subplots, it's a chore to finish. The opening resembles Mr. A quite a bit, but we didn't need any modern references to take us out of the time it was set, like ""Before cellphones and ipods."" It's unrealistic to think people who knew Welles could know what parts stayed and what parts could be cut. I don't know why people who knew a famous director would ride together in a school bus to his party, except as a way of introducing the characters and revealing their secret opinions about him. The yellow bus just might be spoofing the tour bus that people use to visit Hearst Castle, the model for Welles' epic Citizen Kane. I would like to be remembered if I were famous as someone who made movies that appealed to simple tastes and problems of ordinary people. Sad what a grandiose ego trip can do. I suppose it never occurred to those reviewing a hundred hours of footage that Welles might have intended to have a mystery open ""question mark"" ending for the film.. Late photography director Gary Graver said in an interview ten years ago the ending planned for this film was different then what I saw here.",/review/rw4450617/?ref_=tt_urv

","The maker of the estimable The Magnificent Ambersoms, Citizen Kane, Touch of Evil and Falstaff has made a rambling, self-indulgent student film sans interesting dialog, characterization, conflict, momentum or purpose. The film is disorienting and uninviting from the start and it never really becomes a film; it feels like an assemblage of outtakes, and tedium sets in after 30mins. Except for John Huston's familiar persona, none of the actors or non actors register; they seem cramped and uncertain. Oja Kodar, Welles'
attractive companion, and Bob Random are uninteresting in the barren film within a film also titled The Other Side of the Wind which appears to be
a critique of European art films especially Antonnioni and Zabriskie Point, but it's less interesting and more pretentious than what it parodies. Watch They'll Love Me When I'm Dead instead; it has more to say about Welles and filmmaking than The Other Side of the Wind and a better title to boot!",/review/rw4450617/?ref_=tt_urv
