18 October 2015,themadmovieman,9," Easily the weirdest film you'll see all year
","There's no chance that you'll see a film as weird as The Lobster this whole year. In what is effectively an indie art-house piece, you get a completely insane and almost unfathomable world filled with more and more absurdities everywhere you look. However, it's such an incredibly unique and eye-catching film that it's still hugely engrossing and surprisingly entertaining to watch.",/review/rw4619454/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2015,CinemaClown,," Weird, Whacky & Wicked But Also Dull, Sterile & Vapid.
","Weird, whacky & wicked but equally dull, sterile & vapid, The Lobster is a strange beast that actually begins quite well but tumbles down the road after the halfway mark to conclude on a rather uninteresting note. The concept is no doubt intriguing and it takes its time to make us familiar to the society inhabiting its tale but all of it doesn't amount to much in the end & it fails to leave any lasting impression.",/review/rw4619454/?ref_=tt_urv

",The Lobster is an absurdist black comedy with a deadpan narration. It is set in a Dystopian world where being single can turn you into an animal.,/review/rw4619454/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2017,bob the moo,," Cleverly original, scathing, and sharp – even if the oddity of it all did make it hard to penetrate
","I had heard reviews of The Lobster and, while sounding interesting, it also sounded odd enough to delay me in getting round to seeing it. Like many have said, the plot is weird; single people are sent to a hotel and given a period of time to find a match or else they will be turned into the creature of their choosing and released to the wild. Those struggling can add days to their stay by being successful on hunts for those singles who have broken free and live as collective individuals in the woods.",/review/rw4619454/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2021,gregoryrice06,5," Missed the mark
","The idea was intriguing and this was something I had been wanting to watch since it came out, I just didn't enjoy it. It seemed so contrived and it felt like the actors were just going over their lines without emotion, so I didn't really connect with anyone or really care about the plot. There wasn't really a sensible reason for people to turn in to animals or for the loners to be just as brutal about relationships. I get the point it was making, but it didn't really resonate with me.",/review/rw4619454/?ref_=tt_urv

13 February 2016,Amadio,6," Tale of Two
","The Lobster is a curious film with shades of the Coen Brothers or Grand Hotel Budapest (the fact that so much is set in a hotel is incidental, or hotels in movies are places to be avoided). Dysfunctional characters drift through, delivering their lines with humorous lack of awareness and emotion, strange rituals are performed to bond the guests, and all the time the clock is ticking - find a partner, become a couple, within 45 days or be turned into an animal of your choice.",/review/rw4619454/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2016,lesleyharris30,1," A Painful Viewing,
","The Lobster is a diabolical film with a poorly written plot and a top notch cast that are not given any chance to display their talents here. Apparently it is meant to be funny, but it is for a very, very acquired taste, some jokes are extremely dry and others are over to the top, as well as tasteless. ",/review/rw4619454/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2020,veinctor,3," eww no. an absurd, disturbing allegory where nothign makes much sense.
","As a movie, it's slow. As a story is absurd. As a sci-fi, it's weak, as nothing really is explained or makes sense. As a comedy, there are no jokes and if anything, it was disturbing. Yes it's supposed to be an allegory, but come on. Nothing makes sense.",/review/rw4619454/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2017,classicsoncall,5," ""Some excuses are without doubt, better than others...""
","Quite coincidentally and without aforethought, I started knocking down a few about a half hour before starting to watch this movie. I almost never do that, but in this case it was strangely apropos. Now I like quirky, and the first half of the movie, even though a lot of it was non-sensical, managed to elicit it's fair share of laughs from this viewer. But what I originally thought might have been daring and brilliant eventually just collapsed upon itself. It's got nothing on Monty Python, and the thing just wound up wearing me out. I was never so glad for any kind of ending to put this picture out of it's misery, no matter how stupid, and that's exactly what happened.",/review/rw4619454/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2015,vbrt0117,8," Very true reflections of our society
","The film is dark humoured, satiric and mocking mirror of society reflecting on human's obsession to fit in certain rules of society, despite how ridiculous they are. We step on our primary feelings and ignore our instincts just to play by the rules, to belong. And even it was the clear theme of being obsessed with being in a couple, I see it as a bigger reflection of society. After the main character runs into the woods, where he finds rebels of coupling, it's clear that they are as extreme as the hotel people. It looks like it's shown that people have to belong to survive, but options are limited and you have to obey, pretend or risk to be destroyed. Various examples of dysfunctional relationships are shown in the film, which looks so familiar – pretending to have something in common, pretending that you understand that you are the same. Desperation, rejection, cruelty in the relationships – we have seen and know it all, but director found the way to remind it with a lighter tone, with the possibility to laugh at ourselves and society. All the characters acted and talked in the same hyper-polite manner – that's what we do, so often we dance around difficult and extreme situations with our repressed feelings. And despite how similar everyone talked, with the same tone and politeness, we can see through that and find individuality of the characters, and it shows that we are more than just rules, etiquette  The obsession to have something in common with you partner reached the peek at the end. It looked like even David and blind women are still in love, but a realisation that in society norms they don't have anything real in common drives to an extreme decision. It shows that we sacrifice so much if we love someone different, and all just to be more acceptable in the society, but at the end society doesn't care, so do we just have to be braver? This film makes more think than feel. The audience who is used to relate to the characters might find it difficult, as even the main character is not very lovable, he is a week and very human in other words. It's not a 'feel good' film but not miserablism, it's smart and innovative reminder",/review/rw4619454/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2016,george.schmidt,4," Flat-footed satire; Farrell does his best despite this bleak sci-fi black comedy's 'attempts'
","THE LOBSTER (2016) ** Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, Ben Whishaw, John C. Reilly, Ashley Jensen, Angeliki Papoulia, Lea Seydoux, Michael Smiley, Olivia Colman, Garry Mountaine, Ariane Labed, Jessica Barden, EmmaEdel O'Shea. Flat-footed satire of a totalitarian, dystopic society set in the near future where those who are not coupled are given 45 days to find a significant other or face the fate of being 'reassigned' as an animal. Farrell is the best thing about this oddball black comedy as a sad sack whose life is in a downward spiral at the spa from hell attempting to find a mate or find his fate. While filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos - who co-wrote with Efthymis Filippou - has made the attempt of an Orwellian tale of despair (and succeeded in alienating his audience) the film itself is one hot mess and misfire. Not even as a sci-fi parable of say a Twilight Zone or X-File or even a black comedy say like Monty Python. Just dreadful.",/review/rw4619454/?ref_=tt_urv

23 December 2016,Floated2,3," Interesting Premise but Disappointing result
","The Lobster features and interesting premise in itself as it is brilliant and loaded with comic situations, but where the movie goes wrong is in its cynical attitude towards the dating world. It tries hard to distinguishing itself and be creative and unique, only for the actual result of the film to be quite boring and doesn't seem to live up to its potential of ideas. Though one could argue there's a really wonderful love story buried somewhere beneath this cynicism, director Lanthimos' attitude towards society and relationships in particular is awfully bleak that it comes across cold and emotionally distant. The scenes at the hotel, while certainly better in their own twisted way, are an exaggerated response to the dangers of conformity. The Lobster feels longer than it's running time, and does not feel satisfied once the film ends. It isn't as funny as several critics claim, and although it is quite different, that does not necessarily make it good. Certainly this is a film for those of acquired taste.",/review/rw4619454/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2016,cherold,4," Weird and unpleasant
","Wow, people love this movie. My girlfriend, a fan of dystopian fiction, had been told she would like this, and was actually very excited about it. I found the premise offputting and thought it would be inherently depressing. So we went into the movie with different expectations, but by the halfway point, we both agreed it wasn't worth continuing.",/review/rw4619454/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2015,Cjalln1,9," A remarkable oddity of a film
","""The Lobster"" takes the tropes and expectations of modern-day relationships and satirises them almost out of existence. The farcical ""Hotel"" aims to partner 'loner' humans with each other (based on 1 characteristic) in a stress-inducing timeframe of 45 days, often resulting in deception and the suppression of true feelings in order to garner a relationship as a means of escape. The other side of the coin is the outcast tribe living a meagre existence in the woods, where even flirting is punished with physical mutilation. The cold mechanical delivery of every single character's lines emphasises the absurdity of the situation, and bizarrely makes the jokes even funnier. Not since Richard Ayoade's ""The Double"" has cripplingly awkward humour been so effective. This film has a lot to say about the fickle nature of relationships, set against the background of a dystopian society. The cinematography is as flat as the actors' delivery; this contributes to the emotionally-stunted, often silent world that the characters inhabit. The ending is beautifully ambiguous and surprisingly tense for such an understated scene. A score which fluctuates from terse, rough string melodies to Italian opera heightens the sense of weird-art-film which pervades ""The Lobster"": definitely a film which requires full attention, reflection, and a mind open to arty weirdness, ""The Lobster"" is a remarkable oddity.",/review/rw4619454/?ref_=tt_urv

","For the 7.30 screening, the 79-seat auditorium was at least three quarters full, and the majority of people were laughing and enjoying it- I must have watched a different film, because I found this to be unwatchable, an absolutely irredeeming film, devoid of anything worth caring about.",/review/rw4619454/?ref_=tt_urv

","Hands down one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life - it's not just bad or not impressive, it is ultra graphic, violent, slow, meaningless and empty. Many people have recommended this and I expected it to be cynical as ""The favourite"", but still good and very meaningful. But this thing I cannot call a good movie. I was hoping the story was going somewhere but it never stopped being depressive and slow, even the end was not impressive. Huge disappointment.",/review/rw4619454/?ref_=tt_urv
