4 October 2022,npvarley,8," Surprisingly good!
","Ok, I admit that I was a bit sceptical about this show, having seen the trailer. Could they fill out the weekly half hour with quality comedy? Well, the answer is a resounding YES!",/review/rw8636539/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2022,talkteav,10," from intrigued about the idea to laughing out loud
","With half a smile, I went from intrigued about the idea to laughing out loud and wanting more episodes. The actors each have unique comedic styles and a great back and forth. Reboot offered laugh-out-loud and heartfelt moments with more than a few plot twists. What I love most about the show is seeing Boomers, Xers, Millennials, and Gen-Z, all matching wits on the set of a sitcom series turned battleground. Watching these characters who are different in age and personality find common ground gives me hope and makes it feel like a classic sitcom.",/review/rw8636539/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2022,mcvallin-389-686890,7," Not gonna go crazy yet, but it's good...
","So far so good. Doesn't hit it out of the park, but it's quality. Great cast and concept, and it seems to be put together thoughtfully. Ironically, it's a seemingly good show that's riding on the shoulders of what's wrong with the entertainment industry right now, which is crappy reboots and minimal original content.",/review/rw8636539/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2022,gina_gemini,7," Good thing I trusted Paul Reiser.
",I should admit after the first episode I was not thrilled about watching more of this show. It looked like another show you could safely pass without missing much. But the second episode changed everything. The story got much much more worthwhile. The show and characters started showing some depth and especially Paul Reiser's character kept me interested and I am glad I kept watching.,/review/rw8636539/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2022,fayandray,9," Promising
","I am surprised at how much I liked E1. The meta aspect of this show (Hulu, Yale Drama) makes it much funnier than anticipated. Johnny Knoxville isn't as annoying as I've always thought him to be since his days on Jackass; in fact, and I can't believe I'm saying this, his part seems perfect for him and he plays the character well! Judy Greer is always great and I'll finally get to see if Keegan is the great actor (instead of just sketch comedy) his pedigree projects. I'm looking forward to seeing how the show evolves over the next couple episodes and will update this review at the end of the season, if I get to the end of it. Fingers crossed!",/review/rw8636539/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2022,Tr-u-mpbilly,10," A Very Good Show
","I was wondering why I passed on watching it so many times, then I saw Johnny Knoxville was in it. I figured it would be his usual lowbrow, punch in the crotch, fart joke shctick. I was wrong. This is such a good show.",/review/rw8636539/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2022,tomanc,9," I love this show.
","This is such a breath of fresh air. First of all, what a cast! They really knocked it out of the park. I love everybody. Key, Greer, and Knoxville are fantastic. This is the first time I've seen Calum Worthy who plays their ""TV son"" Zack, and he is great. And who doesn't love Paul Reiser? C'mon.",/review/rw8636539/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2022,mccabe-shannon,9," So far so good- interesting take, good casting.
","First, I love the case. Each character really fits. Don't love the grown up kid but I think that's kinda intentional. It's a great mix of people.",/review/rw8636539/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2022,Laight,8," Not Episodes, but not bad
","At first you might think you were looking at a reboot of Episodes, one of the funniest tv comedies in years. Then you realize, nope, this is going to be another Hollywood sitcom. And it pulls out all the basic tropes -- everything is confused half way through an episode and ends well at the end; everyone is romantically attached to someone else, usually in a oh-so-funny way; every plot point you think is going to happen, happens. Whereas Episodes always surprised with its unexpected plots, Reboot plays out exactly as though think it will.",/review/rw8636539/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2022,maristprods,9," Funny! Better than I expected. Shades of 30 Rock with some great conflicts
","This really surprised me. I expected a traditional networks sitcom, and this is that but with a whole lot more. This feels like it could be a four quadrant show while also not talking down to us and having a lot of wit and inside jokes. The things that really hit, really hit hard. Actually laughing out loud is not something that usually happens for me but I did a few times. The cast is phenomenal. None of them are overdoing it or playing their tics. I have nothing negative to say. Give it a shot. Right now my favorite shows are Reservation Dogs, Barry and Succession so that'll give you a hint of my taste. Finally, I appreciate that the child actor grown up isn't a spoiled dick-they went another direction and it's so much better-thank you!",/review/rw8636539/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2022,and_shove_it_up_your_butt,8," Hilarious (no laugh tracks and goofy jokes needed)
","I'm only one episode in and I already know this show is going to be great. Glad I decided to give it a watch and looking forward to how all of this plays out. Reboot is well-written and seriously funny. If you like shows or movies like..hmm..let's see... I'd say The Office, Abbott Elem, Office Space, Single Parents, etc, then I'm pretty sure this will be straight up your alley. Over the top, slapstick humor, isn't always necessary and so I'm glad they created a smart comedy that doesn't always go for a cheap punchline.",/review/rw8636539/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2022,Headturner1,7," And a half
","I watched an episode and went on to find something else. Well I went back and watched the other 2 that were released with it and I must say it has a feel of older sitcoms of the day! It has a feel good feel to it and I like that! With all the dark stuff I usually watch this is a refreshing reprieve from that. Sure it's nothing ""original"" but if it makes me feel good that's quite a feat! It's too early to tell. I loved Reiser in Red Oaks( now that to me was something brought me back to the 80's). This new requirement 600 characters! Ugh. Any ways liking it thus far and will update after more episodes.",/review/rw8636539/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2022,Mehki_Girl,8," Getting Funnier and Funnier
","This is why, sometimes, you have to give a series a chance to meld and find it's footing and not judge by the pilot alone.",/review/rw8636539/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2022,nategerard77,7," Worth the watch for more than one reason
",If you grew up in the late 70's to the early 90's you saw many formulaic shows like the one this show originally was before the reboot because that's what TV gave us. In some ways this show is both a walk down memory lane and another funny look at the distasteful underbelly of the entertainment industry.,/review/rw8636539/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2022,garethcopeland,8," So far SOO good!!
","I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised at how well this show is. Good writing, decent jokes and the actors are doing a great job. Normally I hate most American made sit coms/comedies, as they are mostly hammy and working with a tired framework, but there is a freshness about this. There is no laugh track to this, which I think is great and the fact your not told when laugh",/review/rw8636539/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2022,rickfletcher28,10," I can't believe how funny this is.
","This show gets me. I love how every character connects with each other. Even Paul does a great job being the grumpy director of a show he's lost touch with, but still somehow has warm and funny moments that make him just as liked as all the rest of the other characters. I wish Knoxville had a little more depth to his character, as he seems he's kind of just one dimensional at the moment, but that's not to say I don't appreciate his role in the show. I'm hoping one episode of this show will in fact be a full episode of the show they are recreating, but I know that might be a stretch. All I can say, is Hulu better not pull a Netflix and cancel this show before everyone gets the chance to realize just how great it is.",/review/rw8636539/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2022,amarsh07,9," Let's remake something original.
","First off, that line alone was the funniest I heard on any show in a long while. And it sums up this show to a T. Can't decide if this is a straight parody of the Laugh-tracked, spoon-fed joke filled sitcoms of old or even new (I'm looking at you, The Neighborhood!). So far after three episodes I am loving this show. The jokes are not set up a mile away and predictible. Thank God there is no laugh track. Canned laughter is the worst, even on good shows. The entire cast is great. A special shout out to Kerri Kenney, whom I've loved since The State and Reno 911. There were times I laughed out loud and that is rare for me with shows today. Looking forward to seeing more.",/review/rw8636539/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2022,hirekenk,8," Don't sleep on this!!!
","I noticed the title on my ""you might like"" suggestions and i didn't think anything of it, until i was home sick for a few days and out of shows to binge watch.",/review/rw8636539/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2022,barbra-levy,8," Love the episode titles
","Each episode is named after a real sitcom. I'm thinking they could do Family Ties, Cheers, Good Times even Happy Days. If they did Mad About You, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend or Mad TV/Playing House, that would be so meta. There are so many times that I have to stop the show to explain an inside joke that you get if you're Gen X. I appreciate Hulu being able to make fun of itself and of the entire TV industry - the scene where they quickly name more than a dozen reboots. I could do without some of the juvenile sex jokes (don't google Eskimo brother) but most of the writing is fine. This should last a season or two and it would be fun if they had special appearances like of Jordan Peale or Helen Hunt.",/review/rw8636539/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2022,Boaz777,6," Well, I like the cast, but...
","The writing quickly becomes formulaic. After watching the first three episodes, I already know where these stock characters are headed, because it's the same way they've been going since the invention of television itself.",/review/rw8636539/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2022,phagunocd,10," So Well Written and Funny
","Just started watching this show on a whim because of a Hulu recommendation. Plus seeing Keegan and Knoxville and Greer on the poster I was like ""can't go wrong with such a star cast"". But as we watched it we were blown away how good the writing was and how darn funny the show is. The storyline is very well written and the season finale was fire. This show better get renewed!! Highly recommend it.",/review/rw8636539/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2022,pbbsjky,10," A show about Rebooting a show...genius
","Yet another reboot, no one cares but when you make a show about rebooting, a fictitious old TV show, that is where you got me I thought that this idea was so creative and the comedy and humor and the writing just adds to it definitely a watch. It's rare that you see a TV show about a new idea. The show is relevant into the times and definitely portrays what it is really like in 2022 and how ridiculously cheesy these shows that they are rebooting truly were I would watch again and again can't wait for the next season. Star studded as well, you see actors from all of your favorite shows prior. Awesome.",/review/rw8636539/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2022,DarkVulcan29,9," Show within a show
","This is like a Judd Apatow film, very edgy, raunchy with some heart to it. And a good idea that came from so many shows from yesterday get rebooted, namely Fuller House (2016-2020). And the great bunch a actors playing these out of luck actors getting another chance is played well.",/review/rw8636539/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2022,sogoodlooking,3," Goes nowhere.
","There's no center to what's nothing more than a series of tepid, ineffectual skits based on themes such as... old comic writers v young diverse comic writers; a woman's first time with another woman; a man with a co-worker's mom; a man's lingering attraction to a co-worker; a woman's problems working with her absent father. Nothing goes anywhere. The cast leans towards the sluggish elderly. The 'comedy' involves things like an older person not understanding the slang someone younger used, and looking it up on their phone. That's it. That's the 'joke.' Or we go through a tedious attempt by one of the cast to break up with a castmate's mother. That's it. That's the 'comedy.'",/review/rw8636539/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2022,julieshotmail,7," More Paul Reiser please
","I have high hopes for ""Reboot,"" as the premise seems original and the cast is jam packed with funny and outrageous actors. Kerri Kenney in the early episodes is a hoot! And we get to witness ""Jackass's"" acting chops which is decent. The creme de la creme is of course Mr. Paul Reiser. I look forward to every scene that he is in, and he gives you what you are waiting for: the snide looks, passive-aggressive bite, and most of all, just being a funny comedian delivering his funny lines. The plot towards the middle unfortunately cannot keep up with his greatness. We get some boring fillers that have nothing to do with the original hook of the show. Overall, this is fun but loses a bit of steam, so don't expect anything ground-breaking like the ""The Office"" or ""Seinfeld.""",/review/rw8636539/?ref_=tt_urv
