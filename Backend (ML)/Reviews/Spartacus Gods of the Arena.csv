29 July 2020,ThomDerd,10," Beautiful, funny and educational. Highly recommended.
","As a film student, I had to go through all the important documentaries, starting from the 1920s with Nanook of the North till nowadays docs.",/review/rw4219310/?ref_=tt_urv

",I never saw any of the documentaries that they spoof but every episode was still funny to me.,/review/rw4219310/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2019,kcarrell-95390,10," Some episodes better than others, but overall fun
","My family and I really enjoyed this series. It's hard at times to remember these are Mockumentaries, because the acting, writing and stylized editing make it seem like you are watching an actual documentary.",/review/rw4219310/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2015,troybutcher77,10," Brilliant! Haven't laughed that hard in a long time
","Aktham Tashtoush who left a bad review below must not have read up on what this is about. To fully appreciate the brilliant comedy in Documentary Now, you need to watch at least part of (or read about) Grey Gardens for the 1st episode, and then watch an episode of VICE on Youtube to fully appreciate the 2nd episode. Bill & Fred have obviously watched and researched the original characters and have portrayed and mocked what is so funny about original shows. If you like morbid comedy, then this delivers.

8 September 2015,JeromeArlettaz,8," Unusual sense of humour
","I love this sense of humour based on characters having a great consideration for themselves, looking ridiculous from the viewer's perspective, with a pinch of cruelty and tons of nonsense. In short: the character doesn't know he's in a comedy. It isn't common in US comedy, more frequent in GB. This sense of humour requires a perfect execution in the filming and acting and I think that this series has brilliantly achieved it. I'm not an easy laugher and I'm usually the guy with the poker face in the cinema when everyone is exulting. But watching this show, I think I've disturbed my neighbours with my unpracticed heavy laugh. I particularly appreciate the introductions.",/review/rw4219310/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2017,erinharringtonmobile,10," Some of the Smartest, Funniest Writing in Years
","It baffles me that a show this funny can remain so underground, with less than a ""cult classic"" following. However I understand why many have looked over this show. The concept is not only very ""out there"" but the writing is very smart. In a similar way that the UK version of ""The Office"" is often overlooked by US fans for being ""too smart"", this show is closer to dry, British humor than classic American humor. But, through and through, this show is brilliant. The attention to detail is astounding to the point where the original documentaries look worse than their versions. Mulany, Meyers, Hader and Armisen pour so much passion into this show. This is not a cash grab, it's not a money maker, it's a passion project shared by 4 brilliant comedians and that can be seen in every episode. Please support this show, brilliant direction, writing and acting such as this should be rewarded and unfortunately this show is being overlooked.",/review/rw4219310/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2021,doomedmac,9," It's the most creative comedy show
","Documentary Now is one of the most ambitious and creative comedy shows I have ever seen. It's exciting for a me, a big film fan. It's also very funny.",/review/rw4219310/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2019,braquecubism,10," Nanook Revisited and Gray Garderns
","Being a fan of documentaries- these 2 are such wonderful parodies. I saw this last year, so I can't remember them all in detail. I would watch again. Satire has to be true to the thing yet take it one step further. Hard to do- many parodies fail bec they can't while keeping the integrity- these are 2 important classics- Funny! and true to the original Doc. If you haven't seen them. Did they also do Salesman, if not they should, and I would suggest, Daily Nation, Gladiator Days, the one about Ali in Zaire. it would take geniuses who really understand Docs, and Human natural. It says 3 seasons, will have to find to watch.
This measure up with the best of all time- Spinal Tap- and I think also the other Chris Guest, Best of show and Mighty Winds.",/review/rw4219310/?ref_=tt_urv

21 August 2015,mylifeisbigcomedy,10," Great work
",I just watched the new mockumentary show with my favorite comedians and I satisfied with what I saw there.,/review/rw4219310/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2018,cmomman1988,10," Welcome to Documentary Now
","Pros: Fav episodes are ""The Eye Don't Lie"" (a rare spoof of Errol Morris) and the two-parter ""Mr. Runner Up"" where Bill does his great take on Bill Evans; you can tell that they love their docs and so do I.
Cons: :/",/review/rw4219310/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2019,caseymoravek,10," Brilliant and Hilarious
",Brilliant and hilarious show that takes just the right amount of details from real docs. Wish we had more Bill Hader in later episodes!,/review/rw4219310/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2021,wasecan,6," All over the place
","Some episodes were very good. ""Batsh*t Valley"", ""Searching for Mr. Larson"", ""Gentle and Soft"" are some of the good ones. ""Original Cast album"" and ""Waiting for the Artist"" are painfully unwatchable. I'm sure there are some who like that kind of thing, but it was a major chore to get through those episodes. ""Final Transition"" and ""Any given Saturday Afternoon"" were reasonably OK. Armison is great, and some of the guest stars make it interesting. Overall, it balances out to about a 6.",/review/rw4219310/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2015,Aktham_Tashtush,2," Huge love and respect for Fred, Bill and Seth but the show is just a waste of slots on the channel and i recommend no one to try watching it for the sake of comedy ..
","OMG this is a torture !!! I really had such high hopes for this as i love this old (old as i can remember) crew of Saturday Night Live, ""Bill Hader"", ""Fred Armisen"" and being co-wrote by Seth Meyers ... and the first scene where Helen Mirren introduces the ""movie"" it was all unnecessary and loose,",/review/rw4219310/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2016,Okonh0wp,7," Cleverly conceived idea but it can be hit or miss
",Documentaries are generally a pretty esoteric cinematic experience and co-creator Fred Armisen's comedy is also pretty esoteric. As a result putting those together is going to lead to something that's not easy to appreciate or particularly funny every time out of the gate.,/review/rw4219310/?ref_=tt_urv

5 July 2019,thecoolbonnie,10," My stomach hurts from laughing
","I decided to check it out on a whim...I watched 3 random episodes...all hysterical! Wow! Smart, well written, great acting of course...Sandy Passage ep had me crying!",/review/rw4219310/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2020,sjsufan-4,10," deeply niche, exceedingly masterful; a wet dream for cinephiles and comedy writer nerds alike
","I will admit to not understanding this show for years. i, as i'm sure is also the case with many others, just found myself confused while watching season one as it premiered. i found myself waiting for some overt goof or joke, when i finally realized this material is far more akin to the work of Andy Kaufman as opposed to the more straightforward vibe of SNL. its less about building to a punchline and moreso about absolutely commiting to the bit.",/review/rw4219310/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2022,vaklavkoca,4," A TV show where you have to do homework to enjoy it
","I thought this was going to spoof documentaries in general, but it just spoofs specific documentaries. In order to find this show funny, you have to watch dozens of documentaries. Maybe it would be funny if you've seen all of the documentaries the writers have; but I haven't. And I don't want to do a bunch of 'homework' just to be able to watch a TV show.",/review/rw4219310/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2019,wikiblue,10," Genial!
","I love documentaries in general...so to watch this ""mockumentary"" is just a delight! So well written, produced, directed...loved every single episode. But this season 3 brought true jewels, starting with Owen Wilson as a guru from the '80, Cate Blanchett as a ""tortured"" artist, the Co-Op episode with Richard Kind and those absurds lyrics typical of Broadway sometimes...genial!",/review/rw4219310/?ref_=tt_urv

29 June 2018,tinafey-93194,6," Good but uneven.
","Weirdly enough, you'll probably like episodes based on how much you like the documentary they are spoofing in it. If you don't care about the original doc, you just won't be invested in the jokes. But the War Room episode is absolute genius, Hader has never been better. Armisen is a talented, genius creep. Still a creep tho!",/review/rw4219310/?ref_=tt_urv
