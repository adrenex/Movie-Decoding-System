",Scary Movie 4. Is it an example of good film-making? No. Will future film students study this movie and its revolutionary techniques? No. Could I have written this script in half an hour while stoned? Yes. Can I remember the last time I laughed this hard? No.,/review/rw1343934/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2007,hesketh27,5," OK - so its not great art!
","Its pointless trying to analyse this film as some reviewers have obviously tried to do here. Its not hilarious by any means but it does pass an amusingly enjoyable 80 minutes of time. The gags are mostly clichéd and predictable, there's lots of tired old slapstick but when there's nothing else on TV (which is why I watched this) it certainly fits the bill. As for the appearance of 'Michael Jackson' in the film, I'm still laughing every time I think about it - heaven knows how they got away with it, but its certainly a funny moment!! Im' glad that I had seen all the films that this tries to spoof and the re-creation of the sets for War of the Worlds is fantastic. Its so close to the original.",/review/rw1343934/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2007,claudio_carvalho,7," Shut Down Your Brain (Again) and Start Laughing With this Funny Franchise
","The unemployed Cindy Campbell (Anna Farris) is hired to work in a cursed house as caretaker of an old lady and meets the ghost of a boy. Meanwhile, the teenager son Robbie and the young daughter Rachel of his next door neighbor and crane operator Tom Ryan (Craig Bierko) are spending the weekend with their loser father. Cindy and Tom meet and fall in love for each other, but when Giant Tripods invade Earth, Tom escapes with Robbie and Rachel; Cindy travels to a village, trying to find the answer to a riddle to save the world; and the president of USA organizes the defense of the planet in UN under his intelligence and leadership.",/review/rw1343934/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2006,LoneWolfAndCub,7," Extremely surprised!
","I went to this movie with very low expectations. After watching the trailers, I thought this looked pretty lame and a real waste of money. Boy was I wrong!! This turned out to be an extremely funny movie, which does an extremely good job at parodying movies such as Saw, Saw II, The Village, The Grudge and War of the Worlds.",/review/rw1343934/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2006,Aaron1375,7," About what I expected.
","It was rather funny, as to be expected the jokes were hit and miss with there being more hits than misses for me. I thought once again it could have been funnier and there were some unnecessary jokes, but all in all it was a rather funny flick. This one actually plays like a sequel as characters from the previous flick are explained why they aren't here rather than just being ignored all together. For this one the required viewing or basic knowledge of a movie that you need for this one is mainly ""Saw"", ""The Grudge"", ""The Village"", ""Million Dollar Baby"", and for me the best one ""War of the Worlds"" (a movie that needed some fun poked at it). There is also something in there making a bit of fun of a movie pretty much you don't need to have seen are know all that much about...you will get it as long as you watch a bit of television. The ""War of the Worlds"" to me seems to be the main film parodied, however the other films get their fair share of the jokes as well. The opening is rather funny with Shaq and Dr. Phil doing a ""Saw"" recreation and there are other celebrities who make short visits as well however it is still the same group who forms the core of the cast. Worth a look see, however, if you did not care for ""Scary Movie 3"" I would say you probably won't like this one.",/review/rw1343934/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2022,bellino-angelo2014,8," Probably the funniest in the series
","I really didn't loved the first SCARY MOVIE despite it had some funny moments because I thought that for the most part the gags were of the juvenile humour sort. Second and third were ok, but when I arrived to the fourth I thought that I was watching a different movie than most of the other reviewers (and I still haven't seen the fifth).",/review/rw1343934/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2022,johnsmithjanuary-20081,9," absurdly random and funny
","Say what you may about it not living up to the previous films, but nevertheless it was an entertaining and humorous film. If you can accept the cartoony humor throughout its definitely worth the watch.",/review/rw1343934/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2022,askeland89,8," The story is the least interesting thing about it
","Be honest with yourself.. You don't watch these type of movies for the story, you watch them for the laughs and it delivers just that. There is nothing to learn here, this movie has no depth what so ever but it doesn't need it.",/review/rw1343934/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2006,DarthVoorhees,1," Makes Scary Movie 3 look like Citizen Kane
","The funniest parts were in the trailer and even these scenes weren't that funny. 50% of the movie is sexual jokes and the other 50 is people getting hit by heavy metal objects.The movies that are made fun of are War of the Worlds,Saw, and The Grudge but the movie has no real plot. In my opinion the movie should have primarily been a Saw parody.The character of Tom Ryan had potential but he is shown as a dumb ass when he should have been a direct parody of Cruise.Yes there are moments of potential but they are too few and far between. David Zucker is not trying at all anymore,perhaps because his prime audience is now ten year olds who snicker at the word penis. The other films in the series took time to set up jokes and obscure jokes were passed out. Killing off Charlie Sheen was a bad move because he was the funniest character in 3.4 has the most celebrity cameos but they don't take advantage of the talent. The talented Anna Faris needs to realize she is more than Cindy Campbell and she can move on to bigger and better things. Leslie Nielson the master of the spoof genre is not used at all. Sadly I think the days of the spoof film are numbered. Sad really because the genre has brought laughs when other comedies failed. Airplane was a great film because it had a brain behind the silliness. Writers are using the spoof genre to churn out brainless garbage to earn a few million...",/review/rw1343934/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2006,I_Like_Turtle_s,7," ""By keeping the parody and humour so tightly focused, they've generated more laughter than any other movies this year.. so far.
","The Scary Movie parody wagon has been rolling since 2000, when the Wayans Brothers pooled their considerable comedic talents and came up with a kitchen sink flick that riffed on mainly horror movies  with just a little Matrix thrown in. The second Scary Movie, also from the brothers Wayan, riffed on The Exorcist, The Legend of Hell House, Poltergeist, Little Shop of Horrors, A Nightmare on Elm Street, The Shining, and Hannibal. Non-horror targets included Dirty Harry, Charlie's Angels, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, and again, The Matrix.",/review/rw1343934/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2006,when_anna_attacks,7," Still got the jokes...!
","I went into this film a little hesitantly...How can there possibly be a fourth Scary Movie that still keeps its humour? Well, it was (half) possible. Although the overall structure isn't as tight as the other three, the jokes are often still 'fresh' and there's a lot of slapstick, which, although predictable, is still funny! Anna Faris (Cindi), as always, is still on top form, as is Regina Hall (Brenda) and together, they deliver some fantastic comedy. ",/review/rw1343934/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2006,sullibrandon,7," Typical Mindless Scary Movie Comedy
","Scary Movie 4 is a movie that had me laughing consistently the whole way through. It is a great comedy, one that will surely make you nearly split your sides in laughter. However, it is lacking in character development, a consistent plot, and an overall good storyline. In comparison with the 3rd (which I absolutely loved) it is about on par, maybe even surpassing it. If you liked the 3rd, you pretty much are guaranteed to like this one.",/review/rw1343934/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2006,dhellculvers,6," Fun and entertaining
","I had heard the buzz about this film being a bit crappy, but had to go check it out anyways. I have to admit that I laughed out loud a lot throughout the film. The plot involves Cindy Campell, star of all the previous Scary movie films, moving into a new house. But there are bigger problems than the job of house cleaning, as she soon find out her house is haunted by a little boy. To make matters worse, alien ""TrIpods"" are taking over the world. How is she ever going to escape this scenario? Scary movie 4 is filled with laughs, but cheap laughs as you would expect from a Scary Movie film, but it doesn't make it not fun to watch. So if you find yourself bored with nothing to do...why not see a funny flick. Definitely entertaining and will pass the time. My vote for this film is 6 out of 10.",/review/rw1343934/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2019,neil-476,8," Silly and funny
","This fourth entry in the Scary Movie series of spoof movies cobbles together bits from The Grudge, Saw, The Village and (especially) Spielberg's War Of The Worlds as a vehicle for Anna Faris' Cindy to lurch through the next bit of her life.",/review/rw1343934/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2021,filipemanuelneto,7," The best film in the franchise so far.
","This is the fourth film in the ""Scary Movie"" franchise ... and this time, Cindy is going to get a new job as a health care provider and face an alien invasion. Of course, the film is full of satirical situations and parodies of notable films like ""Grudge"", ""War of the Worlds"", ""The Village"" and ""Saw"". That is, this film repeats the same formula that we already know. Despite this, it far exceeded my expectations. I felt that the jokes are much better and funnier than those of previous films, including the first one. The sexual load is still present, but it has been reduced and the dialogues are the best so far. Honestly, for me, this was the movie that I liked the most in the franchise, so far.",/review/rw1343934/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2006,j-douglasbagley,5," Reassuringly Funny
","Having seen all three previous Scary Movies I was well informed as to what to expect from the film, yet I wasn't at all bored with the film. I found my self chuckling out loud for the entirety of the movie. Some of the gags in the film were really quite funny, especially the Brokeback Mountain sketch between ""Mahalik"" and ""CJ"" was particularly funny. some of the apparently off the cuff humour was really quite enjoyable to watch including the banter between the above characters. Anna Faris was on usual form fulfilling her role as the ""female title fight boxer"", her missing swing at female opponent ""Mike Tyson""(busy biting ears) causing nearly everyone involved in the fight and the crowd, to almost majestically, break their necks, leaving Cindy distraught and full of guilt. The overall length of the movie was quite short but I felt that it was just the right time, any longer and perhaps my interest would have been lost. The Tom Cruise character in the film was OK but his face was rather annoying sometimes, and they even managed to get in a contractual Michael Jackson kiddie fiddler crack. Overall I thought the performances were good and was a quality addition to the Scary Movie franchise.",/review/rw1343934/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2006,scyker,8," Scary Movie
","I'll admit, that scary movie four seems kind of run down after the first ones, but you people are being moronic about it. First off, the movie is supposed to make fun of other horror movies as much as possible. That's the point. Second, it was a good movie. You don't have to be a die hard fan to like it. It had really funny scenes and they went about it the right way. If they see a good joke, they use it. That's the way it's suppose to be done. It's a good comedy movie. I hope there's more in the end. Because this series, unlike other movies with their billions of pointless sequels, can continue as long as there are more horror movies. Don't call the humor into question just because the title of the movie ends with a four. Comedy and horror are disappearing and aren't as good as they used to be. These movies are a great idea. Don't let good ideas disappear. I was laughing right up until the end. Don't let this movie pass you by. The whole point of the new characters is that the movie gets new life. They've done what you asked, sit back and enjoy.",/review/rw1343934/?ref_=tt_urv

6 April 2006,Dashryder56,8," Hilarious, but way too much in it
","It is a refreshing comedy to see, as the other scary movies, yet this film is much different than the others. There is not as much of the David Zucker ""one liners"" you would expect, a hint of the Wayans brothers mixed in, and a lot of the jokes run flat. One of the key problems with the film was that they tried to mix too many parodies into it, which took away from the story, and at times seemed just like one big jumble of plot lines and stories.",/review/rw1343934/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2007,mstomaso,4," Ever Feel as if You are Living in a Scary Movie with a Bad Script?
","Scary Movie adds a new element to the usual *** Movie formula - reality. A few scenes from the Dubya administration's history are reproduced, and an embarrassing moment from Mr Cruise's midlife crisis are re-lived in addition to the usual spoofs of various horror and sci fi films. The Dubya scenes, nicely done by Leslie Nielson, were the highlights of the film for me. I'm not a fan of brainless comedy, but this non-formula material made the film tolerable for me.

4 May 2006,Robert_duder,6," Check your brain at the door....of course...and you'll be fine
","As a self proclaimed hater of spoof films (sorry everyone) I did go to see Scary Movie 4. Maybe I am building a tolerance to the stupidity, and overblown jokes, and stupidity...did I say that?? Scary Movie 4 wasn't so bad...in fact I might even say it was the same as the first three...no better, no worse and I think that is an achievement for the fourth installment in a series that hasn't changed it's star or it's jokes at all. You can't...absolutely CAN'T go into it expecting true witty comedy...Scary Movie isn't pretentious, it never tries to do that, Scary Movie 4 is exactly what it has always been, forced references to big movies, stupid physical gags using poorly made dummies, and the dumbest jokes you could possibly think of...AND a good thing...wrought full of cameos.",/review/rw1343934/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2006,Coventry,2," How do they continue to get worse?
","The concept of the ""Scary Movie""-series is beginning to look more like a tragedy instead of a comedy. The first film was a very entertaining hit because it really felt like a silly idea that started as a joke between brothers but unexpectedly turned into a huge success. The second already sucked because it had to be written in a very short time and this showed. Then the third entry in the series promised some improvement, with the change of director to David Zucker, but it was every bit as disappointing. The fourth part simply continues the trend and presents a spitfire of inane gags, dumb characters and completely uninspired satire. The plots of pretty much every successful recent horror and Sci-Fi movie of the past few years are tacky blend together into one giant ridiculous storyline. Cindy Campbell, ""heroine"" of the previous three films, encounters in one day all the horrors of ""Saw"", ""The Village"", ""War of the Worlds"", ""The Grudge"", ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""The Amityville Horror"". In between, there's even some time left to radically spoof ""Brokeback Mountain"" and even Tom Cruise's idiotic behavior on the couch at Oprah's show. The humor is crude, vulgar and totally tasteless, yet this doesn't bother me at all. The fact that it's also not at all funny irritates me a lot more. The only couple of modest chuckles are provided by good old regular Leslie Nielsen as the nearly senile President of the United States. It doesn't look like the ""Scary Movie"" crew plans to stop making sequels any time soon, so we're all doomed to see many more of these inept turds. Now, I know what you're thinking! ""If you're so annoyed by these movies, then simply stop watching them!"". And you're right, too!",/review/rw1343934/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2006,RHPSvegas,1," Painful!
","Aside from the president in the classroom bit that so accurately depicted exactly how Bush handled the news of 9/11, this was an inept waste of celluloid! Anna Farris (sp?) can be funny, but she doesn't need to try very hard in this - there's not much for her to work with. It was interesting to see Dr. Phil willingly take self-deprecating humor, and Debra Wilson is a comedy goddess (I miss her on MadTV), but other than that the laughs ran so thin that sometimes it was hard to tell if they were making fun of other movies or just getting some more use out of left-over sets. I want my $9.50 back! This isn't even a popcorn ""I can just sit back and laugh"" movie. It is a total waste with ""in jokes"" casually mentioning myspace and ""lovely lady lumps"" but without any substance or even the faintest hint of a plot.",/review/rw1343934/?ref_=tt_urv
