5 July 2006,bob the moo,," A solid genre movie that builds a good atmosphere and tension across the 90 minutes even if it isn't anything that special
","Sean Murphy and his crew are the top salvage experts in the land (well, sea). They have just completed one big job when a pilot, Jack Ferriman, comes tot them with a ship that he has spotted in remote, international waters. It hasn't responded to distress signals and it seems fair game if Murphy will give Jack a cut and let him come along. Murphy accepts and they set off. The fact that the ship doesn't show up on radar doesn't ring any alarm bells with the crew, who board the ship to find a deserted vessel ripe for the pickings. However she has sustained damage and has days before she will sink forever. Diver Maureen spotted a young girl on board is only the first of several strange things to occur and soon the crew find themselves in deeper than they planned.",/review/rw8268564/?ref_=tt_urv

","The savage team of a tug is ready to rest after the transportation of a platform. When they are celebrating in a bar, the plane pilot Jack Ferriman (Desmond Harrington) offers them the chance of rescuing a passenger vessel vanished in the oceans in 1962. Captain Sean Murphy (Gabriel Byrne), Maureen Epps (Julianna Margulies) and the rest of the crew, tempted by the possibility of a great reward, decides to risk one more rescue operation before going home. Their greed leads them, of course, to a ghost ship, where they are spooked and threatened by ghosts. One of them, a little girl, shows Epps what happened to the passengers and crew during the voyage in 1962. A horrible unraveled secret will haunt the rest of the crew.

","I'm rather pleasantly surprised after seeing Ghost ShipI expected it to be a lot sillier, more dumb and inferior than it actually is. Still a long way from being a good horror film but a step in the right direction, to say the least. Cast and crew paid attention to building up a horrifying atmosphere instead of attacking the audience with lame and violent killing scenes. That's an effort that gets my appreciation. The vicious opening sequence is professional horror a scene that grabs you by the throat and demands your complete attention and curiosity for the rest of the movie. The high quality level is held up a little while longer but unfortunately it loses his grip during the second half. For as long as the mysterious, deserted ship is portrayed as a complete riddle, the film is fascinating, interesting and beautifully shot. As soon as a few plot-aspects are clarified, Ghost Ship turns into a mediocre and predictable thrillerI'm convinced that, with a slightly more intelligent script, this could have become one of the better horror-thrillers since the new Millennium. Now, it's only regarded as a reasonable and decent effort that lacks a bit of talent. Nonetheless, the settings and decors make it worth watching. The graphic decorations aren't overused, so it remains a beautiful experience to observe at least once. Gabriel Byrne is acting far below his normal standards and yet he's still great! All the other cast-members are pretty uninspired and forgettable. I'd describe Ghost Ship as a nice waste of time. If you have the opportunity, I advise you to search for an 80's horror title called `Death Ship'a terrific piece of trash of which Ghost Ship borrowed a lot of ideas.",/review/rw8268564/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2019,UniqueParticle,9," Atmospheric awesome horror that I love a lot!
",The cast is so great and so is the style of cinematography; lots of murky gross scenery to appreciate! Karl Urban and Gabriel Byrne are a delight. So much of the bulk of the film is definitely horror I don't know why a few said it's not. I really like the scene when a couple of the guys eat and unlike others I really like the ending - Ghost Ship is fantastic for what it is! Has some of the best horror sequences in my opinion highly effective!,/review/rw8268564/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2004,dbdumonteil,6," an honest horror movie. Starring Gabriel Byrne
","The third movie produced by the production company ""Dark Castle"" and managed by Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis, ""Ghost Ship"" (2002) marks a step forward and constitutes a neat improvement in comparison with the two previous movies, ""the House on the Haunted Hill"" (1999) and ""13 Ghosts"" (2001). This can be checked at the level of a meticulous making and quite outstanding special effects. It is all the more positive as with ""Ghost Ship"", we deal with a B movie. Another good point: the change of scenery. It is a judicious choice to have replaced the threadbare topic of the haunted house by the haunted ship.",/review/rw8268564/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2016,Sleepin_Dragon,9," Never dance on a ship!!
","Ghost Ship will forever be one of my favourite films in the horror genre, it has so much going for it, for starters the ship itself makes for a far more interesting setting then the usual and obligatory haunted house. The special effects, even to this day look really good, as do the sets, it has a quality look about it. Solid acting throughout, an unusual choice for Gabriel Byrne. It has some fine scares, coupled with some powerful imagery, not least the scene where Katie shows Ebbs the true events. I love the story line, it has a bit more depth then the usual batch of horrors, but the main bit where it scores highly is atmosphere, bucket loads of it, so its a little reminiscent of Event Horizon, that doesn't detract from what is a very good film.",/review/rw8268564/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2003,zetes,5," Half and half
","Now this I would call exactly an average film. For me, it landed precisely at the very center of imdb's 10 point scale, right at 5.5. This means that I found exactly as much to like as I did to dislike. There is a bit of inspiration here, but just as much that's stolen from other better horror movies. If it had opted for tone and real fear instead of cheap shocks, the movie could have been great. The story is good enough that it could have been great if handled well. But we do live in these times, and, although there are scholars of the modern era who would try to have us believe that the current generation consists of a bunch of kids who get everything instantly and process it on a billion levels at once, the truth is indeed the exact opposite. No, there is no subtlety here. It would go over your average teenager's head in a heartbeat. Nope, better play it safe and provide us with a gruesome scene up front where a couple of dozen people are sliced in half by a loose cable during a ball. Gore is not scary. I did however produce a dry heave during this sequence, which is more than I can say for any other gore scene that I've viewed lately. As the gore accumulates, I began to appreciate the artistry that was put into the enormous number of deaths. These are some sickeningly creative people, let me tell you. Unfortunately, the director (or screenwriters or whoever) ruins any real potential by revealing every detail about what happened on the titular boat in a fast-motion sequence accompanied by techno music! It's the kind of moment where you just slap your head for the lack of talent involved. And then there was more stuff I liked. For example, the art direction is very impressive. The revelation of one character's identity, while not particularly surprising, is at least somewhat new. I give this film a 5/10, rounding down because I felt the final moment was a bit groan-inducing.",/review/rw8268564/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2004,susanxx,7," forget that cruise you always wanted!
","This films best bits are in the special effects and those moments when you jump out of your seat. The opening sequence lulls you into a false sense of calm, from then on its guess the scenario.  The viewer is always two steps ahead of the actors but, for the most, grips you nevertheless. The special effects are especially good and the acting, although no top-notch stars are evident, is not bad. The end is a real twist. Better to watch this than many others I could mention, certainly worth the video rental and a pizza.",/review/rw8268564/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2003,sherlock_2040,6," Interesting movie that had more potential (Contains Spoilers)
","Spoiler Alert! I love Dark Castle entertainment, I didn't love 13 Ghosts, but I did really enjoy House on Haunted Hill. I loved the original HoHH, and I thought the 'remake' was inventive and had some unique parts to it. It wasn't brilliant, but the special effects were beautiful and the sets were magnificent.",/review/rw8268564/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2004,CharltonBoy,6," Not quite a sinking ship
","Ghost Ship is by no means the worst horror i have ever seen in fact some parts of this film are quite entertaining, the problem seems to be some of the poor digital computer special affect that make this film look like a bit of a B Movie. Some of the affects are good expecially the opening scene where we see the crewe of the ship killed by a steel rope.The acting is ok and the characters are good so that when they are picked off one by one ,you care. There are a lot of question left unanswered though and in stages the scenes apear to have been put in any old order . If you like Horror and dont want a film you have to think about too much then i sugest you give this a go. 6 out of 10.",/review/rw8268564/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2006,preppy-3,5," Atmospheric
","OK ghost story. The movie starts off with a VERY gruesome bloody opening with a whole ship full of people being killed in 1962. It then cuts to present day (well--2002) where a salvage crew is led to a deserted vessel (the same one from the beginning) and find there's something inside that wants them. Dead bodies are discovered, doors open and close (and lock) by themselves and a creepy girl ghost watches over all of it.",/review/rw8268564/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2009,BA_Harrison,7," Set sail for terror.
","It's all aboard for spooky thrills and gory spills in Ghost Ship, a slick supernatural horror from director Steve Beck (who brought us the equally polished Thir13en Ghosts) that launches itself at full steam ahead with a particularly memorable opening scene—an entire room of cruise-ship passengers are graphically sliced in half when a metal cable whips across the dance-floor.",/review/rw8268564/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2009,Tweekums,7," Creepy but not really scary
","While this isn't a great film it wasn't terrible either. It suffers somewhat from having an opening scene which is the most shocking in the whole film; after seeing all but one person dancing on a ship's deck sliced in half by a cable it is hard to produce more action of that level. I think it would have been better to save this scene for later in the film, we saw part of it again in flashback later anyway.",/review/rw8268564/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2006,Lechuguilla,," Ship Of Fools
","With visions of riches spinning in their heads, a group of irritating boat salvagers set out to explore what's left of a luxurious passenger ship lost for over forty years on the high seas. Given that this film is a horror flick, the viewer understands from the beginning that the ship has an array of spooky surprises waiting for our adventurous fools.",/review/rw8268564/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2004,movieguy1021,5," Ghost Ship: 5/10
","Finally, a breath of fresh air. There's been downpours of such ""horror"" films like Darkness Falls, They, and Secret Window, and it's nice to see a movie that sets up its characters in a chilling manner, slowly letting us get to like them, and then the horror turning on us in a subtle yet horrifying manner that gives us nightmares. The movie I'm talking about hasn't actually come out yet, and will probably never be released. I'll bet you thought I was talking about Ghost Ship, right? Ghost Ship is not a movie like that; in fact, it's the complete opposite of what horror films were in their peak in the 70s and 80s. That doesn't automatically mean it's a terrible film. It's just not great.",/review/rw8268564/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2006,davidwarner_za,7," Does enough, could be better
","Well, not bad. Not great, but not bad. I am a big fan of horror movies that aren't all about the horror but are more about a good, well thought out storyline. Think ""Sixth Sense"". While Ghost Ship pales in comparison, it has enough elements in it that satisfies me for me to give it a thumbs up, albeit a hesitant one.",/review/rw8268564/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2020,Just-A-Girl-14,6," Mediocre

17 April 2014,ogdendc,8," Genuinely horrific with great special effects
",The film commences with (almost) an entire complement of passengers and crew on a 1960s cruise ship being sliced in half by a cable. It's dramatic and horrible. Then we switch to the 'present day' where things slow down.,/review/rw8268564/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2017,prolelol,7," Good ghost story!
","OK, ghost story. Not great movie, but it's enough solid that could have been great if it has a good script and I think this film looks like a bit of a B movie. The story and twist are good enough. I loved the opening scene, it was unexpectedly good. That scene was the only good thing about it and it's almost like they used their entire budget in that scene. The acting is OK and I didn't care for any characters except Emily Browning's ghost character which she was really likable. But overall, it was just an okay film with good story. I'd give it a 6.5/10.",/review/rw8268564/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2007,poolandrews,7," Decent haunted ship horror film.
","Ghost Ship starts as Artic weather patrol pilot Jack Ferriman (Desmond Harrington) approaches Captain Sean Murphy (Gabriel Byrne) & his crew of professional salvager's, Jack says that while flying his route over a remote part of the Bering sea he spotted a huge seemingly abandoned ship & that if they cut him in on the salvage money he'll show them where it is. Murphy & his crew agree & they set sail, they find the boat which happens to a huge Italian cruise liner called the Antonia Graza which mysteriously disappeared in 1962 without trace. As salvage the Antonio Graza is worth a fortune so they quickly set about getting back to dock, however in an accident their own boat is blown to pieces so they are stuck on the Antonia Graza. To make matters worse it has a huge hole in it & will sink within a few days, then there's the strange ghostly goings on which become ever more unpleasant & deadly as the truth behind the ship's dark past is revealed...",/review/rw8268564/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2002,movies2u,9," The Best and Scariest Movie That I Have Seen In A Great While.
","(***Contains Spoilers***) Okay, just to say, Ghost Ship has one of the gruesomest opening sequences I've ever seen. It's really weird because as the opening credits are rolling, there is this happy music playing (the music from the song Francesca is singing), and the credits are this hot pink color and are in this fancy writing, and the next thing you know, people are being sliced up by a cable and their bodies are splitting and falling apart. I thought that that was pretty creative though, just to sort of trick you in a way. I almost thought I was at the wrong theater. Steve Beck has a unique way of giving a good feeling to his movies, but in a scary way. Like Thirteen Ghosts, with all those flashes and images of ghosts. But, yes, the opening sequence was very gruesome. The acting in this film was very good, with Julianna Margulies (TV's ER), Gabriel Byrne (Stigmata), and Desmond Harrington (who reminded me of and looks a lot like Edward Norton). Everyone there did a very well job. I think that after this, Julianna Margulies should move more into movies than television. One thing I really liked about this film was that it was very original. I mean, you don't see a haunted ocean liner movie much. It's usually the normal teen slasher movies, which some are okay, but they can get old. Mark Hanlon's story was brilliant though. Ghost Ship is probably the scariest movie of 1999-2002, besides The Ring which was also really scary. The only one thing that disappointed me a slight bit was the ending. At the ending, Jack (Desmond Harrington) is seen by Julianna Margulie's character when she is taken into the ambulence car. He is seen taking the gold onto another ship and then she screams and the credits roll??? I had wished the ending had just been that Maureen had gotten into the ambulence and was saved. But, they left it open for an optional sequel. I don't know if they will make one or they just wanted to let you know that evil can't die, which is portrayed in a lot of horror movies, such as in the Halloween series. All in all, I think that Ghost Ship was very well done and is extremely underrated. Any horror fan has to see this film. I give Ghost Ship a 9 out of 10.",/review/rw8268564/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2005,philip_vanderveken,6," Too bad about those last 30 minutes.
","The oceans of this world still keep a lot of secrets for themselves. We are able to fly to the moon, but we don't know everything about our own planet yet. This is of course also the reason why there are so many mysterious stories and legends about ships, airplanes... that have vanished in the thin air (think of the Bermuda triangle). Is anything about those stories true? Perhaps, but probably not. But that doesn't mean of course that this can't be a good source of inspiration for a new movie.",/review/rw8268564/?ref_=tt_urv
