16 May 2022,Movie_Reviews,6," Totally unnecessary love plot
","The idea for the film is good and solid. However, it is diluted to the absurd with some weird menage a trois love plat that, if removed, would shorten the movie with a much needed half an hour.",/review/rw8136880/?ref_=tt_urv

11 May 2022,thinkMovies,4," Operation hamburger patty
","The main difference between The Man Who Never Was (1956) and this, Operation Mincemeat (2021), is that filmmakers seem to consider 21st century audiences dumb who need everything explained slowly to them. Or, perhaps the filmmakers are such simpletons as they presume their audience to be. Also, it seems that these days the facts, as intriguing as they may be, are not considered enough to make an interesting movie and therefore unnecessary embellishments with invented lies and subplots are deemed a must.",/review/rw8136880/?ref_=tt_urv

12 May 2022,Calicodreamin,6," We need a corpse

2 June 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,5," Absolute boredom.
","Yes, it was that dull, bloated and disengaging sloth of a film, where the dragged out 128 min runtime was filled with lots of unnecessary yappity-yap of boring dialogue and subplots, and the constant annoying clickety-clack of typewriters.",/review/rw8136880/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2022,phd_travel,5," Not as good as ""The Man Who Never Was""
","The Man Who Never Was, the old 1956 movie was much better in terms of focus of the story. Operation Mincemeat played up a silly romantic relationship between Montagu and Leslie played by Colin Firth and Kelly MacDonald. This was probably not true and feels contrived. The beginning is confusing because lots of mutterings with Colin Firth's mumbling hard to understand. Also Matthew McFayden's character's fuss about the dead body felt added on and trivial amidst the war.",/review/rw8136880/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2022,thejdrage,7," A really great story gone bad by a stupid ""love"" story

5 May 2022,hwg1957-102-265704,6," A bit disappointing
",The part of the film dealing with the actual operation is fine with good acting and a gripping narrative. Even when one knows historically that the landing in Sicily was a success in the film it still is a breathless moment when everyone is waiting for the news and all the tremendous effort leading up to that moment is effectively conveyed by the director. Unfortunately the movie is marred by the redundant romantic sub-plot which seems like it's from another film and makes the film longer than necessary. The addition of the corpse's fictional sister is also a mistake. It doesn't add anything apart from cheap pathos. The scriptwriter made what could have been a great film into a curate's egg. Disappointing.,/review/rw8136880/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2022,eddie_baggins,6," An unforgettable true story in a forgettable film
","Just in case there are those out there worried about Shakespeare in Love director John Madden's return to World War 2, fear not for the based on the true story Operation Mincemeat is far less cringe-inducing than his Nicolas Cage effort Captain Corelli's Mandolin as the Oscar nominated director ensures this wartime thriller with a difference is at all times engaging without ever being utterly gripping.",/review/rw8136880/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2022,masonsaul,8," Great WW2 drama
","It's surprisingly light-hearted at times despite the subject matter, which can be a bit too much but Operation Mincemeat is still a great WW2 drama that's witty, fun and suitably suspenseful with a fascinating fact based story to explore.",/review/rw8136880/?ref_=tt_urv

28 May 2022,info-80807,4," Fascinating real life story - turned into a soap opera
","They somehow managed to make one of the war's great operations boring. Terrible dialog and useless sub plots drag this out way too long. At times this resembled a group of high schoolers trying to sort out their lives while planning a dance. And, all the cute nods to James Bond were annoying.",/review/rw8136880/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2022,Joxerlives,9," A truly great film of the quiet heroes of the Second World War
","Truly excellent, the story of how deception played such a key part in the Allies victory. Uniformly terrific performances and a great plot, demonstrating the ""Wilderness of mirrors"" of intelligence work, you can never really be sure of what is real and what is not and have to continually balance one risk against another. The ruthlessness of when the corpse's sister shows up and you have to put your nobler feelings aside because what you're doing is so much more important than her grief at her brother's death, that if you don't carry on there will be thousands of more grieving siblings to mourn for. The heart-stopping scene where the German agent confronts the heroine and you have to consider whether or not to continue, not knowing if there really is an anti-Hitler faction in German intelligence or whether this is all a bluff to make her spill her guts (the fact that he leaves her alive suggests the former). The nagging fear of Communist infiltration which turn out to be 100% true with Philby, Burgess and co. The references to the true inspiration for the plot, ex-British Intelligence chief Basil Thomson (one of the prime architects of the IRA's defeat) and his story ""The Milner's Hat'. In truth the only reason I don't give it 10 out of 10 is that it somewhat exaggerates the impact of the scheme, had it not worked casualties in Sicily would have been far greater but it certainly wouldn't have affected the course of the war and there was no chance of a German invasion of Britain by 1943. But all told a classic spy story that I would recommend to anyone.",/review/rw8136880/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2022,mikerowerush-49063,4," Why ?
","""The Man Who Never Was"" is a brilliantly crafted British wartime drama that told a true story,although that film introduced an unnecessary subplot about a German spy,it was still a great example of classic British film making. Why anyone decided to remake it is baffling,the new version contains many subplots that in real life did not happen and the fact the the subject matter is over 70 years old then why wait so long to remake it and why deviate from the source material ?.....I suppose we should be thankful that the Americans did not do the remake,it would have ended up with THEM single handedly winning the war.",/review/rw8136880/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2022,jdesando,," One of the most exciting and consequential covert operations in WWII history.
","Operation Mincemeat is not an animation, but a straightforward, almost romantic depiction of a WWII covert operation, the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943, that began the downfall of Adolph Hitler. Churchill, having chased Rommel from N. Africa, now could pick Sicily or Greece to invade, and the Germans were fooled into thinking it would be Greece. By the way, that little plot saved tens of thousands of lives along the way.",/review/rw8136880/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2022,Chance_Boudreaux19,4," A story that could've been told as a short stretched to two hours
","The real life story is interesting and if it was told as a 60 minute episode of a WW2 documentary series I would be engaged. However, as a 2 hour movie this is a complete failure. Those 2 hours felt like 4 and I couldn't wait for it to wrap up. The main problem of this film is its boring cast of characters and their extremely dull sub-plots. Not for a moment did I care about what happens to any of them. There are some moments that can be considered somewhat exciting. When they happen You think that the film will start to get better but no, it quickly goes back to being mundane and uninspired.",/review/rw8136880/?ref_=tt_urv

12 May 2022,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,3," Snore
",The story meanders through what seems like endless subplots. It gets caught up in the minutiae of selecting a corpse and seems to lose focus on the greater story. The story just dragged on for much to long and then I stopped it halfway and started something else. The film could use some editing to cut a good half hour of the runtime.,/review/rw8136880/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2022,jboothmillard,7," Operation Mincemeat
","I watched the trailer for this war movie about maybe two months before its actual release, it looked like a fascinating fact-based story, and had a good cast of actors, so I was up for it, directed by John Madden (Shakespeare in Love, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel). Basically, set in 1943 during World War II, British Intelligence are devising a deception operation to keep the plans for the Allied invasion of Sicily secret. Naval intelligence officer Ewen Montagu (Colin Firth) and RAF (Royal Air Force) Flight Lieutenant Charles Cholmondeley (Matthew Macfadyen) have developed an outlandish but intricate plan they are sure will fool the Germans (Nazis) and disguise the invasion. The plan is to dress a corpse as a British officer, give him a fictitious but convincing identity, with personal items, and authentic looking documentation detailing a plan to invade Greece and Sardinia. Admiral John Godfrey (Jason Isaacs) is initially unconvinced that this plan could work, and it will need approval from Prime Minister Winston Churchill (Simon Russell Beale). Slowly however, the plan gets underway, as Montagu and Cholmondeley create an identity and backstory for the fake officer. They give him the name ""Captain (Acting Major) William Martin"", a common and almost undetectable name. Secretary Jean Leslie (Kelly Macdonald) is fascinated by the plan, named Operation Mincemeat (because of the body). She offers her services into creating a credible identity for the dead man, including using a photograph of herself as the man's lover. The most important part of the operation is to find a dead man, specifically who has recently died from drowning, and eventually they find their man. A man named Glyndwr Michael (Lorne MacFadyen), a tramp who died from eating rat poison, is ""recruited"" for the operation. There is a point when the mission could be stopped when it even starts, when the dead man's sister, Doris Michael (Gabrielle Creevy) identifies his body, but they convince her that his part in their hoax could save many lives. There is also concern that Montagu's brother, Ivor (Mark Gatiss) may be working alongside the enemy, after British intelligence have been tracking his movements and observing his behaviour. Montagu and his team are also unable to photograph the corpse for identity purposes, until Jean introduces them to her American friend, Sergeant Roger Dearborn (Lorne MacFadyen), who is the spitting image of the dead man, and may help them with a new photograph. Slowly, Montagu and Jean find themselves becoming attracted to each other, despite him being married to Iris (Hattie Morahan) and having two children. The operation is coming together, with Hester Leggett (Penelope Wilton) writing a love letter from the sham lover to the dead man, with an eye lash included in the envelope, and a black attaché case chained to his wrist containing the false papers from military authorities in London. Finally, ""William Martin"" is dressed in uniform, placed in an airtight canister, loaded aboard the submarine HMS Seraph, and dropped in the water near Spain. The decomposing corpse is discovered floating off the coast of Huelva, in southern Spain. British intelligence communicates with numerous phone calls claiming to have a lost an officer out at sea, knowing that the Germans are highly likely to be tapping and listening to their telephones. Germans becomes aware of the body washes ashore and use their spies to gain more information about the contents he was carrying. Montagu and the rest of the officers are anxious to find out if the Germans have indeed been fooled by their ruse. Eventually, William Martin is returned to Britain, and MoS (Ministry of Supply) expert Charles Fraser-Smith (James Fleet) investigates the fake letter. He confirms that there is evidence to suggest the wax seal was broken and repaired, indicating the letter was read. Sometime later, the British wait anxiously for a phone call indicating if German forces are moving and the situation with the Allies invading Sicily. Lieutenant Commander Ian Fleming (Johnny Flynn) is writing the events as the unfold for a future spy thriller (many aspects of the operation were the inspiration for James Bond). Eventually, the phone rings and it is confirmed that Sicily has been occupied, with very few casualties and little injured during. The deception and Operation Mincemeat are hailed as a success, and Montagu and Cholmondeley are commended for their service. William Martin was laid to rest in a cemetery of Nuestra Señora, in Huelva, Spain, and years later, after the revelation of the mission, his grave was marked with his real name, Glyndwr Michael, and his efforts in the war. Also starring Paul Ritter as Bentley Purchase, Nicholas Rowe as Captain David Ainsworth, Will Keen as Salvador Gomez-Beare, Alexander Beyer as Karl Kuhlenthal, Alex Jennings as John Masterman, Catastrophe's Mark Bonnar as Jock Horsfall, Poldark's Ruby Bentall as Connie Bukes, Nico Birnbaum as Colonel Alexis von Roenne, Markus von Lingen as Adolf Clauss, Rufus Wright as Lieutenant Bill Jewell, Caspar Jennings as Jeremy Montagu, and Dolly Gadsdon as Jennifer Montagu. Firth is good as the gentlemanly leader of the operation, with Macfadyen supporting him well, Macdonald is interesting, and Isaacs is fine. I was told a little about the real story, from the eyelash in the letter to the details of the homeless man chosen, the operation itself is engaging to see planned and unfolding, the characters interacting about the fictional life of their corpse is quirky but likeable, the tiny comedic moments add comic relief, and the period detail is splendid, it is a wonderfully written and performed stranger than fiction British story with gusto, a terrific war drama. Very good!",/review/rw8136880/?ref_=tt_urv
