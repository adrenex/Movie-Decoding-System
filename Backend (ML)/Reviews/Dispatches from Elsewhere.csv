8 March 2006,roghache,8," Unusual theme, unusual relationship, brilliantly done
","This is an unexpected pearl of a movie. Neither of the two stars, Shirley MacLaine or Nicholas Cage, are normally high on my list of favorites, but they pull off this odd ball relationship to perfection. There's chemistry here, just not in the usual sense of the word! It's a plot idea unlike any I've previously encountered...",/review/rw0340017/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2006,rustydog,8," A delightful movie with outstanding performances
","This perfect little gem of a movie deserves watching. With such a wonderful cast and such a great script, if this movie has any fault at all, it is under-appreciation. Shirley and Nick play off each other like the pros they are. The photography is on cue, the pace is keen and the underlying message of learning to love and care for what you have instead of squandering your energies on unrealistic ambitions is heart-warming. Among the many great moments are the calls from the President, Tess's temper tantrums, the scene at the opera, the ""stand-off"" in the car, and Tess's last scene from the hospital. I don't think this submission contains spoilers, but if they are, they're harmless. Please, please see this film.",/review/rw0340017/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2013,g-bodyl,8," Likable Film!
","Guarding Tess is a light, likable film that has good intentions and is easily entertaining. However, it is pretty forgettable and this film has similar themes and plot points as the much better film, Driving Miss Daisy. Both films are about a younger guy and an older woman going at it with each other before their relationship improved. But all in all, this is a good, light-hearted film.",/review/rw0340017/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2002,Tarasicodissa,," The scene in the bar...
","SPOILER: Like the earlier poster, the key in it is the scene in the bar. Prior to it Tess's son came to see her on Christmas Day, only because his probably shady business partners wanted to use her name on their project (which is doubtless the only reason they brought him on board). She smells a rat and refuses. She is forcibly confronted with the fact that she cannot trust her own son and aside from his occasional need to use her for his own financial advantage, they have no relationship (I guess it is hard to avoid feeling like an underachiever if you are the son of a president. Especially when you go through life trading on your last name the way I suspect Tess's son has. I loved the disappointment welling up in Tess's face as her son continued his obviously planned pitch. He had only come because he wanted something. She knew some scam, some manipulation was coming.).",/review/rw0340017/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2006,Smells_Like_Cheese,7," Very touching and has some comedic moments
","I have to admit, in some strange way, I enjoyed Guarding Tess very much. Despite it being predictable and they could have worked the comedy a little better, especially with Shirly, I think this was a decent little movie that anyone could enjoy. I think Shirly and Nicolas has very good chemistry. Nick also did a great performance for such a small movie, I felt for him so much in the end. You'll see what I mean on that part, I think we all could feel for him. It's just a nice movie that has some very heart touching moments, so I would recommend for a Saturday afternoon. I think you'll enjoy it.",/review/rw0340017/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2007,blanche-2,8," fun film, good acting
","Nicholas Cage is ""Guarding Tess"" in this 1994 film starring Shirley MacLaine, Austin Pendleton, Edward Albert, Richard Griffiths, and James Rebhorn. Shirley MacLaine is a much beloved ex-first lady who has Secret Service protection, and one of her protectees, Doug Chesnic (Cage) is thrilled when his round of duty is over. However, Tess makes a request of the president (her husband's vice president) to let Doug stay on a little longer. Annoyed, Doug starts standing up to her more, bringing on himself the wrath of the President of United States, who's sick of hearing from her. Doug and Tess finally start bonding - she in a way she could never do with her own son - and then something happens that threatens both of them in different ways.",/review/rw0340017/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 1999,dho-2,9," A good, old-fashioned comedy
","Guarding Tess is a film that relies on character and dialogue for its impact rather than flashy special effects or frenetic action. The humour is subtle rather than sledge-hammer, a rare achievement for a modern comedy.",/review/rw0340017/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2000,TxMike,," Nick Cage and Shirley MacLaine make this an enjoyable little movie.
","Somehow I had never gotten around to seeing ""Guarding Tess"" but did so this week on broadcast TV.  It starts with Nick Cage, playing a ""by the book"" Special Agent assigned to guard former first lady, Tess, ending his ""tour of duty"" and returning to D.C. Upon arrival he is informed that the president has personally requested that Cage return to Tess for another 3 years, because ""she likes him."" His choices were that, or be assigned to ""guard the president's dog!"" So he went back, to rural Ohio, combatant and bitter, because the old lady, whose husband had died of a heart attack, was very difficult to get along with.  Turns out she also had inoperable brain tumor which only her doctors know about, which complicated her demeanor.",/review/rw0340017/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2001,thirdi,10," Very funny movie, well worth it
","Although Nicolas Cage showed a new range and talent in ""Leaving Las Vegas"", I think it is roles like this one in ""Guarding Tess"" where he is at his best.  He plays a Secret Service agent who is having a frustrating time protecting the fiesty former first lady, Shirley McClain.  Lots of funny dialogue, the chemistry between the two is great.  ",/review/rw0340017/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2000,michaelRokeefe,5," Can't we try to get along? Sophisticated humor.
","This is a well written comedy. Some of it is dry, but very potent. The former First Lady Tess Carlisle is played to perfection by Shirley MacLaine. She has her own reasons for picking Doug Chesnic (Nicolas Cage)to head up her Secret Service security detail. Chesnic is puzzled and reluctant, because the former First Lady is not one of his favorite people.",/review/rw0340017/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 1999,lib-4,7," Who's watching the lady?
",This movie is a refeshing pause in Cage's over the top acting. He plays the foil for the ex first lady well- respectful but not cowering.  this is a film about loyalty and duty and most of all about having compassion for someone who is lonely.,/review/rw0340017/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2008,Siloty,9," very enjoyable
","When this movie was bought, I at first wasn't keen on watching it except because of Nicolas Cage I thought it might be alright.",/review/rw0340017/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2015,mark.waltz,7," He refuses to take her guff, and she loves it!
","Guarding the President of the United States is tough enough, but taking on a widowed former first lady can be shear hell on earth. Nicolas Cage gives one of his most vibrant performances as a special agent with the worst assignment possible: protecting Shirley MacLaine! Continuing her string of grumpy old women, it's gotten to the point to audiences don't know who the real MacLaine really is. Some eccentric student of the metaphysical or the grouchiest woman outside of Cinderella's step-mother. Certainty, ever since ""Terms of Endearment"", her characters have just gone from slightly cranky and cynical to downright mean. Sometimes, her characters just seem to get a huge thrill out of their nastiness.",/review/rw0340017/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2013,eric262003,8," Light Comedy-Drama Without Being Over-The-Top
","This is not the first time that we have seen Shirley McLaine play the role of a crusty old lady and in the 1994 movie ""Guarding Tess"" is no exception either. But it has me wondering, how many bitchy roles has McLaine played throughout her career? If you check out IMDb.com you will notice that she has played a myriad of cantankerous characters (the best being ""Terms of Endearment""), but no matter what she has played those roles flawlessly. Therefore, we can safely summarize that McLaine could have easily played her part as widowed ex-First Lady Tess Carlisle with her eyes closed.",/review/rw0340017/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2007,whpratt1,6," Great Entertaining Film
","Nicolas Cage, (Doug Chesnic) plays the role of a Secret Service Agent and is assigned to protecting a former First Lady, Tess Carlisle, (Shirley MacLaine) who is a very difficult First Lady to protect and is stubborn about who protects her and she simply does not like Doug Cbesnic but for some reason considers him like her son. Tess's son has nothing to do with his mother and Tess seems to take things out on her Secret Agent Doug, treating him like her son. No one seems to be able to please Tess and there are plenty of comedy and great chemistry that exists between Nicolas Cage and Shirley MacLaine and this makes the film a great success. Enjoy.",/review/rw0340017/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2007,xredgarnetx,6," OK comedy drama
","GUARDING TESS takes a crochety, ailing, widowed former First Lady (MacClaine) and one very reluctant Secret Service agent (Cage) and pairs them on a path that spells almost certain doom for one of them. She can't get along with anyone, including her grown son who ignores her. And Cage just can't get along with her. Naturally, over time, they form a strong bond. Then the unexpected happens. Their world is turned upside down when she is kidnapped. The movie shifts into high melodrama at this point and never lets up until the end. The music begins to thunder down on us, Cage badly overacts, mostly yelling and bellowing, and the film almost goes off the rails. Austin Pendleton hams it up as the First Lady's neurotic driver, and frankly he's not very good in this one. A mostly entertaining little movie that soon enough gets too big for its britches. See it and decide for yourself.",/review/rw0340017/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2015,vincentlynch-moonoi,7," Decent, not outstanding
","I know that when most movies start (or for that matter, most books), it takes time to ""set things up"". But honestly, this film is downright boring for almost the first half. After all, we all know where this film is going...at least generally; either there will be an assassination plot against her or a kidnapping, or some life-threatening event.",/review/rw0340017/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2012,The-Sarkologist,7," Independence is not always independence
","Having just read a section of the book Camera Politica, the idea of reaction against feminism has been on my mind. Some of the movies of the early eighties was much a reaction against feminism and the rebuilding of the patriarchal society. Guarding Tess is a movie that falls into this category, though it was released in the early 90's. Guarding Tess is a reaction to is the woman's desire for individuality.",/review/rw0340017/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 1999,DMMII0,10," Great Movie
","A well written, well acted movie. Highly under rated and under appreciated. Great characters, great dialogue. Cage and MacLaine are excellent. I am normally no fan of MacLaine. See this movie and enjoy!",/review/rw0340017/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2007,ccthemovieman-1,6," Appealing Story With Only One Fault
",This was an entertaining film ruined only by one thing. It was a light-hearted comedy without a lot of big laughs but a lot of little ones and had a pleasing overall feel to it.,/review/rw0340017/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2007,leighsaavedra,9," A unique and memorable relationship grows between a former first lady and the secret service man who helps protect her.
","This should not be a spoiler except in terms of flavor; this fine film brings me back to ""Driving Miss Daisy."" A reluctant secret service agent (Cage) is forced to renew his term for ""guarding"" a moody, very bright, usually difficult former first lady. From an infinite number of quickly subdued facial expressions, inhalations, and rare comments, we see that Tess (the former first lady) is a complicated character, built of far more complex material than that which has created simply a tiresome, demanding and spoiled lady finding herself in old age without having prepared for the life she has now.",/review/rw0340017/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2022,planktonrules,8," Amazingly different.
","I have reviewed a ton of movies. And, because of that, I have noticed a real sameness about most movies. So, it's really nice to find a film that has a plot that is very original and difficult to predict like ""Guarding Tess"". It's a film with comedic and dramatic elements...and it's well worth seeing.",/review/rw0340017/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2018,seeingbystarlight,10," ""It's the worst job in the Secret Service.""

21 February 2021,TwistedContent,6," Their Chemistry Truly Makes the Movie
","As I'm choosing which is going to be the 53rd Nicolas Cage romp for me to see, I'm thinking old-school throwback comedies just can't go wrong... And, surely enough, they don't. ""Guarding Tess"" is a dramedy with a good, solid heart that lies in the unprecedented chemistry between Nicolas Cage and Shirley MacLaine. A well familiar tale with some peculiar oddities, and an uneven nature.",/review/rw0340017/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2002,Captain Ken,10," Outstanding Film with Wit and Humor
",Shirley has done it again. What a great film. The relationship between her and the Secret Service agent is excellent... The ways she tricks them call for great writing. I enjoyed each moment of this film I just wonder what First Lady Shirley was copying ???? See it to find out. It is a gem,/review/rw0340017/?ref_=tt_urv
