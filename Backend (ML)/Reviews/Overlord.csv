28 January 2023,Supermanfan-13,8," I found it entertaining!
","I actually liked The Book of Boba Fett more than I expected to. After reading all the mixed reviews I didn't think it would be that good but I'm definitely on the side that think it's worth watching! The only thing wrong with it is the casting could be better. Temeura Morrison (Boba Fett) and Ming-Wa Wen (Fennec) both look out of place, you get used to it after a while but they should of chose better actors. They're just not that believable as bad asses when they fight, both being 60+ years old doesn't help. I still liked the story though and looking forward to another season! If you're a Star Wars fan or even just a sci-fi fan then you should give this a try.",/review/rw7854401/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2023,DiCaprioFan13,8," Worth Watching!
","The Book of Boba Fett was better than I thought it would be. It follows bounty hunter Boba Fett (Temuera Morrison) and mercenary Fennec Shand (Ming-Na Wen) as they run the underworld of Jabba the Hutt's old territory on the sands of Tatooine. After reading all the mixed reviews I didn't think it would be that good but while not as good as The Mandalorian, it's absolutely worth watching! The only thing wrong with it is the casting could be better. Temeura Morrison and Ming-Wa Wen both look a little old and out of place, you get used to it after a while but they should of chose better actors. They're just not that believable as bad asses when they fight, both being 60+ years old doesn't help. I still liked the story though and looking forward to another season!",/review/rw7854401/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2022,WatchAndSmile,4," Expensive Spin Off of a boring Story

27 January 2022,ConnorAsher,6," IN AN EXTREMELY SLOW GALAXY FAR FAR AWAY
","Alright, we're currently 5 episodes in and it just isn't getting better... the pacing is so incredibly slow and at the end of every episode, I'm constantly finding myself say ""...wait?! That's it?!"".",/review/rw7854401/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2022,spasek,5," The Most Feared Bounty Hunter Is Now a Wuss
","Anyone who remembers Boba Fett from the films recalls the reputation of the most feared bounty hunter in the galaxy. A bounty hunter who had Wookie pelts on his belt. A bounty hunter who would do whatever it took to get the job done. He was nobody's friend. Even Han Solo's priceless reaction in ROTJ at the Sarlacc pit of, ""Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?!"" tells you the kind of character he was.",/review/rw7854401/?ref_=tt_urv

17 February 2022,rdvljunk,3," Silly
","Although the series start interesting enough, the first 3 episodes, the writers seem to loose it more and more into the show. Certainly the introduction of Cad Bane is hilariously silly. But also the end of E7 is ridiculous. Yes I know they try to reference to old movies, but come-on. Has star wars become comedy? Yes maybe. A hero, with no armour, gets shots several times without dying. But when he gets shot in the foot he starts limping and requires rescuing. Only to run away without a problem in the text shot. Ofcourse, as usual in star wars, the bad guys drop like flies with a single shot.",/review/rw7854401/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2022,Habibi-Universe,4," The Insane Castration Of An Iconic Character
","Who asked for this show? Actually... a lot of people. In retrospect it would have been better if we hadn't gotten it at all since they completely destroyed the identity of the beloved Boba Fett character making him soft, weak, incompetent and just damn stupid! What started off as an interesting character in The Mandalorian quickly became a joke when he got his own show. You would think that that's when the character would blossom right? Oh, how wrong you are!",/review/rw7854401/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2022,hnt_dnl,1," Awful show
","This rating is based solely on the actual five episodes of Boba Fett 1-4 and 7 content in Season 1. The two ""Mandalorian"" episodes 5 and 6 shouldn't count since the showrunners just shoved in a completely different story to pad the season and give it some semblance of decency. I've been hard on The Mandalorian series and despite the fact that I think it's mediocre, it's way better than whatever this Boba Fett show is. On the Mando show, the writers and directors kept things simple and got to the point. The plot was clear: Mando protects Grogu and goes on sidequests while learning about Grogu's force powers and seeks out Jedi to take the baby off his hands. Of course, this show negated all of that since by the end of it, Grogu is back with Mando, which erases the entire main plot of Season 2 of Mando. But I digress. This review is about THE BOOK OF BOBA FETT.",/review/rw7854401/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2022,rsvp321,," All that's missing is Jar Jar, and a trombone playing a few comical ""wha wha whaaa""s
","Three eps in, and a boring plot that drags on and on - Boba trying to be recognized and respected, and he continues to just look lame.",/review/rw7854401/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2023,madroscoe-53570,8," The Bible (not really)
","I think that it would make a great replacement for Star Trek in the way that each episode addresses something different, honestly: multiple times I got that feeling from it. I thought it was good as far as TV shows go. And really the only thing that detracted from the episodic feeling of the show was that I had every episode to watch on my phone. I thought it was pretty good.",/review/rw7854401/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2022,ebeckstr-1,5," Not so good
","Intriguing and fun moments throughout the seven episodes cannot save this ponderous, portentous, aimless series. Even the ""surprise"" appearance of what's his name is so poorly written as to be boring. It takes some really weak writing to ruin a show with such potential.",/review/rw7854401/?ref_=tt_urv

4 May 2022,Johnny_West,5," Boba Boring
","Boba Fett's life story is told in this series, thanks to incredibly boring flashbacks. Action, there is very little. All that was cool about Boba Fett is gone. Now you get to see him out of his armor, and he is a flabby middle-aged man. He looks like Uncle Fester from the Addams Family TV series.",/review/rw7854401/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2022,deepfrieddodo,6," Boba Fett through the Disney Filter
","The Book of Boba Fett surpasses the development of character arcs and providing depth to previous canon, in such a way that it removes a lot of the mystery.",/review/rw7854401/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2022,mochteam,8," The Mandalorian Redeemed this for me!
",Boba Fett is an old man that losses every battle and needs everyone to help him get things done. Series was OK but it fell short of the excitement the Mandalorian series had..that is until the Mandalorian showed up!,/review/rw7854401/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2022,eunbi0530,5," A Disney production that feels like an amateur project
","Boba Fett is regarded with high praise for decades, a legion of fans of Star Wars have found the Mandalorian mercenary one of the coolest characters despite it being from a series where the protagonists are supposed to be the Jedi knights. After the success of the previous two seasons of the Mandalorian TV show, Disney did the right thing by having a whole series dedicated to Boba, however this series isn't what fans would have expected. I mean we have old fans of Boba, we have new fans of Boba (for when he appeared on Mandalorian), and yet Disney managed to produce something that bad?",/review/rw7854401/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2022,santerixdxd,5," 5/7 episodes in just showcases how Boba doesn't work
","(Spoilers)
After 5 episodes it's crystal clear why Boba Fett doesn't work in his own show. It feels like the character is way too passive, things just happen and he reacts, it should be the other way around, he should be actively driving the story forward. This flaw showcases itself in chapter five, where we follow Din Djarin instead of Boba, he is an active protagonist, constantly driving the story forward and it makes you want to see more from him. In the end, this show just makes you want to watch the season 3 of the Mandalorian, instead of the Book of Boba Fett.",/review/rw7854401/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2022,actionfigurepodcastyt,9," Most Fun Star Wars Show Yet
","I initially watched this not expecting a whole lot. This show really surprised me. First off the casting was excellent. Some actors who really stood out were Corey Burton, Phil Lamar, and Temuera Morrison. But where the show really shines is the writing. There are so many parallels to Return of the Jedi and Attack of the clones, but the show did well balancing fan service while still holding a solid original story, which was surprising since this show is a The Mandalorian spin off. The Tusken Raider episodes were some of the best episodes of Star Wars yet. There are so many different themes for this show, but the two big ones are the passage of time, and overcoming your past. The special effects were spot on, some of the best I've seen in a long time. If you like the Mandalorian, I definitely would try watching this show. It's pretty short and chances are it could really surprise you. Don't listen to the negative reviews, just try it for yourself! Some say they don't like the humor, but I thought it was a pretty serious show, maybe not as serious as Andor, but it's about on par with the Mandalorian. It's definitely an interesting and fun show from beginning to end!",/review/rw7854401/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2022,utathya,6," Odd combination of Very Good, Good, Mediocre, Bad and Awful!
","A TRUELY SPECTACULAR finale of an otherwise lackluster series. Don't get me wrong, some episodes were good, but some were very mediocre and even bad. The series picked up pace after the arrival of Mando but the beginning part of the series was SLOW, BORING AND STRAIGHT OUT BAD to a certain extent.",/review/rw7854401/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2022,Tweetienator,3," Boba Dreck
","A terrible show - Boba Fett has nothing to do with the real Boba Fett. Anyway, childish story, weak characters and almost unbearable dialogues make The Book of Boba Fett one of the weakest entries of Disney to the Star Wars universe to the day, only matched by that bad Han Solo movie and all those silly animation shows for kids.",/review/rw7854401/?ref_=tt_urv

","While it was pretty decent, what in the world is up with those annoyingly slow 50s era looking bike things? Those are not Star Wars. They were completely irrelevant and derpy. Don't bring those back please. In fact, they should write out the entire colorful bio-mechanic crew. They do not belong either.",/review/rw7854401/?ref_=tt_urv
