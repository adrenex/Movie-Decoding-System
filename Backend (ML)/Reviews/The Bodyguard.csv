26 November 2018,treborquest,9," Why cancel such an amazing show
","I absolutely fell in love with this show and that doesn't happen very often. It is well written, funny, has great acting, an original storyline. What's wrong here? I guess marketing? It is such a shame to see something this good being cancelled, because it didn't get the platform other series got. I'm very happy with the two seasons that have been released, but I have to say I'm sad, I was so looking forward to season 3.",/review/rw5098761/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2016,phd_travel,10," Michelle Dockery has won me over
",Not since Breaking Bad has a series caught my attention from the beginning. It's amazing how scary and tense and funny it has been in 3 episodes. The story is unpredictable and original and the lead character gets sympathy from the outset.,/review/rw5098761/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2016,drjgardner,8," Good Behavior is more than Good
","I'm not sure that another TV series or film about low life psychopaths is really needed. In just the first episode we've seen killing, shooting, stabbing, vomiting, robbery, prostitution, and drug taking. We've got a husband who wants to kill his clueless wife, a mother who lost all visitation rights to her child, a mother who hates her daughter, and a well-meaning but incompetent parole officer. Through it all the self-help tapes of the main character ask her to be all she can be.",/review/rw5098761/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2016,gradyharp,10," First class new series
","Chad Hodge and Blake Crouch have created what is becoming one of the finest series on television. Exceptional sensitivity to good vs. evil and attempting to define which is which, and the manner in which two bright and talented people who have tainted pasts work out their lives in crime is unnervingly well acted by a brilliant cast.",/review/rw5098761/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2016,RockyMtnVideo,8," Dark, Seductive, and in the best Film Noir tradition
","I was not familiar with the books, on which this was based, so I was a bit stunned, early on, when this took a hard, right turn, into territory that you might not typically expect for TNT. I was stunned, not in a bad way, but simply because it was more like something I'd expect to see on HBO, where they can get away with sex, murder, and just about anything goes (all of which seems to be on the menu here, as well).",/review/rw5098761/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2016,jonmccann,9," Defies the norm
","We have an enormous amount of choice, especially the last 5 or so years, we have goodies, baddies, bikers, zombies, serial killers, drug manufacturers/sellers, Kings, Queens, Vikings....Oh my the list goes on...So writers finding a part of the spectrum not exhausted is getting tougher...(in the voice of Jeremy Clarkson) Until now!",/review/rw5098761/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2017,KathleenK22,9," Twists and turns and edge of the seat viewing
","I have watched right up to December, 2017, and the series just keeps getting better. It is hard not to invest a lot of emotional feeling into viewing this series. You want so much for Lettie to succeed and be happy, but it always seems to be a struggle for her. She deserves a family and happiness but she seems to self destruct at every turn. Her mother seems hard but has softened from the last series. Javier is a constant and she even tries to wreck that at times. They are good for each other and they really need the protection they afford each other. I believe her child should be with her because he needs to be and she is his mother. The acting is superb especially from Lettie played by the much loved character Lady Mary but this time in a much different role. The scripts are constantly refreshing and taking us down new paths which are the edge of the seat kind of ways. This is probably one of the best series in 2016 and 2017.",/review/rw5098761/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2017,mrc303,10," My favorite new show since Sons of Anarchy
","I have enjoyed season 1 of this show immensely. As I look back, there have only been a few shows that I missed during the off-season, and even after cancellation, such as Buffy, The Shield, Sons of Anarchy, Entourage, Dexter, and Breaking Bad. For me, Good Behavior is right there with the best shows on TV.",/review/rw5098761/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2016,wildsparrow16,8," Blown away - I want to be her.
","This show is a roller-coaster ride going back and forth from the real world to the world we choose to hide in at times. Letty is out of prison, but falls in with ""bad company"", purely by chance. She is trying to make it in the world, but she still struggles with drugs, alcohol, thievery, and an emotionally abusive mother - for starters. She is incredibly likable - smart, tough, and incredibly brave- but can be vulnerable at times. She is deeply troubled with a compassionate heart - it is her heart that gets her into very large messes. All of the characters are incredibly convincing. This show has some humorous moments, but make no mistake - it is a rather intense drama. She wants very much to be ""normal"", but the people in the dark underworld she finds herself in treat her better than those in the real world. If you don't believe in second chances, this show isn't for you.",/review/rw5098761/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2017,dianne00,10," Michelle Dockery should be nominated for an Emmy in Season 2
","Michelle Dockery can act. The range she has and the way she has nailed down her character. Not talking about delivery of one liners, but her out of control behavior in Season 2 episodes 7 through 10 were downright cringeworthy, she looked almost insane and was so believable as a hung out, strung out, guilt-ridden lost cause she really deserves some recognition for it.",/review/rw5098761/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2018,swtsthng-259-856130,10," Why didn't I know about this show?
","I was cruising Hulu trying to find something to watch and gave Good Behavior a try, knowing absolutely nothing about it. One episode is all it took. I went and purchased seasons 1 & 2 after watching just one episode. The show is brilliant, the actors are phenomenal and the music... is now on my Spotify playlist.",/review/rw5098761/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2020,shane1181,9," Bring back Good Behavior!!!!!!!!
",I would have liked to see how Letty and Javier get out of trouble next ... their chemistry is incredible! Maybe a streaming service such as Netflix can pick up where TNT screwed up?! Pretty please.,/review/rw5098761/?ref_=tt_urv

3 December 2016,cerberusbaby,10," Surprised by how good this show is!
","I have been waiting to see a thriller like this on TV for a long time. Quite bored with most of the things shown today, I was pleasantly surprised when I watched the 1st episode by chance. The characters are so real, emotionally. I found myself waiting for the next episode with anticipation, and watching the previous ones again, which I never do. Rarely with movies as well. Both of the characters are so flawed and instead of hiding and making them tough, you can see the hurt and damage. And the obvious chemistry between them is very rarely seen on TV. The directing is amazing in the scenes where the two of them are together. Every moment when they are near each other evokes sparks! Good job guys!",/review/rw5098761/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2016,alisonmiller-74505,9," Taut, intense, addicting
",This is a rare gem of a show. The premier reminds me of the way I felt the first time I saw an episode of Aaron Sorkin's West Wing or heard the opening number of Hamilton--the feeling of having just witnessed real genius. It's that good.,/review/rw5098761/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2017,Mystic1000,10," How Could This Not Be Winning Awards?
","This show made me laugh, cry, cringe, root for the criminals, cheer for the innocent and sing praises for the actors, writers, directors and whoever played any part in making this series happen. Who knows if they can repeat the triumph of season one in season two, but I'll be waiting on pins and needles for it. Actually, we'll probably save up a few episodes so we can do some binge watching. You know, I didn't like Michelle Dockery in Downtown Abbey that much. She was my least favorite daughter! But OMG she nailed Letty in this show, did a flawless American accent, and was perfectly cast. But the revelation was the writing. Each episode takes you to a surprising conclusion and masterfully sucks you into the next adventure. None of it was pretentious or stupid, ever. And the humor is subtle, sly and on the money. Watch this and celebrate the best TV has to offer. No kidding. Just do it!",/review/rw5098761/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2017,kcangel,10," Dark suffering pain of ones past
",I absolutely loved this show and all the characters were well developed and the cinematography is beautiful! All the relationships between each of the characters are beautifully portrayed and the vulnerability is huge in this between Letty and Javier. ,/review/rw5098761/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2019,beyoutfullgirl,10," Time for Letty and Javier to come back.
","It's very very sad that Good Behavior is no longer airing. This was the most amazing series I have watched in a very long time. Michelle and Juan are amazing people and I had the best time filming with them. Chad, please bring GB back.",/review/rw5098761/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2017,badgirl_chikidy,10," Beyond Amazing!
","I have been hooked on this show since the very first episode! Michelle Dockery and Juan Diego Botto are FANTASTIC together. Their on screen chemistry heats more than just the your TV screen! Their performance is impeccable and oh so delicious. Their characters Letty Raines and Javier Pereira are sure to take you through an emotional roller-coaster full of knock your socks off highs and drowning in the pain lows. If you haven't given this show a watch, please check it out. I promise, you'll be begging for more!",/review/rw5098761/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2017,blaynebittner,10," I am very much hoping this show gets renewed. Beyond superb film noir deserving of more seasons.
","I don't tend to review a show often. I figured I'd mention that I have noticed that since the season finale, the amount of people going back and watching through the season have increased. This is part a review but part of a suggestion to renew this show.",/review/rw5098761/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2018,damien-ofarrell,10," This is a must-watch show!
",Amazing show with excellent writing and acting talent - worth watching only for Michelle Dockery who does a great job!,/review/rw5098761/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2018,figg_shannon,10," I absolutely LOVE this series!
",Why have they not renewed this series? This is one of the best series that's been on TV since Breaking Bad! I love it!,/review/rw5098761/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2017,speedcanary,10," My Guilty Obsession
","I rate this 10 stars, but wish it could be even higher. I am obsessed with this series and the leads. The hiatus is literally killing me because I'm not getting my weekly shot of Letty and Javier! ",/review/rw5098761/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2017,cebelina,9," smart, intense, delicious and primal
","This is not a glossed over rose tinted perspective of human behavior...okay, Ms. Dockery can make even a hangover look good. Nevertheless, it is almost viscerally painful to follow Letty. I suppose the fiction hits a bit too close to personal reality. The characters are full and complicated and the story telling is compelling. There is real flesh in these characters. They aren't hollowed caricatures of what a writer might ""think"" people behave like - oh wait they are!! But this illusion is brilliantly weaved together in a fast moving and compelling drama. Oh yeah baby!! Bring it on!!This is going to be one heck of a fun ride; if not painful! Interesting and a good pull on the old gray cells there is a gamut of emotions explored here and the themes remain classic. Nevertheless hold onto your hat you're about ready to take a fascinating trip and a crazy ride. Fiction can be as interesting as life. Oh and my nine rating? Well, I've not even finished one episode...",/review/rw5098761/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2019,chinoquest,10," One of the best tv show I've seen in a long time!!!
","I love love love this show!!! The story is great, the acting is impeccable and the soundtracks are all amazing!!! I don't know why it's cancelled for season 3? The script is funny, sad, angry. All emotions combined in one place. It is witty. All the characters are charming. Especially, Javier. To be able to love this Letty Raines character for all her flaws and ""good intentions"" would make all women's heart melt. When he bought her a big house. So, they can all live happily ever after with Jacob (Letty's son). It's very sad that they wouldn't make season 3. This is a definitely must see tv show.",/review/rw5098761/?ref_=tt_urv
