1 August 2021,bakergarrett,7," Don't go into this expecting a monster movie
","Werewolves is not a good monster movie. It's not trying to be. It's trying to be a comedy and a twisty who done it. I think it succeeds at both it kept me guessing and kept me laughing. The two leads are both great, especially the ranger with wholesome attitude. I liked it enough to write this review.",/review/rw7492748/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2022,FeastMode,5," So close
","The premise is great, I love the tone, it's pretty funny, and I was generally amused. Everything in the setup intrigued me. But as an overall movie, I feel like it just missed the mark of being something memorable and rewatchable. And while the mystery aspect was well-done, they completely give it away at one point. I'm glad I watched it, but it missed the cut. (1 viewing, 2/3/2022)",/review/rw7492748/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2021,paul_haakonsen,6," Definitely a different approach to the werewolf genre...
","When I sat down to watch ""Werewolves Within"", I must admit that I hadn't even heard about the movie, nor seen a trailer or anything, so I wasn't really sure what I was in for here. Yeah, of course the title does sell the concept of this being a werewolf movie, but aside from that, then I only knew this was a horror comedy.",/review/rw7492748/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2021,Reviews_of_the_Dead,8," Solid Blend of Murder Mystery with Potential Creature and Comedy
","This was a movie that I popped up on my radar by going to the Gateway Film Center. Jaime was intrigued to check this one out as it looked funny. Horror/comedies can be hit or miss for me, but this did catch my interest to see. I knew that it would be a murder mystery with a potential monster in from the title. It also has Milana Vayntrub, Lilly from the AT&T commercials, and I'm a fan of her. The synopsis is basic that it is a feature adaptation of the video game where werewolves attack a small town.",/review/rw7492748/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2021,BA_Harrison,3," Werewolves without.
","In the remote mountain community of Beaverfield, a werewolf is at work, targeting the locals. With the power out, and no way to get help, the townsfolk gather at the local inn, unsure whether one of them is the savage beast in human form.",/review/rw7492748/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2022,UniqueParticle,9," I'm tired and still absolutely love this movie!
",Very amusing fun comedy/thriller the scenes flow very well! Melina Vayntrub is gorgeous and I enjoy anything with Sam Richardson. It was nice to hear some 90's music that's from my time even for one scene. Hard to watch with 2 hours sleep but definitely worth the viewing and I'd totally see Werewolves Within.,/review/rw7492748/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2021,kaefab,8," movie is hilarious and keeps you guessing til the end
","Its a slow burn, don't expect werewolf action until the end but the slow build up works amazing.",/review/rw7492748/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2021,abhibnlcs,8," Enjoyable story leading to a great twist, but not much werewolf action
",This was a very enjoyable movie. I'd say it's a good mix of comedy and thriller. I very much liked the way the twist at the end was presented.,/review/rw7492748/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2021,trinaboice,8," Dark comedy with some insightful moments
","IN A NUTSHELL:
The horror comedy is based on a video game Werewolves Within - PlayStation VR that I've never seen or played, so I had absolutely no expectations. It's directed by Josh Ruben and will make you laugh and cringe at the same time.",/review/rw7492748/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2021,CinemaClown,," More Amusing Than Thrilling Yet Thoroughly Entertaining
","Beautifully blending & balancing the elements of comedy, horror & whodunnit mystery into a howling gem, Werewolves Within is more amusing than scary yet manages to be captivating from start to finish. Packed with a colourful set of characters whose interplay injects a fresh quality to its witty & kinetic story, this indie comedy horror is one of the better delights of the year.",/review/rw7492748/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2021,meddlecore,3," Werewolves Within...Only...Without Werewolves...
","I'm not sure what I was expecting, going into a film that was adapted from a video game...but I can't help but be disappointed by this half assed horror comedy.",/review/rw7492748/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2021,MamadNobari97,2," Just Bad in Every Way Possible
","The movie with ""Werewolf"" in the title, and ""comedy"" and ""horror"" as genre tags, kinda unsurprisingly lacks all of them. Maybe 2 second of werewolf, literally zero attempt at comedy, and a handful of miserable attempt at jump scares. Don't watch it.",/review/rw7492748/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2021,wisemanfromtowne,3," Long and boring.
","I really tried to watch this one thru, but the dialogue scenes were just too long and boring that I ended up skipping thru till the last scene to find out who the werewolf was. It was just was too drawn out to enjoy. I really wanted to like it.... Oh well.",/review/rw7492748/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2021,bigbadbassface,8," Better than average horrody
",If you think Sam Richardson is funny as the awkwardly adorable guy with a heart of gold you will probably like this movie. Enough horror and gore for my dark side but still a good number of chuckle out loud moments. Definitely worth a watch if you're a fan of the dark comedy horror genre.,/review/rw7492748/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2021,rpaleschi,3," Disappointing and a Lack of Werewolves
",This movie had the opportunity to be great but really missed the mark and there is a definite lack of werewolf action.,/review/rw7492748/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2021,PedroPires90,4," Overacted (and overrated) pretentious quirkness
","I really can't understand why everybody - especially critics - love this film. Josh Ruben didn't convince me with Scare Me and neither with this one. Yes, it's quirkness is the typical quirkness that the White liberals love (the new Wes Anderson's deserves 5 stars even before it was released, just wait for it!).",/review/rw7492748/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2021,youngcollind,7," Horror comedy whodunit
","The film effectively promotes itself as a lighthearted werewolf flick, but doesn't fully convey the ""And Then There Were None"" style murder mystery at it's core. The three styles do work well together, though they all come across slightly diluted. The comedy is dry but likeable, coming more from quirky character traits than slapstick punchlines. The horror is very minimal, nearly all coming from off screen implication. The whodunit is the central focus really, and for the most part effective, though some details and backstory border on tedious. If you can accept the three styles without asking too much of one, it's all the kind of light fun you can expect from a movie with ""werewolf"" in the title.",/review/rw7492748/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2021,ptrsknnr,2," Waste of time
",Wasnt funny wasnt scary wasnt anything.......too much yelling and people talking over each other........its like an Agatha Christie Whos the Werewolf? Queeny gay couple has been done tiringly in movies of late.......most unlikable cast.....sloppy script......bad direction.,/review/rw7492748/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2021,joiningjt,10," OMG has America completely LOST its sense of humor, this film is HILARIOUS AND BRILLIANT!!!
","Wow are people COMPLETELY off the mark with this BRILLIANT comedy horror, yes it lacks gore and has just a little horror but its FILLED with excellent writing and BRILLIANT acting and directing. Yes you people that have to have vulgarity, nudity, sex, throwing up, farting, shitting, gross humor THIS isnt for you, this is good old fashioned funny ass acting a d writing. I'm not going to bother telling you all the little pieces of humor that add up to a phenomenal comedy cause if you give this anything under an 8 you wont get it anyway. For the rest that WANT TO LAUGH and not need the garbage humor stuff. Here you go!! What a phenomenal cast and crew thank you for the laughs WE NEEDED IT!!",/review/rw7492748/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2021,nogodnomasters,8," Who put the worms in the cookie jar?
","Finn Wheeler (Sam Richardson) is the new park rangers in the small town of Beaverfield, Vermont. WE are introduced to the town's folks who are all quirky. Finn is led around by Cecily (Milana Vayntrub) who looks like she still has on her AT&T shirt. She works for the Post Office. The Midland Gas Company wants to put a pipeline through town which has them at odds. (Real Vermonters would not allow a pipeline.) Snow drifts block the roads and it appears the town has a werewolf as we gather everyone in one room in this whodunit.",/review/rw7492748/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2021,kirbie2182,10," Well, i'm a fan
",I'm not really sure I understand the negative reviews. It was hilarious and fun. It reminded me of an 80s movie. Really enjoyable.,/review/rw7492748/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2021,joncolley,4," Well made, just very very dull...
","I had no expectations of this movie, I'd heard nothing about it and it just sort of 'appeared' so I thought I'd give it a go.",/review/rw7492748/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2021,Movi3DO,7," Funny and chaotic
",A horror comedy where neighbors in a small town were terrorized by werewolves.,/review/rw7492748/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2021,TheTruthofItIs,7," Campy horror-com
","""Werewolves Within"" is a good date-night movie, it's a campy horror-comedy that throws off ""Northern Exposure"" vibes. You'll enjoy Kenan Thompson look-alike Sam Richardson as the new park ranger in town. (Sam also played comic-relief in Amazon's recently released ""The Tomorrow War"".) And of course there's AT&T's ""Lily"" Milana Vayntrub who plays the cute ditz but surprises us in the movie's twist ending. It's a low-budget production but it moves along at a good pace and the ending is as campy as the rest, so just enjoy a lighthearted horror-com.",/review/rw7492748/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2021,thasaint-1,7," No Bad Moon
","Excited to see this one and it was pretty good. Milana is just as cute in this one as she is in the AT&T commercials. Glad to see her branching out for some major roles. Overall it a Clue-type vibe with a Horror ending. It starts a little slow but gets better if you can stick with it. I loved all the actors in this one, perfect choices!!! I had no idea this was a video game? Overall worth the watch.",/review/rw7492748/?ref_=tt_urv
