26 December 2014,smatysia,7," Amazing cast
","Since this film came out only two years later, it is hard to imagine that the phrase ""pulp fiction"" did not come up at the pitch meeting. But I thought that this movie was pretty good and can stand on its own despite the similarities, mainly the weaving together of disparate characters by events. It does run chronologically, unlike PF. It has an amazing cast, with two Oscars, and another five nominations among them. (Although some of these did come afterwards) Kudos for great performances by Danny Aiello, Eric Stoltz, Glenne Headly, Marsha Mason, Terry Hatcher, Charlize Theron, and in a smaller role, Ada Maris. Nice unobtrusive direction by John Herzfeld, who also has a writing credit. Worth checking out.",/review/rw1125449/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2016,claudio_carvalho,8," One of the Best Unknown and Underrated Films in the Style of Pulp Fiction
","In Los Angeles, the professional cold blood killer Lee Woods (James Spader), and his loser partner, the hit-man Dosmo Pizzo (Danny Aiello), are monitoring the house the aspiring Olympic skier Becky Foxx (Teri Hatcher) that is sleeping with her ex-husband Roy (Peter Horton). During the night, the killers break in the house and Lee dopes Becky with an injection and kills Roy. They flee and Lee shots Dosmo and blow up their car with Dosmo inside. Then he escapes from the crime scene with his Norwegian girlfriend Helga Svelgen (Charlize Theron). Meanwhile the bigoted veteran vice detective Alvin Strayer (Jeff Daniels) wants to bust an Asian massage parlor to deport the women, but his partner, the rookie and ambitious Wes Taylor (Eric Stoltz), does not agree with his attitude. When Becky awakes covered in blood, she runs to the street and stumbles upon Alvin and Wes that drive to her home to investigate the crime. Dosmos is wearing a bulletproof vest and survives; then he seeks shelter at the mansion of the wealthy and snobbish art dealer Allan Hopper (Greg Cruttwell). Allan has kidney stones and his assistant Susan Parish (Glenne Headly), who is permanently humiliated, is taking care of him. Meanwhile the washed-up and suicidal director Teddy Peppers (Paul Mazursky) is at the cemetery with his beloved dog Bogey visiting his mother's tomb with the intention of committing suicide. He sees the nurse Audrey Hopper (Marsha Mason) and offers Bogey to her. She invites him to visit her half-brother Allan that might be interested in the dog. Throughout two days, the lives of these characters are entwined and truth is disclosed.",/review/rw1125449/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2001,mattymatt4ever,8," One of the best movies that nobody's seen!
","Unfortunately, ""2 Days in the Valley"" didn't get a big audience.  I saw it in theaters and enjoyed it very much, and now that I bought the DVD I still enjoy it very much!  This is really a unique, original piece of work with echoes of Tarantino.  Just like any Tarantino film, the characterizations are very well-developed and the dialogue is sharp, witty and full of observation.  ",/review/rw1125449/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2016,PredragReviews,8," ""You have one minute to decide the rest of your life...""
","""2 Days in the Valley"" is a great movie for anyone. If you like interesting story lines accompanied by amazing performances by very talented actors/actresses then you should watch 2 Days in the Valley. This movie packs a lot of star power with names such as Charlize Theron, Teri Hatcher, Eric Stoltz, Danny Aiello, Jeff Bridges and James Spader. The story revolves around the events surrounding different characters, all unrelated. The movie has many sub-plots and develops them all independently until they all merge together and we get the big picture. Throughout the movie, we learn important details that are all leading up to a great finale. The director threw in a lot of little interesting quirks, such as the murderous assassin smirking as he watches a cop sight down the barrel of a watergun, or a spiteful old man who we came to hate earlier slinking out of a Japanese pleasure house in the dead of night. The movie is very well written and very interesting, and if there is any problem whatsoever, it would have to be that at times the dialogue becomes a bit laborous and unrealistic. (Sometimes, it appears that the characters are explaining what's going on to the audience, rather than conversing with the other characters.) Nevertheless, this is a trite point, and distracts none at all from the movie's enjoyment.",/review/rw1125449/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2005,ToddTee,8," Too much fun to miss
","In addition to the clever plot and delicious acting you get to see very early work by Charlize Theron and James Spader, either of which is worth your time. All of the characters are full-fledged characters, with not a weak link in the chain; and those playing those characters all make the best of it. It's a true ensemble cast, with no one -- with the possible exception of Spader, having a lead role. The story is full of twists, surprises and turnabouts enough to flesh out two or three movies. You can tell that all of these fine actors are enjoying playing the quirky characters we are presented with to make this a true fun romp.",/review/rw1125449/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2015,larry.launders,8," Watch It! Only some of the characters have to worry about having just 60 seconds....

23 April 2003,george.schmidt,," ""Short Cuts"" meets ""Pulp Fiction""
","2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY (1996) *** James Spader, Danny Aiello, Eric Stoltz, Jeff Daniels, Paul Mazursky, Teri Hatcher, Charlize Theron, Marsha Mason, Glenne Headly, Greg Cruttwell, David Carradine, Peter Horton, Louise Fletcher, Austin Pendleton. ""Pulp Fiction"" meets ""Short Cuts"" best describes this fun, exciting and leisurely paced comedy/crime thriller with a dozen characters crossing over into each others' paths during 48 hours of murder, suicidal tendencies and the usual California angst of the San Fernado Valley. Great ensemble cast all obviously having fun and one helluva cat fight between Amazonian Theron and buxom Hatcher! Oh mama!",/review/rw1125449/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2000,michaelRokeefe,6," Weird and very watchable dark comedy/drama.
","John Herzfeld writes and directs a tangled story that unravels and rewinds itself. The plot seems to involve a murder by hire that goes awry. A dozen or so Californians have their lives intersect with each going different directions. Violence, sex and dark humor are the adhesive for this scattered, but interesting movie. An ensemble cast keeps your attention.",/review/rw1125449/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2019,imseeg,9," One of the best gangster comedies of the nineties, somehow forgotten, but with excellent acting performances and a hilarious, original story. Hot debut of Charlize Theron!

",1st watched 2/5/2000 - (Dir-John Herzfeld): Interesting mish-mash of characters who all eventually fit together amidst violent crimes started by a man who seems to be used to this line of work. Despite the obvious muddle-filled lives we are able to pick out those that we route for and they seemed to win out in the end.

19 May 2002,maeander,9," Not a crime drama but a black comedy.
","With more murders than your average 'Dirty Harry' movie, you would think this film was a crime drama. It is not! It's a dark satire...a black comedy in the true sense of the word. Some of the good people aren't that good (some are) and some of the bad people aren't that bad (some are). But the really dense detective stays that dense for the entire film. From the bald bad guy (Danny Aiello with his head shaved) to the suicidal writer/director who becomes a hero to the cat-fight of the two delicate leading ladies that makes the Ali-Foreman heavyweight battle look like a walk in the park; you know your not in Kansas anymore. If you're looking for something where most of the normal film rules are thrown out the window, you can't do better than '2 days in the valley'.",/review/rw1125449/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2013,seymourblack-1,7," An Unusual Blend Of Violence, Romance & Comedy
","Within the space of a couple of days, the lives of a disparate bunch of characters collide in circumstances that are so bizarre and unpredictable that it's impossible not to be drawn into the rather convoluted plot of ""2 Days In The Valley"". This is a crime movie which features an unusual mixture of violence, romance and comedy as well as a large number of characters who are all eccentric, dangerous or troubled in various ways and it's these characters that make this film so compelling and entertaining to watch.",/review/rw1125449/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2004,steve49er,10," Deserved more moviegoer attention.
","Yes, this can be compared to ""Pulp Fiction"".  It has a slew of twists and veers from one set of characters to another at the drop of a hat.  Unlike ""Pulp"", however, there are many sympathetic characters mixed into the cast. The film has humor (a hired gunman that spends much of the movie looking for Italian seasonings while cooking for his captives), some sadness (a once successful director down on his luck,  ready for suicide, being ridiculed by a bit part actor), a very lush Charlize Theron, a movie mogul with ""kidney stones"", and an extremely competent killer that has a thing with his stop watch.  Let's not forget the two police officers, one a compassionate young man looking to advance to criminal investigation, the other a red neck failure that decides its time to shoot a foursome at the golf course next to his home.  How these characters are brought together through the planning of an Olympic star (well, almost a star)who is ready to have her ex knocked off for the will is amusing, well acted, and one of the best films I've seen in some time.",/review/rw1125449/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 1999,Jedi Jr.,8," Totally Out of Control
","Two Days In The valley really nailed me to my seat,at first I only rented it to see my favorite new actress Charlize Theron(Helga). Then as the movie started and I saw  Danny Aiello(Desmo)and James Spader (Lee) staking out a house I thought it had to be cops checking out drug dealers or something along that line and I was wrong. Then as the other characters appeared in the movie and the story started going in a different direction then I figured it would I was shocked by the way things came out and knew this was one of the best Dramas I've seen in years. It's a must see kinda movie and must have do to all the great and weird acting in it. out of three stars I give it ****.",/review/rw1125449/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 1999,pooch-8,," Solid crime thriller with talented ensemble acting
","Writer-director John Herzfeld's mining of the multi-layered, heavily populated neo-crime genre sparked by the popularity of Pulp Fiction is an above average, if workmanlike, movie that should satisfy most aficionados of the style.  Weaving together the stories of more than half a dozen interesting denizens of the San Fernando Valley, Herzfeld makes the most of his situations, allowing talented performers like Danny Aiello, Eric Stoltz and Jeff Daniels to show-off their chops.  Additionally, Paul Mazursky shines as the depressed, suicidal director Teddy Peppers and Charlize Theron delivers an electrifying turn that should have made her a big star.",/review/rw1125449/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2004,Comberman,7," Worth watching....for its entertainment value.
","Trying to compare Two Days in the Valley with Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is pointless.  There is very little originality in the vast majority of modern movies; by and large within their particular genre most movies are variations on a theme.  I've watched Pulp Fiction several times and enjoyed it every time and I'll probably watch it many times more.  I watched Two Days in the Valley and never once thought about PF, because I enjoyed it and accepted it as just another variation on a theme that was worth watching....and I'll more than likely watch it again....for its entertainment value.  The characters were believable in a many-threaded plot that finally knitted together in a way that did not seem contrived.",/review/rw1125449/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2001,crius-3,," Dark, Deadly and Delicious
","This is great ! For all those people who like their tales dark and told well...oh dash it ! For all those who like their tales told well, dark or not..this is your dish. With a tight script and credible characters this one takes you on a dizzy dark trip. The director achieves this trick by picking a multitude of characters and, wonder of wonders, doing justice to each character great or small. The viewer achieves instant familiarity with all the cast that flit in and out of this set, be it the hard-luck hit man, the mousy secretary, a has-been film director or the females in a dangerous game. With splendid economy the director blends careless, throw away humour and dangerous games to bring off a stunning conclusion. The script is well structured and has a definite place to go unlike the crime movies that seem to falter at the end. The cast is superb, great to witness James Spader do the ice cool one and Danny Aiello is superb as the unwitting player in a sinister game. Do Not Miss !",/review/rw1125449/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2017,romanorum1,7," Fate brings together disparate characters
","John Herzfeld's film is one of Intersecting narratives set in L.A.'s San Fernando Valley. It chronicles a violent and profane tale of how the lives and deaths of a dozen various people intersect over the course of two days. The director's method is to introduce his characters in seemingly unrelated scenes and then eventually connect them together. The technique has been done before: ""American Graffiti"" (1973) and ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) come to mind.",/review/rw1125449/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2004,jimi99,9," the anti-pulp fiction
","I too thought of ""Pulp Fiction"" when I first saw this terrific film, in the sense that this was the anti-Tarrantino principle, a crime drama/comedy with a great deal of heart and soul.  Spader is almost a parody of an evil genius, but magnetic in the film's only over-the-top performance.  Danny Aiello as the very human and lovable hitman should have been nominated for Best Actor.  Charlize Theron is gorgeous and so bad, and her ""catfight"" with Terri Hatcher is the greatest ever filmed, with an eye-popping conclusion. But when I think of ""2 Days in the Valley"" I think of Paul Mazursky's performance, how sweet and sad, how beautiful the way he and Marsha Mason meet and grow close.  Jeff Daniels as the cop on the verge of flipping out, Eric Stoltz as his virtuous partner, Glenne Headley as the woman who Aiello's character brings to life and feeling, all are very good.  I loved this movie, and have seen it 5 or 6 times...",/review/rw1125449/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2003,rdoyle29,8," some decent performances in routine thriller
","A variety of crooks, losers, and working stiffs living in the shadow of Hollywood find their various personal crises overlapping in this intricately woven melodrama. Lee Woods (James Spader) is a cold-blooded hit man and Dosmo Pizzo (Danny Aiello) a soft-at-heart gangster; they've been sent to murder Roy Foxx (Peter Horton), the former husband of also-ran Olympic skier Becky Foxx (Teri Hatcher). 	Alvin (Jeff Daniels) and Wes (Eric Stoltz) are two cops on vice detail. Alvin dreams of becoming a homicide detective, so when he discovers that he might be on the trail of a murder, it's like Santa Claus showed up in mid-July to hand him a present. 	In an attempt to try and pin Foxx's murder on Dosmo, Lee tries to do away with him.  Dosmo manages to escape, forcing him to hide out in the home of Hopper, a pretentious English art dealer (Greg Cruttwell), whom Dosmo holds hostage along with Hopper's long-suffering assistant, Susan (Glenne Headly). In the midst of all this, a down-on-his-luck television director (Paul Mazursky) contemplates suicide (the main stumbling block is finding someone to take care of his dog), and meets a compassionate nurse (Marsha Mason) on a visit to a cemetery, whom he convinces to take the dog. 	The feature film directorial debut of long-time TV movie creator Herzfeld, this crime thriller interweaves several related plot lines into one tongue-in-cheek noir tapestry. The film is occasionally fun, and genre fans will appreciate its hip, self-mocking energy. 	There are some good performances too, notably from James Spader, returning to his roots as a slick, ice-cold heavy, newcomer Charlize Theron in a hilarious over-the-top sexpot role, and Paul Mazursky, who usually comes off as too precious, in the nicely modulated part of a suicidal pet lover.",/review/rw1125449/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 1998,madguy,10," A pretty screwed-up story about pretty screwed-up people.
","Wow!  Fantastic.  A very dark humorous movie, one of the best of its kind that I know of.  Like any good dark story, every character is presented very shortly and separately, in a way that you can already pinpoint every of his traits in a split-second.  Also, like any good dark story, they all get involved with each other one way or another, would that be by being allies that we didn't know of, or simply people that cross the street at the same time and will just look at each other and go on with their lives.  A must-see.",/review/rw1125449/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2005,PersianPlaya408,8," A solid drama with good acting and good direction
","Herzfelds 2 days in the valley is a different film. Borrowing styles of films such as Pulp Fiction and the more recent Crash (intertwining stories meeting each other), its an effective portrayal of what the title states. The performances are good for the most part, although Glenne Headly and Jeff Daniels were not good in this flick. Aiello, Stoltz and Theron were great. My favorite performance of the film came from Paul Mazursky who was great as a washed up TV film director/writer. James Spader and Teri Hatcher were both also good in their roles and Austin Pendletons cameo was one of the highlights of this film. The film is not great, it has some flaws in acting and a few scenes which just don't belong and are very cliché, however as a whole, i liked it, good cinematography and score as well as good performances for the most part, Herzfelds direction and writing was also good, a good debut for him. 8/10 #197 on my list of all time favorite films",/review/rw1125449/?ref_=tt_urv

","(Some Spoilers) Amazing, if somewhat complicated, movie that at first plays like an anthology and then slowly morphs into a solid murder/suspense drama with a moral lesson thrown in, at the very end, just for good measures. Breaking into the home of Olympic woman skier Becky Foxx, Teri Hatcher, these two hit men Dusmo & Lee, Danny Aiello & James Spader, start to work over Becky's husband Roy, Peter Horton, about the truth of him ever having slept with Lee's girlfriend Helga, Charlize Theron. There's also the suspicion if Roy & Helga were ever involved in spying for the Communist North Koreans.",/review/rw1125449/?ref_=tt_urv
