","Okay, now, I'll be frank. When the first information on ""X-Men: Evolution"" was released, *everyone* thought it would suck. I did too.",/review/rw0735851/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2008,datdudesketch,9," Finally the New Mutants or X-Force gets a show!
","That's pretty much what I would chalk this up to. The New Mutants series finally hits the screen. If you read the comics back in the 80's like myself then you know what I'm talking about. Wolfsbane, Sunspot, Boom Boom, amazing! ",/review/rw0735851/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2003,thegreatgrundle,," Better than you thought
","A lot of people have been putting this show down, and I'd like to set the record straight.  For those who don't know, the show is about the X-men when they were teenagers.  The creators probably thought that by making them younger, they could appeal to a younger audience (it's survived 3 years up to this point, so who's to say they were wrong?).  And for the most part, this angered X-men ""purists"", who argued that the series butchered their favorite characters, and that this was an insult to ""true"" fans.  Get over yourselves.",/review/rw0735851/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2006,Nicholai,," First Lame, Then Good, Then Epic
","I had the opportunity to watch the first four episodes of this series when they first aired. Seeing all the producers and directors that were from ""Batman: The Animated Series"" being involved with this show and the superior production quality courtesy of Mook Animation (""Aeon Flux"", ""Spawn"") and DR Movies (""Justice League"") that was far superior than the cheesy Akom animation of the early nineties X-Men cartoon provided me with high expectations for this show.",/review/rw0735851/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2012,TheLittleSongbird,7," Started off shaky, but got better
","X-Men: Evolution may not hold a candle to the 90s series, but on its own merits it is decent. I can see why people dislike it as even on its own terms it does have glaring flaws, but I do think it should be judged on its own rather than being compared all the time. Okay, Season 1 wasn't brilliant, there was a lot of cheesy dialogue, slow and melodramatic story lines, not enough Wolverine, a great character, and too much of Spike, one like Kitty that annoys me to no end, plus Rogue seems bland to me in this series. However, Season 2 was much stronger, the pacing is much crisper, the action scenes are exciting, the writing was a little more intelligent if occasionally still with the odd cheesy one-liner and the stories were much more compelling. The animation is smooth and has some good atmosphere, while the sound effects really add to the adrenaline-rush feel of the action sequences and the music from the catchy intro to the haunting background music is very fitting. There are some good characters too, Xavier is quite likable to me, Wolverine and Gambit are great characters that could have been used more and Magneto is a very threatening presence. The voice acting is on the whole good. The crowning jewel for me was the finale, which was an epic knockout. Overall, shaky start, great end. 7/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw0735851/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2000,Op_Prime,," Stands well on it's on
","Sure, it can not compare to the Fox animated series or the hit movie, but Evolution is pretty good anyway. It has an interesting new look for the X-Men. This show brings back the more popular characters and adds some that weren't a major part of the last show. And why should you expect the same character development? This is a NEW show with NEW people behind the scenes. This is a good show, give it a chance.",/review/rw0735851/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2004,Skeletors_Hood,," The best X-men cartoon ever!! Claws down!!

11 January 2002,LittleDrummerGirl,," can't get better
","This has to be better than the original!  I was excited when I heard about this one, and I am a diligent watcher.  What other teen girls like Nightcrawler?? *raises hand proudly*  I WAS going to think it was just a cheap imitation, but I turned it on one time and I love it.",/review/rw0735851/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2001,Figaro-8,," I hope it continues to evolve.
","Despite my limited knowledge of X-Men--or perhaps because of it--I love this show.  The animation, voices and music are GREAT, and it is not from Japan (no offense to anime fans).  I love how Nightcrawler and Beast look.  And to those who said that characters like Beast were being ignored, the episode ""Beast of Bayville"" proves otherwise and also proves that the series is living up to its name and evolving, which takes time.  I hope the evolution continues.",/review/rw0735851/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2001,SyxxNet,," Rocks!
","Having been familiar with the ORIGINAL X-Men (Angel, Beast, Iceman, Marvel Girl, and Cyclops) and having caught up a bit on the more recent adventures so I wouldn't be a total doofus for the movie, I find this series EXCELLENT!",/review/rw0735851/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2003,jasjgm,," should be taken independently from the real thing
","Although it seems many kids really enjoy and like the series, it should remain a fact that X-Men Evolution is barely an adaptation of the actual X-Men universe (comics & the original animated series). The series itself has excellent cartooning, good music, the characterizations by themselves are good; but they are technically false. I am sure most people really familiar with the X-Men would say that. And yes, the purists should give a chance for a little adjustments, and should keep quiet, but it is disappointing for something which real fans have followed for decades to just be radically distorted (which it is) and turned into something else. Yes, X-Men Evolution is a good animated series, but the best thing to do is to take it INDEPENDENTLY, as in SEPARATE from the real X-Men story line. Treat it as if it were another comic book adaptation. Kids alike will enjoy Evolution, and real fans should just step aside and let it go. However, to those who really want to watch the original, classic X-Men universe, watch the original X-Men animated series (which is not so much for kids, more for the older generations). The cartooning may not be that good, but the stories are classic and true to the comic, and the diverse dramatic world of the mutants, and their intertwining relationships with each other would really be shown. That is the real classic.",/review/rw0735851/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2003,CrystalStorm,," It's a good show.
","Seeing how many have bashed this show, I decided to give my two-cents in. I had never heard of X-men before Cartoon Network decided to show Evo here in Sweden. Curious, I went on-line to see if it was something. What was explained got me interested, and I started to look up facts on the original comics, particular the first ones. Afterwards I saw Pryde of the X-men, and one of TAS, and accutally decided that I liked Evo better! When it arrived I had no means to see the first episode, or the second as I was away that weekend. But when I did see it, I watched the episode 'Spyke-cam' and decided that I liked the animation. (Rouge's and Kitty's dance went smooth.) Also, I researched about Evan (Spyke.) And found out that he was an Evo-exclusive chara, and stumbled upon an interview with the creator of him. Apparently they wanted Evo to have something unique, so they made Spyke, and from what they says, they didn't know about Marrow. I believe them, because how many X-men/mutants are there in the Marvelverse?! They can't know everything about all of them. Now they also gave the mutants a more likely life.",/review/rw0735851/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2004,wc337536,," if your to young to remember the comics or original series its new to you!
","i have read one slash review for this series to many, STOP COMPLAINING! IT'S JUST A TV SHOW FOR GOD SAKES!!!!!!!! how bad could it be if Marvel gave it the ok to begin with. anyway, if children watch the show and get into the x-men they will be more inclined to get into the comic's and get the original story, the entire genre will be more likely to fade into complete obscurity over the years if todays children never hear of the x-men. so if you stop watching the series from a completely bias point of view you might actually enjoy it! (for those of you who are reading this and have no idea what i am talking about just watch the show! it's good! of course you cant anymore because it's canceled, so go to amazon.com and buy the DVD's!)",/review/rw0735851/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2007,titch161,10," A brilliant interpretation of the xmen story
","I'll try to keep this brief as a lot has been written already concerning what xmen evolution is about. This incarnation is not too dissimilar to the television series 'smallville' in that it focuses more on teenage issues and growing up, but with the added burdens and responsibilities of mutant powers. Rent or buy the DVD, but stick with it. You WILL be rewarded.",/review/rw0735851/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2006,BigBadaBruce,8," Brilliant!
","What you see on X-Mne Evolution is the development of the characters and story lines used in their later-years during the comics. With them in High School, the mutants have a new sight of Mutantism in that it coincides with puberty, and the development of their bodies and the changes of themselves. We see good storytelling in the development of the likes of Scott/Cyclops, developing from a young student of Professor X to the leader of the X-men, Logan/Wolverine is the given the role of an uncle to the X-Men, which gives his character a breath of fresh air, and the Acolytes as the High School bodies who have something else on their side; mutant powers. You see the decisions they make in the run-up to the comics, and you see a glimpse of the future in the last episodes as the story continues to grow. It's so disappointing that some bigwig decided to cancel it. Idiot!",/review/rw0735851/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2000,Taps JR.,," A great show, but there could be some minor adjustments...
","I've seen every episode, and I love it. It may not follow the comics, but it's good on its own.",/review/rw0735851/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2003,TVvuer69,," This show's getting better and better!!!
","I saw the 90's X-Men series which was based on some of the comic books and enjoyed it.  Because the Evolution series has the situation set from a different standpoint (with the majority of mutants as high school students), I thought I'd take a look at it out of curiosity's sake.  The first season was a little slow with the recruitment of several of the characters into either Professor Xavier's X-Men or Magneto's Brotherhood.  But it definitely picked up with the two sides battling on Asteroid M.",/review/rw0735851/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2011,x_badd,10," One of my favorite animated shows
","I was a fan of the X-Men long before this show began. I understand that a lot of people didn't like the 1st season especially compared to the previous animated series by Fox. The show had a goal of targeting younger audiences and people who were not necessarily familiar with the X-Men. Therefore they decided to do a reboot of the 40+ years of x-history from the books. I must admit in the initial season some episodes seem to be lacking. However with the onset of the 2nd season that crazy, wild, yet fun ride that we know to be the life of an x-man began. The season finales after that were EPIC. Also that character that everyone initially disliked, Spyke evolved into a true Hero and x-man. The series had very intense stories like Avatar the Last Airbender I used to wonder if kids enjoyed the show as much as I did until I saw my younger cousins' reactions. The voice acting was simply flawless I'd just like to say, ""Thank You"" to Maggie Blue O'Hara who voiced Kitty and kept my ears happy. The animation was breath taking. They even changed Wolverine's costume later to give him that edge the colourful outfit lacked. The thing I like most about this series is that we got to know these character as people not just superheroes. We had a chance to meet Jean Grey the person before she became that all powerful Phoenix. In spite of all it's youth and that unpredictable nature this is my favorite X-Men series.",/review/rw0735851/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2003,BigVash,," I like it. When is Spike coming back?
","I started watching this show when it started coming on Cartoon Network earlier this year.  I was a big fan of the original show in the early 90s so I didn't think this one would be good.  Man was I wrong.  It's not what you would expect from an X-men series and thats the cool part about it.  The best change was Cyclops.  He is so much more laid-back and cool than he ever was in the comics.  Wolverine is cool but the Logan from the old series will always be the best.  I like the fact that it takes place in high school because you get to see the heroes as you would never see them.  And is it me or is Toad one of the funniest things to happen on Evo.  He even gets his own song when he appears in any scene he is in.  Whoever is complaining that it's not faithful to the comics needs to shut up.  It's not supposed to be, that's why they have Ultimate X-Men for people who want a new formula. And that's the way Evo is.  For any fan who hasn't seen this show yet, go see it, but have an open mind when you do.",/review/rw0735851/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2019,rachelkdegnan,10," THANK YOU FOR MAKING MY CHILDHOOD
",This television show took my comic dreams and transformed them into a tv show I could relate to. The show does an amazing job as a cartoon to teach children about acceptance while still providing interesting content.

14 August 2004,AdamantiumSheWolf,10," Tired of all the bashing, loved it!
","First of all, not to be juvenile, but I just wanna' lash back real quick at all those who say this show's stupid (or lame, ""a disgrace to the original,"" pick one.) I've been waiting for this moment... *You* try adapting a mythology like the X-Men and making it fresh, new and relevant to today's youth! Hey, I'm 20 and I love it! I have friends my age who do, too so it's *far* from a ""kid's show.""",/review/rw0735851/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2010,sharafina_teh92,8," A Good X-Men show
","X-Men: Evolution was the first real exposure that I had to the X-Men universe. The original animated series was way back when I was just a toddler, so I am not too familiar with it. Thus, I had a lot to thank to the Evolution series because it made me feel fascinated with the X-Men and eventually Marvel universe.",/review/rw0735851/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2008,Angelus2,10," A different version of the X-Men
","This is a different interpretation of the comic heroes and but tries to incorporate the origins of certain characters; the show has some great story lines; with character development and shows the hardships that mutants face in their world. The group consists of, Xavier; Storm and Wolverine with fellow students, Cyclops, Jean, Kitty, Spike and Nightcrawler.",/review/rw0735851/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2019,Animany94,7," Some things work and others don't.
","This re-interpretation of the X-Men could have been handled better, but it did deliver something of substance. But I must be honest with you guys, the first and second seasons were rather weak. Not that they didn't have good episodes, but they could be counted on one hand.",/review/rw0735851/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2002,kedalto1,," Really grew on me...
","The first time I saw this show I was horrified.  I watched it with a few friends because it came on after Batman Beyond and just stood shocked at how they had destroyed my wonderful X-Men.  However, I went back and watched a few more episodes and I really began to like it.  I really like the animation, most of the voices, and I can actually get into the fact that it doesn't try to present itself as fact like the FOX show did.  I see it as more like a restart, along the lines of Ultimate X-Men.  I gave it a chance and now love it.  If you can accept that this is a re-imagining and get over how worthless a character Spyke is, then I believe you will actually enjoy this show.",/review/rw0735851/?ref_=tt_urv
