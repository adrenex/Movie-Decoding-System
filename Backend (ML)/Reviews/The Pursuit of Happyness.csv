19 April 2021,HelloBlockbuster,10," Good Feelings
","This show is super cliche, but good feeling. It elicited emotions akin to those from watching Hart of Dixie, but with a Latinx cast reminiscent of Jane the Virgin. This really should've been renewed!!! Not all shows have to be super suspenseful or deep, sometimes we just need scratch the surface feel good shows and this scratched that itch. The characters are all likable, however Mari (the mom) is my favorite! Fun fact: Lisa Vidal can now be found on Gray's Anatomy. She's an awesome actress and needs more spot light!",/review/rw5650860/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2020,zahidbin-19256,9," Just finished season 1 then got to know it's got cancelled
","First shame on you ABC for cancelling this great show. This show had every element that you would want from a rom-com show. Great characters, good storyline. So it's disappointing, but the way they finished season 1 I will be okay if this show failed to find a new home.",/review/rw5650860/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2020,coxpnw,9," Breath of fresh air!
","I just saw the advertisement for this show the day before it premiered. It is a really fun, cute and comedic show. I think my 15 year old daughter can actually watch it with me. Minus the threesome comment episode one. No language that I caught so far which is great! You can make a great show without all the crap in it. Actors are good hoping this is a keeper series!",/review/rw5650860/?ref_=tt_urv

14 April 2020,homdeb1058,7," Better Than Expected--Really
","Kind of cute. Kind of funny. Kind of poignant Kind of real in some ways. (Yeah, I know what it's like to stay with someone you're not sure of against your better judgement.) Not sure how long it'll be good for, but I liked the first one. Way better than something like that creepy, awful Long Shot and those ridiculous ""reality"" shows. Likeable actors. Good family interactions. 7 of 10 for me.",/review/rw5650860/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2021,jbrumfield-94914,10," A BREATH OF FRESH AIR
","I watched this series on the ABC network and completely fell in love with it. I was so disappointed that ABC cancelled the show without a Season 2. It is now streaming on Netflix and I am enjoying watching it over and over again. It is a wonderful love story of a mega star and a baker combined with a beautiful family relationship and a little bit of comedy. It felt so good to finally see a series with virtually no violence, no profanity and tastefully done romance. All of the actors are wonderful and the chemistry they have with one another is quickly noticeable. I am hoping that the series does so well that Netflix will provide a Season 2.",/review/rw5650860/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is a variation of the series ""I'm with Her."" Daniel Garcia an every man along with his brother work in the family's ""Little Havana's"" bakery. He is preparing for his big date with his over-achieving girlfriend Vanessa proposes to him at the fancy restaurant he can barely afford. He takes a quick trip to the ""loo"". Out comes (yes this is in the men's room) from one of the stalls walks Noa Hamilton a Kendall Jenner like mogul. She gives Daniel advise to order the soup. In front of a packed place Vanessa asks Daniel to ""marry her."" Well she didn't take his answer well and throws his soup on him. Everyone with a cell phone camera tapes it and it is trending worldwide.",/review/rw5650860/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2020,monicajoy-92407,10," Just what we need...
","...During a pandemic. It's sweet, positive and quite clever. Shows are so trashy and filled with manipulative twists and over the top story lines. This is just an OG, sweet rom com. And who doesn't need that in your life? Covid or not?",/review/rw5650860/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2021,powergamers,10," Amazing show!
","It is a great show to show to binge on a friday night from like 7pm-3am. The show covers funny aspects needed in a show, comedy, drama and romance. I'm just sad there will never be a season 2. I think that the show is great and could be carried on for more seasons.",/review/rw5650860/?ref_=tt_urv

14 April 2020,vjenee,10," As good as the original
","I worried this wouldn't top the original Hebrew version. I am so glad to be wrong, I get all the same fuzzies and feels I got before and it's just different enough being a different culture n all and with the newer social references that I almost forgot it was a remake. At any rate I'm only thinking of the other version because I'm gonna need a fix as I impatiently wait for next weeks instalment. Thumbs up guys!",/review/rw5650860/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2020,Alabouteve,10," Representation Matters!
",Finally a show that represents the LatinX community as a strong family with great values. How fantastic to watch two parents raising three strong children. The show really resonated with me. It gave me such hope and optimism. A feel good show with great relationships. What a journey.,/review/rw5650860/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2020,xoclpxo,10," Why did ABC cancel this show?!!!
",I am so mad that ABC cancelled this show. I just binged this whole season and I am furious that this show is over!!! I WANT A SEASON 2!!!!!!,/review/rw5650860/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2020,dlw-79870,10," Unexpectedly very good
","Wow! This show seemed like on the outside a very cookie cutter rom com tv show that was going to be similar to other shows. But this one was refreshing funny and great acting. I love all the characters and look forward to seeing them develop. The lines aren't cheesy and I love the Afro Cuban music played throughout the episodes. I had to Shazam quite a few they had me dancing in the living room. I got through half the season in one night. That's how good it was. It had me laughing and put me in a good mood. I love this show! I'm glad they didn't make the main female lead snobby and superficial, would have been hard to like. Keep up the good work!",/review/rw5650860/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2020,SpicyCake,8," Wish this wasn't cancelled!

29 July 2020,grimmhybrid,10," This show doesn't deserve to be wasted away!!!!
",I don't want this show to go away due to ABC cancelling. The Baker & the Beauty deserves to be bought by another station even Netflix if may be!,/review/rw5650860/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2020,divyacutie,7," Not bad
","I've watched the original Israeli version and enjoyed it alot. I liked how they took time for each of the character's story to unfold. Whereas the US version seems a tad bit rushed, especially the sister's character. I am not giving up on this just yet as I do see potential. Only time will tell.",/review/rw5650860/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2020,telavivid,6," Overall good, the original is way superior
","This is a remake of the Israeli series ""Lehiyot Ita"" which I binged on several years ago. The present version is pleasant. The story is fun, the actors are nice, the soundtrack is wonderful. Very fitting for a weekend afternoon watch. What I'm unfortunately missing is the intensity and hilariousness of the original characters. The performances here seem to be more subtle, less dramatic and somewhat more ordinary. But they are likable regardless.
So, the show's nice, but I think watching ""Lehiyot Ita"" with subtitles is several times better.",/review/rw5650860/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2020,fsogfan,9," Great Fun & Glamorous Entertainment
","High energy, high production value rom-com/Cuban telenovela set in glamorous/glitzy Miami. Story is based on a popular Israeli comedy. First episode shows lots of designer fashion, fancy restaurants, cameo of local chef, colorful Miami streetlife and architecture plus baking food scenes. Great fun and escapism while we're all stuck at home during shelter in place. Well written with strong supporting cast. Cuban family and girlfriend are hilarious and crazy funny. Nathalie Kelley is believable as a jet setting wealthy model/entrepreneur. Male lead (Victor Rasuk) and ex-boyfriend (Noah Mills) are a little stiff in pilot but enough chemistry there to sell the romance.",/review/rw5650860/?ref_=tt_urv

",Really cringy dialogue and bad acting. I'm not expecting The Wire here but come on. I'm baffled by the high score. There's no chemistry between the two leads and I don't care at all about their relationship. The only person I'm rooting for is the ex Vanessa.,/review/rw5650860/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2020,Turanic,8," To meet a Princess
","There are very many shows and films where an average girl meets a prince... There are very few shows where an average Joe meets a princess (""She's out of your league"", Sassy girl) ... It is funny it's romantic, but most importantly finally a show where a lady does something interesting, just enjoy ...",/review/rw5650860/?ref_=tt_urv
