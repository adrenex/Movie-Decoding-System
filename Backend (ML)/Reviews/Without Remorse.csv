29 November 2003,Smells_Like_Cheese,7," Men in Black: The Galaxy Defenders
","God, do I remember when this movie came out in the summer of '97. This movie brought aliens back in the strongest way possible, everyone was singing Will Smith's catchy song of the same title. But I remember seeing this movie and just wearing out the VHS when we got it. As a 12 year old kid, I just adored this movie and so badly wanted to be apart of the Men in Black. I thought they were so cool. Years later, I got the DVD because I wanted to go for a trip down memory lane, this may not be as cool as when I was a kid but this is still a very fun sci-fi flick that makes you laugh, squirm and also has some good scares. There is a reason why Will Smith is a star, he made this movie a riot to watch and has every star quality you could imagine. He and Tommy Lee Jones take us on an incredible ride through our world where the person that lives next door to you just might be an alien.",/review/rw1444303/?ref_=tt_urv

11 December 2004,Chromium_5,8," Smart, funny spoof that is impossible not to like!
","""Men in Black"" and ""Galaxy Quest"" are in my mind the best sci-fi comedies ever made, because they are both hilarious parodies of two different cultures. Whereas the latter spoofed obsessed fans who take sci-fi entertainment WAY too seriously, this one spoofs the paranoid, tin-foil-hat brand of conspiracy theorists. It has funny characters, witty lines, and does not at all take itself seriously.",/review/rw1444303/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2005,Aaron1375,8," Fast moving science fiction comedy.
","This movie was really fun to watch the first time I saw it in theaters, upon subsequent viewings, however, it loses its luster. Still though, it is still a fun movie to watch. Unlike the sequel which rushes us through the story, this one takes a bit more time developing the characters even though it is only about ten minutes longer. Both Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are very good and funny, especially Smith because he is the new guy so he is seeing all the weird aliens and such for the first time. This is also something missing from the sequel. In the end though the reason I probably like this one so much is that it sort of reminds me of a Ghostbuster movie, and seeing as how we will most likely never see another sequel to that movie it is nice to see a movie sort of like it in that they are keeping tabs and hunting aliens rather than ghosts. The pug dog scene is funny, and the dog is not over used as in the sequel, and there is also a funny scene where Will Smith must deliver an alien baby...their main objective in this one is to track down an alien insect that has hijacked the skin of a guy and is trying to find a universe. If he succeeds the Earth is destroyed, of course Tommy Lee's character is so calm about the whole situation that you feel you have nothing to worry about. So for a funny movie that has great scenes of Will Smith training and becoming a Man in Black watch this film and do yourself a favor and skip part two...not that it was entirely bad, I liked it okay, but it just seems like an unnecessary sequel.",/review/rw1444303/?ref_=tt_urv

","This had been around on television for some time and I'd avoided it because it seemed so popular among the crowd that likes to see gore and ooze on the screen, and because I tuned in for a few minutes and caught scene in which the two men in black (Smith and Jones -- two exotic names for you) used ray guns to blow the head off an alien, and then another different head, covered with elastic glue, wriggled into sight.

5 February 2010,AlsExGal,9," Will Smith saves the planet again ... this time in a good film!
","After the horribly cheesy ""Independence Day"" of the previous year, it was great to see the actor that saved that movie from being completely unwatchable - Will Smith - get a chance to save the planet in a quality film. From the opening of the film where ""Mikey"", an illegal alien from another planet is disguised as an illegal alien from another country, to the end when we see the earth just as a marble in a pouch of many belonging to an extraterrestrial being, I found this film to be thought provoking, original, and very funny.",/review/rw1444303/?ref_=tt_urv

22 April 2004,crowrobot,," One of the best sci-fi comedies ever made.
","As my one line summary says, this is one of the best sci-fi comedies ever made, next to the classic Ghostbusters and the highly underrated Evolution. This movie has action, comedy, and some of the best special effects in the last ten years. Rick Baker, Hollywood's resident 'creature man', as I like to call him, has made such a wide variety of aliens. There's the first alien we see, Mikey; there's the Worm Guys; and the villanous Bug. But there are many others, such as Frank the Pug and the twins. The squid baby is pretty neat. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith have an undeniable chemistry together, which repeats itself in the sequel. Linda Fiorentino is also good as the leading lady, and veteran actor Rip Torn is gruff as the head of MIB, Zed. Vincent D'Onofrio is also pretty good. My favorite line: ""No, ma'am. We at the FBI do not have a sense of humor that we are aware of."" All in all, two thumbs up, baby!",/review/rw1444303/?ref_=tt_urv

Incredible out there special effects from ILM and ingenious aliens from self-professed ""Monster Maker"" makeup guru Rick Baker.

22 May 2012,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,7," ""I never seen sugar do that.""
","The Men in Black(based on a comic I've never read, spawning a TV series I haven't watched, so I can make no comparisons to either) are an agency that protect Earth from not only what the aliens, some of whom are already here, might do to it, but also the common man's ignorance of this situation. It opens a doorway into a fantastic world(whilst playing it straight since most of these guys are used to this stuff) that would be overwhelming were it not for rookie agent J(Will Smith, who brings both his sass and undeniable charm) posing as a proxy for the audience, asking the questions we want to, and being given the exposition and explanations that we need. He is likable in his naiveté and his efforts to help the people affected by the outer-space stuff, and the odd couple dynamic between him and K(Tommy Lee Jones, awesome and enjoyable as the old grump who's blasé about what they experience) is great, as are the various other character aspects. Linda Fiorentino is perfectly cast as a somewhat cold coroner, and she has a nice, strong female role. As the villain, we have Vincent D'Onofrio giving an unforgettable and unique performance as the large cockroach(!) wearing the skin of farmer Edgar. It's a size or two too small, leading to it/him making some rather inelegant movements and possessing poor motor skills. And don't worry, at the same time, he's seriously scary. He's immensely physically powerful, and he can't *stand* humans. This really gets into perspective, and that the importance of something is not defined by its size. This is primarily a comedy, as well as a fun sci-fi action adventure with some very unexpected situations and outcomes. It's exciting, engaging and a cool universe that we want to see more of, with this being a brief(and well-paced) peek at roughly 90 minutes. There are creatively designed creatures and big, shiny guns. Danny Elfman supplies this with a bombastic and playful score. There is a bit of moderate to strong language and a little violence and gore(little of it involving people, and just about none of that graphic) in this. I recommend this to fans of the stars and the concept. 7/10",/review/rw1444303/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Great movie action
","What makes this film stand out, aside from its superb effects, humor and script, is the contrast between Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. While Jones is the emotionless, smarter and wiser one out of the two, Smith is the younger and more enthusiastic. These 'Men In Black' are on a mission to save Earth from a really, really nasty bug infestation. This is one Sci-Fi film that shouldn't be missed.",/review/rw1444303/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2017,ironhorse_iv,8," Don't be kept in the dark. Go see Men in Black. It's gives new meaning to Black Comedy. It's worth seeing!
","You know what the difference, between other sci-fi buddy action-comedies and 'Men in Black'? 'Men in Black' make the genre look good. That was until the 2002 & 2012 sequels came out, but that's that is another story for another day. Yet, in the summer of 1997, this film about two secret organization agents, K (Tommy Lee Jones) & J (Will Smith) having to stop an alien invasion from happening, while hiding their existence from ordinary people, could do little wrong. Even if Will Smith & Tommy Lee Jones was playing, fictional versions of themselves. They are still great in their roles. Not only that, but surprisingly, both share, really good chemistry with each other. Smith's laid-back boyish charm does match, well against Jones' grump mentor, straight-man persona. They do make a good team. Nevertheless, the best acting in this movie, has to go to Vincent D'Onofrio as the extraterrestrial roach-like villain, Edgar the bug. He really went beyond the call of duty, with his performance. Not only, did he researched watch a lot of insect documentaries, spent hours in make-up with legendary, special effects artist, Rick Baker, but he also put on, knee braces to get the feel of Edgar's restricted movement. That's commitment. I also have to give mad props to animatronic effects from Baker & the visual effects by Industrial Light & Magic for making the aliens, in the film, seem real, even if some of the CGI hasn't really hold up, that well, over the years. In the end, it's still impressive to look at. Another thing that still works for me, is the music score by composer, Danny Elfman. It's fascinating how Elfman was able to make an orchestra sound like crickets and hornets buzzing and chirping. It really adds to the visuals of the title sequence. As for the other music in the film. The rap tunes from Will Smith are just as catchy & memorable as the day, it first came out. 'Men in Black' song really does stand out on its own, to the point, that many people forget that the beats was a sample of 1982's 'Forget Me Nots' by Patrice Rushen. As for the humor for the film. Most of the jokes, physical, and verbally are still, laugh out loud, funny, even if some of them are often recycle, throughout the film, somewhat dated or even not complex. Don't get me wrong, as much as I would love more, well-though out sophistical jokes that mirrors, author, Douglas Adams's 'the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' novel; the lighter, cartoony, out of this world, simpler tone of 'Men in Black' works better for the general audiences. Plus, it's a lot better than the much darker and dryer bleak tone that authors, Lowell Cunningham and Sandy Carruthers had in the comic book series of the same name, in which, this movie is loosely based on. Don't get me wrong, I still like the cynicism & more grounded nature of the comic book, but a boogeyman like version, 'Men in Black' fighting the supernatural & brainwashing people to commit mass-school shooting, might not, be the right amount of family-oriented science fiction comedy, this film really need to be successful. After all, it will be really hard to root for, a selfish organization, wanting to secretly control the world, rather than trying to save it. Thank goodness, director, Barry Sonnenfield went with the right direction, by making them, 'the Men in Black' heroic than self-centered a-holes in the action scenes and the case work. Nevertheless, the movie still has a few problems with some of the judgment calls, the agents do, throughout the film. Without spoiling, most of it, I never truly, understood, why, Agent K would neuralize J after meeting him for the first time if he was just going to recruit him the next day? Even, today, it really does bug me down. Regardless of that, the plot-holes in this movie are mostly pretty minor. They're not too jarring, not to enjoy the rest of the film. After all, I quickly forget, that the giant bug alien somehow, fit with Edgar's body, because how entertaining, this is. That's how, watchable, it is! In the end, No neuralyzer will be powerful enough to make you forget this theatrical experience! It's a movie that's worth travelling millions of lightyears for. It's worth probing, after!",/review/rw1444303/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2014,brchthethird,10," Highly entertaining and funny sci-fi/comedy
","I'm about 16 years late seeing this, and I saw the third one first (with no need for #2), but I must say that this is one of the most fun movie-watching experiences I've ever had. It was non-stop laughs and thrills from beginning to end. The element which stuck out to me as being done extraordinarily well was the writing, specifically the comic interplay between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. Their characters are so different, and yet play off each other so well. Even the smaller parts were well-written and played. Of particular amusement to me was the largely physical performance given by Vincent D'Onofrio as the main bad bug. You can tell he gave it his all with his awkward speech patterns and movements. It really seemed like he was adjusting to a human body, and it was all done with a sly sense of humor. The only thing I find lacking was some dated CG, but considering it came out over 15 years ago, it was fine. If anything it adds to the B-movie charm, and some of alien design was probably influenced by 1950's ""Creature Features"" anyway. All things considered, it was an absolutely incredible and enthralling viewing experience. It's just a shame I waited so long to check it out.",/review/rw1444303/?ref_=tt_urv

","I am very upset that most people take this movie too seriously This movie is just a nice comedy with a very intriguing subject. Most people try to find bug in this movie but i believe that they should just sit back and enjoy the great epic line. Let's be serious do you believe that a galaxy can be carried around a cat's belt or that ""Elivs is not dead he's just gone home"" ? For this reason I believe this is an excellent comedy with a Sf theme. I also appreciate that the acting is very good and the script is very nicely written.
