","I love ""JAG.""  That's just about all there is to say.  I got hooked on it one night after seeing the episode of ""Maggie Winters"" on which David James Elliott guest-starred.  The show has given me a new appreciation for the military, and I really like the diversity of the characters and storylines. (Of course, being a ""shipper,"" I love the UST between the two main characters, but that's not the only reason I watch the show.)",/review/rw3101719/?ref_=tt_urv

","JAG (Judge Advocate General) is one of my favorite shows.  Week after week we see our invincilble-gungho hero and somewhat aloof romatic Harmon Rabb Jr (David James Elliot), pursue terrorists, prosecute, convict, defend and acquit: not-always-innocent scumbags, incompetent sailors and marines, and even his best friend.  Its hard to believe Elliot is Candadian born, playing a top American Hero.",/review/rw3101719/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2004,caspian1978,," A Few Good Men + Navy Seals = JAG
","JAG is one of the better military dramas on television. The cast is as  good as the weekly story lines and production value. Although many are  not a fan of the series, its hard to say that the series hasn't  produced a number of quality episodes. Also, Catherine Bell is amazing!  Eye candy with a pulse, Catherine Bell is fun to look at and can act.  Her Demi Moore character as the pretty but witty lawyer adds to the  series. Many leading women who are considered to have amazing physical  assets are not always terrific actors. Catherine Bell is an exception.  Although she is a supporting character in JAG, she could have been the  star of the series and had just as good reviews.  JAG is a fun and also serious television show that has a strong  audience base of fans.",/review/rw3101719/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2003,sawyertom,," Great Show!!!
","This is one of the few shows I make an effort to watch every week. I like the interplay and chemistry between the characters, whether it is the leading two or the rest.The lesser known characters and guests stars play their roles well. Whethger it's Bud, Chedweggen, Singer or Gunny I like the roles and the characters. In fact the less popular characters are as neccessary to the show as the two leads. Who didn't feel sad for the pain of his character and his family when Bud lost his leg in Afghanistan? You get the chance to know and in some cases not just love, but strongly dislike the characters.While I am not big into lawyer shows, the military aspect and background makes it much better and different with political,military and possible combat situation. I was a fan of the show before Catherine Bell arrived and have remained so. The chemistry between Mac and Harm is great. I just hope they don't kill one of them off when the show has run its course. The show is a sterling example of our best and brightest doing their jobs day in and day out where the rules are different and its in a realm many Americans do not understand or know about. This has to rank as one of the best tv series' about the military.JAG is A1 in my book. I hope it goes on for a few more years!",/review/rw3101719/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2000,Lassie-5,8," Action Packed, and Intense!
","JAG is very accurate in terms of the military point of view but also is very exciting and leaves you guessing to the very end.  I see very few errors in the military sense, i almost never see any problems with uniforms and the such.  Cmdr. Rabb and Lt. Col. MacKenzie make a great team and if they aren't on the same team it leaves things even more exciting!  Great show, and well worth an hour each week.",/review/rw3101719/?ref_=tt_urv

","I started watching JAG about a year ago. I fell in love with the show immediately. The episodes are well written, humorous, and sometimes controversial. I am also a huge Navy fan, so it definitely attracts my attention when shows revolving around the military air. However, please don't let that last comment sway you if you are not as gung-ho about the military as I am. The show is essentially ""Law & Order"" (another one of my favorites) with the Navy as the backdrop. The characters are very well developed, and they grow with each episode. Too often, shows err by keeping their characters stagnant. If you haven't watched an episode yet, try it! I don't think you'll be sorry.",/review/rw3101719/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 1999,jacksonc,," Good show - need more like it.
","It surprises me (assuming the show is reasonably accurate) how relatively little the Navy has changed since I got out of it 31 years ago. I assume the show gets some cooperation from the Navy, anyway it's worth watching. I have yet to see a bad episode. My only criticism is there is a tendency to wrap up an episode too quickly sometimes and there is too much time spent on romance and not enough on action (wow, I sound like I am about ten years old. Hmm.)",/review/rw3101719/?ref_=tt_urv

","When 'JAG' first aired on British television back in early 1996, I was hooked. As a huge fan of shows such as 'Law and Order', it was a dream come true finding a series that had all the action of a military programme and the intelligence of a courtroom drama rolled into one. The characters were also likable and well-portrayed with David James Elliott's Harmon Rabb being stubborn yet just and dedicated to Navy and his country and Tracey Needham's character Meg Austin being his talented, determined partner who, after the first season, was replaced by Sarah Mackenzie-- a tough, aggressive Marine-- played by Catherine Bell. It was always thrilling and engaging to watch Rabb and co investigating various crimes involving the Navy and Marine, often cases that bore resemblance to military news happening in reality, then having to argue their case in court.",/review/rw3101719/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2010,classicalsteve,5," Not Quite ""Top Gun"" Meets ""A Few Good Men"": Suffers From Too Much Military Cliché
","Is this an original show or the television equivalent of an army-navy recruiting poster? What made the movie ""A Few Good Men"" such outstanding cinema was its willingness to steer clear of obvious military cliché. Sure you can have the fanatical colonel who was a disciple at Patton's knee but there's also ingredients in his character that makes him different. Jessup certainly had the passion of a Patton but also the contempt for authority of a Nixon. But JAG offers the hot-headed and sweating military officer whose veins pop out of his neck ad infinitum that has been seen so many times that it's a textbook study of stereotypes to avoid. Budding screenwriters take note. (Take note of a similar character in the recent film ""Avatar"".) But in JAG few characters are anything more than these caricatures who are exactly as you would expect them.",/review/rw3101719/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2005,mm-39,," I only watched 2 or 3 shows
","I only watched 2 or 3 of the shows, and I do not like JAG! I see politically correct undertones, with a couple of the characters, mixed with over the top Hollywood plot twists. Kills the realism, I wanted to see. The show is a mix of the movies ""A few good men"" and ""Top Gun"" The show with the model style actors is like a Paul Mitchell commercial. The constant infighting, and personal problems would make the military nonfunctional. I find the show more dramatic than real. I hope the real military is not like this or we would be in trouble. TV is too standoffish and formulated. I wish Hollywood could be more imaginative, and less formulated. Too busy trying to push a cut and dry social message. The creativity, realism, excitement and even likable personalities is missing. I would like to see a more human side to the show, with dualities of the good, bad, and grey area of life. I know there are bad people in the world, but the show is too cut and dry like Walker Texas Ranger. Save a hour and watch another show",/review/rw3101719/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2001,apollyon48,9," Good action, and accurate
","JAG started out as a total shoot-'em-up, dynamic show on NBC.  It lasted almost a season, and was cancelled; CBS took it, and cleaned it up.  Now, what you see is a relatively accurate view of life as a staff corps officer in the US Navy and US Marine Corps.  Of course, it's still a little TOO action-packed for the real JAG Corps, in that most service lawyers will never take leave to travel into a foreign country to face insurgents or rescue POW's.  However, the issues JAG raises can surprise you - Cuban immigrants, political power struggles in Congress and the Fleet, criminals in uniform (just your average old murderers, thieves, secessionists and militias), racism, sexism, tradition versus progress, and the like. People are always drawn to military dramas, to action, and to law-inspired entertainment; JAG wraps them all into one.  The idea of having a gorgeous co-star, who is arguably tougher than the lead, and does NOT expect her looks to get her her way, is groundbreaking, which is unfortunate to happen this late.  As far as work goes, it's good to be attractive, but better to be good.  JAG illustrates this well.  Or, alternately, it's better to be right than popular, or, sometimes, the good guys win!",/review/rw3101719/?ref_=tt_urv

","When JAG first came on the air, I didn't watch it at all. My politics are a little left of center and I was not impressed by the first Bush administration sending our people to secure the Kuwaiti oil fields. I felt American lives were worth more than that. When a show came on a couple of years later that was advertised by seemingly endless shots of people in uniform saluting planes that were taking off, I just wasn't in the mood for what I took to be a John Wayne vision of the military as a bunch of patriotic action figures with no real depth as human beings.",/review/rw3101719/?ref_=tt_urv

","This has to be the most awesome series ever made for TV. I am not really sure what its about anymore, but it certainly rules. It seems like the authors don't give a f... about the continuity of the series, and just write whatever they think is cool, and that is AWESOME! Thumbs up. One thing that never changes though, is the expressions of the actors. Rabb: I'm thinking really hard, and I am really concerned. Mac: I'm cute, and I'm also smart. Bud: I'm confused :(. I love that. Then they go from being layers to superheroes who save the whole world. You could argue that it's unrealistic, but hey, it's America! ",/review/rw3101719/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2001,DarthMAD,," Highly recommend-Great Show- Good plots- Doesn't feel fake
","First, I would like to say that if you have never seen ""JAG"" before, you need to watch it, especially if you are even just remotely interested in the Navy, the Marines, the Military in general, military law, civilian law, good stories, Catherine Bell or any other of the actors/actresses. The stories are very interesting, especially so in the last two or three seasons. I have watched the show regularly for several years, and the stories seem real, not just a lot of shooting and talking with no plot, like some other shows(cough..Pensacola..cough..). Watching this show has given me insight into how many things work in the military, and also it has many cool things that fit into the story without making it plotless-like SEALs, Naval/Marine Aviation, and even Russia and the KGB. If you hadn't figured it out already, JAG stands for Judge Advocate General, the legal branch of the military. The show centers on a group of Naval/Marine lawyers and legalman(somewhat of researchers and assistants to the Judge Advocates(lawyers)). The characters evolve over time, and you see their characters change. For example, Lt. Bud Roberts, a junior naval officer that debuted on the show as a public affairs officer or something on an aircraft carrier that Harm(David James Elliot) and Mac(Catherine Bell) are sent to to investigate a crime. Bud later became a regular on the show, transferring to the office of the JAG and becoming a legalman. Later, he goes back to the carrier with Harm and Mac(this is much later), and falls in love with then-Ensign Simms, who has replaced him in what he did on the carrier, who later does what Bud did and transfers. Bud becomes a lawyer and is promoted to Lt. jg and later Lt., and the two are married and have a child together. The characters are also developed somewhat more subtly, such as when Bud's father, Master Chief Bud Roberts(Sr.), Ret. is court-martialed(is charged of a crime and brought to trial in military court. The Master Chief is a drunk and abused Bud and his brother Mikey when they were children. Bud Sr. didn't show up for his son's wedding. Mikey is eventually coerced to enlist in the Navy, becoming a fire controlman, and is eventually charged with crimes himself(Bud Sr. and Mikey both are found innocent). I went to all the trouble of registering and writing this so the least you can do is watch the show once. It's on 8pm EST on CBS(new and recent re-runs) Tuesdays, and 7pm EST every night on USA(re-runs from past seasons), excepting for special shows/events such as Big Brother and the Grand Open. It's a great show and I think you will like it, so at least watch it.",/review/rw3101719/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2006,xredgarnetx,6," OK legal drama
","I'd like to tell you I'm crazy about JAG, but it's not a show to be crazy about. A fairly cut-and-dried military legal drama, JAG follows the adventures of a pilot-turned-Naval lawyer and his fellow staffers. Catherine Bell, who joined the series in its second season if memory serves, has been a welcome addition as a JAG lieutenant colonel. She makes for great eye candy as opposed to the rather wooden and bland David Elliott as JAG Capt. Harmon Rabb. Elliott is one of those TV leading men who is likely to be on TV forever --- not that there's anything wrong with that. Elliott and Detective Stabler from LAW & ORDER: SVU could change places and no one would ever be the wiser. Anyhow, the show really picks up when it's not a straight courtroom story, such as a two-parter where Bell and Elliott go in search of his missing dad in Russia, and an episode that stuck them in the middle of a deadly situation aboard an aircraft carrier. The more interesting characters are actually played by two very good and versatile actors, Patrick Labyorteaux as a slightly timid JAG lieutenant who frequently serves as comic relief, and John (""Glitter Man"") Jackson as the flinty-eyed but ultimately softhearted admiral in charge of the department. It is a bit hard to believe the show has been on the air for 10 years, I must say. I'd rather have seen FIREFLY or THE PRETENDER go for 10.",/review/rw3101719/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2010,monkeyjb1988,9," Excellent show...worthy of birthing NCIS
","I'll be honest; I was only interested in JAG because it gave birth to my favorite show NCIS. I rented the two DVDs that contained the pilot episodes. Since my family liked NCIS, I waited to watch the pilot for NCIS and watch them with my family. In the meantime, I watched the episodes before the first part of the pilot (I got the discs one at a time). I got hooked fast. I liked how each episode felt interconnected, with either some plot points being set up before the episodes where they were center stage or past ones have at least a minor effect on the current episode. I also got to loving the characters. Harm and Mac are a great combo, with them fighting each other outside or inside of the courtroom one moment and buddies the next. I enjoyed Admiral Chegwidden and Bud, as well as Harriet. There was a great sense of humor. It may've been a little more serious than NCIS, but I say JAG is just as funny as NCIS. It got to the point where when I got to the NCIS pilot episodes, the reasons I even gave JAG the time of day, (SLIGHT SPOILER) I had hard time deciding who to root for: My old friend Gibbs, or my new one Rabb. Needless to say, JAG is an awesome show. I guess I shouldn't be surprised since NCIS is so good that JAG is good. I highly recommend this show. I think it's better than both Law & Order and CSI (no offense meant to fans of those shows).",/review/rw3101719/?ref_=tt_urv

","""JAG,"" in my opinion, is a pure CBS classic! I haven't seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it. However, I think it was always sad when someone was wrongly court-martialed. I always felt for the defendant. It's hard to say which episode was my favorite. It would probably have to be one of the Christmas episodes. Despite the fact that it was a long-running series, it would have been nice if everyone had stayed with the show throughout its entire run. It seems that no one stays with a show throughout its entire run. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong.

22 July 2003,jimmykoy,1," Unproductive
","It's difficult to overlook this show's lack of originality and predilection for mishmash. Just a TV version of A Few Good Men with dragged out courtroom scenes and implausible action sequences for ""variety"". Super lawyers flying jets, parachuting into enemy territory, exchanging gunfire with opposing forces, and being fluent in ten languages? Good God! Far more ridiculous is that many of the episodes not only duplicate story lines of other films, but blatantly include their footage as well. One episode about the IRA ripped off numerous clips from In The Name of The Father. Another, where David Elliot is held prisoner in China, was taken smack out of Red Corner. I even recognized recycled segments from The Hunt for Red October and Crimson Tide during several submarine episodes. After these major flaws, it's barely worth mentioning the immature dialogue and amateurish special effects, but there you have it. One star out of four.",/review/rw3101719/?ref_=tt_urv

13 July 2001,MichaelM24,," at one time it was a really great show
","JAG used to be one of my favorite shows. From week to week, I never missed a single episode. NBC cancelled it after the first season, but CBS quickly picked it up in time for a second season and it's still going strong. But is it worth it anymore? The early seasons were very good, with intriguing stories and interesting characters. As Harmon Rabe, David James Elliot was great in his role, displaying a certain combination of heroism and charm that made his character instantly likeable. Of the three female partners he's had, my favorite remains Meg Austin, played by the very pretty Tracey Needham. It was not long after her departure from the show that things started taking a bad turn. Catherine Bell joined as Sarah MacKenzie, but I just didn't like her as much as I liked Needham. They also added Patrick Labyorteaux as plucky comic relief Bud Roberts, and he was good for awhile, when he was just a small recurring character. But then he began to grow and get more screen time, and they even brought in his own love interest, and the couple eventually married. The show also started to become more interested in the characters' personal lives. While I'm all for character development, sometimes it just got too much. This past season had Sarah falling in love with a fellow lawyer from Australia, but then she began wondering if she was still in love with Harmon. Hey, come on. Stuff like that belongs in a soap opera, not an action show about Navy lawyers and their adventures on the ground and in the sky. And Bud just seemed to get more and more annoying with each episode. Eventually, I stopped watching all-together. When I caught the remaining few episodes from this past season, hoping it had improved since I tuned out, it just reminded me of why I stopped watching in the first place. It's a shame when shows you like have to slowly kill themselves, making you give up all hope for it getting as good as it used to be and completely tuning out. And it's especially a shame that that has happened to JAG, because at one time it was a really great show.",/review/rw3101719/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2014,rgomberg5,10," great show that went bad the last 2 seasons
","I started watching JAG in 1997 and it immediately became my favorite TV show. Vietnam era vet in the USAF too bad they didn't have more interaction with the Air Force. Anyways, a GREAT show. But then, because of circumstances I missed seasons 8, 9 and 10. Just recently I've been watching them on-line, and sadly, I have to say this great show got bad by season 9 and season 10 was almost unpalatable to watch. Why and how could this have happened. 1) Too soap opera, where there was more emphasis on the character interaction than the court cases, but the worst reason was 2) the characters became hokey and silly. Unreal. Like ""check me out, aren't I neat?!"" The only ones who had any sense of original propriety were Harm and MAC. The worst one was this Vic. It's OK to have some ""Hollywood license"" but what makes a character great is when they display INTEREST, in their lives, their work, with others. But when they become INTERESTING with their silly overdone personalities and quirks, they become a distraction and annoying and that's EXACTLY what happened. (this by the way, was WAY worse with NCIS - I couldn't get thru one episode the characters were so overdone and ""interesting"" instead of being interested. Only Mark Harmon was good) If they had just kept the brashness of Vic and used JUST that with his interactions that would have been good. But he became so overbearing. The new Marine JAG also didn't have to be so serious. In it's favor, the character development of Bud from bumbling geek (too overdone) to competent lawyer was good Also, so many handsome men and gorgeous women. Yes, to be expected from Hollywood but too unreal for the military. MAC is a little chest-heavy but has the face of an angel, she is so beautiful, although the short-crop hair of season 10 was a detraction. In any case, the 2 very best plot developments was the interaction between Harm and Mac AND the intricacies of the court cases. By the 10th season that got lost with the silliness of other characters and sub-plots. Season 3 through 6 were the best. All in all though, a TREMENDOUS show. Thank you Mr. Bellesario for your creation. Now if you can make a series of my book Point Of Return about the attempted assassination of President Reagan, THAT would be great!",/review/rw3101719/?ref_=tt_urv
