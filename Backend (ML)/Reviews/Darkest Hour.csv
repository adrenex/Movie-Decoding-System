","Ray Merrimen heads a crew of crooks who have successfully carried out multiple bank robberies in Los Angeles. Nick O'Brien heads a group of fairly wild cops who know who they are after, but haven't been able to catch them yet. Merrimen's crew have a big caper set up, O'Brien's squad has a man on the inside, and the scene is set for a cat and mouse crime caper movie.",/review/rw4490607/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2018,naregian,8," A fun, well paced movie that isn't pretending to be something it's not
","You can't enter a movie like this expecting some cinematic masterpiece. If you do so, you'll be obviously disappointed. Otherwise, it's a completely entertaining and fun ride through some surprisingly complex characters and an unexpectedly intricate game of cat and mouse.",/review/rw4490607/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2018,Fella_shibby,8," A one time watch crime thriller with awesome gun shot sequences n a clever but dangerous heist.
","Bank robbery, gun shot action sequences, trailer of this film n Gerard Butler, all these were suffice for me to view this n i was not at all disappointed. Saw this in a theatre. Comparisons with Heat n The Town will b inevitable but this movie is a solid crime thriller with enuff action/gun shot sequences n a dangerous n clever heist.
The final shoot-out scene will satisfy fans of Miami Vice (the shoot-out scene).
Another good aspect is that the pacing is good and it's never dull. 
Pablo Schreiber (Preservation) was convincing as an ex military leader turned into a robber.
Gerard Butler has a solid screen presence.
O'Shea Jackson Jr. gav a solid performance (spitting image of his father Ice Cube).
Action fans will not b disappointed. Looking forward to its sequel.",/review/rw4490607/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2018,claudio_carvalho,7," The Bank Robbery Capital of the World
","""Den of Thieves"" is an entertaining crime film with the showdown of Los Angeles County Sheriff ""Big Nick"" O'Brien and his team, and the criminal Ray Merrimen and his skilled gang of bank robbers. The plot is full of action and twists and the identity of the mastermind is a great surprise. The pace is perfect and the viewer does not feel the 140 minutes running time. The shootout recalls ""Heat"" and O'Brien´s personal drama with his wife is pointless and only a filler in the story. ""Den of Thieves"" is not a film for intellectuals and the target audiences will be very satisfied. My vote is seven.",/review/rw4490607/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2018,Fredolow,7," A solid attempt
","This film was a good romp and a solid 7 in my opinion. It crtainly doesn't deserve some of the ludicrous scores some people have rated it on here! Well acted and plenty of action. Then again I always thought Heat was overrated (probably would give that a 7 as well). I didn't feel it was overlong and din't get bored once. Yes, there were a few plot holes, but overrall this was good entertainment and so much better than much of the absolute dross that's doing the rounds at present. Don't listen to the naysayers on here, this one is well worth your time.",/review/rw4490607/?ref_=tt_urv

6 February 2018,Quinoa1984,8," a highly successful debut, especially for a January release
","Den of Thieves is a good example of a filmmaker taking inspiration visually and with the entire setting and mood and pitting of two sides - it's Heat, alright, it's damn Heat - and it actually being a strong effort. Christian Gudegast, who co-wrote and directed this 140 minute tribute to mandom in its bullet-flying, hard-drinking, muscle-bound weight-lifting tattooed uber-machismo, makes his debut as director here, and while it can never really live up to what Michael Mann did with his piece of ""Guy"" cinema, it also doesn't come with its high expectations and overly grandiose sense of epic pretention (and I don't mean that as a put down exactly for Heat, but... it is a movie very full of its importance, anticipated actor team-up besides). Den of Thieves cares about what it's trying to do, and that can go a long way for me in a world where a lot of filmmakers just come in and are lazy AF.",/review/rw4490607/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2018,Top_Dawg_Critic,7," More holes in the plot than a brick of Swiss cheese
","In Christian Gudegast's directorial debut, he did better in directing, than what he's know for, which is writing. There were more clearly obvious holes in the plot than a brick of Swiss cheese. His screenwriting of Gerard Butler's character was way too overboard. It was still a fun flick to see, but lost much potential with the sloppy writing. What is more laughable are all the 8, 9 and 10 reviews for this film... are the producers that dumb not to think anyone can click on a user name and see this film was the only one they rated - clearly fake reviews. This film is a generous and honest 7/10 from me.",/review/rw4490607/?ref_=tt_urv

24 April 2018,TheDevilsNotetaker,7," Classic Cops and Robbers flick- best firefights since Heat!
","This is a classic cops and robbers tale of the type you don't see anymore, plus being a huge fan of Butler loved it even more. Macho testosterone fueled action of the type Arnold, Stallone and Willis did back in the 80's and 90's. 
Butler is Far superior as a action star than Statham or The Rock. A true successor to those 80's icons.",/review/rw4490607/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2018,kluseba,9," Going back to the essence of classic action movies in a convincing way
",Den of Thieves might be a stereotypical movie about tough guys trying to outsmart one another but it's a really entertaining ride and worth the praise it gets.,/review/rw4490607/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2018,eddie_baggins,4," This sure is no Heat
","So it turns out all those people calling out Den of Thieves as a Heat-lite heist thriller are entirely correct, as Christian Gudegast's film riffs liberally from Michael Mann's 90's classic in its quest to become the newest king of the heist/crime epic.",/review/rw4490607/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2018,kirbylee70-599-526179,7," GOOD BUT DOESN'T BRING ON THE HEAT
",I love a good heist movie. There've been some classics in the genre. THE ITALIAN JOB and OCEAN'S ELEVEN stand out in my memory. So when I heard a new heist film was out called DEN OF THIEVES starring Gerard Butler I was in. Sad to say it didn't live up to my expectations though.,/review/rw4490607/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2018,carsonschmitt8,8," A Great Heist Film
","I went into Den of Thieves with low expectations, and walked out pleasently surprised with this movie! Im a huge heist movie fan and Michael Mann's 'Heat' is one of my favorite movies of all time. And while its true that Den of Thieves takes almost TOO MUCH inspiration from HEAT, it certainly delivers some unexpected turns that make the movie unpredictible and not generic. Sure, there are a lot of heist films out there, but I found Den of Thieves to bring some new elements into the genre that i have never seen, which i thought was pretty great. I was actually surprised with Gerard Butler's performance in this movie, he was actually REALLY good and played the role with commitment. The same goes for the other cast members, Great Acting! What really sold this movie for me, was the incredible action sequences. They are directed fantastically, and the firearms in the movie sound robust and authoritative, which gives the film a hard edge that i found to love. There are a few scenes in the film that feel out of place and some of the character development isn't really there, but overall i had a blast watching this movie and plan to see it again. Definately Recommend to anyone a fan of the genre.",/review/rw4490607/?ref_=tt_urv

10 March 2020,cricketbat,4," Too long, too many unlikeable characters
","The main issue with Den of Thieves is that you're not rooting for the thieves or the police, you're just rooting for the movie to end. That's the problem with making all your characters unlikeable-the viewer stops caring about what happens to them. There are some interesting moments, but they're bogged down by the extra-long runtime and the cliched plot points. I would be more annoyed, but I'm sure I'll forget about this movie very soon.",/review/rw4490607/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2018,fletcherc21,4," A B-Movie Unaware it is a B-Movie
","Den of Thieves is essentially a remake of Michael Mann's Heat, only Al Pacino and Robert De Niro are replaced by Gerard Butler and Pablo Schreiber. Round out the cast with a rapper and the son of a rapper and you have a tailor made B-movie that shouldn't take itself too seriously. At first, that is pretty much what you get, but then it slowly becomes clear that Den of Thieves is blissfully unaware that it is bad. There are several subplots that belong in a more serious movie that bloat the runtime up to a lengthy 2 hours and 20 minutes when it should be a full hour shorter. The script tries to get way too clever for its own good adding twists and turns that feel more ridiculous than enjoyable. First time director Christian Gudegast clearly demonstrates that his talents unfortunately lie elsewhere as he incorporates several shots that would feel heavy handed in even the most serious dramas.

","Action heist film, the baddies are planning to steal many millions from the impenetrable Los Angeles Federal Reserve, this is in the manner of 'Oceans 13'. The cops and robbers appear to be equal adversaries, this is in the manner of 'Heat'. We slowly realise that the cops are really bad as well",/review/rw4490607/?ref_=tt_urv

1 February 2018,cableaddict,2," Pathetic attempt at a ""Heat"" ripoff.
","Well, there's lots of gunfire & stuff blows up. If that floats yer boat, then get drunk and enjoy this tripe.
But bring along your smart phone, so you have something to do during the endless, boring scenes that add nothing at all to the plot.
Oh, and don't expect any of the action to make actual, you know, SENSE.
Just turn your brain off and enjoy the noise.
Or better yet, find something else to do with your evening.",/review/rw4490607/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2019,christophersarles,1," High hopes, no delivery
","This movie was a waste of 2.25 hours. No way on EARTH cops would endanger THOUSANDS of people To chase some guys who DIDNT COMMIT ANY CRIME (as far as they knew anyway) couple that with the most psychic cop in history of cop movies, a script written by a 12 yr old and you get the picture. This could have been a GREAT movie if the director simply didn't bank on the audience being SO stupid.",/review/rw4490607/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2018,cruise01,9," Better than expected with a great cast, action, and suspense.
","Den of Thieves has really caught me by surprise with being a really good heist film. I thought it was going to be poorly put together and dull performances from the looks of the trailer. But it proved me wrong. Director/writer Christian Gudegast threw the curve ball with setting the film up with gritty dark characters, gave the film an intense gun shoot out, and build the suspense with having this heist play out until the final moments. Den of Thieves is no Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in Heat. But it might as well be. ",/review/rw4490607/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2018,thebricks,9," Great movie ruined by a silly ending
","Absolutely loved the movie from start to finish. Every actor does a great job in this film. O'Shea Jackson, Paolo Schrieber, Gerard Butler did an incredible job. From start to finish, it was a riveting movie. If I ever rewatch it though, I'm going to ignore the end. It was terrible, a ripoff of The Usual Suspects. I don't even think it worked either, nor did it make sense. They had so much to work with and they just didn't follow up to create a great ending. There is an aspect of Gerard Butler's character and his team that is never answered in the movie. It's just dropped, but it was an element of the character that differentiated this film from other heist movies.",/review/rw4490607/?ref_=tt_urv
