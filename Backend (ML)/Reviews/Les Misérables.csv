26 September 2021,pickle-92642,9," Classic for the new generation? Yes!
","I just knew this was gonna be amazing. Such a great idea for an animated movie, even by Pixar's standards. It's truly a perfectly executed vision that did not disappoint on almost all levels. There's a lot of fun to be had with this, it's one of the funnier and more thought provoking Pixar movies. The scene where Bing Bong disappears is also extremely sad. I could also tell that this is one of Pixar's more mature films, about the struggles of growing up. It explored Nostalgia for most of the movie without even using the word. When sadness touched a core memory and turned it blue, it was a symbol for Riley feeling nostalgic for her best memories. In my book, this is yet another Pixar classic.",/review/rw6270808/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2021,Phil_Chester,," Not for young children
","I confess that I had to watch this twice before I could properly assess it. It's definitely not a young children's film, as there's precious little to entertain them, but it does have much to consider for older children and (young) adults. As a rumination on what drives us all through life, this is very effective, but I do feel that the story lacks something for making Riley so isolated in her world. Perhaps if she interacted a bit more in the story, this would be a more involving film, but the reflections on lost innocence do add some poignancy and lift this film slightly above average.",/review/rw6270808/?ref_=tt_urv

24 July 2015,TheLittleSongbird,10," Pixar's best film since Toy Story 3 and one of their finest overall
","Most of Pixar's films are wonderful (short films too), and while the three films made after Toy Story 3 weren't up to their top standards they were still better than most animation companies at their worst. Inside Out was nothing short of a masterwork, Pixar's best since Toy Story 3 and one of their best overall.",/review/rw6270808/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2015,matthewssilverhammer,10," Best Pixar Since Toy Story
","After some ho-hum years and too many sequels, Pixar is back and better than ever with Inside Out, a boldly unique animated film that renews our faith in what a giant studio can do with an original concept. Docter combines the strengths of his two Pixar masterworks here: the endless inventiveness of Monster's Inc. and the poignant strength of Up. A truly fantastic mixture of fantasy-adventure-comedy and small-family-drama, it's a genius work of conception, execution and emotion that will go down in the annals of Disney animation as an instant and enduring classic. It follows Joy, the leading-emotion of an 11-year-old girl, as she tries to navigate a big change in her young life. Much like Toy Story 3, we're shown the inherent difficulties of growing up through a fresh viewpoint, learning what makes you ""you"". It's a convoluted idea that's nearly impossible to explain, and yet Pixar nails it, perfectly shifting between its parallel universes with ease. The humor throughout will undoubtedly have kids and adults in equal stitches, with fantastic turns from everyone, notably Poehler, Smith, Black, and Kind. However, this film's high-point may be the multiple emotional gut-punches that will reduce parents to tears. That fearlessness to be gloomy is basically the thesis of the film: true joy comes when every emotion is allowed to be recognized and dealt with healthfully. It's quite a psychologically complex stance to take for a film that manages to be so kid-friendly. This wonderful balancing act helps make Inside Out worthy of the ""M"" word (masterpiece) and gives it the distinction of being Pixar's best since the unparalleled Toy Story.",/review/rw6270808/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2017,Sweetigal85,10," A brilliant depiction of adolescence
","As an adult, I love animated films but the trailers made this one look like it was really just for kids. I gave it a shot anyway and I didn't expect to love it--but it's depth absolutely shocked me. Not only is it a whimsical, funny film, but the poetry is off the charts.",/review/rw6270808/?ref_=tt_urv

21 September 2015,Giacomo_De_Bello,9," 9/10
","94 minutes of pure joy and emotion. A return to masterclass from pixar and not only that, probably their best work outside of Toy Story 1 and 2. This film does deserves every bit of praise it has got and more. I will say without hesitation that if you haven't seen this film, believe me you should.",/review/rw6270808/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2015,PipAndSqueak,1," Misery on a stick
","OK, playtime's over Pixar, now get over it. This film is so plainly a prequel – c.f. references to a 'puberty' button on the new 'emote' console in the character Rileys brain - you will fail to find anything of entertaining value for your 100 minute investment. You may harbour fond memories of Toy Story, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles and Ratatouille – all unique, funny, thrilling and entertaining. But, that is not what you will get with Inside Out. 'Joy', after all, is banished to long-term memory and can't get back in charge of the console. (Since when was a single emotion ever 'in charge' anyway?). Inside Out can be taken as a metaphor for the poor sops who work for the Disney Corporation. Yes, they started out with true optimism about the life journey they had chosen, (with Pixar). Then, all of a sudden they are 'taken over' by a less than friendly peer. To compound this, they are moved from their original 'playpen' to a new post industrial work lot. All is grim. Sadness takes hold and taints everything that is done. Even 'Joy' begins to sob with sadness and grief. Save us from this self-indulgent misery. Not only is it inappropriate as kiddie oriented movie fodder, those of us who are sentient, self-aware adults can do without this additional mock unhappiness. By the way, most human brains have a 'fat controller' who orchestrates proceedings keeping everything on an even keel – even if that is 'sadness' for a while. Riley's brain seems to be lobotomised – even before puberty has hit. Give this film a wide berth, in fact, it might be best if someone scuttles this ship before the pestilence it's carrying spreads.",/review/rw6270808/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2015,SquigglyCrunch,6," An Interesting Concept with a Handful of Inconsistencies
","Inside Out is the hit Disney-Pixar animated movie about emotions, specifically emotions living inside a person's brain in a somewhat human form and controlling how people react to things. It's an interesting concept, and for the most part it's presented well, but there are flaws for sure. ",/review/rw6270808/?ref_=tt_urv

24 June 2015,michaelRokeefe,3," Emotions...what are you doing?
","INSIDE OUT is a colorful animated feature that I doubt if Disney and Pixar realize is probably too complex for the viewers they intend to reach. Riley(Kaitlyn Dias)is an 11 year old girl, who is really upset with her mom(Diane Lane)and dad's(Kyle MacLachlan)decision to uproot and move the family to San Francisco. Riley is separated from her friends and is just not so happy with dealing with a new house, school and city. She would rather be back in Minnesota playing hockey.",/review/rw6270808/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2015,planktonrules,9," Aside from a few slow portions in the middle, a marvelous film from Disney.
","One important note: If you go see ""Inside Out"" be sure to get there on time so that you can see the short that precedes it, ""Lava"". It's an amazing short film--one of the best CGI shorts I've ever seen. But, like ""Inside Out"", its audience really is adults, not kids.",/review/rw6270808/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2016,PennyReviews,3," Good enough
","Inside Out is the story of how emotions work in our minds (in a girl's mind to be precise). The emotions, Joy and Sadness, wonder around the girl's mind, aiming to find a way back to the controlling room where they can help her through a big change in her life. The story is interesting, but it gets boring towards the end, as the one twist follows the other. Joy is a control freak, dictating every emotions' move and pretty much dominating the girl's mood. Other than that, and the overjoy-full mood, Inside out is funny and entertaining. The colours are vivid and the action enough to make a good movie. But I guess the whole control room, memories, dreams etc etc are kind of confusing, with all the islands and the maze. So 3 out of 10.",/review/rw6270808/?ref_=tt_urv

","I don't have a lot of reasons to give. All I can say is that every other Pixar movie I have rated a 10. I love animations, and the artwork for this one is top notch. Pixar has been terrific at delivering great stories until this one. I even love CARS, which many others found fault with. I wasn't in a bad mood when watching this one. I had great expectations. It's simply sucks. It's made a lot of money and has over an 8 rating, so I'm in the minority here. I want to caution someone like me to save their money so please read the other reviews with a 1 star rating. Maybe that will help guide you to a different movie to watch.",/review/rw6270808/?ref_=tt_urv

","what a complete waste of time - read all the wonderful reviews that are misleading, obviously these are the people that go to Disneyland about 20 times a year - incredibly slow paced, especially after ""JOY"" & ""SADNESS"" get sucked into another dimension where they befriend Bing Bong, Riley's imaginary friend. Wow - it took forever. Bing Bong is the films JAR JAR BINKS, just so annoying and irritating. This is a definite G rated film. I did not see any adult themes whatsoever. This movie makes Winnie The Pooh look like a horror film. This is for 12 year old girls. Parents are so delusional(thanks for the positive reviews Mom & Dad)",/review/rw6270808/?ref_=tt_urv
