22 February 2000,Buddy-51,," conventional romance with a surprise brave ending
","In ""Forces of Nature,"" Ben Affleck stars as Ben, a repressed, buttoned-up stuffed shirt writer who, through a series of natural and manmade mishaps, ends up spending the several days before his impending marriage in the company of a freespirited, totally spontaneous and liberated young woman named Sarah, played by Sandra Bullock.",/review/rw0530087/?ref_=tt_urv

31 January 2003,bob the moo,," Planes, Trains andvery few laughs
","Two days before his wedding, Ben's grandfather has a heart attack while dancing with a stripper.  Due to the delay Ben's fiancé, Bridget, flies ahead to Savannah to make the preparations.  Ben catches a plane later the day and meets free-spirit Sarah.  When the plane is in a minor crash the two join up to head to Savannah by any way other than road, leading to one `comic' delay after another.  Meanwhile the two become a little closer and Ben begins to doubt that marriage is for him.",/review/rw0530087/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2007,lastliberal,7," Sometimes the people we meet change us forever.
",I cannot imagine anything that would be more fun than taking a road-trip with Sarah Lewis (Sandra Bullock). That is why I really think this film is worth watching. Ben Holmes (Ben Affleck) got something that very few of us ever get to experience - a couple of days with someone who will truly liberate us from our staid conventions and open our eyes to a world that we never knew even existed.,/review/rw0530087/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2005,csauer,10," I'm sorry, I liked it
","I read the user comments and was reluctant to view this movie. Well I'm sure glad I went against the crowd. This is a good movie! What more could you ask for. (Sandy is great) The scene I adored is when Sarah is beckoning Ben to come and dance. If a women ever did that to me I would run to her. I really enjoyed the ending but I won't discuss that. There were enough laughs to keep it lite and enjoyable. The gay bar was a real hoot. Ben did a superb acting job doing his dance all be it Sandy does'st hurt the eyes. The one thing I liked is this movie is not a tear jerker. Most of Sandy's movies have me shedding tears like a water works. The story line surely shows that people live their lives in very different ways and that gives the movie credence. What's to not like? Easy to follow has Sandy in it what more could you want? One criticism, what did they use to put on sandy's eye makeup on a putty knife?",/review/rw0530087/?ref_=tt_urv

13 April 2000,TeaBunny,," Surprising, better than I expected
","After reading the back of the video box about the ""whirlwind romance"" and the plot about Ben heading towards his wedding and meeting a ""free-spirited"" woman who teaches him how to have fun, I didn't have much interest in seeing it. It sounded extremely trite, and I'm not too interested in Bullock or Affleck either. I was very surprised at the sharp dialogue and humor. And even though every frame of this film looked like a jeans commercial, I *liked* the cinematography and hip, colorful locales. Of course the whole thing was totally unbelievable and the various events that occur are a bit overdone... but I liked it anyway. I am a sucker for road movies, so that was part of the appeal for me... traveling, different locations (the laundromat, the snack bar with the giant globe and the Big KMart at 2AM). I expected Ben's bride-to-be to be a crashing bore or uptight priss, so the audience would root for Sarah and Ben. But she was funny and sharp also, and you don't feel like the marriage would suck all the life out of Ben as it seemed to have for others in the film. All of the things Ben overhears about marriage sucking is pretty funny. I only post here about movies that make an impression on me, whether good or bad... and this one made an impression. I liked it. And no one is more surprised about that than me.",/review/rw0530087/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2006,mgsmoviesniper,," I highly recommend this movie
","""Forces Of Nature"" got my attention from the start and didn't let up until the end. Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock star as airline passengers brought together by the forces of nature while Ben Affleck's character Ben Holmes is on his way to his wedding. Maura Tierney portrays his fiancée and she brought life to a character that was in the background. This is the perfect set up for ""Forces Of Nature"" because it seems when Ben and Sarah Lewis make progress; the forces of nature somehow get in the way.",/review/rw0530087/?ref_=tt_urv

11 January 2004,liannesang,10," This movie is so quirky and offbeat that it's really good!
","I don't know why many people diss this movie because it's actually really good.  Who better to have than Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock?  They are perfect in their roles as ""Ben"" and ""Sarah"".  But I have to say if Sandra Bullock wasn't in this movie, it wouldn't be as enjoyable as it is.  There are a lot of laughs but not so much that it goes over the top and there is a lot of drama in it too.  It's a perfect mix.  The camera angles make this movie very unique too.",/review/rw0530087/?ref_=tt_urv

6 September 2005,moonspinner55,2," The 'Force' isn't with these two...
","Ben Affleck, about to be married, is shaken up by a plane accident and gets involved with one of the other passengers (Sandra Bullock, forcing herself to act insane). Who is to blame for this inept, ugly morass? It is so badly edited, when I looked in the credits it wasn't to read the editor's name--it was to see if the person actually took the credit! Rife with clichés, contrivances, and Sandra Bullock in raccoon eye-makeup, the movie doesn't even concern itself with creating chemistry between the two main characters. Laughs are non-existent: the scene in the gay bar with Affleck might have gotten a big laugh if it weren't so stupid (the bar patrons--a big rowdy bunch of them!--shout for Affleck to strip and start digging out their cash). It's not supposed to have any significance other than getting Ben to loosen up a little, but the direction of the whole scene is wrong-headed, and the outcome is unseen because the idiot editor cuts away...or was that all the film he had? It's a small moment but it's typical of this film, an amateurish piece of pop-goods that wants to be an edgy modern comedy but doesn't have any guts. It is tailor-made for the bottom shelf at your video store. * from ****",/review/rw0530087/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2007,DavidSim240183,7," Atypical rom-com. Not without its moments
","Forces of Nature is a very unusual romantic comedy. Unusual in that it seems determined to avoid all the natural conventions you would expect from the genre. In fact as I watch it, there's something about the film that places it just a little outside the mainstream. I don't mean it would be embraced by the indie crowd. Especially with stars like Sandra Bullock and Ben Affleck at the helm. But it is not your standard rom-com.",/review/rw0530087/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2021,george_mavridis,7," Still horrible ending in 2020
","I really can't make sense from the ending of the movie. I have read a bunch of reviews that ""explain"" why Ben didn't stop his marriage but any of them really make sense to me. The whole movie was supposed to make Ben realise that he isn't ready for a marriage right? Instead we have Sarah waiting for him to come and kiss her after stop his wedding, while he was unexpectedly saying Brisget that he loves her. The problem is not that the story doesn't have a typical, rom-com happy end, the problem is that the film has a happy end that doesn't make sense and nobody (except married people) enjoyed it.",/review/rw0530087/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2007,longislandlloyd,6," Hollywood Morality
","I think the song ""Love the One You're With"", which played prominently in ""Forces of Nature"", told the entire tale. Few Hollywood celebs take relationships and marriages seriously, and they seem to last only until the next casting comes along. I never saw a movie with so many negative remarks about marriage, and with Ben Affleck's romance record, he could have written the script all by himself. While the movie had its funny and ""oh, not again"" moments, there just seemed to be that underlying feeling that Ben's marriage may never happen and he has discovered that his buddies are right..""Why tie yourself down to one woman when there are so many others out there interested in you"". Even when Ben decided that he'd better do the right thing and marry his fiancée, he just didn't seem to make the decision with all his convictions. It's definitely ""art imitating life"" when it comes to love commitments in Hollywood. As far as all the symbolism many people have written about here, it's just hard to take any of it seriously in this love farce of a movie. The only symbolism that I took to heart was Stephen Stills' song of free love. ""So if you're down and confused (and just waiting for something to do"") on commitment and marriage, and you think that Sandra Bullock is hot enough to break up a romance, then ""Forces of nature"" is the perfect movie for you.",/review/rw0530087/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2013,mdf615,9," Are People Too Shallow to Appreciate this Movie?
","I am stunned by how many people are disappointed by the ending of this movie, saying it is depressing, unexpected, unwelcome, dissatisfying, etc... I guess these folks think that being stood up on the day of one's wedding makes for a feel-good movie!!! The ending affirms the beauty and magic of real love, an emotion that is exalted and pure, and lies above fleeting whims and senseless, immature attractions. Ben realizes that Bridget is his one, true love. Yes, he was distracted by the human tornado that is Sarah, but upon seeing his fiancée once again, he remembers all the reasons he fell in love with her to begin with, and he recognizes that what Sarah said earlier was right: all the things he found exotic about this stranger would one day be all the things he hated about her. He had no true bond with her, they could never sustain a life together, and he was smart enough to realize that before he threw away the best thing in his life. He comes full circle at the end: Sarah tells him not to be polite, and to be honest, just like his fiancée did at the beginning of the movie. For him, honesty is admitting that Bridget is the only one for him. By the way, Maura Tierney is one of the greatest actresses of her generation. She deserves continued success.",/review/rw0530087/?ref_=tt_urv

21 March 1999,rose-58,1," confused collage of meaningless moments
","This movie seems as if someone had a cute idea for a movie, thought of two or three funny possibilities, hired a good cast, then turned the whole thing over to a really bad screenwriter and even worse director.  The director filmed a screwball romantic comedy as if it were a dark, artsy film---weird camera angles, blue filtered shots, lingering, close up looks at raindrops. Steve Zahn was good, as always.  Ben Affleck was charming, sweet, almost shy; he was perfect for a romantic comedy.  Sandra Bullock struggled along valiantly with a character who was supposed to be zany, but whose wackiness consisted of things like madly kissing a husband she hated, abandoning her child, going on carnival rides, offering to strip for money, and bumming a ride with a fellow airline passenger.  The script had very few funny lines; there was no physical comedy; it was boring.  It introduced potentially funny situations, then cut them off before they could develop.  To top it all off, the ""twist"" at the end was a slap in the face to anyone expecting a fun romantic comedy.  If you saw the trailer for the movie and liked it, as I did, my advice is: don't go to the movie.  It will only spoil a nice trailer.",/review/rw0530087/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2007,anton-79,5," Interesting concept, but not well narrated
","Looking at this film from the ending, I think that the intention was that this is mainly a story about Ben's cold feet before a wedding, with the moral that worrying to much if you are marrying the right person is not helpful (because you cannot know in advance).",/review/rw0530087/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 1999,bababear,," This is why we go to movies.
","FORCES OF NATURE was like a breath of fresh air.  Not because of the leads: Sandra is still stuck in her 'aren't I adorable/don't you just love me' mode, which will doom her to Norma Desmond status in just a few years, and poor Ben is as clueless as ever.  But this has such great casting otherwise and tremendous special effects, plus a script that is a lot more thoughtful than you'd expect in a movie like this.",/review/rw0530087/?ref_=tt_urv
