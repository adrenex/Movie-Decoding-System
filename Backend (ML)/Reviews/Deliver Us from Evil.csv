9 January 2018,michaelRokeefe,9," New energy for the franchise. Very good movie.
",This is the third chapter of the acclaimed Planet of the Apes franchise. Matt Reeves directs and this episode that is nice on the eyes to watch. Enough activity to keep your interest and story line that moves along at a good pace for a two hour twenty minute movie.,/review/rw3844257/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2017,urthpainter,9," everyone who gave this film a 1* rating?
","Seriously needs to reevaluate the criteria by which they review films. Why? Because giving this film 1/10 says, ""I am ignorant of quality film making."" Descriptions like slow and boring just don't cut it! Opinions like this are an act of ultimate laziness - the inability to mentally invest in the passive experience of a film. An inability to invest in a well made film that has something to say no less.",/review/rw3844257/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2018,Uncle-Feggster,8," Too many 1 star ratings....somethings up
","Sometimes, when I read reviews about movies on IMDb, I see patterns in the writing. Similar text, similar structuring and similar indignant shouting. Read enough of them and you see that quite often there is an underlying reason why the reviews are marking a film so low. Be it political or religious. Very rarely is it actually about the quality of the film. More often it is about a personal issue that the reviewer has - and so he vents his anger in the only way that's he knows how - a screaming one star rating and a list of reasons why the film is the worst he has ever seen. Makes you wonder what kind of a strange person would do that.",/review/rw3844257/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2019,IamNiyatiJoshi,9," Absolutely epic movie and trilogy.
","War (as arguably miss-titled as it is) is once again on top of its game, with a more intense story, the effects looking better than ever, some genuine surprises and shocking moments, and the A-game acting. This trilogy has truly ended on a high note",/review/rw3844257/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2019,jacobjohntaylor1,9," This is a great movie.
",This a great movie. Down of the planet of the apes is better. But still this movie has great acting. It also has a great story line. 7.5 is underrating this movie I give it 9 out of 10.,/review/rw3844257/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2019,ma-cortes,7," Nice third installment with epic moments , noisy action , thrills , and overwhelming battles
","This War of the Planet of Apes is an intense and exciting film with great visual effects by means of Motion Capture technology . The picture delivers enough energy and turns out to be an impressive flick full of fighting, action , battles and suspense . An acceptable Ape movie with huge production design in which the performers are very fine , and special mention for Andy Serkis who provides the sturdy central pivot the tale surely needs . There concerns Caesar (masterfullly incarnated by Andy Serkis, Gollum alter-ego) , a chimpanzee who gained human-like intelligence and emotions from an experimental drug that rose to a super-intelligent chimp who leads an ape upheaval . As Caesar and his apes : gorilla , chimpanzee and orangutan , are forced into a deadly conflict with an army of humans led by a ruthless Colonel . Along the way the apes suffer unimaginable losses and Caesar (Andy Serkis), a Chimpanzee raised like a child by the drug's creator (first outing with Will Rodman: James Franco) . Here Caesar wrestles with his darker instincts and starts his own mythic quest to avenge his kind that is being submitted in slavery and apartheid . Later on , Caesar is locked and seeking justice for his fellow primates , as they carry out a riot in which simians turn the tables . As simians , Chimpanzees , gorillas uprising violently every human in sight . As the journey finally brings them face to face, Caesar and the Colonel (Woody Harrelson) are pitted against each other in an impressive battle that will determine the fate of both their species and the future of the planet.",/review/rw3844257/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2020,conroyart-46646,10," Ignore the ignorant
","Don't normally review. Some like a film, some do not. But when I see this film given 1* I have to say something. Ignore such people. They enjoy the power of criticising the efforts of others while having, I imagine, little talent of their own. The film is a masterpiece. A war film, comedy, tragedy and biblical. What more can one ask for? Enjoy!",/review/rw3844257/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2017,namashi_1,9," A Mighty Winner!
","The third installment in the Planet of the Apes reboot series, 'War for the Planet of the Apes' is a terrific film, that is grim & thought-provoking, and bravely pushes the Blockbuster Genre, by offering more soul than gimmicks. With a Sterling, Oscar-worthy Performance by Andy Serkis as Caesar, the leader of the apes, to a Screenplay that is dark & powerful & Deft Direction, this recent box-office & critical smash is among the year's best films!

17 July 2017,larrymeers,10," Don't understand all the hate.
","Before i saw this movie i looked at some people's opinions about it and i saw mostly negative reviews, so i was really nervous going into this movie thinking that i would have had the same reaction to it and seriously i have no idea what those people are talking about.

12 July 2017,bob-the-movie-man,9," Putting the ""ape"" in ""The Great Esc-ape""
","2011's ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" was the one of the big movie surprises for me of that year. With staggeringly good mo-cap for the apes and a touching and memorable story it was for me was a 10* classic. Â 2014's ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" whilst also good took a slight backward step. With ""War"", the form is back almost to top notch, and this is a summer release at last deserving of the suffix ""blockbuster"".",/review/rw3844257/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2019,nicerep,10," Someone has it in for the movie makers
","A quick look at the bad reviews shows that most of them were written around the same time, mid July 2017 and most all of them are 1 star ratings, an obvious attack on the movie makers and nothing to do with the quality of the film. I urge you to ignore these fake reviews and read instead those written after the summer of 2017!",/review/rw3844257/?ref_=tt_urv

11 October 2017,AnishMisra,10," Planet of Apes 3 review
","War for the Planet of the Apes is a film directed by Matt Reeves. I loved the first 2 films of this series. And was looking forward to this film for quite some time. Finally when I saw the film, I can definitely say I'm Spechless. This film is definitely one of the best 2017 has to offer.",/review/rw3844257/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2017,tmaria1,9," Get us back to the original
",As much as I liked this trilogy and this movie I really wish they would lean more towards getting us closer in time to the original 1968 version. I understand these are prequels but if they are going to continue with these then I suggest fast forwarding a thousand years or more to just before when Heston arrives in the original 1968 classic. War was a good movie. I truly liked everything about it. I see the humans turning mute setting us up for the future. What I really want to see next is what caused the future nuclear holocaust? Show me what went on in the forbidden zone prior to Heston and crew arriving. Show us how the mutants from Beneath the Planet of the Apes came to be. If the ending of this movie was a foreshadowing of the lake that Heston crash lands in then we are going to have a problem. Remember he landed outside of New York City not over the mountains near California. Perhaps another trilogy can tie up these loose ends.,/review/rw3844257/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2019,ixmeraz,10," I am addicted

27 July 2017,Sparse,8," A Poetic Final Chapter
","War for the Planet of the Apes isn't the masterpiece I hoped it'd be. As someone deeply invested in the characters however, it's still a highly satisfying, emotionally- profound final chapter for the trilogy. War also compensates for its relative lack of allegory/social commentary with an intricately complex (and rather poetic) character/story structure, adding new merits to the franchise even if dissatisfying others.

11 July 2017,iamjacksmoviechannel,10," The Capper to a classic trilogy
","War for the Planet of the Apes, the third film in what I would call a classic trilogy, probably the best all-around set of three we've gotten in the 21st Century, hands down. ",/review/rw3844257/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2017,KOOLAIDBRO,9," You literally root against the humans. That's great writing.
","I am only reviewing this because I am surprised at all the bad reviews for this movie. I loved it and found it to be a great ending to a great trilogy. It's not as good as dawn of the planet of apes, but it is good. Dawn is the empire strikes back of the franchise. It's really good none the less. It pulls on every heart string. There was times I yelled out something I can not say on here from anger. There was times I felt redemption. It's kind of like watching game of thrones. Anyways do not listen to the hate for this movie. It's not action packed and it's not all happy. If that's what you want do not watch, but if you like a great story and a movie that takes you on an emotional roller coaster ride then watch it!",/review/rw3844257/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2020,matthewleighton,10," Best trilogy!
","This film is outstanding the best in the trilogy, planet of the apes is the best trilogy in history these film are incredible. But this film is the best of the 3, its a sad, intense, powerful and so much more. Definitely should watch this film (watch Rise, and Dawn first to help understand ceasar's journey and how he survives) 10/10.",/review/rw3844257/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2017,Jared_Andrews,9," The War for Caesar's Soul
","If you have forgotten what happened in the first two movies, don't worry. ""War"" opens with a clear and concise recap of the events leading up to this movie. It's a smart way to commence and an indication of the thoughtful nature with which this movie was made.",/review/rw3844257/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2017,TheLittleSongbird,5," Has the spectacle but not the brains or heart
","First thing off the bat, 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' and 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' were thoroughly enjoyable films, more so than expected them to be, though they were not quite masterpieces. 'Rise' was exceptionally well made and very entertaining, provoked thought and had heart. 'Dawn' had a bigger and bolder approach and delivered just as much, if not more so, on the brains and heart.",/review/rw3844257/?ref_=tt_urv

16 August 2017,miguelneto-74936,10," Closes the trilogy in a spectacular way.
","The closing of this trilogy could not have been better, War for the Planet of the Apes closes the trilogy with key and manages to be the best one of the trilogy also, not only one of the best films of the year, but also one of the best of this decade, the trilogy Modern Planet of the Apes is one of the best trilogy I've ever seen, War for the Planet of the Apes starts already frenetic with a very good action scene, and we begin to better understand what goes on the screen, the plot is very good, But he does have a few forced scenes, but that does not hinder development, Ceasar is one of the most well-developed characters of the last year, and that owes much to Andy Serkis who embodied the character, and in my opinion he deserves a lot of Oscar, I hope the academy sees this, the direction is again of Matt Reeves who directed the previous one and he does a great direction, Woody Harrelson does an excellent job as the Colonel, he is a great and bad and has good motivation The CGI is amazing, the Monkeys are very well done, the movie even with several sad moments it is has several fun and funny moments, but the jokes are very well placed, the soundtrack is great, the dialogues are very good, The film hits the dramatic moments and the ending is satisfying.

27 October 2017,dcarsonhagy,10," Simply the Best of the Franchise
","Believe it or not, I debated for a long time as to whether or not I was going to watch this. I found the original (in this genre's reboot) to be better than the original, but found its sequel to be simply boring, overrated, and almost unwatchable. And then, there's the third installment.",/review/rw3844257/?ref_=tt_urv
