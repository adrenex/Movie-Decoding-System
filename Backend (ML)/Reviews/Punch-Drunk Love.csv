20 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," The Grey
","I'll start off by saying this movie is not made for everyone. This is about a movie based off of survival instincts between man and nature. First time watching this, It's a thrill chiller. If you're wanting a movie that's depressing 90% of the time, this is the movie for you. This movie grasps way beyond an imagination of dealing with nature's worst environments after a plane wreckage. Traveling through the coldest winter, little to no food, wounded, tiredness and cold, it's a rough marry go-round. Not only the harsh environment for the remaining survivors have to deal with, the movie decided to throw in Northern Arctic Wolves and that made the survivors a living nightmare of hell. Only reason why I gave the movie a 8 star was Ottway (Liam Neeson) was a huntsman. His job subscription should have made him an expert of dealing with the current situation a little more suitable than just trying to survive with some ideas. None of the less, excellent movie for drama watchers.",/review/rw6798349/?ref_=tt_urv

","I would like to start off this review by saying that this movie is not perfect, but the negative hype that it received was not warranted. The first time I watched this film, I was simply disappointed by the ending, because lets be honest, I wanted to watch Liam Neeson kick some wolf ass. I was mad, angry, and bitter about how the film ended. But fast-forward a few months to the second watch, and this is where the real beauty of this film presented itself to me.",/review/rw6798349/?ref_=tt_urv

27 January 2012,cadillac20,9," Fantastic Man-versus-Nature Film Will Have You On The Edge Of Your Seat
","A lot of people will complain about this film not having enough action or being too introspective or whatever other reason they can think of not to like the film. But the reality is, this is a fantastic movie about survival when there is little to no chance of doing so. In fact, the film speaks about a lot of things. It speaks about man versus nature, about being male, and about the human spirit's need to persist. What this film is not is an action-adventure or one about Liam Neeson punching wolves. No, the trailer really pulled a number on anyone expecting a loud movie about wolf killing.",/review/rw6798349/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2012,rumbleinthejungle,7," Survival tale goes against the grain
","I'm surprised to see the number of negative reviews here and also surprised as to the number of comparisons to Lee Tamahori's 'The Edge'; a completely different type of film in my opinion despite the similar locales. Unrelentingly bleak with almost no glimpse of warmth ( both literally and figuratively!) during the whole running time it's easy to see that this film will not be for everyone. The absence of a heroic ending and the depiction of the absolute fragility of man (and futility of machismo) will also serve to divide audiences even further. But, if you can get past these things and can overlook a couple of plot points that might seem illogical you are in for one heck of visceral cinematic ride. The story is simple - Liam Neeson is a distraught widower contracted to shoot Wolves in the Alaskan oil fields. On a flight to the mainland for R&R the plane goes down in the middle of nowhere and he and six other passengers are the only remaining survivors. The motley group must contend with a grim situation that see's them dropped in a freezing barren wasteland with no food, shelter or weapons and a pack of hungry Timber Wolves keen to pick them off one by one. I liked the AO Scott review for this film in which he pointed out that the film posed and answered a number of theological and existential questions in a very quiet and dignified way. Quite un-Hollywood. This is no Tom Hanks picture and unlike the aforementioned The Edge it's never for a minute considered an option for the men to make a stand against the Wolves in the way that Charles and Bob did with Bart the Bear in that film. They are completely at the mercy of the environment and it's predators whilst also being aware of the increasing futility of their plight. The film goes against the grain right from the outset and it's a stylistic decision from the creators that simultaneously elevates it above many of it's counterparts but also probably limits it's broader appeal - an early scene immediately after the crash where Neeson comforts a dying man is one of the most powerful and beautiful pieces of acting I've seen in recent years. To summarize, I found the film a very intense watch and it stayed with me for long time afterwards. Surely the hallmarks of a great picture?",/review/rw6798349/?ref_=tt_urv

9 April 2012,saadgkhan,7," Intense and watch 2 seconds after credit to know your answer for the ambiguous ending
","The Grey â€“ CATCH IT (B+) After Taken and Unknown, the Grey is added into another likable Liam Neeson's venture. The Grey can be considered very close to the actual the rugby team Andes survivors. Actually the movie gives very nice reference to that actual event and the movie. In this movie besides the nature it's actually the wolfs, who are ready to kill them as they crash into their marked territory. Liam Neeson is fantastic as always. The supporting cast Dermot Mulroney, Frank Grillo, Jeo Anderson and Dallas Roberts was good. Overall, it's an intense movie and will make you jump off your seats in some of the crazy sequences. Many people will feel like being cheated in the end but hey watch for 2 seconds after credit, it'll answer your question ;)",/review/rw6798349/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2012,petralyn,5," The Grey, so full of anomalies
","I had to laugh at several scenes. Finally, while the credits were rolling, it was all i could do to not let out a wolf yell. A plane loses power and everyone's breath is visible but no one is concerned. The plane is going down and the flight attendant is still walking the isle? After the crash, is a clearly snow covered, desolate area there are several survivors. All of a sudden the first wolf scene has trees magically appearing in the barren landscape. Next one of the most outlandish scenes has the few remaining fashion a rope from whatever then ask a volunteer to jump 30' from a cliff, across a river, and land in trees without injury. These guys are not Rambo, and no way can one jump from this cliff and make it to the other side, in a tree.",/review/rw6798349/?ref_=tt_urv

","I saw The Grey opening weekend, with Liam Neeson, how could you ever miss a film with this guy? He's such a good actor and has such a commanding presence and from the trailer I was expecting a B type movie with some cheesy acting and over the top action scenes. Instead I went to philosophy class questioning what death is all about. Almost 15 years ago there was a film called The Edge that was similar to this film only taking more of an action route, it's an enjoyable film and I think that's what I was expecting The Grey to be about. The Grey instead has a little bit more of a deeper meaning, disputing death. Is it horrifying to think about or is it peaceful? It's violent, it's quiet, it's scary but maybe we try to fight it too much. Having to accept the difference between fate and destiny can also be exhausting to think about.",/review/rw6798349/?ref_=tt_urv

2 June 2014,ironhorse_iv,7," Who is afraid of the big bad wolf? The Grey might be a little too grey.
","I'm howling at the moon about the grey! It was alright. Directed by Joe Carnahan, and based on the short story ""Ghost Walker"" by Ian MacKenzie Jeffers, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Carnahan. The movie focus on a group of Alaskan oil workers who survived a plane crash on their way to Anchorage, Alaska. Only to find themselves in the wilderness, forced to fend off attacks by dangerous man-eating wolves on their way to civilization. The action scenes were entertaining. The way, they portray the plane crash scenes are just nightmarish. Probably the scariest thing in the movie. The acting was alright, but it hard to like any of the characters due to their unlikeable, horrible dialogue or lack of development. Cluster f-bombs doesn't help, make it any better. The main character, John Ottey (Liam Neeson) was fine. I love the way, he makes improvised weapon, out of normal stuff, but his wolf-hunting skills are just not there. It's weird that a nearly 60 year old man like Neeson, can still play the gritty action hero. One thing that bother me a little are the grey wolves, itself. The grey wolves were not realistic at all. I really didn't like how the movie had CGI-enhanced wolves, because they didn't look right or act real. It looks like they were getting chase by werewolves. If only they use more real gray wolves. I would believe these wolves as a threat, more. The Wolves looks and act like supernatural beings doing more than what normal wolves could do. I do think the night scenes darkness makes it scarier, but you can't see anything. It's way too dark. I do understand artistic license, and it's supposed to represent a killer machine freak of nature like the shark in 1975's Jaws or the lion in 1996's Ghost in the Darkness. What made those films, great is how little, you see the monsters. I also do understand the Environment/ Native American metaphor message. In which the wolves look and act like demons from hell to punish the men for drilling their land, and killing members of their society. Surprising, there is a religious message that kinda got lost in the film with characters in the film, being atheists. I don't know, if the movie theme is living in the face of presumed hopelessness or what, but honestly, I don't think all atheists are suicidal. If the whole time, they were in purgatory, I guess it kinda makes sense. While, it's really good - an existentialist parable - in wolves clothing, it's distracting. The movie's deeper meaning between black & white kinda makes this movie less of a realistic survival movie, and more like a horror movie. The movie gave the wolves a reason for their odd behavior for hunting the humans. They are suppose justified in their attack because they felt threaten by the human presence in their own wolf pack's personal territory and they never encountered humans before. The film got some backlash due to the negative portrayal of wolves. It got worst, when animal activists found out that the movie indeed buy four wolf carcasses from a local trapper, two for props for the film and two wolves for the cast to eat for certain scenes. This really angered environmentalists and animal activists, who were already irate that the film depicts wolves in a negative light, specifically at a time when grey wolves had recently been removed from the Endangered Species Act. Some animal rights groups boycotted the film like PETA. Another fault of the film is the theme. Without spoiling it, for a movie about surviving, it's just doesn't work. It's so depressing. I don't get it, why make a survival thriller, only to waste people time with an awful Wolves Den type ending AKA 1969's Butch Cassidy & Sunshine Kid, Bolivian Army type ending. It makes the whole movie pointless. I guess a happy ending would have cheapened this film, but I think most people wants to see a movie where the hero survived. Yes, it's predictable, but people go see a movie looking for hope, not a downer message. Its reasons like that, that make movies like 2012's Life of Pi and 1993's Alive, far superior movies than this. Don't get me wrong, I can handle, downer Man Vs Nature endings such as 2007's Into the Wild and 2000's Perfect Storm. The only differs between those movie and this, is that this is movie plays out more like a cheesy horror movie fiction with mostly unlikeable characters than a realistic portrayal of survival. It's a man vs nature with nothing in stake. The movie could had done with less narration as, there are things, we could figure out with the silence reflection. The ending also was a bummer, because in the trailer, the movie makes it seem like we would see a huge fight between John Ottey and the Alpha wolf. It was sadly cut or not film. There is a post-credit scene, but it's really doesn't help solve anything. It was indeed bad misleading advertisement. Overall: For a man vs nature film, it was alright fray, but there are better movies out there. Still, the movie is watchable.",/review/rw6798349/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2018,jcoria,9," Much Deeper than a survival film
","Just a few comments about this Jack Londonesque movie. Beyond the surface this movie harpoons the great competitions of man versus man, man versus nature, man versus God and man versus himself. What the director was able to accomplish in this raw film is an inspiration. A man evolving from suicidal tendencies, a man who protected life but initially cares little of his own, revealed his true flesh of wanting to live. The ethereal remembrances provided a cloudy peek into his pain. The parallels of the pack of wolves and the pack of men within the indifferent universe. Oh my fellow watchers this visceral movie gives us hope, purpose and the untethered pang of raw survival. To rage against the cold, while the hungry wolves that lurk in our souls attempt to devour us. Those that rate this movie poorly lack the honed taste of organic storytelling. Shakespeare throughout this movie. Enter the Gray with fortitude and alacrity and your poem will write itself. Well done.",/review/rw6798349/?ref_=tt_urv

","Most of the people heading to see this would be men looking for a survival flick. It's not, it's an implausible and absurd waste of time. The story is so artificial it makes the June 1969 issue of the Invincible Iron Man (#32 Where Walks the Weirwolf) look like a Pentagon budget report. Some of the more credibility defying stunts include: Liam Neeson in a 300 mph plane crash into the ice and emerging from the wreckage with a slight scratch on his left hand, Neeson (wilderness expert) convincing his fellow survivors that the best place to avoid ravenous wild wolves is in a dark forest, jumping off 150 ft sheer cliffs, jumping into icy rivers, fighting said wolves with miniature airline liquor bottles.
