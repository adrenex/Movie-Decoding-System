18 November 2021,ronaldalamascus-90506,8," Delightfully Quirky!
","Might not be everyone's cup of tea but my wife and I both loved it! Beautiful setting filmed in Malta although it supposedly takes place in western France but easily overlooked. Some of the characters are definitely quirky to the point of being corny although lovable nonetheless. This is not serious drama certainly and the story is very predictable with occasional one liners that are classic British humor. It's lighthearted, enjoyable entertainment that doesn't require apt attention or puzzling over whodunnit. Good change of pace.",/review/rw7637930/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2021,SunnyDaise,6," Almost perfect
","Really enjoying this comedy-drama-mystery so far. It's great to have a show written by and predominately starring over 50s that is clean enough for all generations to watch together. I wish the younger characters were a bit more inspiring eg have more interest in their work and the all-age community. The leading lady and man are absolutely lovely together. Plus I love bi-lingual shows, should be more of those on TV, as so many places/groups are.",/review/rw7637930/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2021,shoretalk,8," Entertaining, uplifting, and worth watching
","Perhaps I'm aging myself but I don't need gratuitous violence and sex to enjoy a mystery show. In fact, when you throw in good natured comedy with characters that you enjoy seeing on screen you've got something special.",/review/rw7637930/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2021,malpasc-391-915380,8," Mystery fun in the sun
","I like Sally Lindsay as an actress. She's great at comedy, drama and comedy drama. I particularly loved her in Sky series Mount Pleasant. I also think she's great in the Madame Blanc Mysteries which she also created and produced.",/review/rw7637930/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2021,john_dulieu,7," An Enjoyable Watch
","Why are the 'couch potato reviewers' on here so cruel when sharing their views? This is as well written, filmed and acted as Any formulaic detective series on TV these days... and in the hands of seasoned actors like these, better than some. Always give a new series 2 or 3 episodes before you make a judgement, a lot of talented creatives worked very hard to bring some much needed entertainment to us... If you can't say something nice, shut the feck up!",/review/rw7637930/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2022,mymeister,8," Much better than i expected
",I really enjoyed this. I got an Agatha Raison vibe at first but just on the blonde vivacious detective similarities.,/review/rw7637930/?ref_=tt_urv

16 December 2021,grandmabrat,9," I would like more of this.
",A mystery without the over dramatising. I like the characters and there is a lovely mystery to solve. The background of France is so entertaining also. A nice break from England and the US.,/review/rw7637930/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2021,paul_anson,7," Light & silly in the British tradition.
",Silly fun in a light entertainment format. Of course it's not meant to be taken seriously. Of course the actors are hamming it up. It's still an entertaining little package best enjoyed with a nice glass of red French wine.,/review/rw7637930/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2021,labenji-12163,7," Nice Light Mystery For Gen X
","This is a lovely light dramady for Gen Xers. Believe the characters are still finding their footing, let's hope the show gets renewed so it can fully flush itself out. Fingers crossed for an early 2022 release date.",/review/rw7637930/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2022,bosporan,3," Abysmal show with few redeeming features
","Cheap, lightweight, lowest-common-denominator television that should never have seen the light of day. My endurance got me halfway through season one, despite my rational mind screaming at me to stop at episode one where all the signs of mediocrity were present.",/review/rw7637930/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2021,mnb-123,8," series review
","I think this series is meant to be OTT/ham/caricature acting, it's a light hearted, not to be taken too seriously series which I'm enjoying so far. Nice location, not France tho, I believe it was filmed in Malta but you can't tell.",/review/rw7637930/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2021,dbaelee,9," Great mystery series
",Great series but the old couple in the chateaux are too over the top. I love the main characters and their relationship. The second episode story of the dying woman Eleanor who was a child when her mother and brother Henri were snatched by the Nazis was a beautifully written story. Sally and Steve have a great chemistry.,/review/rw7637930/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2022,westsideschl,3," Potential Lost
","Supposed location is Mont Sainte-Victoire (CÃ©zanne; lived in nearby Aix) mountain range is in the south of France also visited by Picasso, Kandinsky. The sleuthing was not realistic, but entertaining. Crimes?, the usual Acorn Studio method of quickly/cheaply resolved at the end with a meek passive confession followed by being led away in 'cuffs. All the made-more-cheaply is the dumb ending; makes no practical, logical, realistic sense. Spoils the script's potential. What a disappointment.",/review/rw7637930/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2021,thekarmicnomad,4," This is no Agatha Rasin
",I watch these comedy mystery programs with my girlfriend - we love a bit of Agatha or Father Brown or Shakespeare & Hathaway.,/review/rw7637930/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2021,cathyannemoore-66196,4," Is this supposed to be a spoof?
",4 stars for Sally Lindsey because she is so likeable. But do I watch this as a spoof like the murder on the Blackpool Express or is it supposed to be serious. Not funny enough to be a spoof and story and characters not good enough to be taken seriously. Some dodgy French accents and background music. It seems Sally has written herself an anglicised Jessica Fletcher series and set it in France so she can get away from Manchester for a few weeks. I'm just watching episode 2 now to see if it gets better?,/review/rw7637930/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2021,tomtpcarpe,3," Plodding
","Have you ever watched a horse wade out of a bog? A perfect description for this show. You know the animal it trying hard to move forward, and you hope to finally see a beautiful stallion free itself and gallop majestically across the meadow. I don't think this nag will make it. Weak (or non-existent) plot, poor writing, strained acting, and neither comedy nor mystery.",/review/rw7637930/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2021,irnbru-333,4," Wants to be Lovejoy - but more like Eldorado meets the Mallorca Files
",OK it's deliberately cheesy and meant to be a light frothy crime caper but it needed to set the bar higher than this. The opening was ponderous and the story was dull with no surprises. Lead Sally Lindsay looked like a rabbit in the headlights all the way through. As for the supporting cast I haven't heard zee French accents like zeese since 'Allo Allo'.,/review/rw7637930/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2021,ranchofiesta,3," Just meh.
","I liked the premise. Episode 1 was interesting... until... no one, including ""Mrs. White #1"" suggests finding ""Mrs. White #2""??? Everyone in the village knows her, yet not a word about who she is, where she is???",/review/rw7637930/?ref_=tt_urv

29 November 2021,bibikatusic,3," Why does every series these days have to be about LGBT?
","It happens in every foreign series I watch these days, without a fault. The story does not follow the description of the series. Mrs. Blanc is not looking for her husband's murderer, instead she gets involved in the towns requirement for her help, and her being nearly broke you would think the main cop would hire her for all her services instead of her giving it away.",/review/rw7637930/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2021,Britannia24,6," A Bit Of a Mish Mash - But Enjoyable Nonetheless
","Where to begin?!? It's as if Sally Lindsay has taken Midsomer Murders, Rosemary and Thyme, 'Allo 'Allo, Lovejoy and A Year in Provence, thrown them into a blender, given them a damn good 'zizzz', and then poured out the script for Madame Blanc!!! The resolution of the first episode was 'swift' to say the least and wouldn't have strained the talents of Insp Clouseau, never mind Sherlock Holmes!! Oh yes, Clouseau...there's another who was popped in the blender!!! Line of Duty it ain't, but it's enjoyable enough for a Saturday night with a glass (or two) of Sauvignon Blanc!!! 'Chewing gum for the eyes' as my old Boss would put it!!!",/review/rw7637930/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2021,SunnyDaise,6," Original start but loses it's uniqueness when the mysteries take a back seat to LGBT+ plots.
","I love the middle-aged lead characters of Jean, Gloria and Dom. However, being only 40 minute episodes, too much time is lost promoting LGBT+ plots from episode 4 and the mystery storylines therefore become too simple. As much as I appreciate Paul O'Grady on 'For the Love of Dogs', his episode 6 cameo was predominantly waffle and there was barely any mystery to solve.",/review/rw7637930/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2021,robbiep-53815,9," Bright, sunny and enjoyable
",Really enjoyed this. Great location. A bright sunny and refreshing change. The ongoing mystery is intriguing and the self contained weekly case to be solved keeps things ticking along nicely. A lovely change.,/review/rw7637930/?ref_=tt_urv
