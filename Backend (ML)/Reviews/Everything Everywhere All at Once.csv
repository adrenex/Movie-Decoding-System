2 January 2023,Top_Dawg_Critic,7," It's like a free toy in a cereal box.
","It's a gimmick to get you to buy the cereal, but once you get to the toy at the bottom of the box, it's just a cheap useless piece of plastic, and not worth buying the cereal you normally wouldn't buy, just for the toy. This is the case here, a gimmick that does work, but not worth the eight colorful episodes that are basically a two-hour movie spread thinly to make a series, and really not offering up anything revolutionary that hasn't been done before, and much better. If you enjoy this genre and haven't seen Money Heist yet, watch that instead of this, it's 1000x better.",/review/rw8772314/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2023,rklemm05,5," Form over substance... What a letdown...
","I was really looking forward to watching this show. The trailer was appealing, it looked like Ocean's eleven meets Tarantino, so I binge-watched it as soon as it hit Netflix.",/review/rw8772314/?ref_=tt_urv

","So, there was a lot of potential in the script, but a couple of things was a big letdown.",/review/rw8772314/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2023,evandronius,4," Bad characters
",I don't mind the nonlinear approach. The story itself was ok but I felt like they could have taken it in so many different places that would have made it so much more satisfying and interesting. But it was the characters that really soured it for me.,/review/rw8772314/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2023,mfeierskov,5," Pretty mediocre
","The gimmick of being able to watch the show in any order is fine on paper, but what does it actually accomplish? You're not going to watch it more than once and who really cares what order someone else watches the show in.",/review/rw8772314/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2023,raiderreggid,5," Solid heist caper ruined by dumb ""twist""
","First, the good: The non-linear story was not an issue, as each episode stood fine on its own. Similarly, the acting is top-notch, and while the ""impregnable vault"" heist story has been done a million times before, it still made a compelling narrative here.",/review/rw8772314/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2023,DarkPassenger73,7," I like the idea... But...
","Despite this being a so called non-linear series (you can watch the episodes in any order and it still makes sense), I decided to watch them in chronological order and I'm glad I did.",/review/rw8772314/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2023,Bobalopacus,6," Read you any order can in this summary (do you see what I did there?)
","Are you fed up with stories? Aren't they all becoming way too predictable, with their structured beginning, middle and end and cliched character arcs? Don't you wish for something novel, something that captures the unpredictability and 'chaos' of reality?",/review/rw8772314/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2023,kkmgirl-448-111988,6," Color Me Mildly Entertained
","I was initially excited by the ""random play order"" of the series, but quickly realized I may prefer my stories more linear (at least in this case). It didn't pull off the same effect I got with Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction, but the effort was there. The highlights- good production, mostly good acting, some decent heist moments. The low- the sappy overly dramatic Dad/Daughter storyline, the terrible de-aging makeup, plot holes, and the ridiculously violent temper tantrums from Bob. I think editing out about 2 episodes would have helped keep it fresh, but it definitely grew stale in parts. Maybe I lack the knowledge to understand, but the final episode (Heist) should have been way cooler and tense, yet wasn't. It just seemed unrealistic that they had so much time to stand around arguing, looking for a hidden key, AND having heart to heart talks when the Bad Guy and the Feds were actively aware of the cape and trying to get at the crew. Also, Judy did the math on how big the load was... no way in hell 2 people were able to intercept the load and change out ALL the boxes in that short amount of time. Things like that ruin the heart pounding excitement for me. Lastly, the Big Reveals at the end were completely anticlimactic since I figured them out during the other color episodes. Overall, it was a fine way to kill a few hours, but it wasn't memorable.",/review/rw8772314/?ref_=tt_urv

2 January 2023,FilmFanatic2023,5," A Unique But Disappointing Heist Thriller
","A heist thriller with a unique concept - eight episodes that can be watched in any order, with each episode featuring a different color code to indicate its place in the timeline. While this could have been a fun way to play with character and storytelling, it ultimately falls short. The repetitive character beats and thin ideas make the series feel manipulative and melodramatic, and the mid-season sag is a problem even without a traditional season structure. The performances from the cast, particularly Giancarlo Esposito and Rufus Sewell, are engaging, but the writing is shallow and fails to fully explore interesting themes like race. The action is fun at times, but the limited character development and thin ideas make it hard to fully invest in the story. Overall, ""Kaleidoscope"" is a disappointingly uneven series that fails to fully take advantage of its unique premise.",/review/rw8772314/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2023,miroslav-yanakiev,5," Started with PINK
","It looked liek a fun idea and i was super excited to start the show. Untill Netflix decided do start my experience with Episode Black 0:51 seconds intro folowed by PINK ... Pink from all episodes , which is 6 months after the heist and contains a lot of references to all the other episodes and conclusions. The idea is great on paper but in reality it ruiend the most important part of the show for me the ending from the start. I don care how many puzzle parts or twist the story will have if i see them all resolved before i even know the caracters and their development. I will not watch another episode.",/review/rw8772314/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2023,durablu,5," A swing and a miss
","When they announced a series that could be watched in any order, not gonna lie, I was hooked. Especially considering that the show centres around a heist.",/review/rw8772314/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2023,greekBruin,4," Unoriginal and boring
","The same boring story about a heist that targets the bad guy. It is a plot that we have seen many times in recent years: the good guy is in prison, he breaks out of prison and sets up a great heist against the bad guy who wronged him in the far past. In order to achieve this, he assembles a group of criminals that are very capable but each one of them has a character fault and they have regular squabbles between themselves. And we also have the FBI agent who wants to catch these guys. Plot twist, the FBI agent has been a drug addict while at FBI, then FBI found out and suspended her, but somehow she was not fired! It is silly, but there are a lot of such unbelievable subplots in this show.",/review/rw8772314/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2023,nightringer-76840,3," Very Promising Premise, But...
","Kaleidoskop is a mini series that wasn't suppose to be. It should be a 100 min movie, and that's that. We have a collection of talented and connectable actors, good concept, but the storyline development went down the drain way too quick.",/review/rw8772314/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2023,latinotoons,3," If Bad One Liners are your thing
","Imagine if you were up late the first of the year and stumbled across this new show. Naively trusting of the handful of talent they'd sourced, you dedicate three quarters of an hour of your life to Kaleidoscope, starting on yellow, because hey, thats what autostart is for anyway. Dull voice overs and vignettes abound, a rehash of classic tropes from caper flicks, each one more tiring and poorly delivered than the last. Unlikeable and unexplicably motivated characters, a slew of bad accents, jarring pacing, irregular sound mixing... you get the picture. The only thing worth watching in this show seems like Rufus Sewell's performance. Rayuela it aint.",/review/rw8772314/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2023,alanfl1,1," Three Strikes and You're Out!
","Stupidity and nonsense in movies and TV are often overlooked. Of course, sometimes the willing suspension of disbelief *isn't* so hard to do. Not so with Kaleidoscope, and I'm not even talking about the silly concept that viewers can watch the episodes in any order....",/review/rw8772314/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2023,mr_sharma,7," A perfectly fine binge worthy show.
","The main draw for this show is that you can watch any episode in any order. Although, the majority consensus is to watch the WHITE episode last as it provides all the answers.",/review/rw8772314/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,markinsac,8," Really Liked It
","I love this approach of individual episodes that can present the story no matter the order the episodes are watched. I might have gotten lucky in the order I saw them but enjoyed seeing some backstory later that explained and illuminated elements of the story telling. Acting was good, story was good. Of course watching every story like this there are certain go-to tropes that you've already seen a billion times and you can predict the decisions and outcomes that will play out. But still entertaining and I often wonder if that's even intentional. As if we're ""in on it"" with the writer and know the big secret.",/review/rw8772314/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2023,TheTruthofItIs,8," A surprisingly good heist-er from Netflix
","""Kaleidoscope"" (single season, 8 eps, 50-mins, Netflix) is a solid, based on true story mega-heist ($7B in bonds) series that's offered to viewers in an almost random order. The span of episodes ranges from 24 yrs before the heist to 6-months after it. I did not opt for the random order which likely increased my enjoyment 10-fold compared to others you'll notice. I watched in chrono order: Black (only 1-min long), Violet, Green, Yellow, Orange, Blue, White, Red, and Pink. The tale is a good mix of Ocean-11-esque heist, revenge, betrayal, regret, family ties, FBI priorities, etc. There's a lot there to keep you interested. Production values are solid as was the casting/acting and direction. Definitely one of the better series you'll find from Netflix.",/review/rw8772314/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2023,msghall,4," Made for money, not for art.
","Eric Garcia needs to want to make art, not just money. Despite sinfully skimping on lighting, Garcia's gleefully brays on social media how successful this series already is in its first days on Netflix. Instead of showing pride for putting his best into this show, he brings us a cheaply-made, darkly-lit, noisy, plastic slab of entertainment that is hard to see, jumps around needlessly and lacks a sense of artistry, even for Netflix.",/review/rw8772314/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2023,krisztianv,1," Boring, stupid and full of idiotic scenes and storyline
","This series is a wannabe heist series but it is so boring and full of stupid scenes and events that it is just unbearable to watch. Packed with illogical actions, scenes, decisions that even morons would not commit when shoplifting- let alone a 7B heist. It's just pathetic. Also, over half of the cast is terrible actors not to mention their idiotic characters they play.",/review/rw8772314/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2023,premedprincessxo,6," Meh
",Pros: Amazing performance from lead who plays Ray as well as guy who plays Roger Salas. I also enjoyed the actress who plays Ava and felt she brought a unique charm to the role. Also visualization and editing is fantastic and high quality.,/review/rw8772314/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2023,ColinTheGorilla,6," It's alright
",I started with Violet and I think this show was pretty meh and did some things alright. Giancarlo Esposito was the only reason I even wanted to watch this show due to the fact I think he's a very good actor. He's honestly one of the only reasons I watched this show and even made it to the finale. I think the idea of watching a show in any way you want could be good but this is super confusing and I had no idea where to start at. The heist in episode white was actually so boring and stupid and didn't feel entertaining at all to me and I truly didn't like it at all. I thought it was so generic and stupid. This is worth the watch if you've got a ton of free time.,/review/rw8772314/?ref_=tt_urv
