29 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," One of the best spy series ever!
","The Americans is one of the best spy shows ever created. There are a million to choose from but The Americans is a true top among the best. It follows to KGB spies (Matthew Rhys and Keri Russell) posing as Americans in suburban Washington D. C. at the height of the Cold War during the Regan administration. We watch as the pressures of the job and raising their unknowingly American born children out them at risk of being discovered. To make it even worse, their best friend neighbor (Noah Emmerich) is an FBI agent who job is to uncover Soviet spies. There's a reason that The Americans is one of the best reviewed shows and that's because it's fantastic! This is easily one of the most thrilling spy shows ever created. I loved every second of every episode!",/review/rw7897790/?ref_=tt_urv

22 May 2018,wgingery,10," A Gut-Wrenching Journey Deep Into the Mirror World of Espionage
","The fifth season's first episode featured the ""Americans"" digging a hole - a BIG hole. The scene goes on a long, long time. This is pretty much how the whole season feels. The show downshifts a gear or two, the payoff is elusive, and you wonder where it's all going; until, that is, the end finally does come, when it's a shocker. It is all done quite intentionally so as to set up the final season.",/review/rw7897790/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2018,nufafa,9," Great final season and episode
","Although I have found the series a bit repetitive over the years, the final season has been exceptional, with a beautiful final episode that will be always remember. 
I think is one of the shows that better uses the silence to explain things, and in the last episode music plays also a big role.
The acting of Rhys, Russell and Emmerich is exceptional and I'd love to see them in the nominations and awards' lists.",/review/rw7897790/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2022,abcprivateemail,9," The Americans should used as a guide for how to make good tv
","TV/MOVIE EXECS, PRODUCERS, SHOW RUNNERS, DIRECTORS, AND WRITERS TAKE NOTE: The Americans should be your guide for how entertainment does NOT need constant, long fights, car chases, or emotional outbursts. It does NOT need clearly defined, black & white, un-nuanced good guys versus bad guys. It does NOT need music shoved in the audience's ears. A show can have audiences other than just teens with Attention Deficit Disorder.",/review/rw7897790/?ref_=tt_urv

2 February 2013,savannahkhan,10," A star is born...
","It is very rare that you have a near perfect episode, especially of a series on commercial television. But FX has done it here with The Americans. It is nearly flawless. Great mind candy for the thinking person, with something to come back to after the first viewing. I credit the success of The Americans to 3 things: Great script, great music, and Matthew Rhys.",/review/rw7897790/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2018,electric-crow,10," Don't Go!
","Watching the last episode was like having to say good-bye to a lover........... or the shock felt by Keri Russell when she see's Paige....... well you'll just have to watch it.
I watched every episode and The Americans was truly a rarity in TV entertainment quality. It never compromised, never jumped the shark, and the last episode was one of the best endings, unlike most series endings who just mail it in with a bunch of feel-good pretentious schlock.",/review/rw7897790/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2022,dogyorky,9," Superb, proper drama series
","Understated, excellent, not well-enough known about drama series. Well acted, well written and with a proper ending. Believable characters and only the occasional 'that wouldn't happen ' kind of vibe. Well worth watching.",/review/rw7897790/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2022,theedeer,10," Really Awesome series and acting. This could have went on much longer.
",Really Awesome series and acting. This could have went on much longer. Really Really hope the do an after series tie-in. This was underrated and should be all 10's.,/review/rw7897790/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2022,dansolo-20563,9," The Americans
","This show is so important to me. Along with Orphan Black, it's basically the first ""adult"" show I ever watched. I was 14 at the time when I started it, and I watched the episodes as they came out from season 3 onwards. I'm nearly 23 now and it's insane how different my perspective is on the show now that I know a lot more about the world. Binging it in 2 weeks also helped, because watching the show over 3 years as it came out really didn't help with my understanding of it. That's also ignoring the fact that my comprehension of film and TV shows when I was younger wasn't great to put it mildly. Now, while my personal philosophies prevent me from empathising with the Jennings, I can absolutely get behind their plight and mission, in a way anyway. The United States are not painted as saints by a long shot, and rightly so. It's a noble cause that the Jenningses are fighting for, even if it is completely futile. It's what makes them so fascinating, especially Elizabeth. Their tangle with duty against morals is always enthralling, and it makes for two incredibly complex characters. Honestly, forget Walter White or Tony Soprano (maybe idk I haven't watched The Sopranos yet), I think Elizabeth Jennings is the quintessential, definitive anti-hero. Season 6 in particular showcases her vicious ruthlessness superbly. Philip is a really great counterpart for her, and it's the type of duo, like Rust Cohle and Marty Hart, where you can't have one without the other.",/review/rw7897790/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2019,jjrt-66178,8," I've underestimated this show.
","I've heard about this show countless times mostly in the US media.
I figured it was a very politicized show with the same old message
""US = Good, RU = Evil"" This is what kept me from giving the series a go.
Only in late 2018 I've started watching and to my surprise It's not the case.
The show manages to give a fair and near unbiased view about Geo-politics, fractions, countries. espionage, ideologies.
Without telling you what to think or how to feel about it.
It doesn't demonize any side neither does it glorify the other.
For those whom refuse(d) to watch for the same reasons as me, if still curious just give it a try! It's actually a good show",/review/rw7897790/?ref_=tt_urv

5 May 2022,estathena2,8," Slow burn
","The Americans is a series that watches like a great spy novel; each chapter slowly developing into a very watchable season. It's well crafted, the acting subtle, & the storylines are disconcerting in their realism. There's very little black and white in The Americans it's all various shades of grey, a not always good versus a not always evil that evokes empathy, pity, & often frustration.",/review/rw7897790/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2022,etpvsrw,10," Great serie!
","I am binge watching this, very good series. The storyline is perfect, you feel for them but than you realise they are the enemy...they are Russian and they stand for everything we hate.",/review/rw7897790/?ref_=tt_urv

","This woman is so fantastic in this series
She portrays so many different characters and always looks so elegant and sophisticated that binched the whole 4 seasons in less than a month
I think im in love ...",/review/rw7897790/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2018,Nightmarelogic,10," One of the best shows in recent history
","From pilot to finale this is one of the best written and acted shows in recent history, I would put this in my top five of recent memory. From day one to its exciting conclusion it defied convention and told not only an amazing spy story but a truly human one as well. This is a deeply underrated show that I would highly recommend about spies living in 1980s America. If you haven't watched it as of right now most of the series is on Amazon Prime. I would give it a shot. It is an amazing show worth the watch.",/review/rw7897790/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2013,mohan59,9," Intriguing
","It is early days yet, but the pilot was so engrossing (and Fox infuriating with its endless barrage of commercial breaks), it deserved a review.",/review/rw7897790/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2019,robfollower,10," Winner 2019 Golden Globe 'Best Drama in a TV series'
","The Americans' powerful final season pumps up the volume on an already intense show, concluding the complex series arc with epic familial conflict... and a high body count. Capping off a six season run on an emotional high note .",/review/rw7897790/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2013,mrblumis,10," Finally, a great television series.
","I'm not going to spoil any of the episodes so read on. I'm just saying I've been waiting for years for a television series that sets the hook and does not let you go. Very intense, great social issues, Keri Russell is spectacular. I just started ""Nashville"" the series this year and thought that was the answer, but ""The Americans"" has bumped Nashville down to number 2. Some of the younger crowd who does not know the 80's, or the cold war between the USSR and the US, might not feel the intensity compared to us who felt the tension of the time - when WWIII felt on the doorstep. The first ten minutes of the series opener was the best ten minutes of any television series opener in history. The pounding music, the action, the mystery, the excitement was unbelievable. I just hope the writers can keep it going for the next ten years.",/review/rw7897790/?ref_=tt_urv

21 October 2022,melody-76-159291,10," Powerful
","If this had been a film it would have won Oscar's. Human view of the Cold War with excellent dialogue, storylines, character development, and wisdom. Every episode was gripping. The last episode was brilliant, wrapping up the horrors of what they did to find them saving the world. Wonderful twist at the end,",/review/rw7897790/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2022,Tron79,10," Addicted to the Americans
","I finished re-watching the Americans binging all 6 seasons in a short period of time. The first time I saw it, I remember thinking it had a pretty good ending. This time, I still thought it was well done, but I was left with a couple of questions that bug me. I wish people could write replies to these reviews so I could see your opinions!",/review/rw7897790/?ref_=tt_urv
