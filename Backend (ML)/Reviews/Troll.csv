31 May 2022,Supermanfan-13,9," Better Than Expected!
","Much like the Vampire Diaries, I thought that the Originals was going to be a show aimed at tweens. I was so wrong! It is a great supernatural show for people of all ages. I didn't start watching these two shows until earlier this year but I'm so glad I gave them a chance after reading so much about them. Klaus is one of the best characters in either show and this show is worth watching just for him. I highly recommend this show if you like shows about supernatural or vampires/werewolves. It doesn't get much better than this!",/review/rw5973566/?ref_=tt_urv

30 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," Terrific!!
","The Originals (along with The Vampire Diaries) surprised me as much as any show I've ever seen. I absolutely thought this was a show for High School kids but I couldn't of been more wrong. I never watched it when it was originally on and just binged the entire series on Netflix recently. That's not an easy thing to do considering it has 92 episodes but it was that good and totally worth the time and effort. This is not your average vampire show. The dynamic between the family, especially Klaus and Elijah, is what makes this show so special. The Michaelsons make a lot of enemies on their time on Earth but always find away to get over their family problems to come out on top. This is a must watch for any fan of Supernatural shows.",/review/rw5973566/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2019,Moviesnob411,10," Will forever be my favorite show
","I truly cant describe thoroughly enough how much I love this show. This to me is the show of shows. The vampire diaries is a close second but for the older fans this show is the one. So many memorable characters, so many favorites. Makes me cry to think it's over.",/review/rw5973566/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2022,alexleizerovichcoaching,10," A glorious ride that ended with a bad taste
",This is one of my favorite series ever if not the favorite. The characters are written perfectly. With that said I was disappointed with the final season. This is my full series breakdown.,/review/rw5973566/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2022,Phnemonic,9," I did enjoy the most of it! Addictive!
",It was pretty great an adventure to have TVD and then this. I've always wanted to see more of Klaus and the others and the directors delivered.,/review/rw5973566/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2021,AnnaPagrati,10," Adore it!
",One of my favorite shows ever made! This show really knows how to get the audience on the mood for every scene!,/review/rw5973566/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2022,nelnyr,7," Love this cast!
","I love this cast and Joseph Morgan is one of my all time favorites. His intensity mixed with charm and charisma is brilliant. They are all phenomenal. I struggled with some of the storylines, which is why I only gave it 7 stars. But I do love that they went out on their own terms and wrapped the show up so beautifully. I've watched it through 2 full times and I'm sure I'll watch it again!",/review/rw5973566/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2018,enochkayiira,10," ENDING OF THE ORIGINALS
","Why is the series ending on season 5. This is the best vampire show I have ever watched. The cast, literal alignment in scripts of the cast, the storyline are all so eye-catching and addictive. I for one am bitterly hurt that my favourite series is coming to an end.",/review/rw5973566/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2019,dianamarinelli,9," A spinoff that is better than the original (TVD)
",After watching the vampire diaries I decided to try the spinoff the originals and my god it's doesnt disappoint. It gives you the suspense and makes you keep on watching. I found this show way better than the vampire diaries because the originals keeps you watching without boredom and it doesn't turn out like the soap opera like tvd. Anyways overall it a good show 100% recommended even tho Julie ruined the ending and almost killed everyone off in the final season.,/review/rw5973566/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2022,jleigh-48770,9," Fourth and Fifth seasons killed the whole series..
","For three seasons the series was chugging along just fine, it sputtered in season 4, but it wasn't unsalvageable, even after introducing the Hollow. But, Season 5 is really where everything went off the rails.",/review/rw5973566/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2022,revanthgarigaboina,10," What a glorious ride it has been!!!!
","Personally I felt their emotional bonding of the characters and their capabilities to forgive and the phrase ""Always and forever"" lives with me until my end of live. The greatest I have ever watched till date and it will always be. The finale has blown my mind and I end up crying so cheers go for it you won't regret it..",/review/rw5973566/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2013,drfaaiza-rehman,10," Spin off way better that the main show!
",THE ORIGINALS is a show which has amazed me this season more than the main show TVD(I am not comfortable with a girl hopping in love from one brother to another- I like Ian and Nina as couple but not on the show). ,/review/rw5973566/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2022,ebrahimpourfateme,10," Incredible
","The originals is the best show about vampires I've ever watched. My favorite character of the originals is Klaus Michaelson cause Klaus's character is very powerful and cool. Also, Joseph Morgan's accent is one of the sweethearts of the show.",/review/rw5973566/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2013,prafulkrsingh2,10," Super awesome TV series!!!!!
","This series has gone far too good beyond its expectations in just two- three episodes, the way its story has picked up speed and the environment they are creating is awesome. Klaus' character as usual is classic and its fun to watch him argue with his brother Elijah and sister Rebekah. Talking about The Vampire Diaries, that show is different in its own way, but there is no way TVD should be compared to The Originals as its story has completely moved in another direction. The acting of all characters is awesome and story is mind-blowing. The flashback story they are gonna show seems to be quite fun as it is related to original vampires. Even in The Vampire Diaries I was a bit biased towards original vampires and waited for their part to come (not only me, happened with many people). So all in all its good they separated out original vampires' story from TVD.",/review/rw5973566/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2013,Lee-Richardson1995,8," TVD spin-off show is better than the main show
","This show is miles better than The Vampire Diaries in my opinion. The show has a brilliant cast, characters, great story and good location. I like the way they have made this show darker than TVD and they haven't kept that 'coming of age' type of show. The originals also gives explanations and goes into some detail about the characters backgrounds and helps you understand the story between the Originals and Marcel. Also, the first couple of episodes have made me wanting more without a doubt. No disrespect to TVD, i like that show, I just think that the way this show focus' on the Original family and the story which they have created makes this show a better one than The Vampire Diaries. Definitely worth the watch.",/review/rw5973566/?ref_=tt_urv

10 November 2013,ypuskinsan,9," More original than vampire diaries
","I admit i was rather reluctant to watch this series especially considering vd. Don't get me wrong vd is okay for me, but common two vampire series and what more it is going to spin-off of vd. In the beginning i was rather happy with vd but as the series progressed the Elina drama got too much whiny and needy for my nerve but still i was hook to the stories so i kept on watching not like an indulgence but more of tolerated time pass. So you could imagine my surprise they are making a spin-off of vd, i mean sure there are die-hard fans of vd but this was a suicide, like they say too much of a same thing is dangerous.",/review/rw5973566/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2014,Shopaholic35,8," Just as good as the original show.
","The Originals is much more than some teen supernatural drama. The storyline is extremely compelling and explores an old topic in a new and fresh way. There are no victims in this show, everyone has their own strengths and it keeps you guessing as to what will happen next.",/review/rw5973566/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2022,joshgoughwild,9," Best super natural show
","I think this show just beats tvd however I also don't think the originals would be so good without the context of tvd. This show is honestly so complete with only minor things wrong with it and it's the only show to ever make me cry. I honestly couldn't recommend this show enough with the addition of watching tvd seasons 1 - 5. The acting, the casting and the writing are some of the best out of any TV show ever.",/review/rw5973566/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2018,jlcarpenter79,10," Could have been on longer
",The only disappointment I have is the cancellation of the show. There are so many ways it could have gone. I enjoyed this show more than the Vampire diaries.,/review/rw5973566/?ref_=tt_urv

6 July 2022,bitnicat,8," For Me Season 4 Is The True Ending Of The Originals TV Series And Season 5 Never Happened
","Why to end The Originals TV Series in such a horrible way, when season 4 ended it in the best way it could have ended? Has the greed of the creators of this TV Series caused them to create an unnecessary and awful fifth season, which not only ends badly for the main characters of the series, But also makes no sense? Because once Klaus and Elijah dies the Hollow is released again anyway. After all, It was explicitly stated by Vincent in season 4 that the Hollow cannot die and that it must be split into 4 original immortal vampires so that she can never return. And also that the Hollow could only be killed permanently by someone of the Labonair bloodline, And Klaus and Elijah Mikaelson isn't part of that bloodline. So why to kill the two original immortal vampires that contain two of the Hollow parts? Where is the screenwriters' logic here? Season 5 is so bad and unnecessary and ruining the series, And I recommend to anyone who starts watching this TV Series to just not watch season 5 and to remain with the ending of Season 4, Which for me at least is the true ending of The Originals TV Series.",/review/rw5973566/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2020,ZinQ,9," Vampire Diary's do not compare.
","Never could get into Vampire Diary's but The Originals I just loved. And in season two, along came Yusuf Gatewood, just the most beautiful man, simply gorgeous. Kind of put Marcel in the shade.",/review/rw5973566/?ref_=tt_urv
