",VERY stupid adaptation of Nathaniel Hawthorne's classic.  For one thing Demi Moore is totally miscast in the title role.  I have nothing against her--she can be good in the right roles...but casting her as a Puritan was just stupid.  Gary Oldman looks like he doesn't know what the hell he's doing in this and Robert Duvall sadly embarasses himself.  ,/review/rw0370272/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2001,Servo-11,6," Not that bad, actually
","I was expecting something really awful, but once I got about 15 minutes into the movie, I decided that the only way to enjoy it was to forget that it was ""based on"" a famous novel and just enjoy the movie for what it was.  And I found myself very entertained.",/review/rw0370272/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2016,Snikic,7," Its a good film, many reviews are ridiculously pretentious
","If this is your first studio film, you may be shocked by the fact that this adaptation is not the same as the source material. This is not Hawthorne's insightful, profound, crushingly depressing novel. As with most studio adaptations, it's been made more tantalizing and easily digestible with a sort of happy ending. In order to enjoy this film, you have to let go of the fact that it only borrows from the characters and theme of the novel and let it stand on its own. You also must accept that it is more entertaining and emotional and less thought provoking. Its also helpful to keep in mind that this is a very 90's studio film. ",/review/rw0370272/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2007,FiendishDramaturgy,8," While Not Well Received, This Is Quite Well Done
","I must inform you that that Roland Joffé has utterly bastardized Nathaniel Hawthorne's work with this film, but I find I must review the film as a film, rather than an adaptation due to the strength of the film itself in comparison to the original literary work. As an adaptation, it is a sexed-up, stylized-down piece of detritus. But as a film...",/review/rw0370272/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2018,Kirpianuscus,," good intentions
","The basic sin is to not be a real adaptation of Hawthorne novel. inspired by it - yes. but nothing more. the second error is to transform a classic novel in a kind of ""ad usum Delphini"", in which every nuance of a great and profound drama is lost. the only significant virtue is the fight of Demi Moore and Gary Oldman to save their roles. not with real succes because the script does a so simple and pink story than nothing could change the sense of it. and the only prize is the atmosphere, costumes, and hope than another director will do a better and smart adaptation for a novel who remains one of fundamental books not only for American literature.",/review/rw0370272/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2000,BruceMcM,1," A travesty of a great novel
","Why should anyone find it necessary or even appropriate to hijack one of the landmark works of American literature to replace it with an emotionally slack, thematically vacant, and feebly agenda-driven narrative?  Demi Moore's curious Scarlet Letter is almost an hour underway before it even reaches the point where Hawthorne's book begins: whereas Hawthorne's novel is a study of sin, psychological torment, and forgiveness, this film has neither heart nor mind behind its high-gloss presentation: it is apparently a libertine tract in defense of adultery, and an attack, pretentiously lofty but incapable of more than junior-high subtlety of thought, on intolerance.",/review/rw0370272/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2007,Nazi_Fighter_David,7," ""Who is to say what is a sin in God's eyes?""
","For my point of view ""The Scarlet Letter"" is a good film with great performances All the actors do a superb job I was worried that Demi Moore might not have the range to handle the role of Mistress Prynne, but she is excellent... She is strong, passionate, intelligent and damaged In another place and time she might have been a leader; in this movie she is quite believable as the woman who defends her love at all costs Gary Oldman looks perfect as Reverend Dimmesdale He projects force and sexual magnetism along with the guilt for his sin",/review/rw0370272/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2016,dhainline1,5," Demi Moore's Version of Choose Your Own Adventure Ala Nathaniel Hawthorne
","I feel a bit generous giving this movie a 5 out of 10 but my score is based on the way little Pearl's scarlet and gold dress looked and I did picture Demi Moore as Hester when I read the book. This movie is more like the Choose Your Own Adventure books from my childhood with Nathaniel Hawthorne thrown in. Demi has said not a lot of people have read the book even though it was published over one hundred years ago by one of America's greatest writers and has been a staple in high schools since time in memorial! Everyone who has read the book knows the meaning of the scarlet letter A for adultery changed to Able or Angel in regards to Hester because she helped out the people of her town when she was needed. The choice of the ending is an Indian attack with Hester and Pearl leaving with Rev. Arthur Dimmesdale goes against what Nathaniel Hawthorne had in mind. I wonder if his grandchildren and great-grandchildren were offended by this Hollywoodized version of their grandfather's story? The language in the book is beautiful and Pearl had more of a role in the book than this movie! Nepotism shows up because Demi has cast daughters Scout and Tallulah as Pearl and they don't really say anything! Robert Duvall and Gary Oldman do their best as Roger Chillingsworth and Rev. Dimmesdale. Do what Olive from ""Easy A"" says in regards to this story: watch the original story and not the one with Demi Moore as Hester taking a lot of baths and talking with a fake English accent!",/review/rw0370272/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2002,michaelRokeefe,6," Love hurts; aggression with passion.
","Based very loosely on the work of Nathaniel Hawthorne. Forbidden love, patience and stout convictions. I really enjoyed this despite the bad reviews. In 1666 Massachusetts a married woman(Demi Moore) falls in love with the young reverend(Gary Oldman)of the colony. Her husband(Robert Duvall)is believed to be part of an Indian massacre on his following arrival to the new world. Duvall's character is actually captured by the Algonquian tribe and forced to live among them. He then vents his wrath on his wife, who is expecting a child from her affair with her lover.",/review/rw0370272/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2007,skydvr38,1," Just Horrible
","If this movie were original it would be only fair to mediocre, but claiming its based on Nathaniel Hawthorne's classic novel is insulting. I hear the ads for this movie say its based 'freely and liberally' on the book. Well, this is an insult to the book. Is Demi Moore so illiterrate she comments (see trivia section) that it was okay to change the ending of the book from sad to happy because not many people read the book? Unbelievable. The Scarlett 'A' imagery has been permanently etched in American culture. Take classic literature and try shoving it through the Hollywood formula mill and this movie is the result, a faceless, emotionless and forgettable movie. Try sayign that about the book",/review/rw0370272/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2005,mOVIemAN56,6," Completely Different From the Novel. Don't Watch If Your In Love With the Book.
","The Scarlet Letter is a piece of American literature greats. Written by Nathaniel Hawthorne in the 1800's the book has been considered one of the greatest piece of American literature ever. But when Hollywood caught hold of it in 1995 the story was changed. I'm not a fan of the novel, it was boring to me, but this movie brought a new sense of hope for me.",/review/rw0370272/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2019,hislights,8," Loved Oldman and Moore
","Everyone has something that either pulls them in or turns them off of a movie. However, I love this movie! I guess I am just a romantic which is why I love it. Oldman has beautiful eyes, and whenever he was looking at Demi in a loving and adoring way, it just made me melt. The movie stated it was freely adapted from the book by Hawthorne, The Scarlet Letter, so it should have been no surprise that the director took it in the direction he wanted to. If you want a really good feel good movie with romance mainly in the eyes of the two main characters and their loving touches, you will enjoy this movie a lot. I guess what I'm saying is that this is more of a chick flick. The movie needs to be taken for what it is. So what if it does not follow the story of Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter?",/review/rw0370272/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 1999,Billy-34,8," Entertaining, sensuous and beautifully lensed film.
","I am an English major and have to say, yes, the book was better and this film is not equal but by itself as a ""freely adapted"" version it too has merit.  It has a beautiful score by excellent film composer John Barry, superb acting by both Gary Oldman and Demi Moore (as a woman way ahead of her time) and even excellent supporting cast.  It is beautifully filmed and on its own - is a rare romantic treat that would be great in a double feature with say ""THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS"" w/ Daniel Day Lewis.  Oldman is terrific...his best role I believe.  The only distraction....the always wonderful Robert Duvall as a madman...who starts to stray this film toward THE CRUCIBLE area of witchcraft.",/review/rw0370272/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2002,lesdroits,8," A beautiful, evocative movie--loved it.
","Yes, I know everyone and his canary has panned this movie. But I don't get it.  I like to think I'm a decent critic and I find what I believe to be disaster and Hollywood stupidity in many popular films (Fish Called Wanda stank, e.g.,) but here, what gorgeous scenery, what evocative music, what a passionate screen play and  oh la la, what a love scene.  It so evoked a time and place I believe to be early New England that I could just be there. I was there.  Wasn't bad either getting to see Gary Oldman play so against type -- and damn well, too.  A moving, beautiful love story -- I don't care what I'm supposed to think.",/review/rw0370272/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 1999,lukas-5,1," Absolute dreck.
","You could try to imagine a worse film, but why bother?  As a film and as an adaptation (""freely adapted"" is perhaps the greatest understatement since our involvement in Vietnam was labeled a ""police action"") of a book, it's a complete failure.  The acting ranges from the clueless to the atrocious. Gary Oldman is apparently trying to do a Scottish accent, Demi Moore is just plain terrible, and Robert Duvall is nuts.  The soft-glow sex scene is risible.  There's no tension to the story because Oldman & Moore don't appear to have souls to lose.  Instead of a perceptive & morally soaked tale of guilt, sin, and conscience, this is a trite, gushy story about being true to yourself.  It's basically a Disney cartoon message, except without as sophisticated a presentation. The script (it's idea of 17th century English is lots of thees & thous) is as bad as everything else, substituting a nick of time rescue happy ending for Hawthorne's.  So bad that it's not even enjoyable on a camp level. C-R-A-P.",/review/rw0370272/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2007,Overdubbed,1," Shallow lies wrapped in easy to swallow eye candy.
","I just caught this movie on cable. Eager to see a film version of the Hawthorne book I was, Very Disappointed. It is sad that some people will think that this is the real Scarlet Letter. The names of characters are the same as the book but it rapidly departs from the book beyond that -- and for the worse.",/review/rw0370272/?ref_=tt_urv

","I loved this movie! I was captivated by it from beginning to end. From scene to scene, I was drawn further and further along. The beautiful Demi Moore and talented Gary Oldman were both excellent. I have enjoyed both actors for many years now, but I would have never imagined them working so well together, as they did in this movie. Their chemistry was great. This movie reminds me of another great romance film: Ridley Scott's 2006 ""Tristan & Isolde"", starring James Franco and Sophia Myles. Yes, I am a sucker for such love stories. :)",/review/rw0370272/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2005,didi-5,5," a definite misfire
","This adaptation of Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel is pretty disappointing. The casting of Demi Moore as Hester Prynne is laughable - she looks what she was at the time, a pretty, A-list, Hollywood star. Gary Oldman does slightly better as Dimmesdale - in fact he might have just saved the film - but Robert Duvall is atrocious as Roger Chillingworth; totally wrong.",/review/rw0370272/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2004,Kalpurnia,9," I enjoyed this movie
","First, I apologies because my English, I'm from Panama. Second, for me, TSL is a very beautiful movie and I know that it is far from the book by Nathaniel Hawthorne, nevertheless, I found nice things there, for instance, the setting was so refreshing to me and the love scenes were very romantic too. In this movie I felt in love to Gary Oldman.  I consider that Demi as well as Gary were chemistry.  On the other hand, I think that the producer and the whole team portrait the epoch of the pilgrims, the way they lived and thought about morality and religion. Demi was pretty in this character and convincing.  For me this was a sad story of love. Although, the screenplay changed at the end, I found that this movie was done to give audience happier than the original book.",/review/rw0370272/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2005,beepink630,1," this movie was an embarrassment
","Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote The Scarlet Letter, one of the greatest classic American novels. This Roland Joffé movie would have caused Nathaniel Hawthorne to roll over in his grave. The only similarity the movie had with the original story line was the character names and the title. It was an absolute embarrassment to the intelligence of anyone who actually read the novel, or even those few who went to see it.",/review/rw0370272/?ref_=tt_urv

","Okay. Calm down people. This movie is an overall very good movie– terrific cast, great sets, great costuming, lots of action and I've never seen Gary Oldman look so handsome. The actors did a really good job. Very entertaining. The book was boring, people. Boring boring boring. Don't you remember having to read it in high school? THE MOVIE IS MUCH BETTER. And I'll state this unequivocally-- it's way better than 90% better than most stuff I see on the big screen-- hands down. And the amateur critic that pulled the race card and said the Indians in this film were not depicted doing anything other than one dimensional, childish actions obviously didn't watch the scene where the two older tribeswomen were discussing Robert Duvall's character very astutely-- great dialogue!

22 February 2005,smurfboy,1," Truly disastrous - a classic turned into a travesty
","Why? That one word could sum up everything that makes this movie so bad. It was made primarily because a lot of Americans got fed up with people suggesting all the classics are English - so what do they do? Change the ending and most of the rest of the plot too! As well as swapping the tragedy at the end for a typically Hollywood lovey-dovey ending, the story is told through the eyes of Hester's daughter Pearl, and halfway through the film the villagers are still guessing that Hester has been having an affair with the minister - even though the novel opens with Hester wearing the Scarlet A for adulteress! The only reason to watch this is to enjoy the irony of a studio thinking 'we'll show the world America has classic novels too', only to rip out everything that made it a classic. If you need any more proof of what a disaster this was, look at what Demi Moore, once Hollywood's highest paid actress, has done since...",/review/rw0370272/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2015,MRavenwood,7," 20 Years Later, It's Still Just Fine
","I'm not going to lie and say I didn't enjoy this film. It's faults I found forgivable. I saw it when it first came out and liked it, and I still like it. I have read the original Scarlett Letter by Hawthorne and liked it too. I believe this film serves two useful (perhaps unintended) purposes. One: it's hopeless as a ""cheat"" for kids who try to do a report on the book and watch this instead. Two: It will perhaps make teens more interested in reading the book - something I was usually not interested in in high school. The most frustrating aspect of the film for me is that it exactly contradicts Puritan teachings when it tries to damn Hester for saying she speaks to God. The whole point of Puritanism was to remove clergy and government from between Believers and God. It would have been more outrageous for her to say something like, ""All believers in Jesus Christ are saved from this sinful world."" Puritans believed a select few would go to Heaven, even of their own flock.",/review/rw0370272/?ref_=tt_urv
