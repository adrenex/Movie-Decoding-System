11 July 2020,Top_Dawg_Critic,9," Ummm... wow.
","*EDIT: I just saw this a 2nd time. Knowing the ending made this an entirely different film - surprisingly in a good way. Sure the surprise wont be there, but seeing it again through a different perspective and knowing certain things, I picked up so many metaphors and clues! Thus I had to up my rating from 8/10 to 9/10. Brilliant film. See it again!

29 May 2022,Tweekums,9," Intelligent science fiction
","This science fiction film is set in the year 2038; protagonist George Almore is working alone on a humanoid artificial intelligence at a remote facility in Japan. He has three prototypes each more advanced than the previous; J1 has a childlike intelligence and an armless boxy appearance; J2 is more capable, has arms but is still fairly boxlike... J3 however has a far more human appearance; it is just waiting for its legs to be attached. J3 also bears a noticeable resemblance to Jules, George's late wife. Before the fatal accident George had Jules's conscience copied to a commercial computer system; this enables him to continue conversing with her even though he knows it won't work forever; the signal gets gradually weaker. As George works to complete J3 he encounters some problems; jot least the fact that J2 appears to be jealous.",/review/rw6411980/?ref_=tt_urv

11 July 2020,vithiet,8," Fantastic sci-fi movie, best I've seen since Ex Machina
","I expect a lot of people will compare this to Ex Machina, and for good reasons. Excellent story, interesting character development, great acting and directing, this is definitely the kind of smart, evenly paced sci-fi I love (if you're expecting explosions, lasers and flying car chases, you're gonna have a bad time...).
While it may be using familiar tropes and the occasional cliche, this truly is a 7/10 throughout that earns its 8th star in the last 15 min. Highly recommended, especially for sci-fi fans!",/review/rw6411980/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2021,nancyldraper,7," Emotion not action
","I didn't think a story about artificial intelligence could be so heartbreaking. If you aren't willing to be emotionally invested in this film then don't bother to start it. It has a good premise and some interesting themes. The acting is solid. I give this film a 7 (good) out of 10. {SciFi, Thriller, Drama}",/review/rw6411980/?ref_=tt_urv

11 July 2020,ksgillihan,9," Oh man I did not expect that
","This is one of the best science-fiction movies I have ever seen. Some maybe won't agree with this but for me it was damn near perfect. It's definitely a slow movie but it has a great story and thought-provoking ideas to consider. A man who is an engineer in artificial intelligence has his life blown apart by the death of his wife, right after he lands the job of a lifetime. It follows his work in developing artificial intelligence in the wake of his wife's death.",/review/rw6411980/?ref_=tt_urv

12 October 2020,arungeorge13,6," Impressive production design and an unexpected climactic twist save an otherwise predictable sci-fi drama! [+61%]
","Not quite in the league of sci-fi brilliance as Ex-Machina or Blade Runner 2049, Archive has an interesting (yet familiar) premise that features humans and artificial intelligence. George, an A.I. scientist, is trying to upload his dead wife's conscience into one of his brilliant android creations. In the process, he has created two prototypes - a bulky one with the intelligence of a toddler, and another smaller, leaner version with the brains of a teenager. Both the prototypes (treated as sisters) develop a connection with their creator. George, however, wants to build a 3rd and final prototype which has the potential to perfectly carry his wife's sensibilities and demeanor.",/review/rw6411980/?ref_=tt_urv

","If I would compare it to an other movie, it would be a spoiler. Then again, once you've seen it, maybe I gave you a hint with what I just wrote. Or maybe I didn't (but I probably did, didn't I?). That aside, because I don't want to spoil anything, if you are into Science Fiction movies, you may like this. It has very good visuals and while I wouldn't call myself a Theo James fan (more a Stacy Martin fan), he does a really good job.",/review/rw6411980/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2020,deloudelouvain,7," For the sci-fi genre it wasn't bad.
","For sci-fi fans this movie will do the job. The plot is interesting, maybe not new but there is a nice twist to it, something I didn't see coming, and that made it a bit better than I expected. Don't expect a lot of action though, it's rather slow paced with barely any other actors than Theo James, who acted really well by the way. But the story is engaging, you keep watching it as you want to know what will happen. For that writer/director Gavin Rothery did a good job, the story is never boring and that even if it lacks of action scenes, the small cast and the quite monotone environment. Archive could have been worse but in the end I think sci-fi fans will like it.",/review/rw6411980/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2021,mhodgson66,7," Slow burn sci-fi
","As a sci-fi fan, I found this admittedly derivative film extremely enjoyable. It is stylishly shot, directed and acted with aplomb by the attractive and enigmatic leads of Theo James and Stacy Martin. Indeed, the latter is well cast in her role who is both ambiguous, childlike and yet empathetic all at the same time. The wonderful Toby Jones also turns up in an extended cameo just to give it that bit extra. If you want wham, bang, action this is definitely not for you. However, if you enjoy psychological, moody sci-fi with stunning visuals then there is much you will enjoy. It is very 'Twilight Zone' with an ending I didn't anticipate.",/review/rw6411980/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2021,planktonrules,7," I wish the film hadn't given clues as to the twist at the end.
","""Archive"" was a very good but frustrating watch for me. I happen to be watching it with my daughter who is relatively fluent in Japanese...and she quickly recognized the Chinese character for 'Dream' and mentioned this....and this made the ending seem inevitable instead of a surprise. I think having these clues did not help the film and it would have been better without them.",/review/rw6411980/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2021,westsideschl,8," Keeping Up with the Human Brain
","Caught me, an unexpected twisty ending. Basic science very shaky, most notably mid 1900s hobbyist electronic gear on shelves. Didn't explain how you store a person's memories, emotions, cognitive processing, etc. on a computer (even a server farm) since there is nothing out there now that comes remotely close. Besides, unlike the brain, it would take an entire power plant dedicated just to that pseudo-brain. Nice effects; interesting different take on used before plot.",/review/rw6411980/?ref_=tt_urv

16 July 2020,ReaLMoisan,6," This is no Her or Ex Machina.
","The movie looks great, solid special effects, wonderful production quality, with very competent cinematography and editing. In 2020, this should be the expectation, and as with most film and television media made in 2020, the writing is the weakest link. Unlike many infamous examples in horrific writing seen in these mediums lately, this film is at least competently written. The issue is what story it's trying to tell, and how it's told.",/review/rw6411980/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2020,gpsychos2-239-278464,8," A very well done movie. Twists, turns and surprises will have you guessing till the end!!
",This was quite a well done movie. These days most movies you know where theyre going long before they get there. I thought I had this one pegged thru out but it kept coming up with surprises. These days they dumb down a lot of movies so everyone in the audience gets the story but that tends to let you guess the end long before you get there. Im happy to say not this one. Everytime you think its going to be this type of movie it turns into another type and that continues until the surprising ending which the film gives nothing away about until the last couple of minutes. Great acting great cinematography. Definitely worth a watch through. Enjoy,/review/rw6411980/?ref_=tt_urv

6 April 2021,siderite,6," A stylistic mix of Ex Machina and Moon that yet provides none of the qualities in either
","The film might have been a decent one if it weren't for the ending. I don't want to spoil anything, but basically in the end nothing happens. There is no closure, no reason for what has happened already, it just ends abruptly on a note that is part of a different song. The location is great, the style is very reminiscent of Moon (for which the director worked as a concept artist) and the play on building your own girlfriend in a remote location feels like taken from Ex Machina. But Moon was an extraordinary performance piece and an innovation at the time while Ex Machina tackled (realistically) real issues of artificial intelligence. It's not like Theo James played badly, it's that his character is bland and sometimes inconsistent in behavior and emotions.",/review/rw6411980/?ref_=tt_urv
