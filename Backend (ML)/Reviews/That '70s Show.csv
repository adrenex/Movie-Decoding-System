5 October 2009,ccthemovieman-1,9," Pretty Innocent, And Fun To Watch
","This was a pleasant surprise: a nice, feel-good film that is pretty innocent and sports the usual beautiful Dreamworks art. The artwork and colors are magnificent. I say ""surprise"" because it did not get great reviews. Thus, I wasn't expecting the quality film I got.",/review/rw2048733/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2013,SnoopyStyle,7," Nice team chemistry
","Susan Murphy (Reese Witherspoon) is a woman who got upsized by a meteorite on her wedding day. B.O.B. (Seth Rogen) is a gelatinous, brainless creation after an experiment on a tomato went wrong. Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie) is a scientist who turned himself into a hybrid. The Missing Link (Will Arnett) is a creature found frozen and revived. And giant mutant larva Insectosaurus is a product of nuclear testing. The government has secretly collected these monster and now they need them to fight alien Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson).",/review/rw2048733/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2009,johnnymacbest,7," A little underwhelming, but still good fun.
","Okay, I'll admit I'm not big on CG movies as I always find 2D animation much more convincing and involving but I had a good time with this (along with a some relatives) and it's a pretty cool movie. However, I kinda felt a little underwhelmed; the story is good, but there's just wasn't enough substance along with the characters and action. I just felt it needed more. But it's a treat to see all the nods to '50s classic era of films that Monsters Vs Aliens pays homage to along with some good messages about being true to yourself and looking beyond one's appearance in order to know someone. Seeing the film with 3D glasses was a cool idea but in my view, 2D will suffice but still, it's good family entertainment for an afternoon. Hopefully the next film will have more ooomph, more ""Monstrosity"".",/review/rw2048733/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2009,Apemangalore,7," A pleasant surprise
","Let's get this out of the way first: I'm not a huge fan of DreamWorks Animation. Usually consisting of nothing more than unfunny pop culture gags, I think the majority of their films are mediocre at best, with the only ones that I really enjoyed being the first Shrek and Kung Fu Panda. The trailers for Monsters vs. Aliens did get me interested, though, and the voice cast seemed pretty impressive. Even so, I was still fairly skeptical about how it would finally turn out. Now, having seen the film, I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised.",/review/rw2048733/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2009,jdesando,," DreamWorks can be proud.

13 January 2011,cherold,7," Cute and often very funny
","After a rather slow beginning in which a girl gets proposed to, the movie picks up when she gets turned into a giant on her wedding day and from that on the film is frenetically comic. Like most Dreamworks cartoons, this one can feel like it's trying too hard (Dreamworks has a Looney-Tunes-on-speed approach that can be a little exhausting), but at its best the movie is wildly funny.",/review/rw2048733/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2009,Vic_max,," Wonderful summertime treat (even though it's still spring) ...
","If you're going to see this movie, make sure it's the 3D version - not all showings are in 3D. If you have the opportunity to see it in IMAX - it's definitely a 'bigger' treat ... but FWIW, know this: it was ""converted"" to IMAX from normal print - not created in the IMAX format.",/review/rw2048733/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2018,vithiet,7," Entertaining and surprisingly, maybe more for grown ups than kids
",It might not be the best but it's definitely one of the funniest Dreamworks animated films in my opinion as many jokes seem a bit more for grown ups rather than kids. I also found it quite entertaining overall.,/review/rw2048733/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2013,Tweekums,7," Enjoyable retro sci-fi animation
","When a meteorite made of quantonium strikes Susan Murphy on the day of her wedding it doesn't kill her; it causes something strange to happen though... just as the service is getting underway she starts glowing slightly green then starts to grow. She doesn't stop growing till she is fifty feet tall! Understandably everybody flees in terror and the army turns up, tranquilises her and takes her to a secret facility where they keep monsters. These include Dr. Cockroach; BOB, a gelatinous blob; (Missing) Link, a strange fish/ape and Insectosaurus an enormous caterpillar like creature. It looks as if Susan will have to spend the rest of her life in captivity with these creatures until evil alien Gallaxhar sends a giant robot probe to Earth to recover the quantonium. The military is powerless to stop the robot so they use the monsters; they manage to defeat it but Gallaxhar realises that Susan has his quantonium so comes to Earth to recover it himself. If Earth is to survive his plans Susan and her monster friends will have to defeat Gallaxhar and his army of clones.",/review/rw2048733/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2009,DICK STEEL,4," Å Nutshell Review: Monsters vs Aliens
","I'm beginning to wonder whether the 3D novelty is wearing out already, especially if slapped on films that think the beauty of visual effects and animation take precedence over a solid story. Everything here worked to a perfect T, from the very key component of animation, to voice casting, and sound, but what the film ultimately lacked, was a compelling narrative, and soul.",/review/rw2048733/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2011,TheLittleSongbird,8," Nice, clean, smart fun
","As far as Dreamworks movies go, it is not as good as How to Train Your Dragon, Prince of Egypt and Shrek, but for me Monsters vs. Aliens is one of their better efforts. True, the story is predictable and there isn't much character development. That said, the animation is beautiful, with well modelled characters and bold bright colours and backgrounds. Not to mention the battle on the Golden Gate bridge, which was stunning. The writing is also very funny and smart, the references to Close Encounters, ET and Men in Black are clever, the music is fun and the characters while not having much development are likable and charming. The voice acting is also solid and fit their characters well, Reese Witherspoon is a nice surprise and Hugh Laurie especially is fun. All in all, very good fun, not a classic, but enjoyable family entertainment. 8/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2048733/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2009,pberko,7," Doesn't live up to the promise.
","When I first heard of Monsters vs. Aliens I literally went giddy. A 50's B-movie revival! Stephen Colbert as the President! Hugh Laurie as a cockroach! I mean, it's called Monsters vs. Aliens!!!",/review/rw2048733/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2009,dbborroughs,3," Its not that good
","Clever, but not funny animated film from Dreamworks is a unfunny comedy about monsters taking on a alien who wants the energy that is contained in one of the teams members.",/review/rw2048733/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2009,Ramascreen,3," Destroy Monsters Vs. Aliens
","The thing is.. it's just not entirely entertaining. Maybe I expected more and had my hopes up so it's probably partly my fault but MONSTERS Vs. ALIENS is just an average family movie. It's got some amusing moments, a few scenes that will get you to chuckle a bit, Kids will love it, parents will love it, but the rest of us however will be saying 'okay, next!' Thank God it has the 3D because otherwise I'd be staring at my wristwatch from beginning to the end.",/review/rw2048733/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2017,YourFamilyExpert,7," Fluff, but fun fluff
","Monsters vs. Aliens is a family-friendly Dreamworks Animation feature which pits classic sci-fi monsters vs. space aliens, in a 1950's B-movie style showdown with modern humor and the visual flair available through today's computer effects. For a special treat, the film is also available in 3D.",/review/rw2048733/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2010,LOQUE9,," Great Animated Film. Don't listen to the naysayers.

21 April 2009,singwaileung-1,5," Dreamworks needs some new originality
","Monsters and Aliens was a poor clichéd animated outing from Dreamworks. I found some of the pop culture and repetition in an attempt to get cheap laughs were embarrassingly bad. In particular the part where the President tries to make peace with the alien invaders by playing the Beverley Hills Cop theme on an electric piano made me cringe. Another scene where the general was showing images of the monsters to the cabinet with the secretary hysterically screaming on a number of occasions, leading to the president screaming also left me cold.",/review/rw2048733/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2009,3xHCCH,4," So-So, If Not For the 3D Effects
","They were already showing trailers of upcoming movies when we came in. I was very surprised to discover that all three of the movies previewed all had 3D trailers! These were ""Coraline"", ""Up!"" and ""Meatballs"". The studios really have to go the extra mile to ensure people will still be watching in theaters.",/review/rw2048733/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2009,arc_a2007,4," The tagline of this movie should be ""Eh...""
","Because that's exactly what you get. Monsters vs. Aliens isn't a TERRIBLE movie, but it's not very good either. The plot is predictable. That's something that you should expect from movies of this type. But a certain other animation studio (I think you know the one) makes the journey itself so enjoyable, and the scope of adventure so vast that it doesn't matter. Monsters vs. Aliens feels at times like a bunch of action scenes strung together by completely unfunny jokes. There's also a message of female independence here, one that gives the film a chick-flick flair. If that sounds bad, stick around. It gets worse.",/review/rw2048733/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2009,gregeichelberger,5," New 'toon has a brain but very little heart
","One would have to believe that - as far as animated features goes - Dreamworks must feel sort of like Avis Car Rental, No. 2 behind Pixar Studios. This feeling of inferiority was never more apparent with the release of ""Monsters vs. Aliens,"" which is basically ""Monsters, Inc."" meets the ""Incredibles,"" two vastly superior Pixar movies.",/review/rw2048733/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2009,kentro21,7," Good, not great (unless you see it in 3D)
","Monster versus Aliens is a sometimes funny and sometimes interesting, but mostly the story is dull and the plot is nearly a non-entity.",/review/rw2048733/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2009,inyourimage,7," 3D IMAX version - Amazing!!! One small point of contention!
","As far as the artistry and imagery, I was wowed let me tell you! And the plot was even great on the surface! As a mindless 'Overcoming the Monster' plot, it was superb. But...and this is a BIG but...if I see one more movie that portrays the woman as the selfless leading alpha-hero overcoming men and saving the day, and the men as (a) selfish egotists victimizing the poor hapless female, or (b) as a bunch of bumbling idiots following a woman's lead, I think I am seriously going to boycott this society. This seems to be an alarming trend in popular culture that I could really get on a soapbox about, but I'm not. At least not nearly as much as I'd like. The part that really bothers me is that men seem completely complacent in it. Completely unconscious! It would be against my conscience not to at least mention it. This is a pattern, not an anomaly. However, if you are not one to care about underlying ethical concerns such as the subtle systematic emasculation and/or vilification of men, this is a really great movie! It was one big thrill ride that really put me in awe of the creative ability of the human race.",/review/rw2048733/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2009,jhmocha,6," Good, but not quite as good as expected.
","Monsters Vs. Aliens has some really funny moments, but by the time you get to see them on the big screen you've already seen them plenty of times on the small one. So there's not too much left to offer by buying a ticket. I thought the 3D was OK. They have a couple of moments specifically designed around flexing the 3d capabilities, but again nothing mind-blowing.",/review/rw2048733/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2009,mrdonleone,4," quality vs quantity
","and there I was, watching Monsters vs Aliens. it must be easy to make an animated movie. how stupid can someone be? I can see the company sitting on their desks already, thinking what else they could make a movie of. then suddenly, some of the 'artists' jumps up and says 'I have a great idea! let's make a movie about monsters and aliens and let them fight each other!' probably it has been like that. in a time like this, where animated features are being made like dozens in a year, it's a competition to make the best picture. oh wait... did I say 'best' picture? guess again. it's not about quality anymore, it's about quantity. if the movie could make money the most, it's considered a 'good' movie. and you know what? this junk movie actually does make movie a lot! it's easy, it's like a formula: make something kids could enjoy and you will have millions, or perhaps even... billions??? (anoying Dr Evil laugh) I was very happy to go see this, but when I did, I was praying for some beep that would come up, so I would have a reason to go to the lavatory. I hoped I could puke a bit, my own beep would be more interesting to look at than this movie (which is not flawless).",/review/rw2048733/?ref_=tt_urv
