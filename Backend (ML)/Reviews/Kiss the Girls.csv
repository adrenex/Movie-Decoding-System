23 May 2019,truemythmedia,9," Insanely Underrated
","This movie is brilliant. It's severely underrated, criminally misunderstood, and I believe, totally ahead of its time. In ""Falling Down"", Michael Douglas has brought to life one of the most believable, likeable, and disturbing antiheroes of all time. It's a poignant tale of the everyman finally getting sick of the various stupidities, banalities, and irritabilities (I'm coining that if it's not already a word) that plague our modern life. It's a film that, at the beginning is as hilarious as it is true, but as the film continues, it proceeds to become more real, more disturbing, but also more grounded in its message. It's ridiculous and insane, but it also cuts deep to the truths that all of us feel at times.
I've seen a number of Joel Schumacher's films, but this is the only one I could imagine myself watching multiple times. It depicts the American dream better than most films out there. It shows the everyman's struggle to conquer what he believes is wrong. It gives us a person to root for who is idealistic and filled with bravado, but also a man who is seriously flawed. I really believe this picture was ahead of its time; it didn't get incredible reviews, but I'd argue it's Joel Schumacher's crowning achievement.",/review/rw3696919/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2018,Fella_shibby,10," Since when did the average hard working middle class person became the bad guy?
","I first saw this in the mid 90s on a vhs. Revisited it recently on a blu-ray.
I thoroughly enjoyed viewing this again after so many years.
This movie is still relevant today no matter which country u belong to.
Michael Douglas' hypnotic performance is the highlight of this film. Everything about him, from his half sleeve plain white shirt, to his briefcase, his lunch, his specs and his torn shoes all screamed average middle class.
The best line of the film is when Douglas asks Duvall, I am the bad guy?",/review/rw3696919/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 1999,baumer,9," An important look at the decay of society
",Falling Down is the kind of film that has much more more happening than many of us want to know about. It is disguised simply as a film about an apparent nut who goes out and tries to right the wrongs that have been done to him and in his trek across Los Angeles he becomes an anti-hero. ,/review/rw3696919/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2006,MOscarbradley,8," A Road Movie in Reverse
","Joel Schumacher's best film is a brilliantly realized urban nightmare that many people in the audience will identify with. On one of those typical LA dog-days, disgruntled motorist Michael Douglas, caught in what could be the traffic jam from hell, finally decides he can't take it any more, abandons his car on the freeway and decides to walk home and God help anyone who gets in his way.",/review/rw3696919/?ref_=tt_urv

17 August 2007,DavidSim240183,10," One man out to tear down a crippled society one flaw at a time
","I think Joel Schumacher is a really terrible filmmaker. Nearly every one of his films is an exercise in flashy stylistics with not a single thing to say. Look no further than his Batman films. But on one occasion, he managed to rise above his desire for eye-candy overkill. And produce something really worthwhile. And Falling Down was that film.",/review/rw3696919/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2002,Agent10,8," Michael Douglas: voice of the average consumer
","Joel Schumacher's career has gone down the drain since this movie, for now he is just trying to make stupid movies with no sense and style. However this proved to be one of his best films. Michael Douglas portrayed William Forster perfectly, giving us a character who is both sensible and psychotic at the same time. The whole scene with Douglas in the fast food restaurant was priceless, giving a voice to the typical angry consumer. So many messages in the film really brought out the stereotypical infuriated American, and gave us the reactionary nature of such an individual. While this film will most likely leak in to the annals of obscurity, this one will always remain in my video collection.",/review/rw3696919/?ref_=tt_urv

This is elemental and it is very important to balance the D-Fens character. There are so many layers, so many social commentary stabs, that it is hard to break them all down.

11 July 2016,Leofwine_draca,10," One of the best films of the decade
","Joel Schumacher's satire of modern America is just as fresh now as when it first came out. This thriller packs a real punch, telling the story of anti-hero William Foster, who snaps one day while sitting in a traffic jam (echoing the early Stephen king novella ROADWORK) and proceeds to go on a rampage across L. A. It works as a general thriller, with plenty of humour and action set pieces (I enjoyed it when watching as a kid) but at its heart it's a dark, despairing look at the troubles facing today's society. Schumacher is gutsy enough to criticise the integration (or not) into society of non-Americans; gang culture; fast food establishments; customer service; the growth of Neo-Nazism in the US; the nuclear family; marriage breakdown and divorce; the rich/poor divide, and plenty more besides. Lashings of the blackest comedy imaginable abound and despite elements of sentimentality here and there, this remains a striking, powerful and original masterpiece.",/review/rw3696919/?ref_=tt_urv

","It is the hottest day of the year in Los Angeles and the freeway is jammed solid and William Foster has reached breaking point. He abandons his car and heads into a shop and asks for change so he can phone his young daughter on her birthday. The Korean shopkeeper says he won't give change unless he buys something. Unhappy with the prices Foster rages at the man who grabs a sawn off baseball bat; Foster disarms him then smashes some of the produce before buying a drink. Foster then sits down to consume his drink on some waste ground and is confronted by a couple of gang members; he hits out with the bat and takes a butterfly knife one of them dropped. Later the gang track him down and try to shoot him; not only do they completely miss him, they crash their car. Foster walks up to the vehicle and takes a bag full of guns. Things quickly escalate as he pulls out a submachinegun at a fast food restaurant, confronts a neo-Nazi storekeeper and rages at a pair of golfers. All the time heading towards his estranged wife in Venice Beach.",/review/rw3696919/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2000,Quinoa1984,10," American Beauty meets George Carlin
","Joel Schumacher's Falling Down is really an under-rated film.  Michael Douglas gives his best performance yet as a middle aged man who is now gone completely insane.  I compare it to American Beauty and George Carlin because basically that is what this is.  A regular guy who's had enough of life (and goes around lecturing people about how life for him sucks). Still, Schumacher, Douglas and co-star Robert Duvall try their best and succeed with perfect precision.  One of the best films of 1993.",/review/rw3696919/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2019,UniqueParticle,10," My 7th favorite film is a masterful look at how crumbled society has become!
","Michael Douglas's best film ever and is his personal favorite of his career! So many examples of how money issues have increased, how much meaner people have gotten, territories taken over property that definitely doesn't belong to them, the unfortunate racism, and the devastating factor of lack of wanting to live. I get so immersed into every scene when I watch Falling Down, I originally saw it on HBO around 5 years ago and now own a nice Blu-Ray copy.",/review/rw3696919/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2019,inspectorbob,9," a 26 year old Masterpiece!
","It has been 26 years since this movie came out. I saw it finally yesterday after desiring to see it since it was first advertised on circuit all those years ago.
And what's my synopsis of this semi-vintage movie?...brilliant! So worth it! So much better than I ever imagined it could be! And not outdated at all!
I expected it would be a novel, fun, action-packed movie about a guy who's had enough; with something of a pointed statement/indictment against our modern urban society. And it is that...but also so much more!
This film is a masterpiece; it is beautiful and poignant art. There is not a scene or a shot or an utterance that is not absolutely intentional, loaded with depth and/or intrinsic to both the unfolding narrative and to its poetic depiction of humanity and the state of the world. It's a film that makes me feel robbed for having watched dozens of mindless one-dimensional action movies over these years. The writer (Ebbe Roe Smith), the director (Joel Shumacher), the awesome actors Douglas and Duvall and everyone involved with this production do not deserve a tinselly Oscar...they deserve a medal! And this movie deserves a shelf at the Louvre! And it most certainly deserves to be watched!
As for me, I will be grabbing my shovel and go tracing the seam of movies from these great artists in search for more undiscovered gold.
Last words: know that the language is not toned down and the very hard, very real issues that it deals with are weighty, so it's not for every audience or every occasion. But it couldn't have been any other way for being a look on real life. Phenomenal though that there is such hopefulness, joy, inspiration, overflowing humour and clever wit in this story. It is not at all a dark or depressing or ugly movie while it deals with matter in our society that is just that. It is like a great red wine that has the sweet and the bitter and the dry just perfectly balanced ... you take a sip, savour it and sigh out, in deep satisfaction!",/review/rw3696919/?ref_=tt_urv

20 January 2004,Beaux,," Excellent Observations of Society
","""Falling Down"" is a film that intends to point out the many quirks and oddities of modern urban society.  It succeeds in doing so, but one must look carefully.  Each situation Bill Foster (Michael Douglas) faces is one that most people can relate to.  However, unlike most people he decides to ""fight the system"" and wage war on the everyday annoyances that we all face. Foster is a People's Champion.  To illustrate this, most people who watch this film naturally pull for him and see him as being a hero, mostly out of pure sympathy.  However, at the end of the day, Foster is still ""the bad guy"" for going against the societal grain.  Most viewers will find this upsetting or even unfair, considering that he fought back against many criminals and unjust forces.  ",/review/rw3696919/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2007,Bobbydange,10," Somebody explain to me how this isn't on the top 250.
","I declare this one of the most underrated movies ever made. What a great story. Just look at the situations in the movie. Did people not understand this movie? I think because of the way the movie was shot people look at it like a B movie but if you really think about it, it's far from that. There are so many parts that are just purely classic. You can relate to so many things in this movie. That's what the movie was trying to do. It was suppose to show you this little story about this average guy who goes off of the deep end... but then you look closer and you realize how many things you can truly relate to. How many things subconsciously frustrate you and how you never do anything about it. It shows how life is a double edged sword for some people, showing you that if you take matters into your own hands it comes back to you in the end and if you play by the rules you get screwed over. If you were to ask me what I thought about this film after I first saw it I would say that the movie was a cult classic. But sadly it's an underrated forgotten movie. I love this film. I give it 10 stars. If I could give it 11 I would. A movie that will be forever misunderstood.",/review/rw3696919/?ref_=tt_urv

11 April 2006,srobi280,10," Michael Douglas is having a very bad day.
","Falling down is a movie that makes people take a look inside themselves. Have you ever felt so angry you want to explode? Have you ever had a week, or even a single day when nothing is going your way and everything seems to be going wrong? Who hasn't? On these days, you just want to throw your hands in the air and say ""I give up!"" Many people hold in their anger for days, weeks, months, or even years. They get up in the morning, go to work, come home, go to sleep, and do it all over again. There is no release of stress. People keep holding in this anger and tension, and it just builds, and builds, and keeps building, until it can build no more. This is the point where people lose it. This is the point where people commit suicide. This is the point where people go on shooting sprees. This is the point where people commit horrible crimes of passion, or just simply disappear and start a new life.",/review/rw3696919/?ref_=tt_urv

30 April 2017,ironhorse_iv,8," I had fallen for Falling Down. It's one of my favorite films of the 1990s.
","We've all had bad days. And oftentimes, a day that starts out horrible just keeps getting worse, snowballing into a really awful day. This is how 1993's crime thriller, 'Falling Down' begins. Directed by Joel Schumacher & taken place on, one of the hottest days in Los Angeles, California's history; the film written by Ebbe Roe Smith, the film tells the story of an defense worker, William Foster (Michael Douglas) trying to get home for his daughter's birthday party, only to get frustrated with the various flaws he sees in society, which starts to unravel him, until he suffer from a major to psychotically and violently unstable mental breakdown. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, that, the English Hard Rock Band, Iron Maiden got it right with this man. He was truly on the edge, with each step gets closer to losing his head. Even if, we can't condone his extreme actions, as least, some of us, can relate to the issues, he had to deal with. Everybody, at least, had one of these days. If you can't relate to his struggles, as least, you can understand, the frustrations that Det. Martin Prendergast (Robert Duvall), had to deal with on his last day on the force on figuring out the mystery, who is this madman, is all about. Both of these character's stories, make 'Falling Down', a very intriguing, yet challenging movie, worth watching. Added to that, is the wonderful use of music by James Newton Howard that set the mood, and powerful visual cinematography from Andrzej Bartkowiak under Schumacher's direction. Sunny LA has never look, so bleak and hopeless, before. Great use of desaturated and low tech camera-work and shooting at rundown locations. Also great use of symbolism and metaphors throughout the film, like the running use of the lyrics of 'London Bridge' & others. However, I do have to say, the film isn't with some faults & I'm not talking about the minor nitpicking goofs. I'm talking about how the film was notorious criticize by critics at the time, for its treatment of minorities; mostly with how they show Korean and Latino Americans as thugs. It got so bad, that Warner Brothers canceled the release of 'Falling Down' in South Korea & certain Latin America countries following boycott threats. In my opinion, while I can understand the reasons, why minorities groups like Korean & Latino American Coalition got anger. After all, the film was made, during and released just after the 1992 Los Angeles Riot where Koreans and Latinos were targeted by police and looters. In truth, there was plenty of positive, Hispanic & Asian Americans characters in the film, like Detective Brian (Steve Park) & Detective Sandra Torres (Rachel Ticotin). Both characters were played by Korean and Latina performers. If anything, if you look at the majority of negatively characters, throughout the film. Most of them, were portray with white actors. Plus, as a minority, the portrayal weren't as bad, as people back then, make it out to be. Compare to other films back then, it's pretty tame. I just think, these groups are just missing the point. The film is trying to tackle the struggles, of trying to get along, despite cultural differences, language as well, as the economic conditions, in which, many of us, Americans, lived under. Honestly, if there is any real faults for this film, it wouldn't be their use of harsh-language & violence; if anything, it would be, due to the fact, that the film couldn't stop itself, being label as the negative 'angry white racism man' movie. While, on the surface, the film might look like the stereotypically disproportionally portrayal of an older White Americans, having animosity toward minorities; in truth, the film is nothing like that. We sees, throughout the film, William Foster getting along with a number of minorities. Some good examples are the 'Under Construction' scene, where a young unnamed black kid (Valentino Harrison) teach him, how to use a bazooka and the scene with the not economically viable man (Vondie Curtis-Hall). There is even, a scene where Foster disagree with a Neo-Nazi Surplus Store Owner (Frederic Forrest) about race. Because of that, I can't say, Foster is a racism character, nor can I say the movie glorifies lawbreaking. Of course, we see many elements of our society that contributed to his madness. However, the movie never condones his actions as the right thing to do. He's never the hero. If anything, Robert Duvall's character, is. Despite that, I do have to say, portrayal Foster is probably the best role, Michael Douglas has done, since 1987's 'Wall Street'. You really do see, the unbalance nature of his character, trying to figure out, what is right and what is wrong in a world that he views is upside down. You see his alienation, disgust and mounting rage against what he perceives to be an increasingly unfair and depersonalized world. However, I can't say, the same with Robert Duvall's character. His performance was a bit, too similar to the role, he played in 1988's 'Colors'; still interesting, but in the end, he really didn't stand out as much as Douglas does. After all, Douglas's character inspired the creation of the one-episode character Frank Grimes from The Simpsons 23th episode ""Homer's Enemy,"" on Season 8 and received a parodic homage song in Foo Fighters' video for ""Walk"". In the end, the dark comedy of this movie really does payoff; both tragedy and humorous. Either way, it's a film that inspires quite a bit of discussion and debate. That's one thing, I love about this movie. It makes you think. Depending on who you ask, this film is either social commentary on the dangers of capitalism, and the ignorance of the citizen under it or the call to arms for conservatism against the dangers of liberalism. All these arguments have merit and it could be any of this. That's why, this is one movie that is worth seeing.",/review/rw3696919/?ref_=tt_urv
