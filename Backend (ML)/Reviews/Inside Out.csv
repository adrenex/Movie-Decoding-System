8 April 2019,cardsrock,7," Carried by charismatic leads
","I enjoyed the chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Hathaway quite a bit. It's definitely the selling point of this film and makes it watchable. The story involving pharmaceutical companies and the healthcare industry is interesting, as is the late 90s setting. The film ultimately falls into typical rom com conventions though. However, the chemistry of the two leads and the focus on the struggle of Parkinson's help make this one slightly rise above the pack.",/review/rw2448065/?ref_=tt_urv

25 November 2010,Movie_Muse_Reviews,6," Good chemistry is the best drug for any standard romance
","Love stories are essentially the same -- it's a matter of how you dress  them up. Many will see through ""Love and Other Drugs"" and count the  romance clichés and formulaic characters, others will find the 1996  setting and the pharmaceutical angle refreshing. Both forces are hard  at work in this film, but the tipping point goes in favor thanks to the  leads, Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway.  There's a reason most romantic films are judged based on the chemistry  of their lead actors. When it comes to romance, it's not about how  cleverly written the two characters are and how unique and special they  feel to us. What counts is whether they can convince you of their  attraction/love and get you to -- without blunt coercion -- invest in  what happens to them. Gyllenhaal and Hathaway have what it takes to do  just that in spite of a script that sometimes tries to lean too hard on  conventional tactics of boys meets girl.  Gyllenhaal plays Jamie, an expert salesman who lands a gig as a  pharmaceutical sales rep for Pfizer, right before Viagra hit the  market. He's also adept at landing any woman he desires. He epitomizes  a Don Juan and he's plays the type well, but when you can predict that  he'll end up in bed with the next attractive woman that shows up on  screen, the writing has taken it a bit far.   As good of a filmmaker as Edward Zwick is, his best credits include  ""Glory,"" ""The Last Samurai"" and ""The Blood Diamond"" -- not exactly  romance. He co-wrote the script (based on Jamie Reidy's memoir) with  longtime collaborator Marshall Herskovitz and thriller writer Charles  Randolph (""The Interpreter""), so no real romantic comedy prowess exists  among them, hence the tendency to stick with genre conventions. One  such convention is Jamie's brother (Josh Gad), who plays the little  brother crashing on Jamie's couch who has a porn addiction and makes  clueless statements, usually to the tune of no laughs, but he does help  break the tension.  Enter girl. Jamie meets Maggie, a bit of a free-spirited cynic who (in  a unique twist) has way early onset Parkinson's. Many will be quick to  jump on the ""diseased girl"" archetype, but don't judge Hathaway's  prowess that quickly. As completely pathetic as Maggie's self-esteem  might be and how strictly anti-commitment she is, when her character  caves in to the romance as they all do, Hathaway gives Maggie a  believable fragility rather than a melodramatic tone.   Jamie's motives for wanting to spend more time with Maggie and not  simply continuing his streak of banging all who possess lady parts are  reduced to the reason of ""she's playing hard to get,"" which is not the  best of reasons. The same can be said about Maggie constantly accusing  Jamie of having pity sex with the diseased girl. However, watching  these two charm each other and overcome the cliché has a definite  appeal.  The two spend a lot of naked time together, making ""Love and Other  Drugs"" the best date movie this holiday season. But on a serious note,  the drug angle and the ""recent past"" setting give us something else to  chew on, which is nice. Zwick never truly marries that story line with  the romance except ""Jamie sells drugs and Maggie has a disease that  lacks an effective one."" The thematic ties are not quite there despite  the plot coincidences and the fitting title.  ""Love and Other Drugs"" is hardly the cure for the common romantic  comedy, but the consistent dosage of its two stars by and large pushes  away those symptoms.  ~Steven C",/review/rw2448065/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2010,hyprsleepy,," Expected what I saw in the trailer and got more
","Despite what some may say, Love and Other Drugs wasn't like other romantic comedies I've seen except in the most general of senses, in that it was a romantic comedy. I hadn't seen one set in the environment of pharmaceutical sales or with a main character who had Parkinsons disease, a setting which is very interesting as there are a lot of things wrong with health care and the system today. It gives one something to chew on while watching the rest of the movie.",/review/rw2448065/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2010,blanbrn,9," Blunt and provocative feel good enjoyment film driven by plenty of sex, yet it proves hot feel good sex can lead to love!
","I must say that ""Love and Other Drugs"" is clearly one of the better films I've saw in awhile. For a variety of reasons for one the chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Hathaway is in perfect form as the two worked together before(as a couple in ""Brokeback Mountain""). Second it's an emotional story that involves sickness and finding unexpected love. And finally what can I say the film has plenty of passion, lust and hot steamy love scenes so plenty plenty of sex! So aside from those reasons this picture can best be summed up as a kind of old fashioned romance falling in love story that touches your emotions as you feel the couples(Jamie and Maggie)growing pains of trust, sickness and feel good pleasure. Still the sex overshadows those ingredients leaving a happy and feel good side effect for a viewer like me and it helps because I'm a big Anne Hathaway fan and with this picture you get to see plenty of her skin.",/review/rw2448065/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2010,carlabag,8," Portrayal of degenerative disease SPOT-ON
","Like Maggie, I was diagnosed with a degenerative, neurological illness (with no cure or treatment) in my early 30s, and also met my husband around that time. Hathaway's acting (and the script) captures with devastating accuracy the emotions one goes through when confronting a degenerative illness at an early age, particularly when falling in love (i.e. trying to push someone away/set them free before you become a burden on them; stubbornly seeking independence/avoiding vulnerability, though in real life, you really do need someone to love and take care of you; wanting to avoid the grief inherent in your diagnosis, and particularly, wanting to avoid pulling someone ELSE into that grief; going out and seeking support groups, and feeling empowered by this; getting angry at your partner's refusal to accept what is; etc. etc.) ",/review/rw2448065/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2010,sacflyzone,8," Slow Start, Great Finish... Anne Hathaway is Wonderful
","The movie starts out as a generic and even pedestrian romantic comedy and appears to be headed in the typical cliché driven direction but, fortunately, evolves in to something more. Jake Gyllenhaal's character and his alleged ""funny"" fat side kick are established almost purposefully as illustrations of what's wrong with most romantic comedies. It's Anne Hathaway's character that is the catalyst for the transformation from two dimensional rom-com to something deeper and more enjoyable. As she is fleshed out (pun intended because the more Anne Hathaway nudity the better) her character forces both Gyllenhaal's character and the film itself to grow (almost Viagra like). What follows is a deep, sometimes moving and genuinely interesting film. Commentary about battling illness, life and enjoying the moment are all relevant and poignant. Even supporting characters are given moments to shine. Oliver Pratt's drug rep has a wonderful scene delivered over dinner and there's even a smart drunken ramble explaining what is wrong with being a doctor and a commentary on the state of the Hippocratic Oath. From an emotionless and even tedious start, this film surprised me and is worth the price of a ticket.",/review/rw2448065/?ref_=tt_urv

Being kicked out of his job at an electronic store for his amorous ways, he soon finds himself applying his innate ways with women into his selling routine, now working as a sales rep in the medical industry for Pfizer, which when he joined hasn't created the magical blue pill called Viagra yet.",/review/rw2448065/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2018,nogodnomasters,8," COMEDY TO LOVE STORY
","The movie starts out as a great man's comedy with Jake Gyllenhaal charming every woman from 8 to 80 selling them lower tier electronics. This basically lasted through the credits as he gets fired for being a little too charming with the boss's girlfriend in the stock room. His family has money and he gets a job as a Pfizer salesman, something the movie makes out to be an evil job. He uses his charm and ability to have casual sex to sell drugs. During this time he meets Anne Hathaway (multiple nude scenes, thank you Anne) and they have incredible casual sex. The movie was great up to this point. Then we find out Anne has Parkinson's disease which is why she is a free spirit.",/review/rw2448065/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2011,mooviefan-891-879574,8," not the average romantic comedy ( and thats a good thing)
","This is one of those movies that have a weird marketing campaign, the studio wants to sell it like a romantic comedy when its more like a drama with complex and real characters. Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyleenhaal have good chemistry on screen and secondary characters help to bring equilibrium to a movie that other way could turn to be a little depressing. I also think that this movie doesn't deserve the R rating just because it deals with sex ( I live in Mexico and here we have something like PG-15)hopefully people don't feel to uncomfortable with the sex scene because it gives more credibility to the story.In the end the film works better than others of its genre and its worth a look ( probably not for a first date) but if you are already on a relationship it will give you something to think and talk about.",/review/rw2448065/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Love & Other Drugs"" is another example of how Anne Hathaway is one of the most talented actresses from her generation. She managed to score a Golden Globe nomination just like her co-star Jake Gyllenhaal. I have to say I am not his greatest fan, so I was neither too impressed with his performance here nor did I manage to find him likable near the end which was probably the intention.

6 January 2016,anaconda-40658,2," You Need Drugs to Get Through It.
","Love and Other Drugs (2010): Dir: Edward Zwick / Cast: Jake Gyllenhaal, Anne Hathaway, Oliver Platt, Hank Azaria, Josh Gad: What drugs could possibly assist someone in getting through a screening of this junk? The drug in question is feelings and it stars Jake Gyllenhaal as a womanizer who recently lost his job then he is roomed with his slob brother and selling drug samples at doctors offices. He meets his match in Anne Hathaway, a victim of Parkinsons disease whom he will suddenly give a sh*t about. This is all very phony and even the disease subject seems like an ill contrived plot device. Director Edward Zwick previously made much different films in Blood Diamond and Courage Under Fire but here he can merely watch his actors become undone by dipstick circumstances. It is easily one of the worst films Zwick has ever attached his name to, and a total opposite to the greatness of Blood Diamond. Gyllenhaal is a fine actor but here he lacks the sincerity required. Hathaway is a stunning presence whose first scene has her exposing a breast. Eventually she shows up at Gyllenhaal's apartment dropping her robe displaying all of her goods. The view is spectacular but it comes off as desperate. In flat supporting roles are Oliver Platt as a job associate of Gyllenhaal's who eats a lot. Hank Azaria plays a doctor whom seeks Viagra from Gyllenhaal. This movie is everywhere. At one point it wants to be charming and funny, then it gets emotional presenting serious talk about Parkinsons. What it doesn't do is suggest the right drugs one should take to erase this drivel from memory. Score: 2 / 10",/review/rw2448065/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2011,zetes,7," The leads are good enough to make the film worth a watch
","A fairly standard romance. Jake Gyllenhaal plays a representative (i.e., salesman) for Pfizer who meets up with Anne Hathaway in a doctor's office and falls for her. At first he just assumes she's a prescription medicine junky (which he obviously doesn't look down on, since he's pretty much just a pusher). It turns out, though, that she really does have Parkinson's disease and is refusing to let him get closer to her because she doesn't want to hurt him (or be hurt by him if he runs away when things get too rough). The film does work, though, mostly because Hathaway is excellent. Gyllenhaal's pretty good, too. You also get some good supporting performances from people like Hank Azaria, Oliver Platt and Judy Greer. One big negative aspect: Gyllenhaal's fat, obnoxious younger brother played by Josh Gad. I think they wanted to cast Jonah Hill, but he was too big a star for such a role. Gad is a lookalike with about half as much talent. But, really, the flaw is mostly in the writing. The guy's a pretty poor excuse for comic relief. He does completely unbelievable things (like masturbating to a sex tape starring his brother and his brother's girlfriend, then, when getting caught, asking his brother how his penis got so big?!?!), and his joke lines are completely unfunny.",/review/rw2448065/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2010,tavm,6," Love and Other Drugs has good performances by Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway despite the movie's occasionally uneven tone
","If you're familiar with the names of writers/producers Marshall Herskovitz and Ed Zwick from their TV output of ""Thirtysomething"", ""My So-Called Life"", ""Relativity"", and ""Once and Again"", you may know their reputation of creating characters that are complex and therefore not always likable enough to completely relate. That's the case with this movie that they're also responsible for. Basically, Jake Gyllenhaal plays a drug executive who's always been good with the ladies at least until he meets a patient played by Anne Hathaway who sees right through him. I'll just stop there and just say how nice to see these veterans of Brokeback Mountain have more of each other to play against compared to the previous film's story-dictating of some separations. And despite some character flaws, the characters they play do have some remarkable good chemistry due to both the actors and some of the script/improvisations. But despite some good laughs, Herskovitz-Zwick do provide some rough edges that almost threaten to cast some pall over the proceedings. Still, having said all that, Love and Other Drugs is a worthy adult dramady for all involved though I do have one real caveat: Why put George Segal and the recently departed Jill Clayburgh here and just have them have one dinner table sequence where neither gets to really show their stuff?",/review/rw2448065/?ref_=tt_urv
