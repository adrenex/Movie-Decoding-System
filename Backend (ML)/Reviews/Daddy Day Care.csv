4 June 2003,Rob_Taylor,7," Harmless fun for those who don't need swearing to find something amusing.
","Y'know, it's kind of sad to see some of the comments bemoaning Eddie Murphy for not swearing enough anymore. It's almost as if some people equate foul language with humour. If you're one of those people who thinks a comic sketch is much funnier with swearing in it, then you'll no doubt not like Eddie in this movie.",/review/rw1376320/?ref_=tt_urv

","Eddie Murphy and Jeff Garlin are two fathers who lose their jobs in product development at a large food company and decide to set up their very own day care centre. Using unconventional methods 'Daddy Day Care' starts to catch on, bringing with it the rivalry from Anjelica Huston who runs the Chapman academy and has already driven all the other competitors out of business.",/review/rw1376320/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2013,avigailbenzagmi,8," Its a great movie!!!!!!
",this movie is rated low just because its a comedy. If you check all the movies are comedies rated low (especially Eddie Murphys). Eddie Murphys is an actor who plays amazing and funny in many good movies. This comedy movie is good  for the whole family and very fun to see it t in a family movie night. If you choose not to see this movie because of its rating then you make a big mistake (believe me it's not a waste of time).its music is great. and you will enjoy watching it. I loved this movie sow match i watched it like about four times. this movie is good for all ages and don't be afraid to show it to your kids because its just fine.,/review/rw1376320/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2008,canuckteach,9," A more subdued Eddie shows that less IS more..
","Caught this today on DVD with a buddy's grand-kids, and was pleasantly surprised. I have given it 9 out of 10, not for pure artistic merit, but as a funny 'family-film'. Certainly, the current rating here at IMDb is pessimistic. There are only 2 or 3 decent films of this sort produced annually in Hollywood, the rest being utter trash.",/review/rw1376320/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2014,Shopaholic35,9," The perfect family comedy.
","OK did everybody forget that this movie is a family comedy. To the person who sits behind their computer screen quoting Eddie Murphy's earlier work, why did you even watch this. There is no shock we all knew this was a movie for kids and their parents and the young at heart. Please move on and stop trying to drag down the rating because you didn't feel this role was good enough for him.",/review/rw1376320/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2013,mrso_ory,7," Wholesome Fun
","This is just a funny and fun movie. And as one user wrote, the chemistry between all the actors and kid actors really makes the movie. We could use more movies like this. Nothing inappropriate either. It is one of those movies that you come away smiling. It's a feel good movie. I imagine if more people would support these kinds of movies maybe Hollywood would make more. I do wonder if there are more people than we think who secretly enjoy a good wholesome movie. And love Steve Zahn. Eddie Murphy is so good when he keeps it clean. He seems genuinely nice and, of course, love his voice for animated characters.",/review/rw1376320/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2005,stephen_thanabalan_fans,7," The Cast (even the kids) are tremendous fun!
","Casting for this film was brilliant. In fact, it could not have been anything less, given that the final edited product - which boasts of great interplay and chemistry between the crew, cast and the kids- was a great family film (decent, entertaining, and heartfelt). What is particularly nifty is that in this film, like some others including Judge Reinhold's Vice Versa (1988), we get to see a children's movie for adults with both the kids and the adults sharing equal stage presence, which really is splendid.

5 April 2004,MLDinTN,," Actually entertaining...
","to my surprise. This wasn't half bad.  The first time in a long time, I've found an Eddie Murphy movie to be OK.  Of course, it isn't him that makes this film, but the kids.  They were the ones which were funny.  How can you not laugh when a little girl kicks a fat guy in the crotch for no reason with her mother by her side.  Plus when all the kids are given sugar treats for lunch and are bouncing off the walls.  And there are many other scenes like that one.",/review/rw1376320/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2005,Smells_Like_Cheese,8," Very cute and fun for the family
","I honestly thought that ""Daddy Day Care"" was a very cute movie. I really had my doubts since I don't have my own kids lucky enough, I don't have to watch this. But my mom said to give the movie a shot and to have fun with it. I was plesantly surprised and laughed more than a few times. Yes, it's a cheesy movie and very typical, but you have to learn to have a little fun with it. It reminded me a lot of ""Kindergarten Cop"". You have got to admit that this was a lot better than Eddie Murphy's last film ""The Haunted Mansion"". It's got laughter, drama, and just good old slap stick fun that you or the whole family will enjoy. Just give it a shot.",/review/rw1376320/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2003,Agent10,6," So sticky sweet that you might be sick or satisfied, depending on what kind of person you are
","Okay, okay. How exactly do you give a movie like this a horrible grade? It's too cute to call bad, and how can an innocent children's film be considered a corrupted form of entertainment. Well, I guess I'm a sucker. With all of the cute kids, the laughable Star Trek fan (Steve Zahn at his best), and a diverse collection of neurotic characters plays into a movie that was focused-grouped t o the point of near banality. But then again, you can't put this film down simply because the kids were so great. So, I put down Eddie Murphy, who must be longing for the days of Beverly Hills Cop. Sure, he was respectable and funny, but his hard hitting days are well past him. I will say this, Lacey Chabert was absolutely smoking, and Angelica Huston was perfect as the evil school marm.",/review/rw1376320/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2003,Ben_Cheshire,6," First Class family entertainment
","See this with the whole family. Cute, funny, well-made tale is really an adult movie, though it was marketed as a kids movie. You really care about these characters, and desparately want everything to turn out well for them. A pleasant surprise. Best fun Eddie Murphy movie since Dr Dolittle.",/review/rw1376320/?ref_=tt_urv

","Ever since I saw ""Baby Geniuses"" I automatically hated any movie that involved obnoxious young toddlers...especially babies who are supposed to be smarter than everyone else. But two years ago when I was in grade six, and it was in theaters, a couple of my friends wanted to see it, so I thought ""how bad could it really be?!"" ",/review/rw1376320/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2005,SpazMcG7,8," Mixed Feelings
","I've seen this movie a couple of times and I'm feeling rather mixed about it. On one level I have a new kind of respect for Eddie, seeing him in a nice family movie that I can show my baby cousins and still laugh at myself. However I also know that we've passed the point of no return on this one, we will never again see the strong 80's Eddie that we once loved. I suppose we should look at this as a new chapter in the career of one of America's funniest men, and while it is depressing I'm still slightly awed that Eddie is still on the scene. After several blundering movies and one very sorry attempt at singing stardom we find an enduring man who can in fact change with the times. So for all the Daddy DayCare bashers I think you should just be glad the our favorites Murphy man is still around.",/review/rw1376320/?ref_=tt_urv

10 March 2007,bob the moo,," Adult pratfalls and cute kids  it isn't any good but at least you know what you're getting
","Fired from their marketing jobs, Charlie and Phil find themselves running low on cash to the point where Charlie and wife Kim have to withdraw son Ben from his exclusive prep school, Chapman. This gives them an idea though and soon they have turned the Hinton household into the base for Daddy Day Care. Things get off to a slow start but soon the men find their feet and their unique approach (which mostly involves reacting to the children) finds a market. This brings them into conflict with Mrs Harridan, who runs the main prep school in the area.",/review/rw1376320/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2005,hcalderon1,10," Mr. Moms
","Eddie Murphy has come along way since his stand-up days. Finally a movie he can sit with his own kids. For anybody with kids will love this movie. This movie starts with two out of work dads (Eddie Murphy and Jeff Garlin) begin to stay at home with their kids while their wives work. Till one day they decide to run a daycare center, much of the dismay of their wives. But managing a bunch of 4 year olds is not as easy as it seems. But when they become a success, an evil strict school principal sets up a scheme to ruin them. And that's all I will tell you about the movie. It was a funny family orientated movie. The kids were cute and funny. Eddie Murphy and Jeff Garlin had me laughing my head off. If you are curious go out and rent this movie.",/review/rw1376320/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2006,mholmes899,10," Feel good movie
","Daddy daycare is a feel good movie for me. I'm not sure why but I never cared for Eddie's previous movies, expect for SNL. My son watches it with me and imitates the little boy, Ben. I think it's nice story of a man who really cares for the children and loves his son. There is no violence or cursing and I appreciate that. I also think there home is beautiful. I like looking at how they decorate. The kids are so cute. My favorite part is when Marvin meets Kelly for the first time and he falls for her. Marvin keep on tripping over his words. I would like to see a Daddy Daycare part 2. I hope this helps someone who hasn't seem this movie. That is all I have to say.",/review/rw1376320/?ref_=tt_urv

20 October 2003,danimac616,," Daddy Day Care is da bomb!
","Ever since I was a youngster, I have loved Eddie Murphy.  He's been in many different roles, we've seen him as a vet in Doctor Dolittle, a prince who wants to be an average American in Coming To America, but really have we never seen him as a father figure.  However you do, in Daddy Day Care.  I saw the movie last night, and I thought it was one of the best Eddie Murphy movies i've seen since Coming To America and the Nutty Professor movies. The supporting cast is brilliant, especially Steve Zahn.  This movie is a good family movie, and it's one of the best since the classic, Old Yeller. Daddy Day Care made me think of males in a totally different way, and by the way the message is good too.  All in all, I thought this was a great family movie.",/review/rw1376320/?ref_=tt_urv

","I thought Daddy Day Care was a good movie, and I think that Eddie Murphy pulled off the role really well. Outside of Dr. Doolittle and Dr. Doolittle 2, I'm used to seeing Eddie Murphy in roles where he can cut up and be very NON PG. I'm also used to seeing Eddie Murphy take over the show and be the show so to speak, but Daddy Day Care wasn't all about Eddie. The kids had their small but valuable contributions, and the other co-stars added some good flavor to the movie as well. It ended up being a nice family movie that wasn't so over the top with antics to be absurd, and at the same time not being to bogged down with sappy melodrama. Eddie Murphy hit a solid line drive with this one.",/review/rw1376320/?ref_=tt_urv
