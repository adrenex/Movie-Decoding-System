15 November 2014,kuashie,9," You are being watched, the machine.
","This is a cleverly made series with a kick ass plot, interesting acting and character and a very bad-ass hero. This series keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout, since its concept broadens the paths the series can take.",/review/rw2494831/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2011,johnnymacbest,," An action thriller with substance.
","From the opening moments of ""Person of Interest"" I was gripped like wet rope from beginning to end. This is because JJ Abrams and Jonathan Nolan, a successful collaboration at best, delivers thrilling action in both it's plot and action scenes. But what I like most about this series is it's exploration of the post-911 world of NYC and the ""surveillance State"" which is so plausible that it's frighteningly disturbing. Though admittedly vague, more will be explained in future episodes in further detail.",/review/rw2494831/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Person of Interest"" is the brainchild of Jonathan Nolan, the brother of director Chirstopher Nolan. Jonathan wrote the screenplays for Christopher's movies ""Memento"", ""Batman Begins"", ""The Prestinge"", ""The Dark Knight"", as well as the upcoming ""The Dark Knight Rises"", and ""Man of Steel"", which Christopher is producing. But, back to ""Person of Interest"". John Reese (Jim Cavezil. OK, I did NOT spell that right. It's the guy that played Jesus in ""Passion of the Christ"", is a former government agent who experienced a tragic event in his past, and wants to conceal it from everyone. He is essentially homeless, but possesses some pretty impressive fighting skills. It's these fighting skills that make him noticed by two people: the first is an NYPD agent, Carter (Taraji P. Henson), who doens't really know who Reese is, and Reese doens't want to reveal anything to her. The other person is Finch (Michael Emmerson), a mysterious millionaire who was hired by the government after 9/11 to create a Big Brother like machine that would help save innocent people from being killed. But, eventually, the Machine began to take on a mind of it's own, and Finch took matters into his own hands, helping these people on his own, without the help of the government. It's this that leads him to Reese. He sees in Reese someone like him, a person who can't get over past tragedies, and it's those tragedies that are holding him back from being successful. Finch and Reese become somewhat of business partners, with Finch using Reese to find ways to save innocent people. But, sometimes, these people are not as innocent as they seem.",/review/rw2494831/?ref_=tt_urv

","Person of Interest was such a great show! It will hook you from the first episode and hold you at the edge of your seat for the entire series. Just about every episode was good.

1 November 2011,abecipriano,10," Best new drama of the 2011 US shows
","I've been totally addicted to this show ever since I watched the pilot a few weeks ago. James Caviezel is dark, brooding, yet calm and methodical when he's in action. Michael Emerson from Lost is also effective as the guy who invented the machine that predicts that violent crimes are about to happen.",/review/rw2494831/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," This was such a great show!
","As most people have already said on these reviews, Person of Interest was such a underrated show. It follows former CIA agent John Reese (Jim Caviezel), who's presumed dead, and billionaire tech genius Harold Finch (Michael Emerson) as the join forces to fight criminals. Finch created a computer system that recognizes patterns to determine violent crimes before they happen and these two try to stop them. It will hook you from the first episode and hold you at the edge of your seat for the entire series. Every episode is thrilling and worth watching. Just read through the reviews to see how loved this show was. It's not your average procedural tv show, it's so much better.

23 September 2011,Sylviastel,9," Give It Time!
","I love the lead actors, Jim Cazaviel and Michael Emerson, who play Reese and Finch in this post-9-11 world. Finch finds and bails Reese out of jail and hires him to help protect Jessica Hanson in the first episode from being killed or killing. Unlike other crime dramas on the air, they don't play by the book which is refreshing. I hope they add more female characters in to help explain Finch and Reese's backgrounds. I love Michael Emerson ever since his performance in Lost. As Finch, he's totally believable as the rich billionaire who wants to make a difference and stop further horrible attacks such as murder. We don't know why he does it except how he felt after the September 11 attacks in New York City but he realized how much or how little money and power. Finch developed a system to help track persons of interest before something terrible happens to him. Reese is perfect as a former government agent disillusioned by the agency and the world to help him foil further plots. I keep looking for the future for this show and hope it lasts a season.",/review/rw2494831/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2011,sasazg-1,," Something new, something really good
","Finally, something original. The whole premise of the show seems little bit strange at times, but it makes sense. It's something we haven't seen on TV in while. I like the actors that were casted for the show, Jim Caviezel looks good as an ex-CIA hit-man, his martial arts sequences are credible, he looks like he knows what his doing. Michael Emerson is perfect in his role, as an odd billionaire who is a genius. A strange team that solves strange cases, it has a mysterious vibe which is good, it has a JJ Abrams signature all over. Nice bounce back for him after the failure of The Undercovers last year.",/review/rw2494831/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2016,alissarios-100,10," One of the best shows I've ever seen
","This show is truly genius. It starts out as an intriguing procedural with the premise that a very intelligent man creates an all seeing AI and sells it to the government for protection against terrorist attacks. The ""Machine"" as they call it, separates the threats into two categories: relevant to national security, and irrelevant to national security. Horrified that the government couldn't care less about the irrelevant threats (everyday crime and murder) Harold Finch enlists John Reese to save peoples lives, but with a twist. The machine has been coded to only give a social security number in order to protect the public's privacy. Now Finch and Reese must save lives with limited information and keep the streets of NYC safe. ",/review/rw2494831/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2011,tmcdaniel1,9," Simply well done
","It is hard to do something fresh or different in this genre. I've found, usually, it is either writing or chemistry that produces success. This show has both (at least in the pilot). Cav can carry the weight of holding one's attention for an hour. He's proved that in spades.",/review/rw2494831/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2011,aks5592,9," Abrams' Genius meets Nolan's Class
","With Jonathan Nolan and J.J. Abrams at the helm, I had great expectations from this show and it delivered in the best possible way. 'Person of Interest' is a sophisticated, intriguing, intense thriller with an exciting plot that kept me on the edge of my seat.

12 April 2020,MiketheWhistle,10," Truly an exceptional show

25 March 2014,A_Different_Drummer,9," Updated version of Touched By An Angel ... by way of Jason Bourne
","One of the most memorable pilot episodes in the history of TV. One of the best repeating ""visual gimmicks"" in the history of TV -- those connecting shots of people being invisibly dissected by hidden cameras are mesmerizing, even if you didn't know (courtesy of the NSA and your generous tax dollars) that all this is probably true. And then there is Jim Caviezel, oh wow, now jumping ship from the film biz to TV is hardly new, happens every day, but rarely has it been done so successfully. He was good in movies. He is awesome in this role. And Emerson is often overlooked. Every successful show has ""the glue"" and if you are a critic, sometimes you tease yourself trying to find who it is...? The glue is always a part that seems insignificant, until you realize that without that insignificant character the show would fall apart and shatter. Emerson is the glue here and he is brilliant at it. So, warts and all, you have one of the biggest guilty pleasures in modern TV. Enjoy. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

7 April 2016,skipperkd,9," Engrossing and Evolving
","Set in New York City in current time, this crime-drama series reflects cutting-edge technological advances and their ethical / legal constraints. Several contrasting positions are explored: the value of the ""irrelevant"" individual versus the safety/ security of the nation, the pros and cons of widespread surveillance cameras, the pros and cons — and possible emergence — of artificial intelligence, the best and worst aspects of a police force, and the nuances of organized crime leadership.

26 January 2016,trepessa,10," Science Fiction crime drama
","I'm not giving a synopsis of the show because that is not a review. What I am going to say is this show is dynamic with a very intriguing story. The casting is superb with a variety of races and ethnic groups all playing a part in the show. Not only that but women with parts that are equal to the men. Even when some have left the show they come back here and there in flash backs in time. Root is a female character played by Amy Acker. She does an outstanding job in the part. She is waif-like with a high pitched voice to make her deceptive because in all actuality she is smart and lethal. I like the fact she communicates with one of the AIs directly at the whim of the program. This is one of the best crime dramas I have seen on a network in a very long time. I know there are others but they have become basically redundant at this point. Each one is entirely different from this series. Person of Interest is unique and covers all levels of law enforcement as well as the underworld. There are many characters that aren't in every episode but they are reoccurring and played by outstanding actors. The writing is excellent and they have made the characters they have created very appealing. I find myself rooting for them. If this series were to be canceled it would be one of the biggest mistakes a network could make. It is unique in its story line, so much so I'm addicted to it and I didn't start watching it on the network but in Netflix and was astonished at the quality of the show. As far as I'm concerned, the series is genius and better than any other now airing on any network of its type.",/review/rw2494831/?ref_=tt_urv

25 February 2021,jandriod2012,9," Bingeworthy series
","I think this series was overshadowed when it first came out as it was around the time that Game of Thrones dominated TV. However, I have watched it several times now but could not face the horror of watching GoT again, which is a testament to its appeal.
Masterfully crafted by Jonathon Nolan, the writer brother of Christopher, and brains behind Memento, The Dark Knight and Interstellar, this is clever, intelligent TV. Some of the episodes are derivative (ie the 'killer in the house' episode), but still enjoyable, and there's some nice touches of humour throughout. The characters are all likeable with some excellent female roles and Jim Caviezel appears to be made for the part of John Reese. I enjoyed it immensely and am currently bingewatching it again whilst shielding, having found the dvds in a box. Highly recommended for passing a few months confined to barracks.",/review/rw2494831/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2018,peterjdickinson,10," Beautifully done
","The supposed central character of Reese set up the show as the usual formulaic TV show but Reese was never the heart of the show. Its heart was always 'Harold Finch', beautifully portrayed by Michael Emerson and he towered above all of the other excellent cast. POI was a rare show that started well and always got better. Rights issues and money from sales distribution in international markets caused its network cancellation; make no mistake, POI did not end because it overstayed its welcome. When it started it was good and when it ended it was greater.",/review/rw2494831/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2011,milesinchrist,9," It's a show that honestly wants to be good...and succeeds at it
","So I don't have too many TV shows that I would say that I'm hooked on. I had LOST while it was on the air, and that was enough for me. Since that show ended, I've had a couple of shows that I've paid attention to, but none have ever really replicated the intensity and addictiveness of LOST. In fact, in those years, there have been shows that I have thought might have the ""potential,"" but they all flopped and didn't get renewed. For this reason, I have a hard time when someone tells me a show is ""the new LOST"" or something to that effect. ",/review/rw2494831/?ref_=tt_urv
