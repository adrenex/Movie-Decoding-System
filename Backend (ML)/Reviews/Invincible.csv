","This is not as much a review of the movie but an attempt to clarify it, as its story seems to have been widely misunderstood. I will first summarize the main events as told in the original tale, and then compare them as told in the movie. It will be found that the movie inverts the original tale in a highly innovative manner.",/review/rw7205157/?ref_=tt_urv

23 January 2022,siderite,6," Rise, sir Giveup!
","I really wanted to like this film, but other than the obvious care towards its execution, everything else is basically slow, pretentious, referencing stuff important to the writer/director and metaphorical. This is one of those movies that you have to research after watching it, trying to understand what it wanted to say. In short: a boy's rite of passage to becoming a man by facing his own death... stretched to more than two hours.",/review/rw7205157/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'm writing this seconds after finishing the movie so forgive my frustration. While this is generally a well-made movie from every technical perspective, it is completely destroyed for me by two things. One, it's one of the most boring movies ever. And two, it's made up almost entirely of metaphors and symbolism with nothing concrete to hold onto.",/review/rw7205157/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2021,deloudelouvain,5," Good cinematography and actors don't mean good movie.
","I don't know what kind of drugs David Lowery took but it seems like that stuff was doing its job. The Green Knight is well filmed, I'll give them that, but the story itself is slow, making no sense for the majority of the time. It's just a weird movie, and normally that doesn't mean it's bad but in this case it was. The acting wasn't bad either so it wasn't their fault this whole movie was a mess. Apart of the good cinematography and the decent acting it's just not good. I wouldn't waste your time with this one if I were you.",/review/rw7205157/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2021,MOscarbradley,3," Exactly what audience is this aimed at?
","You would have to go back to ""Excalibur"" to find an Arthurian movie that looked or sounded remotely like David Lowery's ""The Green Knight"".

4 August 2021,kevin_robbins,4," After 125 minutes you're left with a whole lot of ""why did I watch this"" feelings
","The Green Knight (2021) is a movie we saw in theatres the weekend it was released. The storyline follows the queen's nephew on a mission to prove his valor and partake in an adventure as a newly anointed knight. When a strange mythical tree-like creature arrives at the kingdom and offers a mission he jumps at the opportunity to prove himself without fully understanding the perils that go with it. Can the young knight overcome the mission and become a hero within the kingdom or will his first adventure be his last? This movie is directed by David Lowery (Pete's Dragon) and stars Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire), Ana√Øs Rizzo (Rain), Sarita Choudhury (Lady in the Water), Erin Kellyman (The Falcon and the Winter Soldier) and Sean Harris (Mission Impossible). The storyline for this picture had a lot of potential with a great build-up, settings, back drops and special effects. The acting was solid and the cast fit the characters well. Unfortunately, the storyline and characters never evolve. There's no real point to the story. You hope the main character learns from his mistakes and circumstances...he never does. You hope the storyline has a good point and conclusion, it doesn't. After 125 minutes you're left with a whole lot of ""why did I watch this"" feelings and faces within the audience. This was a huge disappointment and nowhere near better films in this genre like Pan's Labyrinth, The Hobbit or Lord of the Rings. I'd skip this and score it a 4/10.",/review/rw7205157/?ref_=tt_urv

31 July 2021,tarynabryant,5," If you need to fall asleep, watch this.
","I'll start by saying that visually, this movie is stunning and it has some moments of great acting. That's about the extent of the positives. As an avid fan of A24, I was very excited for The Green Knight and tried to go into it with as open a mind as possible. I wasn't expecting a horror or action movie. I went in simply expecting to be told a story. I anticipated that it would be on the slower side, but wow. I feel so guilty for saying this seeing as so many people loved the film, but it was way too boring for me to enjoy. I have loved the slow-burn approach that A24 has taken with other movies like The Witch and The Lighthouse, but The Green Knight just didn't have enough substance to keep me engaged in what was going on. Every time something significant seemed to happen, it would be followed by an agonizingly long shot of a forest with loud, eerie music playing over it. Furthermore, this movie is DARK. Like literally dark. I couldn't see who was on the screen or what was happening for at least 30% of the movie. As for the other 70% that I could actually see, I had literally no idea what was going on. What's the meaning of those giant gray naked people? Why did everyone want to kiss Dev Patel? Beats me. Maybe that's my fault because i'm not very familiar with the story of Gawain and the Green Knight, but I consider myself a generally thoughtful person who makes an effort to understand complex films. I spent the entire drive home mentally analyzing this movie and still had no idea what any of it meant until I read some online articles explaining the story. I really wanted to love this movie and I wish I could understand why it is receiving such praise, but both my friend and I left the theater feeling very underwhelmed and sleepy. I've also noticed that a lot of these rave reviews are coming from people who are likely pretentious arthouse film lovers who somehow think they are better than everyone else, since they all seem to think that anyone who didn't enjoy this movie is ultimately ""unintelligent"". As one review states, ""all negative reviews are from people who should have stayed home with a bud light and watched South Park"". Well I hate both South Park and beer and still found this film boring, as did the four or so people who walked out of my theater.",/review/rw7205157/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2021,cagebox111,2," Extraordinarily Dull
",The Green Knight is the first movie I have ever left the theater during in my life. That's not to say it was the worst movie I have ever seen in theater but it was among the most pointless. Lowery's film was egregiously slow-paced and dull with a tone that is utterly devoid of joy. Please do not watch this movie unless you are only into dry arthouse style cinematography devoid of a cogent plot. Even Arthurian romance fans should avoid as it does a disservice to the classic genre. One of the most pointless and unpleasant films in recent memory.,/review/rw7205157/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2021,boblipton,8," The Matter Of Britain
","David Lowery's movie version of the Middle English poem known as ""Sir Gawain and the Green Knight"" is a thing of visual beauty and story weirdness. Believed to be written about the time of Chaucer in a completely different dialect of English, its basic story -- Gawain accepts a Christmas challenge by the Green Knight at blows with his axe; one year later, Gawain must present himself to the Green Knight and accept a similar blow. Gawain knocks off the fellow's head; the Knight picks it up, reminds Gawain of his promise and toddles off -- begins with the fantastic.",/review/rw7205157/?ref_=tt_urv

","The Green Knight barges into King Arthur's court. He challenges any knight to a game. Arthur's troublesome nephew Sir Gawain (Dev Patel) accepts the challenge. Instead of a stand up fight, the Green Knight offers his neck. Gawain reluctantly chops off his head but it doesn't kill him. He simply picks up his head and reminds Gawain that he expects reciprocity in one year's time. With the one year approach, Gawain sets off to meet his fate.",/review/rw7205157/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2021,Tweetienator,4," Just Another Dazzler
","There should be a law that forbids Hollywood to maim European history, tales and legends. I am not talking about the main actor - The Green Knight has nothing to do (story-wise) with the great epics of medieval Europe but is one of those mass produced movies with some nice cinematography and effects but no real or good story. Like the last Arthur movie by Guy Ritchie (same procedure - take a well known character of literature or history but change everything else to your gusto), The Green Knight shows hard, that good story-writing is an craft and art that is not known and managed by many these days. Mediocrity hidden behind a veil of pseudo-intellectualism.",/review/rw7205157/?ref_=tt_urv

","Greetings again from the darkness. If you are at all inclined to see this movie, then I would encourage you to do so ... and brace yourself for a surreal and mystical treat unlike any other medieval tale previously adapted for the big screen. Writer-director David Lowery re-teams with A24, the studio that also distributed his critically-acclaimed 2017 film, A GHOST STORY, to deliver a trip for your senses based on the tale of Sir Gawain - a tale that's been told in various and often contradictory ways over many years.",/review/rw7205157/?ref_=tt_urv

","Featuring metaphor and symbolism on steroids, this film thinks it is desperately deep, but it fails to deliver a compelling, or even a comprehendible, narrative.

7 August 2021,gcsman,8," Step into a world of allegory and myth, and don't expect everything to make sense
","The Green Knight is not your run-of-the-mill Arthurian swords-and-battles adventure. It belongs to an entirely different and much rarer genre -- something like Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal and other philosophical films filled with allegory and myth. (Another one I like very much for its humanity and warm heart is Joe Versus the Volcano, believe it or not.) But the Arthurian world is so diverse and has so much historical legend and literature behind it, that it can support a film like this just fine. This one is very much worth seeing -- just expect that when it's over, you'll be scratching your head over a whole slew of things. But that's what powerful allegory is like. It's under no compulsion to explain itself all that directly, and it takes a different, non-rational route directly into your brain.",/review/rw7205157/?ref_=tt_urv
