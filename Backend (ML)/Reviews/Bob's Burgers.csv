","The Belcher family is unique to television in that they all love and respect each other. It took me a few episodes (mostly, after I cleared a bumpy Season 1) to figure this out, but Linda and Bob really do love and respect each other, and they really do love and respect their kids. In turn, their kids, really do love and respect their parents. And, perhaps most bizarrely to modern television, the kids love and respect each other and work, go to school with, and play with each other, as well. And, it's a secular, non-patriarchal family (it appears to be egalitarian).",/review/rw3126918/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2011,G-Joshua-Benjamin,10," A great new show that I hope will last.
","New things come and go and many are easily forgotten. There are so many shows now a days. It's hard to keep track of the good with all of the carp that some how makes it into our homes. I am so glad to say that Bobs Burger is one of those shows that you will be happy found it's way. Many things made this show be added to my favorite list and my DVR. Firstly, I love the animation. Instead of trying to look like Family Guy, The Simpsons or King of the Hill, this show stands out as looking completely different. It is gritty and looks like something that would have been on MTV in the mid 80s or early 90s. That makes me like it even more. I am writing a kids book and seeing stuff like this makes me feel good. Not everything has to look so polished. Another thing I like is the dark humor. It is the kind of thing that if you stop paying attention for just a minute, you won't get something later. I actually laughed out loud at this time after time. Which is rare these days. Something else I like about this show is the people doing the voices. Especially H. Jon Benjamin. The story I saw was really funny and memorable. All these things make me really excited about the next episode.",/review/rw3126918/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2021,BrnzReviews,10," Funnier Than Family Guy!
","This is by far my favourite animated comedy series, I think it's much funnier than Family Guy, that's coming from a FG fan as well. This is so funny to watch, if you're ever in a rubbish mood this is sure to bring you right back up. I used to watch this on YouTube live stream sometimes I find myself back there more often recently than before, its a constant live stream that never ends, you could go watch it right now.",/review/rw3126918/?ref_=tt_urv

10 October 2018,Hollywood_Yoda,9," Pretty Funny Show
","Bob's Burgers is a pretty funny show, it has a lot of references to pop culture. However, it is a mature show and definitely shouldn't be viewed by children younger than 12. The language is fairly mild, but some situations and references might be questionable. The animation is very crisp and the voice work is really good.",/review/rw3126918/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2016,ericstevenson,9," Not sure where it came from, but it's awesome
","While I don't find this as good as ""Rick And Morty"" or even H. Jon Benjamin's other show ""Archer"", this is still a lot of fun. I really do find the animation funny. The creator has stated that yes, the character designs were in fact inspired by the Muppets. The funniest thing is that I find myself singing the intro to ""The Muppet Show"" when I see the theme song to this. The story is as basic as it can be, with a guy named Bob running a restaurant named after his burgers. The biggest appeal to this is probably how authentic it is. Despite the fact that the animation is goofy, it comes off as very realistic and the characters do behave like real people. The voice acting is wonderful in this.",/review/rw3126918/?ref_=tt_urv

11 July 2014,QinetiQ,9," Worth it
","When I first saw the commercials about a new cartoon-series I wasn't really impressed. Bobs burgers, about a burgershop, really..? The style was a strong reminder of Beavis and Butthead and the short commercial didn't really impress me much. Maybe I was a bit skeptical because the last years no cartoon or animation series has impressed me much. Brickleberry for example never made me laugh and I didn't like any of the characters.",/review/rw3126918/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2022,owenpont-70803,10," One of the best animated shows............
","Bobs Burgers is the definition of relaxation. Everything about bobs burgers just works. The acting is on point and is easily one of the best voice acting today. Each plot works perfectly. And the animation is great. This is a short but sweet review, because there really isn't anything to say other than to watch it. This show is going to run for a long time and it should. Overall this is a must watch show for anyone who likes comedy, it is very consistent and is the best adult animation show running currently. Between that Archer and Rick & Morty. It is a likeable show with likeable characters with great writing and animation.",/review/rw3126918/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2022,dustinclousher,10," Better than the Simpsons
",This adult animation is the most family friendly. It features a family that owns a restaurant and depicts what adventures they get into. There is obvious some adult humor but it is normally mild. It is very easy to love the characters and root for them in their endeavors.,/review/rw3126918/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2011,stevo-74,9," What on earth is wrong with the reviewers on this site?
","I can't believe the amount of flack this show is receiving from the simple-minded and humorless... I have news for everyone: New episodes of the Simpsons are trash... Family Guy hasn't been relevant or clever in ages... American Dad and The Cleveland Show are rip-off cash-ins. I actually read one comment that stated ""Give Seth Macfarlane another show!"" God forbid! I was a huge fan of Futurama, About the first 10 seasons of the Simpsons, Clone High, Mission Hill, Undergrads, About the first four seasons of Family Guy... so on and so forth. This is the first show that has made me really laugh in a long time. It's clever, and the humor is a bit dryer and more subtle. There are some pretty crude stuff I suppose...",/review/rw3126918/?ref_=tt_urv

","Love this show. One of the funniest and most relatable. Nothing rude, just simple funny, family humor. I watch it with my kids and they love it also. Hope they keep making more seasons honestly. Thank you Fox",/review/rw3126918/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2016,clacura,10," Character Driven w/Creative Scripts
","Gene and Louise are too over the top. I don't like the character of Gene much and Louise is too over-the-top, that said, the three remaining characters and supporting characters are very strong. The Simpsons took detailed writing to another level, Bob's Burgers does the same but with nuances. Comedy is all about timing and space. Now that I think of it, Linda needs to sing less. Gets old...again, timing.",/review/rw3126918/?ref_=tt_urv

4 February 2021,brittanyroberts-20024,8," Give it a chance , watch 1 season before you review.
","I used to actively communicate to others that this show sucked. I hadn't even watched one full episode! I've seen every episode of family guy, futurama, and American dad many many times and I was getting bored of reruns. I saw this on demand and thought I might as well give it a try. I put on the first episode and was like
""Yup it's crap just like I remembered, but I can't take seeing more reruns so I'll just leave it on in the background while I scroll online""
A few episodes later I was hooked. Some people don't like the simplicity of the animation but that's what makes it unique. I love the hand drawn look. I used to hate that all the characters ""sounded the same"" I used to say. Now I think it's funny that they have masculine sounding voices.",/review/rw3126918/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2014,wrjfellows,10," Bob's Burgers is a refreshing change of pace.
","I am an avid fan of animated television, and have a massive appreciation for MacFarlane's Family Guy, American Dad and The Cleveland Show. And also The Simpsons and Futurama. While Groening and MacFarlane are cartoon tycoons currently dominating animated programming, Bob's Burgers is a pleasing, utterly enjoyable change.",/review/rw3126918/?ref_=tt_urv

","With new Simpsons and Family Guy episodes failing to entertain less and less with every new episode, Bob's Burgers was a glimmering light at the end of what to me, was a dark, unfunny tunnel. On it's premiere night I decide to check it out because there wasn't to much on, and since then I have been a complete fan of the show. The plot revolves around a man and his struggling burger joint run by him, his wife and his 3 children. The premise may seem a little ""closed"" but I hope that they are able to continue it for long enough that it doesn't get boring and ridiculous, but with what they've shown so far it does not appear that they are slowing down with quirky, and original plots. The show is hilarious and the actors that voice them are perfect. I've shown this to all my room mates and everyone has become a fan, so hopefully this show will be on the air for a while.",/review/rw3126918/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2014,snailovercello,10," Mr. Fischoeder
","The simple fact that Kevin Kline is involved, should be enough for anyone to understand the caliber of this series. The entire cast playing the Belchers is spot on and only gets better with each episode. This show has a new and fresh vibe to it, but also has a certain familiar attribute; a family trying to do the best that they can with what they have and having a little fun along the way. A surprisingly exceptional character is found in Louise, played by Kristen Schaal. While all the characters have redeeming qualities of their own, Louise's character is in my opinion one of the most exuberantly funny. She is the comic relief more often than not. Each episode takes you on a new adventure, theme, idea, premise, etc.. Lots of variety keeps the show interesting. Overall- Outstanding series, but could use more of Regular Sized Rudy.",/review/rw3126918/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's glorious that H. Jon Benjamin is the voice of Bob, he was excellent in Aqua Teen Hunger Force among others. Bob Burgers is so good in many ways with the comedy, music, beautiful colors, and entertainment value! The new movie should be great as well. Crazy how there's over 200 plus episodes I have a lot to get through.",/review/rw3126918/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2012,krupin,10," Very much enjoyable
","I really enjoyed the first season of Bob's Burgers. Not often for a cartoon you can say that there is chemistry between characters. In Bob's Burgers - there is. The calm and usually serious, but funny dad, mother who's full of weird ideas, and children, each so different. The youngest daughter is definitely my favorite with her unpredictable attitude towards many usual things.",/review/rw3126918/?ref_=tt_urv
