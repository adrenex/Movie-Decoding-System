13 February 2021,ThomDerd,6," A Nick Cage Film. Campy and weird AF but entertaining!
","Strange and crazy idea at the same time, coupled with a ""special performance"" by Cage. For the fans of Nick Cage this is a treat, he is giving the audience what it needs. If someone remembers the SNL skit ""why am i not in that moviee?"" then they know that Cage could not have said no to this one. The story is simple: he gets stuck somehow in a random town and agrees to work for a night in Willy's Wonderland. Shortly after he has to fight against an evil bunch of animatronics, while consuming energy drinks and being nick cage. I have to admit that the work on the animatronics was good, sound mixing was good and the fight scenes were ranging from funny to fun. Don't expect to be very (or at all) scared; maybe just creeped out by the animatronics. Obviously, don't take this film seriously. It's campy enough and does a weird tribute to this horror genre and to Nick Cage maybe... But it is definitely entertaining. 6 /10",/review/rw6590013/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2021,A_Different_Drummer,6," And Now for Something Completely Different. And odd. And strange.
","A completely off-the-wall B movie that seems to be a cross between CABIN IN THE WOODS and A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS. With animatronics. Starring what used to be the top A-list actor on the planet. Who seems to have no actual dialog to deliver. And partly paid for by product placement for GM because all the vehicles in it are branded for the camera. There are a number of theories. My personal favorite is that this was actual footage shot by a reality crew following Nic Cage on a typical night out. In other words, this s**t happens to Nic on a regular basis. The other theory is that Nic got tired of being in everyone else's B movies, so he decided to make one of his own. Fun and holds the attention. Like a car accident where the victims get back into their cars and crash all over again. Could easily become a cult classic.",/review/rw6590013/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2021,Draysan-Jennings,5," Chuck E. Cheese on Bath Salts
","B-movie horror fans will love this film. It's Nicolas Cage running around slaughtering animatronic puppets. That's literally it. If that's your thing, give it a watch. If not, don't waste your time. 5 stars",/review/rw6590013/?ref_=tt_urv

15 February 2021,Clive_W,6," Super happy fun room lol
","The film is thoroughly enjoyable, it's far from being an amazing film, but take it at what it is, and nic cage doing the cage effect! A good way to kill 90 odd minutes, I did have myself a few chuckles throughout, don't expect a plot or anything haha, just enjoy another great nic cage experience. Get some good popcorn in, and something to drink and enjoy!",/review/rw6590013/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2022,searchanddestroy-1,6," What the f....?
","I won't say anything wrong about this film, this unidentified filmed object, because I don't know what to think about it. It's not for all audiences anyway. It's totally crazy, unpredictable, jaw dropping, even if I found it boring and unbearable for my taste. But it remains worth seeing for anyone seeking something different and fun. Cage is excellent here, but that's not enough for me to torture me one second more.",/review/rw6590013/?ref_=tt_urv

",The movie has no intentions on being anything but what it is. Nic Cage fighting robots for an hour and a half. And it's awesome.,/review/rw6590013/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2021,matthewssilverhammer,4," Man...this movie is ALMOST awesome.
","Unfortunately, the good nonsense (Cage as a mute monster fighter obsessed with pinball, the design of Willy's Wonderland) is lost in the bad nonsense (cheap filmmaking, lazy storytelling, complete illogic between scenes). I would love to see a better filmmaker (Edgar Wright, James Gunn, Rogen/Goldberg), or even a much worse filmmaker, take on a possessed-Chuck-E-Cheese story...but I feel like this might've been the one chance, and we BLEW it!",/review/rw6590013/?ref_=tt_urv

",A driver (Nicolas Cage) suffers a flat tire on a remote road. He gets a tow into town where he is hired to be a janitor at a closed Willy's Wonderland. It's essentially a Chuck E. Cheese's with animatronic figures in individually themed rooms. The place is a mess and he's locked in overnight. Local girl Liv (Emily Tosta) tries to burn it down and gets arrested by Sheriff Lund (Beth Grant). Her friends help her escape and the group returns to burn down the place.,/review/rw6590013/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2021,Gordon-11,," Entertaining
","The story is basically about Nicholas Cage fighting murderous robots. It is funny that he seems superhuman, and doesn't talk at all. It's entertaining.",/review/rw6590013/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2021,Fella_shibby,7," Cage curb stomps an animatronic, he even rips open a jaw beating Kong's ripping of T-Rex.

13 March 2022,justahunch-70549,1," Just about as awful as a film can be
","Even for Nicolas Cage, this is an embarrassment. A truly awful, unimaginative, unfunny regrettable waste of anyone's time, though this actor has a fan base that loves when he wallows in junk such as this, so one man's trash can be another man's treasure. This man has talent, but what an odd career indeed.",/review/rw6590013/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2021,DarkVulcan29,8," Everything you would want from an entertaining B movie
","You go into Willy's Wonderland knowing it's not gonna be a masterpiece, films like Sharknado come to mind, there so bad, there suprisingly entertaining, gaining quite a following, I believe Willy's Wonderland is right up there.",/review/rw6590013/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2021,I_Ailurophile,9," Fantastically fun and clever

5 November 2021,Woodyanders,8," Nic Cage versus killer puppets
",An enigmatic tightlipped loner (a remarkably expressive mute performance by Nicolas Cage) agrees to spend a night cleaning up a rundown family center called Willy's Wonderland in exchange for free repairs to his car.

","If you watch movies to actually enjoy your time then go for it, if you are some sick perfectionist (like most of the 1/10 raters here) who's expecting every movie to be of Nolan's plot, actors and script, then this is not a movie for you nor a place for you to downrate such an entertaining product.",/review/rw6590013/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2021,kosmasp,8," Silence! I kill you
","Now that is a reference to a doll ... which I falsely thought was the main bad guy(s) in this ... but it is animatronics. Not just any animatronics as we learn during the run time of the movie. But more on that in the movie. There is not much ""story"" here and while I thought our ""Janitor"" would get some backstory himself, this never happens ... as the filmmakers say, it is in the tradition of the Western movies ... the silent, nameless ""avenger"", who comes to clean town ... or hallways/rooms/bad souls.",/review/rw6590013/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2021,deloudelouvain,4," Another stinker for Nicolas Cage.
","Nicolas Cage did it again, and by that I mean he accepted to play in a movie without paying too much attention to the script before agreeing to it. He's getting paid and that's apparently the only thing that matters to him. He isn't a bad actor, played in some really good movies, but the stinkers he played in are now taking the upper hand. In this one it must have been the easiest job ever for him as he doesn't speak a word, but it's not a good enough excuse for me to play in this movie. Willy's Wonderland is beyond dumb, and I'm normally easy going but this plot is just too dumb for words. I watched it and I got bored pretty quickly and I'm sure a lot of other people will also.",/review/rw6590013/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2021,bradaviel,7," No words, only Punchy Cage
","What happens when you drop a** kickin' Nicolas Cage in a Feebles/Killer Klowns universe ? Exactly what you'd expect. No words, no explanation to his character except punches, kicks and final blows, Cage is at his best doing exactly what you love to see him do. While he's known for award winning and AAA blockbuster performances, I always enjoy seeing him in projects no one but him would accept and pull to their best potential. In recent years, Mom and Dad, Mandy & Color out of space really gained points with his mere presence, and boy does he shine when he's having fun. On par with those, this is a refreshing flick and I'm really hoping we keep seeing more pop up from time to time. And while many horror and indie flicks get forgotten over the years, this one will be remembered by everyone who gave a chance to the experience.",/review/rw6590013/?ref_=tt_urv
