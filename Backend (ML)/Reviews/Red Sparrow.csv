28 March 2018,Victreebong,9," IMDb needs better mods
","As a preface, this is not the only JenLaw movie to get unnecessarily slammed by sham reviews. Since The Fappening, people have been on a mission to smear her image. (The personal comments about the president haven't helped.) But throw all that out, look at this film objectively, and you will be pleasantly rewarded with a spy thriller that's cunning, sexy and disturbing all at once.",/review/rw4140262/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2018,michelle_kummer,10," This film is underrated
","I was shocked reading some of the reviews on here knocking Jennifer Lawrence's performance as cold and emotionless. This is how she's supposed to act as she is, she's lost everything and has become numb. 
I thoroughly enjoyed this film and despite Jennifer not 'perfecting' the Russian accent as so many mention on here it is a difficult accent to learn so give the girl credit for the way she played the role! 
I can't fault this film, it's a spy thriller so don't listen to the critics and give it a chance.",/review/rw4140262/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2018,masonsaul,9," Incredible but uncomfortable thriller
","Red Sparrow is an incredible thriller that's unpredictable, extremely well made and tense. Jennifer Lawrence gives an incredible lead performance with Joel Edgerton and Matthias Schoenaerts giving great performances. Francis Lawrence's direction is excellent. The pacing is also great. The only downside is that is almost excessively disturbing in places.",/review/rw4140262/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2021,hello22222,8," Never a boring moment
",There is never a dull moment in the movie. JLaw did an amazing job although I am not much of a fan. I didn't care for her accent since she is speaking English in the movie anyway so who cares. For me her acting would have been as good without the accent as well. She portrays a cold and ruthless character and her expressions are enough to convey the message. Matthias Schoenaerts was also impressive. Ending took me by surprise. It could have been a much better movie if all Russian men were not portrayed as evil in the movie and all CIA as heroes and if graphic scenes were reduced. Nevertheless I found it more entertaining than Bond movies.,/review/rw4140262/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2021,TaylorYee94,8," Exciting and intriguing storyline. Great Ending.
","I am so glad to see many reviews which give the right value to this movie. 'Red Sparrow' had been castigated for unnecessary violence and sexual scenes and implications. This may be true, and I have to admit some of the scenes and narratives are too disturbing, not just hard to watch but hard to comprehend. Sexpionage itself is uncomfortable topic because it exploits and undermines the dignity of sex. However, the story involving Dominika's double espionage and double identity and Jennifer Lawrence's portrayal of her are so entertaining and perfect. The whole 140 minutes pass by really fast while focusing on the path of finding a mole, on figuring out where Dominika's loyalty lies, and on her relationship with Nash and his uncle. The twist at the ending especially deserves the compliment because it signifies her loyalty, her decision, her resolution, and her revenge. Perfect ending for those who has been rooting for her for more than two hours. 'Red Sparrow' is totally worth of watching it again. It has received all the hate it does not deserve.",/review/rw4140262/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2018,TheLittleSongbird,7," Flies high enough but doesn't quite soar
","The book, that 'Red Sparrow' is adapted from, is brilliant. It is very complex, but also very clever, suspenseful, intelligent and fun. As well as loving the book, the main reason for seeing 'Red Sparrow' was the cast which is a talented one and while not being blown away by the advertising it left me intrigued.",/review/rw4140262/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2021,Dr_Mark_ODoherty,10," Very good spy film about current challenges in Russia.
","Very good and dramatic film; being symbolic about current challenges in Russia, I think. However, in my opinion, one drawback of this intense spy thriller is that the portrayal of the Russian spy apparatus is rather pessimistic and nihilistic - lacking a humanistic and uplifting angle, I think. The whole story is very serious, set in Moscow and Vienna, spy capital of the world... Having had some contacts with female Russian spies in Vienna myself, I can safely say that they are not that fixated on manipulation and extraction as depicted in this film; and actually can be quite funny and amusing - even though I also think, in my experience, that female Russian spies may focus too much on sex, and not put enough emphasis on romance, when initiating contact with a person of interest :) However, 'Red Sparrow' also has a romantic element - between Russian and American Intelligence Officers - who work very well together to resolve challenges between the US and Russia in a dignified and peaceful way. So the whole story is very much a testament of peace and harmony in the International Community - and that each and everyone of us has the mystic power to manifest joy, love and harmony in our world :)",/review/rw4140262/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2019,Tweekums,9," A gripping and gritty spy thriller
","Following an accident which ends the career of Russian ballerina Dominika Egorova her uncle, the Deputy Director of SVR, offers to help her by finding her a job working for the state. This leads her to 'Sparrow School' where agents are trained in seducing potential targets. The target she is given is CIA agent Nate Nash who is believed to have been in contact with a high level Russian official; it will be her job to get the name of the traitor. As she gets close to him it is uncertain who will ultimately turn who and the danger increases for both of them.",/review/rw4140262/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2018,socrates99,5," This is a badly conceived project with few redeeming aspects
","Though I'm a fan of Ms Lawrence and wouldn't fault her performance all that much, this film's attempt to portray Russia as the home of overly cruel spymasters doesn't ring very true to me. It smells of over-the-top propaganda hoping to cast Russia as some soulless country without moral compass. If the US were given this treatment, we would all see through the overwrought bias. But as Russia is in the news, we tend to tolerate this kind of hyperbole.",/review/rw4140262/?ref_=tt_urv

5 April 2018,mm-39,9," A gritty solid movie!
","Red Sparrow is one of the most non P C Hollywood movies made this year. Instead of the typical B S the viewer sees with establishment movie, Red Sparrow is hard to watch at times, non-sanitized, with a real life feel. Red Sparrow starts with an accident, doing a favor, set ups, melded into in an ugly cold environment! The beginning throws an icy cold feeling on the viewer and gets worse with the un-folding of the story. Lawrence's character is forced into a brutal Sparrow training program. A program of harshness, leverage, and deceit. The ugly life of spies and spy games unfolds, as Lawrence's character faces a jaded Edgerton character from the C I A. Red Sparrow add more and more characters which creates more sub stories , which keeps the viewer intrigued and guessing. Will the Red Sparrow lose her soul? Which side is the Sparrow working for? The conclusion ties everything together brilliantly, but I had to take a couple of takes on the ending. Well written, directed and acted worth watching",/review/rw4140262/?ref_=tt_urv

24 November 2021,pavlovs-god,9," I absolutely LOVE this movie.
","I've watched it about 6 times already and it's a ""different"" winner each time. The acting is strong in some spots and the scenes where she flaunts her body are amazing. The complexity is great. And the Storyline is fast-paced and engaging. There's even a love story thrown in. Highly recommend for its adult theme.",/review/rw4140262/?ref_=tt_urv

4 March 2018,kgprophet,6," Prostitute or Super Spy?
","This movie is based on a novel. It can be tough to translate the body of a novel into a movie. 50 Shades of Grey is an example. The book is a spy thriller. The sexual aspect of the tradecraft goes back to ""From Russia With Love"". I remember ""The Debt"", also dealt with spies falling in love with each other. It was not interesting the same reason I don't find soap operas interesting. The film version of ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" depicted the Soviet Union back in the 1970s as a cold and harsh intelligence agency that would easily kill one of their own if necessary. This film visits the mythical spy school that creates sexual bait to blackmail the enemy in the name of the state. However, you would think the break up of the Soviet Union would have retired that style of cold warfare. Evidently not.",/review/rw4140262/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2018,CANpatbuck3664,8," The Payoff, Performances and Tight Plot Make Red Sparrow Worth Checking Out
","Addressing the elephant in the room, there are moments in this movie that will leave you squirming in your seat. Normally this would be a major negative, but this is an intentional choice. For a movie with so much sex in it, little to none of it is hot or even sexy. I think this was a brave and chancy thing to show so much raw abuse and although it is graphic, it really underscores the traumatizing effect of what Dominika is subjected to. It is uncomfortable, but I think its more realistic than people want to admit. This is an adult movie dealing with adult themes and although there were times where I wanted to look away, it didn't dissuade me from wanting to see where Red Sparrow would go.",/review/rw4140262/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2018,MovieIQTest,," Lukewarm and loose screenplay further ruined by miscast
","Watching this film adapted from the novel felt like deja vu of some good novels adapted into TV series or movies, either the scripts were not good enough to match up the original novels, or the leading key characters turned out terrible miscast. Michael Connelly's ""Harry Bosch"" series was totally ruined by the wrong cast of the guy who played Bosch in a lousy TV series, all the supporting actors, especially the female ones were even worse, female detectives or female city employees all looked in a fashion show, with perfect hairstyles, over the top make-up, tailored costumes...But worst of all, is the miscast of Harry Bosch, completely ruined the personification of the large-than-life Harry Bosch in the novels. The other worst nightmarish miscast was Tom Cruise played Jack Reacher of Lee Child's Jack Reacher series. Tom Cruise completely ruin the image of Jack Reacher in the novels.

","The only redeeming feature of this movie was a chance to see a bit of Jennifer Lawrence in the nude - she's got a nice bod.. That's it. The rest of the movie was a depiction of duplicity, torture and sadism as carried out by the current version of the KGB. There are some formerly prominent actors in this movie - Jeremy Irons for one - but how they all must have needed the money to appear it this extremely violent and cartoonish movie.

16 March 2018,rabbitmoon,8," Much better than expected - intelligent, mature thriller
","I'll admit I was worried about the 1 star reviews - I was expecting a typical 'Hitman Agent 47' or 'Spectre' style film packed with stupidity and self-consciousness, eager to impress a teenage audience with gimmicks, wisecracks and all that usual tedious trash. But it really isn't anything like that. Its not quite along the lines of Tinker Tailor, or Bridge of Spies, perhaps more like excellent TV show 'The Americans'. You really do have to pay attention to details to get the most out of the slow-burning story, and there ARE subtle levels of depth to be unpicked in appreciating motives. It doesn't treat the audience like a bunch of morons, which is getting rarer. ",/review/rw4140262/?ref_=tt_urv

","Based upon the book of the same name by ex-CIA agent Jason Matthews, Red Sparrow is a modern-day spy thriller by director Francis Lawrence (Hunger Games: Catching Fire, I Am Legend) that harks back to the days of the cold war thrillers of the 70s/80s but fails to update it appropriately, coming across as a piece of vitriolic propaganda and little else. Jennifer Lawrence (Winter's Bone) and the rest of the top-notch cast try their damndest to give it some credibility but the story and premise make for a predictably silly and gratuitous affair on many levels.",/review/rw4140262/?ref_=tt_urv

","Under rated double agent Spy Thriller . Jennifer Lawrence with acting style is excellent for this film. The plot twist of Jennifer's character being a double agent and not fully knowing where her allegiance lies is the element that drives Red Sparrow . The plot twist at the end of the film may confuse the viewer . But it really makes the film great. Lawrence's character is smart and is a step ahead of all the Russian's who manipulate her into becoming a ""Red Sparrow "" And as the climax of the film plays out . You see how crafty Lawrence's character has become as she get her revenge on those who used her . Excellent film if you can follow the some what convoluted story line . 5 out of 5 star's .",/review/rw4140262/?ref_=tt_urv
