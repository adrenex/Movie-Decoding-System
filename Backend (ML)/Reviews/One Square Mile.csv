21 November 2014,MovieAddict2016,3," One of the most disappointing and unsatisfying experiences I've had at the theater
","I'm going to preface this review by stating the obvious (and what no doubt some may be quick to point out in defense of the sequel): look, it's ""Dumb and Dumber"" we're talking about here; not ""Citizen Kane"". But I feel like that disclaimer only goes so far, because frankly, the original ""Dumb and Dumber"" is one of the funniest films I've ever seen -- endlessly quotable, thoroughly likable. The key to the movie, I think, is that there's an underlying sweetness to the humor: Lloyd and Harry (Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels) are never presented as malicious. Most of the bad stuff that happens to them is inadvertent, and often at the expense of trying to do a good deed (e.g. Lloyd trying to return the briefcase).",/review/rw3176343/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2020,baileycrawly,5," Downhill!
","I believe it was Jeff Daniels who said that the directors of Dumb and Dumber were ""guessing"" about what would be funny the first time, but ""now they know.""
If that is the case, they definitely have a fair amount of arrogance and narcissism, because this film is vastly inferior to the original. What started as honest-to-goodness stupidity has given way to a mean-spirited attempt to be funny. Harry and Lloyd are no longer running on their own redundant behaviour alone; they're using their naïveté to hurt others and to be lewd and crude, which is never what the original film was.
This movie has its comedic moments, but it ultimately falls flat, trying too hard in some areas and not hard enough where it truly matters.",/review/rw3176343/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2014,matthewssilverhammer,2," Stupid Isn't Always Funny
","As a big fan of Dumb and Dumber, I went into Dumb and Dumber To trying not to let wistfulness paint the sequel too positively. Those worries quickly dissipated, as To is a forced and aggressively unfunny gross-out comedy. It's the absolute worst kind of sequel: the kind that repeats old jokes to try and get a cheap cheer of nostalgia. All the while, laziness and overt offensiveness abound, with jokes never reaching higher than the lowest of low hanging fruit. It disappoints completely, like a desperate old rock singer trying to hit the same notes he used to, but consistently falling flat. While the first was a brilliantly inspired bit of comedic stupidity, Dumb and Dumber To is just plain stupid. We find our puerile protagonists older but none-the wiser, still getting in over their heads yet unwittingly finding their way through it. Plot is not the movie's aim, and it doesn't need to be. What it does need to be, however, is funny. Unfortunately the jokes are understandably irreverent, yet also socially inept and rarely successful. Worst of all is that Daniels' Harry and Carrey's Lloyd have completely lost the chemistry that once bound them. They've become purely sad parodies of their former selves. Maybe I'm taking this too seriously. I mean, the Farrelly's have proved to be nothing more than perpetual 10-year-olds, and they manage one or two moments of contrived laughter. But one or two laughs in a 100-minute movie just isn't enough. Clearly the filmmakers think the audience is as dumb as their leads. We're not.",/review/rw3176343/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2015,kosmasp,7," The official sequel too the original
","Yes I know it's only one ""o"" and not two. Or two if you talk about the title (it could be a ""w"" missing also, depending on what way you want to go). But back to the movie. I haven't seen that unofficial movie that was made in between those two movies. But I was excited about this getting our two main characters back together (literally). Is it as good as the original though? You probably won't think so.",/review/rw3176343/?ref_=tt_urv

18 November 2014,scottyent,6," Perhaps my expectations were too high for this recycled movie
","I was pretty disappointed in this movie, and I'm not really sure why. There were definitely some funny parts where I laughed, but the whole thing felt pretty....forced. Harry and Lloyd felt like exaggerated versions of themselves, the storyline was just OK, and I think what threw me off the most was that so much of the movie was recycled.",/review/rw3176343/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2014,rgkarim,8," Amusing, Inappropriate, and Nostalgic
","Dumb and Dumber, a comedy that many years ago had families laughing their heads off. With its incredibly stupid antics, simplistic one-liners, and pushing the borderlines in appropriate films. I personally didn't enjoy it as much as others, and regretted seeing the prequel Dumb and Dumberer even more. So you can probably guess I wasn't too thrilled to see another attempt at continuing the simplistic story. Yet I go back in once again to give you my thoughts on the latest in comedy movie installment. So let's get started. ",/review/rw3176343/?ref_=tt_urv

16 November 2014,Movie-ManDan,10," Fans Of The Original Will Be Impressed, Non-Fans Will Be Unimpressed.
","I have been waiting twenty years to see a sequel to my favourite comedy ever. I have seen Dumb and Dumber so many times I practically know the script by heart and it never gets old. The stupidity is always funny and the story and subplots are always intriguing. Now there's the sequel, stylized as ""Dumb & Dumber To"" instead of ""Dumb and Dumb Two"" to show stupidity. As much as I loved this one, it is not at the level of 1994's. 1994's was fresh and majorly innovative. It's not that Carrey and Daniels are too old, there just hasn't been one down in so long, the result was one repetition and reuse from the first after another with little new things. Plus, Harry and Lloyd are more immature in this than the first. In the first, they just simply have no clue what anything is and they act like kids in this one. The immaturity was a minor flaw, but the lack of anything new or being innovative was what I saw critics poke at the most. After twenty years without a sequel, doing a big rehash was the best thing to do. I knew this would be a big rehash movie when I first found out about the pre-production. This would not be a rehash movie if they did the sequel in 2003 instead of the lame prequel. Either way, this movie is still non-stop funny from beginning to end. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels just needed to dress up in their old outfits and I was all aboard. The movie maybe a rehash, but what they do again is just as a funny the second time around. It is also a great nostalgia movie. Harry and Lloyd's old outfits and hair- dues, the old apartment, Billy in 4C (the blind kid?!) and loads of others make this a very great flick any old Dumb and Dumber fanatic would love.",/review/rw3176343/?ref_=tt_urv

","LIke many others I thought this movie was going to be that sequel you wish they didn't make. Because I love Dumb and Dumber. And it seemed the only reason they made this sequel is because the directors and one of the actors haven't been doing good stuff, the last couple of years.",/review/rw3176343/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2015,OpinionatedJM,10," Thank you Jim, Thank you!!
","It had been a long time since I had laughed to the point of weeping, thank you so much for going back out to the battle again! a hero has been sorely missed in an era of self aware lack of humor. This one might be the best of the whole series it really knocked me for a loop, maybe because it's been a while since I actually laugh out loud at a comedy to the point of having to rewind because I missed what they said next on account of actually laughing my a** off!",/review/rw3176343/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2014,CowherPowerForever,8," He's Got a Gun!
","Almost exactly twenty years after the release of the original Dumb and Dumber, The Farrelly Brothers, Jim Carrey, and Jeff Daniel return to the classic characters that we have loved so much over the years. While you shouldn't expect something as classic as the original film, this film delivers tons of laughs from start to finish. The thing I loved so much about the original film was that it flowed by so quickly. Now, I've only seen this movie once so far, but on my first viewing it went by fast and I really never felt bored. The following is my review of Dumb and Dumber To.",/review/rw3176343/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2021,cstover-28468,2," Dumb and Dumberer was better than this
","Say what you want about the prequel Dumb and Dumberer, but at least it got the characters of Harry and Lloyd right for the most part. This movie didn't. Which is insane considering this one actually was written and directed by the same people and stars the same two actors in the roles as the original. In the first one, Harry and Lloyd did screw up people's lives, yes. But they didn't do it intentionally, they did it through their ignorance and stupidity, but they usually had the best intentions, for the most part. In this one, they're just a--holes for no reason. I hate them in this movie. In the first one, we could sympathize with them but here, they're just mean. All in all, huge disappointment.",/review/rw3176343/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2014,sswren1,1," No need for a spoiler alert - everything after the intro is spoiled
","I love Jim Carrey and I know he polarizes people. Even his most die hard fan would have a tough time seeing merit in this one though. The original made me laugh - a lot. The characters were sympathetic and buffoons need to be, otherwise you end up hating them; which isn't good for a comedy. In this outing they were grubby. The 'dick jokes' turned my stomach and I can't believe that Carrey and Daniels could look at their work and not feel the same. What were they thinking? Enough said! I really wanted to laugh but even when I felt the urge (eg: the catheter tube scene) they prolonged it which lost the impact completely.",/review/rw3176343/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2014,temzo91,7," They're still as dumb.
","Well, I was pretty excited to see this one, knowing that no matter how bad it might turn out to be, these two still would never fail at making you laugh, now it's not as good as the first, but it sure does make you laugh, it's just unbelievable how dumb these two are, time will never heal how stupid they are, and they sure won't be getting better any time soon, they're still as dumb, still funny, and still as entertaining as they were in the first, but I don't know if it's just me or the fact that the first was just too good to beat, I was honestly expecting this one to be even more fun, but it wasn't, the first was better, but this one wasn't bad at all, I would go back to watch it again with a friend if I was asked to, you wouldn't get bored watching this, as everything these two do is a complete mess, it's worth the watch, and definitely worth the ticket.",/review/rw3176343/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2014,phd_travel,9," A laugh a minute - funniest Farrelly Bros movie in years
","Surprisingly, this was very funny in surprising and original ways even the crude parts. There are even more laughs per minute than the more recent Farrelly Brothers movies. It's not as thoughtful as 'Shallow Hal' or ground breaking as 'Something about Mary' but it has more non stop laughter than any of their other movies. The story is quite good. Needing a kidney transplant for Harry, the duo go in search of a daughter encountering a hilarious bunch of characters along the way, from parents to baby Mama to adoptive parents etc. Jim Carrey hams it up like no one else can. Kathleen Turner is perfect for her role.",/review/rw3176343/?ref_=tt_urv

","I can assure you that I won't ""spoil"" it for anyone because my girlfriend and I left after about 45 agonizing minutes of watching this horrible movie...it spoiled all by itself! It's disappointing too because I was a HUGE fan of the original D&D but this was nothing close to that. Carrey and Daniels try too hard to recreate their roles with sub-par dialogue and a story line that is just lame, and it just doesn't work. That and the fact that they tried to ""raunch it up"" a notch I guess thinking it would make it funnier.....it didn't.",/review/rw3176343/?ref_=tt_urv
