","Having really enjoyed/loved 'X Men: First Class' and 'Kick Ass' and being someone who likes a lot of the actors, 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' did seem really intriguing.",/review/rw3178934/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2016,SnoopyStyle,9," ultra-violent Bond-like movie
",Kingsman is a secret spy organization not connected to any government working in the shadows with no rewards and no fame. Arthur (Michael Caine) is the head of the organization. Harry Hart (Colin Firth) is Galahad. He recruits Eggsy (Taron Egerton) who's father once saved his life. Super billionaire villain Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) has vicious hench-woman Gazelle and a devastating plan.,/review/rw3178934/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2015,Sleepin_Dragon,7," Not what I was expecting
","I was expecting something in the way of a James Bond spoof having only seen a 30 second trailer, how wrong can you be. Instead I got a crazy, mad, violent, nutty and over the top film. It has a definite Britishness to it, it's a very smart looking production, very well acted, with some jaw dropping fight scenes, the visuals and production values are extremely high. The fights involving Sofia Boutella were just insane, she's particularly good. Some big casting, Colin Firth as always makes the perfect gentleman. It's Samuel L Jackson I particularly enjoyed, he was just so funny. Lots of violence, which if it's not your thing you should avoid. Overall, slick and very funny. The world is saved by a chav!! 7/10",/review/rw3178934/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2015,CalRhys,," Quintessentially British, Hilariously Funny, Brutally Violent
","Stylish, brutal and hilarious. 'Kingsman' is an extremely quintessentially British flick full of over-the-top yet hilarious comedy, brutal violence and a quirky image of England. Since James Bond's debut in 1962, a number of films have attempted to reinvent the genre, with films like 'Johnny English', 'Get Smart', 'This Means War' and many more, however, none have come close to displaying the perfect blend like 'Kingsman' has. Matthew Vaughn has become renowned for taking on action-comedy projects, for instance 'Kick-Ass' (which is still stronger than this but only just), and along the way has kept that feel-good British aspect to it that makes our greatest secret agent (James Bond) such an icon. All-in-all 'Kingsman' is a brilliant, well-executed film.",/review/rw3178934/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2014,bloodnguts29,10," One Of The Funniest And Most Violent Action Films In Years
","I'm going to be honest about this: I like unabashedly violent action films. I'm 42 years old, I'm from Texas and I can take it. Growing up with films like 'Rambo', 'Die Hard', 'The Terminator' and 'Robocop', I can't stand that watered-down ""no-blood-no-swearing"" gutless kiddie fare that is being served as ""action"" these days. I know the real thing when I see it - we used to see it all the time back in the day - and I hardly ever see it anymore.",/review/rw3178934/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2015,YohjiArmstrong,," Kingsman: The Secret Service
","KINGSMAN is yet another comic book mess, this time about a South London petty criminal who is given the chance to join a private intelligence agency only to find himself fighting against both class prejudice and a mad dotcom genius with an aversion to blood who wants to murder most of the population to save the world from global warming. It's amusing to see a film be disrespectful about Obama and AGW but the film is morally repulsive and stupid. It wants to be a silly but fun globe-trotting adventure like old James Bond films but those films had wit, exotic travel, high living and great stunts whilst this film is crude, stuffed with fake-looking CGI, charmless and has stupid jeopardy-free action scenes; I lost count of just how many times the bad guy's goons had the hero in their sights but missed him. The promised chav to gentleman transformation never occurs - apparently being comfortable with who you are is what makes a gentleman - with the hero starting as a lout and ending up as a lout in a bespoke suit. What really sinks the film though is its lack of a moral compass. I could complain about the crudity of having a Swedish princess offer anal sex to the hero but the real culprit is the way the film mixes comic book sensibilities with hyper-realistic violence. People are tortured and cut in half without a qualm. Worst of all is a sequence in the middle where a (hate) church full of people are driven mad and kill each other in an orgy of improvised and graphic violence which is shot like an action scene as if it is entertainment and goes on forever. If you want to see Colin Firth brutally and repeatedly stabbing a woman in the stomach then this is the film for you.",/review/rw3178934/?ref_=tt_urv

","Kingsman: The Secret Service marks the third film in a row that director Matthew Vaughn has adapted from a comic book background. His two predeceasing being Kick-Ass (2010) and X-Men: First Class (2011) - which, by all means, were pretty damn good!",/review/rw3178934/?ref_=tt_urv

","#Kingsman: The Secret Service is a gentlemen secret spy-society that saves the world from a villain with the help of new recruits ... Don't let this summary fool you, the movie fantastic! It got applause at the end of the preview; for me first time ever in a cinema. ",/review/rw3178934/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2016,MUFCOK,8," Kingsman is just what you would hope for from a modern, British, secret agent flick.
","It's got a solid story with strong acting and a great cast. It has good humour, plenty of violence, bad language, stunning cinematography and perfect pacing. I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie; I avoided it at the time of release as I dismissed it, under the opinion that I wouldn't enjoy it. However, it was impossible to avoid the glowing reviews, so I went into watching this movie intrigued if it would live up to its reputation. ",/review/rw3178934/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2015,A_Different_Drummer,9," A Funny Thing Happened on the way to this review
","True story. I saw the film in August 2015 just after catching President Obama's speech to the nation on the evils of Global Warming and his ""plan"" to save the planet. And although I usually try to avoid sinking into states of Deep Irony I could not help but notice how similar that speech was to Sam Jackson's in this film when he explains his own unique view on saving the planet... just saying...",/review/rw3178934/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2015,dcobbimdb,3," Didn't work for me on any level
","I went into this movie with decent hopes given the high rating it had, but it's not like I was over expecting or anything. In the end I found this thing a total a mess. I think for me it tried to ride too many lines and as a result failed in most aspects. It tried to take itself serious as a spy movie, yet it also tried to be this weird comedy, and while I think movies are capable of doing both, this one just didn't do it well or right to the point where it just bounced me out of the movie completely. Far as it taking itself seriously I found it to be way over the top unbelievable and unrealistic to the point of being stupid. Far as the comedy, I just didn't think the nuclear head explosions or the McDonalds being served on a silver platter was funny at all.",/review/rw3178934/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2015,film316-125-427677,10," The Vaughn Supremacy
","It's strange when you consider it, how much the Spy thriller genre has changed and grown because of James Bond, there is not a single Spy movie that is made that isn't and won't be compared to double 'O' seven himself. So I suppose it's no surprise that a film like Kingsman had to be made eventually, so I suppose the reel question is will this make the Sky fall or just be a quantum of nonsense?

27 December 2014,Quint1965,8," Hilarious! This could be the surprise hit of 2015
","Well folks, that's how it's done. Ever thought MI-6 (note: that's what the British call their secret service) is a club for snobbish, upper class dudes who like to watch paint dry all they long? OK, Bond is kind of cool (I hated the last two, though), but now we finally got a film that takes spy movies to the next level. Not since 'District 9' have I had that feeling during the watching of a film like ""this movie just does everything right"" (by which I mean of course: it plays exactly to MY taste).

","Kingsman , follows an elite team of spies appointed in order to stop crisis around the world and the recruitment in to their ranks of Exjy ,who as all hero journey go becomes awesome and kicks ass. This time the villain that the agency has to stop is Samuel E, Jackshon ,who is a billionaire Eco-terrorist who has as goal to kill a respectable present of the world population, something like the Nick Fury turns bad and he is hilarious!",/review/rw3178934/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2017,Leofwine_draca,6," Warm-hearted action comedy
","KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE is very much a kindred spirit to KICK-ASS, doing for the spy genre what KICK-ASS did for comic books. It's a light and breezy affair, a film which never takes itself too seriously, involving British spies battling a megalomaniac bent on world domination. Taron Egerton suffers from being an unlikeably 'street' character for a lot of the running time, and some of the humour is a little crude for my tastes, but otherwise this is a film which hits the ground running with a heady mix of comedy, action, and genre tropes.",/review/rw3178934/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2014,funwithflags1992,10," Crazy, over-the-top ultra violent fun!!!
","I just came back from a pre-screening of 'Kingsman' and let me tell you: if you liked the first Kick-Ass, you are going to LOOOVE this film! I would never have thought that a stiff Brit like Colin Firth could pull off action - but boy, does he whoop ass in this one. I thought the story was rather original (don't know the Comic), it's a bit like an ultra violent James Bond parody. Or better: a crossbreed of Bond and Kick-Ass. Finally an action movie that doesn't use kiddie-gloves. The kid who plays the recruit is also worth mentioning. I've never seen him before but he really nails it. There's a lot of humor in this film, it really doesn't take itself too seriously, but it's not overdone. And Sam Jackson finally found something he hasn't done yet. I guess his role was already spoiled a bit in the trailer, but believe me: you haven't seen Jackson in this kind of part before. This is an excellent, over-the-top bloody and sexy film for fans of old-school action films. I give it 10 stars. Highly recommended!",/review/rw3178934/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2016,anaconda-40658,8," Great Followup to Kick-Ass.
","Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014): Dir: Matthew Vaughn / Cast: Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson, Taron Egerton, Sophie Cookson, Mark Strong: Matthew Vaughn's lighter followup to Kick-Ass. This one is less graphic yet similar in style and violence. It regards legacy and stars Colin Firth as agent Harry Hart who loses a fellow agent in the film's opening rescue attempt. Guilt ridden, Hart delivers a bravery medal to the agent's widow and infant son. This kid grows up and ends up being recruited as a possible agent through an encounter with Hart. He and several other youths are trained and it comes down to two recruits. Central plot regards an Internet millionaire who implants a SIM card in various individuals that results in outburst of violence. One scene, which occurs inside a hate group church is amongst the best footage Vaughn has ever shot, in its slow motion chaos and theme music. Vaughn's other worthy credits include X-Men: First Class and Stardust. Firth plays it straight as Hart whose appearance in the thick glasses, suit and umbrella denies his true abilities. Samuel L. Jackson dressed in an orange jump suit and cap on backwards steals scenes as this profane outrageous villain with a female sidekick whose legs are blades. Taron Egerton plays the young lead whose struggles merge with surprise when he must take centre stage when chaos threatens. Sophie Cookson as agent Roxy is fetching but underwritten. Mark Strong is featured from Kick-Ass but doesn't elevate beyond the standard role. Theme is identity and taking the secret agent clichés to a harrowing climax that does this inventive visual comedy tremendous service. Score: 8 ½ / 10",/review/rw3178934/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2015,ptb-8,3," Kingsmen....or clown..
","Clever slick and all Steed-shiny...but this film, poached from KILL BILL, THE SAINT, INCEPTION, THE AVENGERS, any 60s BOND etc...with added CLOCKWORK ORANGE violence simply shows that Matthew Vaughn is just another vile Tarantino wannabee handed a big budget and excessively indulgently produced a stupid film with set pieces of boring ugly violence. Some scenes, as in the church, are just disgusting, and from that point the interest level wanes. The scenes in the mountain lair are INCEPTION meets ON HER MAJESTYS SECRET SERVICE with absurd and endless killing which ultimately made me feel ill. 30 minutes too long and from a clown copycat director, this film is great initially, for 60 minutes and then irritating and vile for 70 minutes. Yes the damn thing runs 130 minutes. I really did feel sick and exhausted when it finished. I thought it all a shocking waste of production money time and the studio's trust. To show contempt for the audience with such cretinous perverse 'action' and result, the villain even spews on the audience. Then there is the 'hilarious' anal sex joke. The last 70 minutes of this chrome dildo of a movie are truly horrible.",/review/rw3178934/?ref_=tt_urv

23 May 2015,leftbanker-1,1," Completely Stupid and Unbelievable at Every Step
","This film was embarrassingly stupid from start to finish. A stinking load of feces with huge lapses in logic and riddled with the most senseless violence with no nod towards reality. It was like some high school kids had an unlimited budget and access to top-notch actors and went on to make a childish mess of a film. I can't believe this was written by anyone out of their teens. I doubt that I will ever be able to take these actors seriously again. Sam Jackson was idiotic as a lisping half-moron, Colin Firth was no better in his role as a Bond wannabe. A hire-the-handicapped assassin? Completely and utterly stupid.",/review/rw3178934/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2015,bob-the-movie-man,7," A great first half but then the pudding is over-egged
","Matthew Vaughn, who's previous films in the director's chair number just four – ""Layer Cake"", ""Stardust"", ""Kick Ass"" and ""X-Men: First Class"" – does not do subtle. But he certainly does do stylish and entertaining. Of his past works Kingsman resembles most closely Kick Ass with its anarchic tone and comic-book violence. This is not surprising given the film is based, as was Kick-Ass, on a new comic book series by Mark Millar (this time with Dave Gibbons).",/review/rw3178934/?ref_=tt_urv
