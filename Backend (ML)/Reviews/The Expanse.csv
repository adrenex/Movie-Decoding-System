10 February 2015,Leofwine_draca,7," Surprisingly mature and compelling thriller
","I'm not sure why this was a bomb at the box office, because I thought it was pretty decent. It's a New York-set conspiracy thriller starring the underrated Mark Wahlberg as a private detective who soon becomes embroiled in a new case involving the city's Mayor (played with sleazy relish by Russell Crowe) and his cheating wife, Catherine Zeta-Jones.",/review/rw2745214/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2013,ferguson-6,5," We Broke this city on Mark and Crowe
","Greetings again from the darkness. The best Political crime dramas are complex films with multiple intersecting sub-plots, filled with stylish mis-direction and intense wordplay and back-stabbing between good guys and bad. What doesn't work is obvious. Especially obvious to the point where the audience is way ahead of the earnest, but clumsy protagonist. Luckily for director Allen Hughes (working solo without his brother Albert for the first time), he has stacked the film with a wonderful cast which makes it somewhat entertaining despite its major flaws.",/review/rw2745214/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2013,Bob_the_Hobo,7," Smarter than You Think, Not as Clever as You Hope
","Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg) is a New York city cop who got off on a technicality following his execution of a supposed rapist/murder. Discharged from the force by his Captain (Jeffrey Wright), Taggart is viewed highly by Mayor Hostetler (Russell Crowe) for taking out the trash with a common thug. Seven years later, Hostetler, amidst a re- election battle against golden boy city councilman Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper), hires Taggart to find out who is sleeping with his gorgeous wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones). As Taggart follows, he uncovers a much larger conspiracy. ",/review/rw2745214/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2013,Movie_Muse_Reviews,4," Top talents only take 'Broken City' so far
","The quality of a corruption-themed political thriller with a star-studded cast always comes down to one thing — the script. Mark Wahlberg, Russell Crowe, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Barry Pepper, Kyle Chandler and Jeffrey Wright definitely qualify ""Broken City"" for that category of film, and so all eyes are on rookie screenwriter Brian Tucker.",/review/rw2745214/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2013,griffolyon12,6," A Generic Political Thriller
","Broken City is not an unwatchable movie, but it's not a great movie either. A standard, run-of- the-mill political thriller about corrupt politicians and the private eye caught in the middle of it all, is elevated by the turns of Mark Wahlberg and Russell Crowe, but the script itself is bland and a little too on the nose for it to ever be believable or emotionally involving. When a character is flat-out telling you everything about their backstory, rather than letting you piece it together through visuals and subtext, that's when you know the script doesn't always work. Even still, there are good moments to be found here and there, but there's nothing about this movie that's any different than any similar movie ever released, and most of those do everything a lot better. Want my advice, watch Serpico or All the President's Men instead.",/review/rw2745214/?ref_=tt_urv

18 January 2013,mannin11,5," Painting by numbers
","I give this a five for the cast, but a two for the obtuse and predictable script, which inexplicably appeared on the Black List of best unproduced scripts -- in which category it should have remained. In development hell for years, it should at the very least have undergone a major rewrite to simplify the story (which wanders all over the place and becomes dumber by the minute) and raised the tone up out of the gutter. Whichever studio execs placed this on the Black List need to stop sniggering over the dirty words and earn their money by figuring out just what constitutes a good script. Wahlberg is always a pleasure to spend time with but the phoniness of so many of the scenes and the clunkiest car chase ever defeat even his efforts to entertain. So much of this movie is predictable and so many scenes are actors simply going through their paces with inferior material. The gorgeous, gorgeous Catherine Zeta Jones is totally wasted in this piece of dreck. Somewhere in this movie there may originally have been a good idea about corruption in the city. Unfortunately nobody appears to have had the courage to grab it by the throat, beat it into shape and present it to the public with any wit, style or originality. Like it says in the header, this is painting by numbers.",/review/rw2745214/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2013,michael-j-chapman1997,7," Entertaining, yet still average.
","Broken City has many flaws, yet I was still surprisingly entertained the entire way through. Russell Crowe was the highlight of the movie, not a surprise, as he's one of the best actors of his generation. Mark Wahlberg was pretty good too, although he wasn't very likable. An election's happening, Crowe is the dirt bag of a mayor, and an election's coming up. Although it seems Crowe was supposed to be the bad guy, his opponent wasn't likable at all, and I was rooting for the corrupt mayor the entire time. The supporting cast in general wasn't spectacular, although Kyle Chandler plays his part well. The film was written averagely, the story wasn't that great, and the direction was simple, yet as I stated earlier, I had a good time.",/review/rw2745214/?ref_=tt_urv

16 February 2014,rupie,2," a liberal bedtime story
","This movie is nothing more than a scaffolding on which to hand a tiresome collection of clichéd liberal nostrums. The characters, as well, are cardboard stereotypes. We know right from the first scene in the office of the mayor that he's going to be the bad guy. Why? Look how much he drinks, and see how tough-on-crime he is. We have the standard liberal line of ""developer as villain."" And then when the gay issue is injected it's clear the ""good guys"" will be gay. And how stunningly obvious, to the point of silliness, that the ""good"" mayoral candidate's name is ""Jack Valliant."" Puh-leeeez. The clincher to this view of the movie is the extended excerpt from the mayoral debate, which does absolutely zero to advance the plot. The whole point is to show us how the bad guy wants lower taxes, and the good guy wants to - wait for it - ""tax the rich."" I guess the viewer is not supposed to be paying attention because Valliant claims to want do this to close the budget deficit, when 30 seconds earlier it's been made clear the budget is in surplus. Details, details. Wahlberg and Crowe do their usual good jobs, and the suspense is fairly well maintained, but it's not enough to counter the liberal sermonizing and some pretty clumsy plot devices. I'm waiting for Hollywood to be really radical, and come up with a movie where the villain is gay, or a prochoice activist, or an environmentalist, and the hero is a Republican or a developer. But I'm not holding my breath.",/review/rw2745214/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2013,DUKEJBM,," A Badly Written Mess
","This movie is a mess. It's an entertaining mess but a mess nonetheless. Besides taking no time to introduce or make us care about any of the characters, the overall plot and concept are simply ludicrous and that's putting it mildly. What transpires a week leading to the election for mayor of New York is so outrageous and nonsensical that it deflates this movie right to its core. Character actions make no sense at all and the movie tries to turn on a dime in a few places to seem clever or deliver some sort of arc but it all plays out as lazy writing and development.",/review/rw2745214/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2013,Troy_Campbell,5," The cast deserved better.
","Three things become quickly apparent whilst viewing this run of the mill thriller: Mark Whalberg is in his comfort zone playing the reluctant and damaged hero, Russell Crowe obviously had a blast taking time off from 'serious' acting to play the Machiavellian politician here, and Barry Pepper unfortunately remains one of our generation's most underrated and underused actors. With a predictable and clichéd plot - Whalberg's emotionally wounded ex-cop is hired, then framed for murder, by Crowe's scheming New York Mayor - and Allen Hughes' uninspired direction from behind the camera, Broken City never reaches the heights it could, or should, have. In his first solo directorial effort (he's made 4 feature films with brother Albert), Hughes musters neither the style (From Hell, Book of Eli) or the grit (Menace II Society, Dead Presidents) of his previous work, instead his camera feels flat and his tone plodding. There are sporadic moments of excitement, but these are owed to the top notch cast doing their best despite the one-dimensionality of their characters. Crowe is a pure joy to watch as the gleefully despicable villain and Pepper imbues his opposition leader with intrigue, whilst in other roles there's Jeffrey Wright who keeps his police commissioner morally ambiguous to the very end and Catherine Zeta-Jones who plays the Mayor's seductive wife with aplomb. Alas, throw in the terminally dull climax and this is ultimately a disappointing movie with unfulfilled potential and broken promises, of which the cast deserved better.",/review/rw2745214/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2013,tictack,5," Broken movie
","First of all whats with the title of the movie? its catchy but hardly bears any relevance to the story. The plot and the screenplay are just good for a detective show on the television. Even when it tries to pack some thrill, the plot is so obvious that you can almost make out what has really happened. performances from Wahlberg and Crowe are decent although we have seen better from them. Catherine zeta Jones is absolutely wasted. when you watch the movie, you get a feel that you have seen this before as there's hardly anything new to offer. overall watchable once you start watching it but why should you in the first place? give it a miss. you wont miss nothing.",/review/rw2745214/?ref_=tt_urv

","This one had the makings of a classic, with a very interesting cast: Whalberg, Crowe, and Zeta-Jones, all of whom have done great work before and are more than engaging and capable of giving us multi layered performances. The result is satisfying, but it feels rushed, and there were moments when there are gaps in the narrative. The supporting roles needed a little fleshing out because as I mentioned before the seeds were planted, yet something stunts the full development of a golden promise.",/review/rw2745214/?ref_=tt_urv

","Before I even get into a review I just have to mention something thats rather annoying, I am not a conservative but I am certainly not a liberal. But when forced to pick sides I go with conservatives, anyways this stupid film had the audacity of making the Crowe character into a total republican thus heres the subliminal message for you moron movie goers, republicans are greedy and liberals are always pure and noble socialists who just want to abuse those very rich snobs. Of course we all know how that really goes, they say they'll tax just the super rich and me a guy who makes 1600 a month working at a grocery store gets hammered with that 2 percent payroll tax, thanks liberals, jerks.",/review/rw2745214/?ref_=tt_urv
