","Although classical music and opera is more my cup of tea/forte, that has never stopped me from having always admired Elton John and loving most of his songs. ""Your Song"", ""Something About the Way You Look Tonight"", ""I'm Still Standing"" and pretty much all the songs in 'The Lion King' are especially great, one of the few exceptions being ""Crocodile Rock"". He is/was also a quite interesting man, both stage persona and personal life, and the period that is primarily focused on is a very compelling one and worthy of being told on film.",/review/rw4880473/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2019,Ed-Shullivan,10," Elton John is amazing, and he is a complicated man....this film reflects his tormented side
","Taron Egerton's portrayal of Elton John is superb and only heightened by the producers allowing Taron to sing his own versions of many of Elton John's classic hits. It would be impossible to capture all aspects of Elton John's life in the 2 hours provided in this musical/biographical film, so instead the producer/writer/director concentrated on Elton's early childhood which helped shape his destiny when he first met his partner in song writing the great Bernie Taupin played by Jamie Bell.",/review/rw4880473/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2019,oldmovies1185,9," Here is what many people don't understand
","This is not a movie about a rock star with their music simply part of the facts of the story. It is a musical in the truest sense, that uses his own music to show his tribulations through the eyes of a man during the troubled years of his life. The movie is not always chronological and in some cases is more figurative than historical. In this way it can convey Sir Elton John's life and struggles in a way that the viewer may understand on a more personal level. The acting, writing and singing are superb.
The star did not try to truly imitate Elton but instead preforned the pieces in his own style that he molded as closely as possible to the original. It sounds odd, but it works.
As always you can never sum up any life, book or story in a 2 or so hour movie, but this comes close. You leave feeling like you really got to know the real, yet flawed, human Elton John. Overall a wonderful movie.",/review/rw4880473/?ref_=tt_urv

8 November 2019,classicsoncall,9," ""Just put on a great f..... show, and just don't kill yourself with drugs.""
","For whatever reason, I didn't catch this in theaters during it's opening run the way I did for ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". I think I liked this one slightly better, even though I'm not that much a fan of movie musicals. The way this story was presented was cleverly and artistically well put together, though if put into perspective, many of Elton John's mega-hits seemed to have been written well before he made his American debut at The Troubador at the age of twenty five. I never followed Elton's personal life that closely, but that all seemed to be poetic license for the sake of a narrative flow. Taron Egerton did a bang up job here, not only looking like Elton John on the way to super-star status, but sounded quite a bit like him as well. Given that Elton John himself gave Egerton and the film his blessing is all anyone needs to know about the underlying substance to the story. It's a shame that Reginald Dwight's parents never really cared for him, but then you have to consider how much that sadness translated into the singer's overall success. What the film put to rest for me was Elton's relationship with song writer Bernie Taupin, as I never really knew if Taupin was anything more than a collaborator rather than a musician himself. Additionally, as I watch all my films now with captioning enabled, I was surprised to learn how much of John's popular lyrics I never really knew. So overall, this was an entertaining experience, and one I'd welcome viewing again. The surprising thing is, it's actually shorter than one of Elton John's concerts. The man can do three hours without a break, always giving fans more than their money's worth.",/review/rw4880473/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2019,deblasiogwae,10," TARON EGERTON is the real ""A Star is Born"".
","There's a moment during the first half hr of Rocketman when Reggie is sitting at the piano in his robe. He looks at Taupin's lyrics and composes ""Your Song"".. His grandmother (who seems to be the only person who loved this lonely child) comes into the living room, sits down and then does something so beautiful it made me cry. She puts her hand to her chin and gazes in awe at what her grandson has produced. By this one gesture the director shows us what a genius Elton John was in his heyday. It's an overwhelming moment. I think even Taron himself may not realize just how great he is in this movie. It's a cliché to say in a biopic that ""he becomes"" the character he portrays. But Taron Egerton overcomes the cliché.

25 December 2020,Morejambo54,5," Hmmm...
","It's alright. I really didn't like how much of a musical it was. There was a sad scene that instantly turned into a fun and happy song, this really took me out of the movie. Another thing that felt stupid was when someone would start singing mid sentence, maybe it's just because I don't like musicals...but it was rather annoying. The music is obviously good and the acting was great there was just so many things that pulled me out of the story and got me thinking only about the songs, which is the main part but I came for a movie not a collage of music videos. The ending was pretty bland also, another sad and depressing scene turned into a bright and happy song. Then it ended, just like that. The movie is enjoyable though I just personally prefer more realistic movies such as bohemian rhapsody which was executed superbly. I can understand how and why people enjoy it as much as they do. 5/10",/review/rw4880473/?ref_=tt_urv

","I love Elton John...but this movie is nothing but a long pity party for him! The entire movie is obsessed with showing us what a victim he was...people treating him badly and how all these awful things made him resort to drugs, sex, and self hate. ""It wasn't his fault!"" Meanwhile, he's the center of the world's attention and making millions. There is not one ounce of joy in this movie.

","What a disappointment. Bad writing. Pitiful representation of EJ. I couldn't stand the musical portions and ended up FFW past them. And how do you screw up concert/show dates with when the actual song was created? Casting was great and Egerton nailed his role, but he should've lip-synced the music and had the actual EJ songs played. Not saying his voice was bad, but basically I just saw a 2 hour pity party played/sung by a cover band musical. This film would have been much better as an actual biopic. Compared to Bohemian Rhapsody, this film was a huge flop for me. It's a generous 6/10 mainly for Egerton's great performance.",/review/rw4880473/?ref_=tt_urv

With this big screen picture called ""Rocketman"" it tells the rise and break out of the stardom of one Elton John it's like the film also teases in a fantasy like way with parody that involves certain songs from John. Flashbacks and looking back at his life are the norm thru the film, as his life is heavily focused on. Looking all the way back at his childhood days you the viewer see that it was tough that Elton grew up without his real dad after the split from tough overbearing mommy Sheila(Bryce Dallas Howard) it was clear that Elton needed a father figure.",/review/rw4880473/?ref_=tt_urv

21 June 2019,peeedeee-94281,2," Rocketman Fizzles Out
","I'm not sure if I saw the same movie as everyone praising it. I thought it was okay, but definitely not an 8 or 9 out of 10.
There are many problems with this film. The main issue, which I didn't realize until someone pointed it out in their review, is that the magic of listen to Elton John singing his songs is missing in this one. If you compare it to a recent, similar film by the same director (half directed by him), Bohemian Rhapsody, we get to hear Freddie's voice. Malik lip syncs to it, but that's why we fell in love with the artist. Taron does a good job singing, and performing, but he's NOT Elton John, vocally.
Second issue is that it's tonally all over the place. It wants to be a musical, or it wants to be a drama, it can't be both. Usually musicals are more upbeat. But I think the placing of a music scene is critical, and it just felt very repetitive in this movie. In fact, I took a bathroom break during one of the middle music scenes because I didn't feel compelled to stick around. I felt the drama scenes were worth more to sit through. The uneven tone just kept kicking me out of the movie.
The makeup for Bryce Howard was horrible when she was playing the older version of the mother. It looked like all they did was make her face lighter, it was pretty lazy. And why was the step father/boyfriend not considered a supportive person in Elton's life. I get that the mother and father were not as warm, but the step father, in addition to his grandmother, seemed to be a pretty good father figure.
Ultimately, this film fails to make Elton a sympathetic character. At least with Freddie Mercury, we did feel emotion for him and his plight. With Elton, it just felt more like 'woe is me' x 20, i.e. over and over again. Then the movie ends, and you're like 'okay, what was the point of this movie?' There is no point, no message. We just watch Elton's life set to a Mamma Mia-esque framework, with mediocre results.
If you have to choose to watch Bohemian Rhapsody or Rocketman, choose the former.",/review/rw4880473/?ref_=tt_urv

","Elton John is one of the greatest contemporary artists of the world, no doubt. However, this highlight of his life is a terrible overrated film, without any emotion and an exploitation of Elton John as a needy alcoholic and drug addicted gay. He is needy because of his one-dimension parents that are never developed and the viewer never knows why they treat the boy that way. His gay side is also poorly developed and more exploited. In the end, the film is lost between a shallow drama and a boring musical. The performance of Taron Egerton in the role of Elton John is the best this movie can offer.

","After finishing the Freddie Mercury and Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody, director Dexter Fletcher then made this musical biopic of Elton John played here by Taron Egerton. And this is very much a musical as not only does Taron sing the famous songs written by Elton and Bernie Taupin but so do the other real-life figures in his life as if characters in a Broadway or movie musical. It's mostly a joyous celebration until John's drug and alcohol fueled excess takes its toll. But he recovered in a big way leading to...well, just watch Rocketman.

11 June 2019,isobelebarker,10," A Beautiful Fantasy
","I want to start by saying that I really struggle to sit through longer films, I get restless and my attention wavers (a little sad I know, but it is what it is). When I left the cinema I couldn't believe the running time - including adverts etc I'd sat through 2h30 without even thinking about the time once. I was completely engrossed!
Taron Egerton, alongwith his co stars perform excellently in this fantasy based musical, taking you through the highs and lows of Elton Johns earlier life. It's a real rollercoaster experience, I loved it!
There were many moments which made me smile of bought a tear to my eye for different reasons, I'll name a couple of my favourites. Elton arrives in America and performs Crocodile Rock. There's so much passion in his performance and then comes this euphoric, floating fantasy scene, it's so beautiful and a great piece of cinematography which immerses you and makes you feel like you are there in that room. I also loved the way Elton and Bernie's friendship was shown, it was so lovely to watch. There's a really touching scene where Elton is playing his piano, creating music to accompany the lyrics to Your Song. Bernie is upstairs shaving, yet is drawn to the dining room to listen to Elton bring his song to life. Elton's singing the lyrics and keeps looking over to Bernie, seemingly singing it to Bernie platonically, as a love song. You see a real bond between the pair of them.
One scene that got me the most was after Elton had tried to commit suicide, they showed him being rushed to hospital which once he arrived there was a routine in which he was treated and prepared by everyone around him to perform on stage immediately as he forces a smile. It just showed how much he suffered and how money came first, it was really poignant. Again, a beautiful piece of work.
There's so much more to talk about, such as the relationships between him and his mum/dad/new manager come lover and how they were all equally as cold and callous. Or the scenes in which Elton has visions of his younger self, comforting a younger Elton at the end of the film with a hug - all he ever wanted. However we'd be here all day!
I truly adored this film and it's definitely one to watch on the big screen. It bought out so many emotions and that's what I think a film should do. So glad I've seen it and have recommended it to everyone who's mentioned it!",/review/rw4880473/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2019,zkonedog,8," All About The Music And That Works Here!
","When I think of biopics, especially about musicians, I think of films like ""Walk The Line"" or ""Love & Mercy"" that told pretty much straight biography stories and then interspersed the artist's music at certain points. That is not the approach taken in ""Rocketman"". No, this one is all about the music, and because it's the legendary Elton John, it works basically as well as anything.",/review/rw4880473/?ref_=tt_urv

5 September 2020,ironhorse_iv,7," This jukebox musical didn't quite hit the right keys. Still it was watchable.
","This bio-pic directed by Dexter Fletcher about musician Elton John's breakthrough years as he struggles with his sexuality and substance abuse was mostly fine. The problem comes from the fact that the movie used the same somewhat tiresome familiar old plots thread that most Rockstar films have. Some examples are the rag to riches rise, debauchery hedonism of that lifestyle, the break up and redemption. This movie mirrors countless flicks with similar premise like 2004 'Beyond the Sea', 2005 'Walk the Line' and most of all 2018 'Bohemian Rhapsody' which Fletcher help co direct. Barely anything in this film seem to stand out or seem unique. I thought the music video for Elton John's ""This Train Don't Stop There Anymore"" song had a better approach. It showed his career by detailing the real-life musician coming to terms with getting older and unable to sing the iconic falsetto notes any longer, with audio narrative intermixed with fantasy visuals of his past self, well performed by Justin Timberlake getting tired of the fame and partying. It was really good at cleverly hinting of Elton's past problems not over exploitation it like this movie. Regardless Taron Egerton did show an uncanny resemblance to John with use of flamboyant body language, voice and alright piano playing even if bit hammy. With great costumes and make up, he was convincing. I also did like some of the visual styles of the musical numbers. Even if the order of them wasn't really historical accurate, such in the case as the ""I'm Still Standing"" song sequence. That scene is supposed to represent Elton's full recovery from substance abuse. Yet in reality, in 1983 when John was still drinking heavily. In truth, he didn't seek out recovery until 1990. The film also left out the real reason that Elton decided to sober up which was a chance meeting with Ryan White; the poster child of the AIDS crisis who died one month before his high school graduation. The film kinda omitted that. Along with the fact that the singer also created Elton John AIDS Foundation. It's pretty sad that the screenwriter Lee Hall did that, because those events could had added a lot more to the movie. Nevertheless, Elton didn't really leave Madison Square Garden quickly in costume for a rehab group as the movie outrageously wants us to believe. Still the use ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" from the opening scene being played out as a triumphant entrance showing John at the height of his career and fame only to reveal that he's at his lowest point was brilliant. Then there is ""Saturday Night's Alright' scene that plays over a dance number that symbolizes the excitement of a child and adolescent versions of Reggie Dwight (Matthew Illesley and Kit Connor) transition into adulthood. It was a lot of fun; despite the song not being written by Elton about him, but Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell), a man he has yet to meet in the film. As for the other, they're just as spectacular. 'Crocodile Rock' shows the out of body experience with everybody floating in the air even if it's not synced with the timeline. While ""I Want Love"" illustrates the sadness of Reggie with his family, even if the kin's public perception portrayal is a little bit over dramatic. For instance, Elton John's grandma wasn't the only one who supported his dream. In truth, both of parents help him out. Stanley Dwight (Steven Mackintosh) got Reggie his first piano and didn't really limited what the child wore. Later in his life, Stanley did see John perform many times irrespective from what the singer might believe. He wasn't as distance and cold as the film makes him out to be. Then there is his troublesome relationship with his mother Sheila whom is oddly played by American actress Bryce Howard Dallas whom not British nor mature enough for such roles. While they certainly had their disputes, she is portrayed more harshly in the movie as well. Much of their heat come from the fact that Sheila stayed friends with Elton's enemies like former driver Bob Halley which the movie doesn't talk about and John Reid whom played by Richard Madden in the movie. Like Stanley, she wasn't as critical of his life as a gay man in real life. Then that brings us to his harsh relationship with Reid. It's true that they were lovers, but there is hardly any record of predator like physical abuse between them in reality. In fact, Reid remained Elton's manager until 1998 when it was discovered that he had been spending Elton's money on oversees tour expenses. That's the true reason why they stop working with each other. Nevertheless, the fictional course of direction feels a little bit one sided as the film makes it look like getting into a homosexual relationship might be bad. It gave the wrong tone. Fletcher should have balance it with showing Elton meeting his eventual husband David Furnish rather than after credit telling us that. In truth the filmmakers should had cut the pointless Elton's impulsive straight marriage to German native Renate Blauel played by Celinde Schoenmaker, despite in reality the marriage actually lasted four years. Better yet they shouldn't had adapted out singer Long John Baldry who had a very meaningful role in Elton's life. Not only did he inspired Elton's stage name, but he is the one that save his life after a suicide attempt and aided in him coming to terms with his homosexuality. While all of his moments are given to Bernie. Him being there would have work better in tone. I also wouldn't mind a cameo Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury or mention of Princess Diana if that helps the movie be more developed. In the end the movie seemed unfinished. Overall: While this musical didn't quite go breaking my heart; it also didn't make me want to crocodile rock that much. It was only alright at best.",/review/rw4880473/?ref_=tt_urv
