14 January 2023,Supermanfan-13,8," Pretty Fun Show!
","Hunters was actually a pretty fun show. I was looking forward to seeing this after watching the trailers and seeing that Al Pacino was involved but then after reading so many mixed reviews my expectations tempered a bit. Well, after really enjoying the first season I was for season two, I'm about halfway through right now and it's even better than the first. It's too bad that they're only doing two seasons overall but that might actually be perfect for a show like this. You don't want it to overstay its welcome and hang around just for the sake of hanging around. Id definitely recommend if you haven't seen this yet, just give yourself enough time because you're going to want to binge it.",/review/rw5551365/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2023,DiCaprioFan13,8," Very Entertaining!
","Hunters is about some Nazi hunters in the late 70's in New York City that find out that there are hundreds of high ranking Nazi officials that are living among them. The hunters then go hunt them down and bring justice to them and also stop their new genocidal plans. I really wasn't sure what to expect from Hunters with all the mixed reviews, I've never seen a show so split between people liking it or not. After watching season 1, I thought it was a pretty good show that was absolutely worth watching! Now after finishing season two it became even that much better. Season two was fantastic. I don't understand what some of these negative reviewers wanted? There's plenty of action, comedy, drama, mystery, twists, etc., to please most people. It's too bad it was only two seasons long but at least it didn't go out with a cliffhanger.",/review/rw5551365/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2022,valiantprince,9," So, for the uneducated
","1. Those of us who lived through the 70s can attest: YES. The clothes, the cars, the hair and sideburns, YES they were really that over the top. In hindsight, it all looks ridiculous, but even the executives in my Dad's branch of General Electric were sporting the polyester leisure suits, the gold chains dancing in their chest hair, and those godawful white patent leather shoes and belts. I'd go into home devote and the peak of avocado appliances, but the memories are just too horrifying.",/review/rw5551365/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2020,eborella63,9," fantastic show
","I was very surprised by this show, when I saw the trailer I thought that it would another Nazi theme series, so I was hesitant to start watching it, but after the 1t episode, I wa hooked. The actors are incredible good, Al Pacino deserves all the praises but all the other actors nailed the performances as well. I loved every single episode, even the bad guys are really good. The dialogs are witty and funny when needed or dramatic and intelligent. I hope Amazon continues to bring shows of this level of quality in the future. Congrats to all involved. I can't wait for more.",/review/rw5551365/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2022,kh-17438,8," The First Scene
","The Nazis were here, and were completely assimilated into the corn belt of America. I went to high school with their children, and we always knew about their sponsorship from the ""old country"" after the war. Every summer we all went to a cookout or two, and heard their recipes and stories about the displacement camp, and we all just never asked too many questions. Just mostly why our small town when anywhere else sounded better. It seemed the family had barely escaped with their lives and we were grateful for them.",/review/rw5551365/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2020,andrewlever06,7," Am I watching the same show?
",I've read some really negative reviews on here I'm not sure why. I'll admit they could've and should've dialed down the schmaltzy accents a bit but other than that I've really enjoyed it. The Tarantino references are more homage than plagiarism I feel. Well worth watching.,/review/rw5551365/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2020,horrorgasm,," Little too silly for me.
","Look, I'm not a Trump supporter so just forget about that right now. No politics involved here, I just don't think this show is very good. The Nazis are such over the top cartoon supervillains that it's hard to take them at all seriously. This is made painfully clear from the very first extremely over the top scene. The tone is all over the place. Sometimes it seems like they're going to take the subject matter very seriously, but more often than not it starts leaning into a weird mix of comic book movie (and no I don't have a problem with comic book movies) and some kind of weird parody of exploitation films. It's all very campy, over the top, and packed with comic book references for some reason. The protagonist kid's introductory story even feels like a superhero origin story.",/review/rw5551365/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2023,Grey_rainbow,6," An ok-ish series, except the 7th episode of 2nd season, which is pure genius
","If you can suspend the most basic common sense and stop wondering why not a single agent of CIA, Brits, Mossad, KGB, etc. Ever turn up, not even at the very end, you can enjoy the show, although with a bit of help from the fast forward button in some sappy parts.",/review/rw5551365/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2020,jsauri,5," Not what I was expecting
","The trailers for this highlighted the moments of drama, graphic violence, and a compelling plot. However, the show has a very cartoonish, faux-blacksploitation veneer, riddled with very cheesy attempts at humor that fell very flat for me. The writing and direction undermine some good performances from (some of) the actors. Maybe I'll give it another try when I'm in a better mindset for the type of show this actually is. But I don't know if I'll be able to get past how desperately it tries to be fun. It just seems to rehash tired tropes from better genres in an attempt to see original, but lacks its own sense of style to pull it together. It's like someone threw a bunch of random ingredients in water and called it soup. But they never let it simmer enough to create a real broth.",/review/rw5551365/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2020,iamkeysersoze-13228,," Seriously worth watching. Check it out ASAP
","The most important scene in a TV show or miniseries is the opening 5 minutes. If the opening scene doesn't intrigue or invest you, chances are that they'll check out before the season finale. Thankfully Hunters was terrific from the get go. Hunters is fantastic.",/review/rw5551365/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2020,levybob,2," God I hate this
","God I hate this.
And not because of its subject matter.
And not because of its trivializing certain historical events.
And not because there are sudden outbreaks of song, and dance, and whatever.",/review/rw5551365/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2020,dhooghesven,3," Missed opportunity
","With this kind of budget and cast I was expecting something dark and gritty like Munich (2005) but instead we get a failed attempt to mix The Boys (2019) with Inglorious Basterds (2009).
The production is high quality although the set creators maybe overdid it a tad with the 70's feeling, the actors delivered with what they had to work with but the writing is all over the place : Cartoony, unrealistic and certainly not funny.
In times where everybody gets offended with the smallest of things it seems like the writers had a contest to offend as much people as they could. Considering there were real Nazi hunters and the CIA actually did what they showed in the show they could have delivered a way better script for those actors. Sorry but I can not classify this in any other way than a missed opportunity.",/review/rw5551365/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2020,privatechrisnylan,4," Tarentino vibe if Tarentino was crap
","Really wanted to love this.... it's just unlovable. With an hour to fill for each episode there's just so much padding, get on with it FFS. In the end I gave up as it progresses as such a glacially slow pace.",/review/rw5551365/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2020,drjgardner,2," You gotta be kidding
","Nobody like a good Nazi hunting plot than I do, but give me a break. I'm not sure what this is. Is it a comedy? Is it a satire? Is it drama? Who knows? Who cares!? It's none of these because it's so childish and poorly put together it's impossible to care. What makes it even worse is the terrible accents by just about everyone. Sometimes I can't even understand what they're saying, and then I realize that I just don't care. Gave it 3 episodes to get better. It didn't.",/review/rw5551365/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2020,ROOKreations,4," A show that doesn't know what it is!
","I really liked the premise, the cast, and the trailers and was looking forward to seeing what the show would offer. The show is rampant with awkward dialogue and repetitive references to comic characters which gets very annoying. Every other piece of dialogue seems to only be exposition and no real character development. The show feels to constantly be in battle with itself on its own identity. The show feels disjointed while trying to deliver comedy right against constant flashbacks to the Holocaust. The show relies too heavily on those flashbacks which feel very lazy in an attempt to fill those unanswered questions. Pretty disappointed with the show. Logan Lerman and Al Pacino are entirely underutilized.",/review/rw5551365/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2020,dogonlion,1," Bad, bad, bad...
","What can I say? You start watching this and 20 minutes later you wonder ""what the hell am I watching?"" Then you don't even want to wait for Pacino to appear anymore. He should have skipped this one. F",/review/rw5551365/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2023,gogg-05075,2," Season 1 was 10 but season 2 is a 1
",Season one is brilliant but after a 3 year break season two is just a disaster. Watch the first season as it really is good but avoid the second season.,/review/rw5551365/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2020,peeone,10," Fantastic - I loved this
","I'm binging a lot of TV at the moment as I recover from surgery. Watch the ads for this and waited for it to drop... half way through episode 8 and I haven't stopped watching... it is great television and a great cast.
It is a bit violent though so be warned for that.
Oh and I don't give a stuff about political leanings I watch tv to escape... this did the job!",/review/rw5551365/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2020,Rogermex,10," Amazing!
","This is very, very cool! Fantastic and way heavy! I think it's better than ""Watchmen"" and gives Tarantino a challenge for ""badness."" Seriously, all sorts of top-notch acting, mind-bending scenes, twists and turns like you haven't seen, etc. I think Al Pacino, who does not need any credentials, must have said ""OK, If I'm gonna do this streaming TV thing, you gotta get me something great."" And he's got it. Timely? Oh yeah.",/review/rw5551365/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2023,classicrun-44914,3," Good until it wasn't
","I was hooked for the first season. Yes, I had the bad guy figured out long before the ending. Nazi hunters were common thread in America for many years, many were arrested and deported and put on trial. This took all of that and fictionalized it and made it interesting. I was completely hooked for the first season. I could not wait for the second season to start. I'll admit I had my doubts because the bad guy had died so who was going to become the new bad guy? This was where it fell apart. The second season became alternative history. The hunt for Hitler was mildly interesting but over the top. When they got to the alternate history of the trial, they completely lost me. It just went in to comic fantasy. I will not be watching a third season if there is one.",/review/rw5551365/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2020,donovandesign,1," Dazzingly offensive, moronic and...boring.

1 March 2020,dougmacdonaldburr,1," God Awful!
","This is hilariously bad. It is about as realistic as Bugs Bunny without the wit or charm. They have clearly thrown a lot of money at it. The production is slick, but, who cares? How much can you polish a crap? I don't care how many pop culture references you include or punch one liners, there is nothing of substance being expressed here. It really is just 'Nazis are bad'.... Embarrassing! The worst part is they clearly think they are being clever. It is so lazy. I hate all of the main characters. I feel nothing for them. The villains make me laugh because they are so forced evil. Everyone involved in making this should be deeply ashamed, especially Al Pacino! Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro are two of the greatest actors of all time, but, it is like they have been going out of their way to ruin their legacies. To be fair the production is good. It is filmed well and has a decent soundtrack. The acting is okay given what they have to work with. The main problem is the story. It is absurdly bad. The premise had potential. Nazis have infiltrated the USA and a diverse group of heroes must hunt and kill them. I think it sounds dumb and cliche, but, I can see why other people might like it. The problem is the execution. It is so over the top. You might as well watch a children's pantomime. The dialogue make an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie look like Macbeth. It is on the boarder of being so bad it is funny and just plain annoying. Maybe if you want to hate watch something, then you might enjoy it. If you want to watch something similar that is actually good, then you might like to try The Man In The High Castle. This is TERRIBLE!!!!",/review/rw5551365/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2020,lakeshore-98711,1," Tries to be everything to everybody and fails spectacularly
","Watched four episodes last night, was looking forward to it mainly because of Pacino. Its like a marvel movie, do film directors and producers have to introduce comedy into a serious subject. Would they have made a series like this about Bin Laden and 911? why do they think this approach will work about WW2? because it doesnt work on any level. Pure drivel and I couldnt bear to watch any more of it.",/review/rw5551365/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2023,villain-16905,9," I'm no critic, don't care about the details, this is sooo entertaining.

14 March 2020,lilred1700,2," Hansel and Gretel were actually white, Christian, murderous, racists
",They lost me when they turned Hansel and Gretal into a story about two evil Christian children who murder a nice Jewish lady minding her own business so they could steal her fortune. The program is ok but certainly not great. The Characters are all completely one dimensional with the possible exception of Jonah. And while it's somewhat satisfying to imagine Nazis getting their just desserts the annoying outweighs the entertaining.,/review/rw5551365/?ref_=tt_urv
