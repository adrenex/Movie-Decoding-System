19 May 2005,sfbearcop,," Better than CSI:Miami
","Despite the fact that all three of the CSI franchise shows exaggerate the roles and scope of crime scene investigators, I enjoy them in varying degrees. As a retired cop, I've worked with CSIs on cases many times. They are mostly good, solid professionals who do their previously unsung job and help detectives solve cases. The CSIs on the CBS shows do far more than that and far more than they would be allowed to do in real police departments. I'll suspend disbelief and allow the wide dramatic license when I enjoy a TV show.",/review/rw3001166/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2006,ccthemovieman-1,," Nothing Soapy About This CSI Spin off
","When this first came on TV, the first few episodes were just too downbeat for me and I stopped watching. It didn't have the excitement and color of the Las Vegas and Miami shows.",/review/rw3001166/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2005,MuskratPower14,," Give it a chance
","When most TV shows have spinoffs, they're usually not worth watching because of thing-they are different than the original. I think that is a major reason that many fans don't like CSI:NY. While the original show is set in glamorous Las Vegas, NY is set in a much darker city, giving the show a darker tone and feel than Miami or Vegas. ",/review/rw3001166/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2005,Withnail_fan,9," Better than Miami.....
","When i learnt there was to be a second spin-off of csi, i was really looking forward to it......thankfully i was not disappointed. This show is certainly different from the original csi as we learn more about the characters but not all at once leaving some room for us to wonder about them. The acting and stories of the show are superb, Gary Sinise portrays Mac Taylor a likable character who is still dealing with the loss of his wife in 9/11, who i feel has the potential to match Grissom of the original, particularly as Petersen's contract is up in 2006. He has strong support from the rest of the cast including Melina (sorry can't spell her last name) as Stella.",/review/rw3001166/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2004,sarahz911,8," Awesome!not a photocopy
","I absolutely LOVE the original CSI. I really can't watch CSI Miami - just a bit too much. So when they announced there was a third one coming out I was skeptical. But they've out done themselves! Although the original is still my favorite, this one steps away from the CSI format a bit. There's more of a glimpse into the characters and great story lines. There isn't the condescending tone that Miami has. Gary Sinise is, of course, brilliant as usual. If they keep it up this one will stick around. Combine this one and the original and I could watch all week! No one can beat Grissom, but Taylor is certainly going to give him a run for his money. Now a combined episode would be phenomenal!",/review/rw3001166/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2006,eamon-hennedy,9," Franchise hits gold again.
","Wow, what have we done to deserve this, another fantastic series from what has shaped up to be one of the best franchise's on television, CSI:NY has everything that a good cop show needs; strong leading characters, well thought out stories and above all else, cinematic production values, like the previous two series do. That it isn't to say that the show had the best start. I'll admit to being balled over by the pilot/crossover episode during CSI:Miami's second season and I couldn't wait to see how it would transpire as a fully fledged series. Initially however, the series did have a rough start. The show just seemed too dark and gloomy and any humour seemed to sit at odds with the show's dark milieu, but things happily changed as the first season progressed and by the end of it's freshman year I would have to say that CSI:NY was truly one of the best shows on the box, more than giving its sister series a run for their money.",/review/rw3001166/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2020,kdupes-1,8," Rating should be higher
","I really liked this show. The did a great job with the cast. It's one of those groups that gel well together & you hope none of them ever leave the show.
> It's a typical detective/forensic type show involving them catching different types of murders/ serial killers, and the continuing stories of the main characters lives, etc.
> It's way funnier than you'd ever think it pull ne, it has a lot of that quick witted humor, that comes Out of the blue & makes you laugh out loud.
>> It reminds me of the show Bones. Same type of show finding the serial killers with science & cool tech gadgets, with a great cast & lots of good funny humor thrown in.
> And it's a tv show, so I'm not gonna pick it apart for being technically correct or not at every turn. Grain of salt people, if it as 100% accurate, it'd be a documentary.",/review/rw3001166/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2009,XweAponX,10," My Favourite CSI Show
","I think, of all 3 shows, this one has some style: As each CSI show has, over the last 9 years, developed a kind of personality - I like the way the graphics are done in the ""discovery"" shots (The little ""bridge"" shots that show the various CSIs working and the evidence being collected) - As Danny always says, ""Boom"".",/review/rw3001166/?ref_=tt_urv

","I actually happen to like CSI:NY. having watched some episodes of CSI(LV)I have to say it can't quite measure up to the original, but it is definitely worth watching. Gary Sinise gives his usual great performance, although sometimes it seems as though he's just bored with the proceedings.",/review/rw3001166/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10," Wonderful
","I love CSI:NY, and yes I agree that it is better than CSI:Miami. For one thing it is stylishly photographed yes some of the more graphic images may disturb but I don't mind it so much. Secondly, it is brilliantly written, with intelligent dialogue and interesting episode ideas. Thirdly, the music is a real winner for me, the theme tune is very cool, then again it's the Who, what's not to like. Fourthly, the acting is very good, Gary Sinise is a great and I think underrated actor, and he is wonderful as Mac. Melina Kanakaredes looks stunning and acts convincingly which is a major plus in my book, and Carmine Giovinazzo is appealing as Danny. Overall, I love it. 10/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw3001166/?ref_=tt_urv

","Today is the 10th anniversary of the day Melina Kanakaredes quit the show in protest because CBS and producers refused to pay her on par with Gary Sinise. But that was the fourth shot fired in the network's war on this show. The destruction of CSI:NEW YORK was assured way back in 2005 when Anthony Zuiker, kowtowing to Les Moonves, agreed to have the sets Carey Meyer designed & built destroyed for no reason whatsoever. It was here Moonves & CBS knew they could inflict whatever damage they wanted to on this show.",/review/rw3001166/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2006,Mr_Villmark,10," This one is better than Miami and L.V.
","I love the CSI series, but CSI:NY is my definite favorite. There's much more character development than in the other series. You can actually follow the characters one by one, and get to know them. It's in many ways more human. For example, in CSI:Miami, Horatio Caine is presented as an almost clairvoyant person: He walks into a crime scene, and just by looking at some blood traces, he can say: ""No, I don't think our victim went over here to call the police - he was going to warn his son who he thought was asleep. But his soon was at a party in town."" CSI:NY is much more down to ground. Not to mention, it's much more bright and colorful. Compared to L.V., where even the labs and offices are like dark tunnels, the settings and locations in N.Y. is much brighter. For me, this makes the program easier to watch.",/review/rw3001166/?ref_=tt_urv

Sinise is brilliant as Mac Taylor, a man dedicated to his work yet hurting inside since losing his wife on 9/11. Melina's just fabulous as Stella.

28 June 2005,cathyshome,," CSI clones
","While there are lots of people who do not like clones, there are many others who wait with bated breath for the next one. I and my daughter are both in this category. What I find most interesting is the variety of crimes from city to city. For example: CSI-LV has the desert/gambling/showgirls/prostitution, CSI-M has alligators/hurricanes/illegal immigrants/drug smuggling, and CSI-NY has drugs,mobs,gangs/big city over-population & ethnic diversity crammed in a small space/terrorism threats. We would most like to see a CSI-Alaska. The possibilities for totally new crimes are plentiful: poaching(polar bears,eagles,whales,fish,seals), exploration espionage(oil & gas,diamond & gold mines)/hide outs for criminals escaping mainstream cities etc. There are so many channels now that I can't see a reason for anyone to complain about shows that are on - we just choose to watch the ones we like and we choose not to watch the ones we are not interested in. Another reason my daughter and I like CSI is for the absolutely amazing camera shots of the different locations. We are both disabled and don't have the ability or finances to allow us to travel, so it is very pleasing for us to be able to see these panoramic views (especially Miami-just beautiful!!!).",/review/rw3001166/?ref_=tt_urv

","I've always watched ""CSI"". I never took a look at CSI: Miami when it came out. When ""CSI: NY"" came out, I was skeptical. But then I watched a few episodes. It is a great version of CSI! Miami is a little too much action, eh? But NY combines action with the stuff CSI has and presto! A great show is born! It will NEVER beat ""CSI"", though. However, my timer is set to record ""CSI: NY"" and ""CSI"" every Wednesday and Thursday. I absolutely love these shows! If you liked ""CSI"" and are skeptical about ""CSI: NY"" I have 2 words for you: Don't be! It is not a cheap copy just to make money, It is very good. If they keep it up, this show will be around for a while.",/review/rw3001166/?ref_=tt_urv

",Every Saturday I just c'ant Imagine missing an episode of CSI New York I just love watching CSI New York I think its a great show just like the other two but CSI{crime scene investigation}is the best the first time when i heard that they were doing CSI Miami I told my self that i was never gonna watched the shaw. But now i am totally hooked on it and i just c'ant wait for season three to air on T.V.. I think the problem with CSI new york you just have to get use to it and specially you have to give the characters a chance because i think they really are doing a great job specially you can see the way they are really working really hard to please their fans for me in the show Gary Sinise's character is really good.

19 August 2005,jmorrison-2,2," Forget it
","I continue to be amazed at shows like this, that seem to be popping up more and more. The original CSI was, for the most part, good and gripping television, with a unique look at law enforcement procedure. Whether it was necessarily realistic was a question that was easily avoided. For the most part, the original CSI stuck to the premise of evidence gathering and processing as a key factor in developing a criminal case. The bits with crime scene technicians questioning suspects while the assigned detective (who actually has investigative authority over the case) sat silently by was a little much, but didn't seem to overwhelm the overall show. That is clearly not the case with CSI:NY, nor it's sister show, CSI: Miami However, with CSI: Miami, and this show, the plots seem ridiculously contrived, and the technicians carry themselves with an overblown, overbearing authority that doesn't really seem to fit their actual role. In CSI:NY, we have a technician whose ""New Yawk"" accent has seemed to steadily increase with each succeeding episode, and also seems to come and go, with varying degrees of thickness. He has also cultivated the goateed look, probably to enhance his look of business-like toughness. We have a female technician whose prime acting ability seems to be puffing her lips out; another female technician who, in one episode, handles weapons like a deranged Rambo figure, to convince us of...what, exactly? Gary Sinise, normally an excellent actor, as a blank-faced, authority figure (the obligatory former-Marine).",/review/rw3001166/?ref_=tt_urv

","in my view,this entry in the CSI series is as good as CSI:Vegas.many of the episodes are pretty exciting.i also like the characters a lot.CSI:Vegas doesn't delve too much into the personal lives of its characters,whereas CSI:New York gives you some insight into them.plus,Gary Sinise is outstanding as the leader of the team,while i also like Melina Kanikaredes a lot.the show is much faster paced than either Vegas or Miami.each episode is exciting enough on its own that a cliffhanger episode isn't necessary at the end of the season.this approach is different from Vegas(Miami,i'm not to sure about,as i don't think i've watched a full season).i prefer this approach.that way,you don't have to deal with the unbearable suspense until the next season comes out.for me,CSI:NY is a 10/10",/review/rw3001166/?ref_=tt_urv

1 August 2011,PartialMovieViewer,," I Digress a Lot - Sorry
","Excellent cast, very good directing and well written. Like most detective shows, not only is there a weekly storybut one is always dragged into the ever-obvious undertow of the 'soap-type' REAL story. Eh – I am too old and my attention span really sucks to have any interest in some sneaky ongoing tale. You know the ones I am talking about. You are watching a really, really good show – OK? And of course you think this is the last scene of the last show of the season. It has to beeveryone is chuckling and slapping each other on the back yelling, 'good job', or 'nice shot', or 'you deserve a raise.' Of course we fade to the last commercial – oh wait – it is not the last commercial. The show is still on and then Kate gets shot right between the eyesworst thing that ever happened in a show. OOPSwrong show. I have a hard time getting over that scenebroke my heart. Sorry about such a terrible digression, and amazingly, this has nothing to do with CSI New York. I liked this show the first time I saw it. I immediately became a true-blue fan. Mix some Gary Sinise with a dab of NY and a splash of a super castall supported superbly by excellent directing and super writinghow can you go wrong?",/review/rw3001166/?ref_=tt_urv
