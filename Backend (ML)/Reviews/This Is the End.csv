5 September 2014,grainstorms,9," The Daughters of Jane Tennison
","At a time when it seems that every TV detective program offers over- the-top-heroics, impossibly good-looking characters, exaggerated Sherlock Holmesian deductions, and smug repartee, this British production comes as a wonderful surprise -- a superbly acted cop show, portraying tough, wise investigators picking through the detritus and debris of human life and trying to keep it all together until the end of their shift.

10 December 2012,HillstreetBunz,10," Reality bites
","I was a detective in a Northern force and this show truly captures the atmosphere of the team, the work, the passions, the characters and the full gamut of human life that you are forced to confront. Great to see such real women characters leading the show, all 3 leads are almost too lifelike, these are women I've known. It may still be mostly a mans world, but these women really are out there. Two criticisms, the only flaw in the real life tapestry, the absence of the other policewomen that make it hard or this kind..... And why does it have such an unimaginative title, especially when it's really about three omen not two! Don't miss the best of British.....",/review/rw3143836/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2013,fung0,8," Quirky, Worthwhile Cop-Soaper
","If you know Sally Wainwright's writing, this will be familiar stuff. Scott & Bailey follows the various relationships within a police team, focusing on two women, one mature and stable, the other young, talented and often unable to control her personal life. Their boss, another woman (amazingly enough) is tough, sharp and also not without her own personal issues.",/review/rw3143836/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2015,bjarias,9," .. it really does not get much better.. bravo to all involved.
","Cop dramas have a great tendency to follow a formula script, and as a result after several seasons usually become tedious and boring, and audiences continue watching them mostly out of habit. Scott & Bailey is the huge exception to the rule, and I'm positive that those knowing just how good a program this is they're watching, want it to continue on indefinitely. There's actor after actor in this marvelous series that consistently do outstanding work.. and for it all to end, well, would just be criminal. It's one of the ironies that when it looks so easy, an enormous amount of talent and effort on all sides make it appear that way. All involved are producing top flight work, and deserve all the accolades they get. I watched Doctor Foster and that turned me on to one of the leads in this series... soooo glad I did. The final season was short.. and once again extremely good. Know they wished to go out 'on-a-high'.. but this is another series that will be sorely missed.",/review/rw3143836/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2011,bbgon,10," Loved it!
","I couldn't stop until I've watched all 6 episodes in a row. Suranne Jones and Lesley Sharp give a brilliant performance alongside the other cast. I loved that it's one of a few stories set from women's point of view, dealing with the professional and personal issues. I think we should have more of that. I can't judge if the work of police was shown true to life, but it definitely seemed more realistic than the 'bang-bang-case solved!' sort of shows. Scott and Bailey has cross-cutting plot lines, which also makes it more interesting to watch. I want to also point out the beautiful camera work. I hope for the next season!",/review/rw3143836/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2012,ginamalke,8," Superb female copper drama
","I have seen only two episodes so far of season 1, but already it looks like this female detectives duo is the among the best, definitely the best of the season. The chaotic private lives of DI's Janet Scott and Rachel Bailey and the solving of the cases are presented in a perfect mix. An especially good point: we are off dead bodies and CSI-like gore (at least for the first two episodes). They still exist, of course, but off-screen. The details are related to us in indirect ways, through the cops' case meetings, the questioning of suspects, conversations in cars, and walk-with-me talks. What we do see instead are the consequences of the crimes committed: We see them in the faces of wonderful hugely talented actors that fill even the tiniest role. It makes up more than enough for the only grievance I have: spoiled by the lavish period production of Inspector George Gently I was hoping to see more of the Yorkshire landscape.",/review/rw3143836/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2012,actor-15,10," One of the Best Cop Shows Ever!
","I don't know what others are watching but I'm an actor and I watch a lot of TV and Films (and have been in a lot as well) and this show which my wife and I just finished watching was amazing! Powerful women doing wonderful things without making a big deal out of gender is almost impossible to pull off and almost never happens in American TV. This is what Rizzoli and Isles could have been if they didn't have all the ""funny"" stuff and if they let their characters be true to themselves. This is what the Closer was at its best but finally I found the writing and the directing and the acting so much better in Scott and Bailey than well any other show of its type on TV on either side of the pond. Get a region free DVD and buy this series and tell me I'm not right. The relationships are sharp (better than Blue Murder which is also a good series) and the stories are valid and dark and the humor works cause it is not forced. The only Detective show I like better at the moment is Luther and it is not quite as good an ensemble show as this one. 10 stars easily",/review/rw3143836/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2011,hjs7777,9," V. Good
","Scott and Bailey's first episode was actually rather superb! OK so it was a little predictable but the banter between all of the characters and the clever questioning by Rachel Bailey at the end made this an enjoyable cop drama. To be fair, this series has a lot to live up to - it has a likable cast and its home, ITV, have a reputation for writing some very interesting and good detective dramas such as Morse, Lewis, Vera,Midsomer Murders and Law and Order:UK and, in my opinion, it continues ITV's success at writing and presenting detective dramas. I have a feeling that Scott and Bailey will continue to improve as the weeks go by...",/review/rw3143836/?ref_=tt_urv

15 July 2013,cutch74,10," wow
","I am thrilled I stumbled upon the first series and episode on PBS! Its heads above any crime drama here in the States. I'm not sure I love it so much because the title characters are women and the boss is also a woman, but it helps! Can't wait until the 3rd series! Hope to see it on my PBS station nit long after it airs in the UK. I've been an avid watcher of shows from Britain. I do not really watch much of shows here. Crime dramas in the US are full of violence, blood and just seem to be going for the shock factor, no substance. Granted Scott and Bailey had their fair share of some blood, but necessary to the plot. Inspector Lewis, Poirot, Wallander, and Morse focus on the process not the gore. I beg of you to allow our PBS channels get the next set of episodes as quickly as possible! Thank you",/review/rw3143836/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2015,reggie-at-random,7," Consistently Unique
","Series 1-3 repeatedly delivers unique and intriguing plots in a very realistic fashion. Balancing the domestic with the professional challenges for each partner. Series 4 seems to prove that the character Rachel can never keep her personal life clear of her job which is a bit tiresome. Even so, it's a good series and reveals some interesting insights into other issues of family relationships that are switched about and from a female perspective. Overall, it beats the violent smash, shoot and blow up copper routines so beloved by all the male dominated production teams. This series at least gives you something to think about.",/review/rw3143836/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2018,rsapygmies,5," An ok show
","I started watching and thought well, maybe. However, I liked the crimes and how they were checked and got convictions. BUT the Rachel character got on my nerves with her neuroses. How they even thought she was doing ok as Sergeant is beyond me because she was petty, spiteful and mostly out of control. Loved Janet and wished I had such self control and most favorite was Gill.",/review/rw3143836/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2018,hughdavey,4," Not as good as most Brit detective shows
","I like Brit and Australian crime shows as they're usually much better than American fare. I had high hopes for this one but I just can't suspend my disbelief long enough to enjoy it. Rachael seems somewhat unbalanced and, in my opinion, not fit for police duty. The male characters are written as low-lives or idiots, with their catting around, lying and just plain abuse of women. The main female characters have their affairs too, but they're sympathetic figures and therefore not really cheating. 
It's like an old afternoon soap opera with a crime or 2 thrown in. It should appeal to the 'Men Are Scum Wing' of radical feminism.",/review/rw3143836/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2016,consultinggroupusa,6," OK detective series from UK with way too many family issues
","I enjoy watching detective series from the UK, Australia and New Zealand to avoid all the melodrama that the majority of USA detective series feel they have to add to make the show watchable. I always though that these countries contribution to the detective genre involved great detecting techniques and cops that were very capable of working out the evidence in a case (Luther, Shetland, The Fall, River, DCI Banks, Inspector Morris, Inspector George Gently, Prime Suspect, Death in Paradise, Foyle's War Endeavor, Inspector Lewis, Hinterland, Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries, Brokenwood Mysteries, etc.).

9 November 2014,lorriebeauchamp,7," Gender Bender
","Just binge-watched this show on Netflix, and loved how well it dealt with relationships on and off the job - certainly the Bailey character stretches the limits of credibility, but for some reason, it works, and by the end of Series 3, you find yourself rooting for her, hoping that she works out the dysfunctional kinks in her personality.

23 June 2021,imdb-04964,8," Should be Retitled ""DCI Gill Murray""
","Solid, standard British detective show. Great to see strong female leads in a male dominated field. Amelia Bullmore as DCI Gill Murray is the standout scene stealer. Simply outstanding. The title characters are good, at times over acted. Story lines a bit unbelievable - hard to see why so many men would be obsessed with these two.",/review/rw3143836/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2018,baroncoco,3," JUST TOO MANY PROBLEMS, including the MAIN CHARACTERS
","Only one good character, their DCI, but the rest? Just bland pretend-racy cliches, with a drunk and a wanna-be-good mom paired up. So of course, it got more seasons than much better shows. In the US, it would be 1990s eight o'clock fare; and now, just bad melodrama with crime. AND HOW MANY SERIAL KILLERS DOES BRITAIN HAVE, ANYWAY??!!",/review/rw3143836/?ref_=tt_urv

2 August 2020,jestak,9," Definitely a good show
","As was said before in a couple of reviews...not one admirable male character. Not even close. They are almost all nasty, mean, stupid or useless. One or two very minor males are okay, but still very stilted. I enjoyed the writing and the acting, just the anti-male thing is off-putting.

","Sally Wainwright creates and delivers an outstanding episodic series well worth your time. The series is an excellent crime drama that will have you intertwined in the characters personal lives - and, you will love it. Suranne Jones and Lesley Sharp are superb as the title characters and give praise-worthy performances. Scene-stealers Amelia Bullmore, Tracie Bennett, and Nicola Walker are outstanding and not enough can be said about their remarkable performances.",/review/rw3143836/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2020,geordiesdad,5," What a WASTE of talent
","What a shame this 'police' drama had to go the way of MOST American police dramas of the 2000's.....
We can't be permitted to see women as competent police officers...they are portrayed either as man-bashing dykes FAR superior to any male detective on the force or they are continually MIRED in emotional and cloying sexual tension between themselves and at least 1 ( rotating ) male member.\
This one, SADLY, follows the all-too-familiar pattern and at least 20% of every episode is filled with sexual tension between the women and.....pick someone...fellow officers, other women, ex boyfriends, ex husbands, children....and the sad list goes on.
Potentially a good story lies somewhere beneath the sad personal dramas they bring to the office but it's hard to see the trees for the forest of sex and sadness.
If you want a soap opera....have at it but it you dreamed it might be a real police story....dream on.",/review/rw3143836/?ref_=tt_urv

7 February 2014,ianlouisiana,9," A story of friendship between two women who happen to be coppers
","But they could be supermarket workers or computer operators and the dynamic would be the same,just rather less bloody,I guess. They watch each other's back,slate each other's men and get drunk together - because it's what friends do. In the police environment both are empowered and use their position to advantage themselves on occasions,and that's what real coppers do,even female ones,because they are only like the rest of us except they can stop us doing what we want to and make us do what we don't want to. It's part of the contract we have with them.The other part is they help us when we need them,and this also is what Scott and Bailey do.Perhaps rather more than supermarket workers and computer operators. They are surrounded by men none of whom are worthy of lacing their shoes,some of whom may well be incapable of lacing their own shoes as it happens. Neither Scott nor Bailey is an angel.Both they are both profoundly human with all our frailties(and Bailey has added frailties,I must say). Because of that ""Scott and Bailey"" is compelling television.",/review/rw3143836/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2014,robertabaldwinteam,10," Compelling Police Drama with Amazing Back Stories
","Wow! Discovered this Brit series by chance and got hooked immediately. Characters are written with depth and honesty, their private lives brimming with challenges and uncertainty, while the major cases they explore are are also pretty fascinating. Of course, the acting is terrific. Scott (Lesley Sharp) and Bailey (Suranne Jones) are an unlikely but compelling duo, one a dutiful wife and mother; the other single and screwed up. Their back stories are no less than riveting. Casting across the board is seductively brilliant, including, in recurring roles, Amelia Bullmore as SCI Murray, the detective in charge; Nicholas Gleaves, as another detective in the squad; and Rupert Graves as a sexy barrister who nearly destroys Bailey's career. By the time you get to episode 5 or 6 in the first season, you start worrying that there are only 3 more seasons to go in this wonderfully satisfying drama.",/review/rw3143836/?ref_=tt_urv
