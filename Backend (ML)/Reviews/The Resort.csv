","Launched in the winter of 2022 to rather disappointing ratings, I was alerted to 'The Traitors' by how many viewers were describing it with words like 'addictive' and 'absorbing'. After viewing the first episode, it was obvious that the show would be a sure fire massive hit. The series has continued to be startlingly fascinating, entertaining viewing and unquestionably my favourite newly launched show of the year.",/review/rw8742845/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2022,pob_22,9," Addictive viewing!
","This is reality television with a twist! Most reality shows choose extreme personalities, pit them against each other in mild challenges, surfacing drama from the close proximity of big egos. The Traitors picks relatively normal people and pits them against each other in brutal fashion. The ensuing drama is a result of natural paranoia!",/review/rw8742845/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2022,gazjames-32169,10," Full of suspense
","What a show. Love it. Full of action and psychological play
The worst bit wierdly is missions for the money which to me has no impact at all.",/review/rw8742845/?ref_=tt_urv

22 December 2022,jennidavis64,10," Totally and utterly addictive!
","I only watched this programme to start with as I love Claudia Winkleman! I bet she had a whale of a time making it and inflicting/encouraging such cruelty! Ha ha... I am not usually a big fan of reality shows but this sounded refreshingly different. I was totally hooked from the very first one and couldn't miss a single episode! I love everything about it... the tasks, the scary round table, the armoury, and the conspiring followed by the murders! So many twists and turns too... A very good selection of totally different characters made it compulsive viewing... interesting to see how they change towards each other throughout the days!... they had better make a series 2!!",/review/rw8742845/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2022,dkmsaegd,10," Never been so gripped by terrestrial tv
","Just an amazing emotional experiment into human behaviour. Loved every single second of this. By the end of the series I felt like I personally knew all of the remaining contestants. I hated the 4 day gap over the weekend waiting for the next set of episodes. I thought the challenges were really high quality. It can't be easy to set physical challenges that are appropriate for such a diverse set of contestants, but somehow the BBC have done it. Just a phenomenal pre-Christmas viewing experience. I really hope this gets renewed for a second serious. Claudia Winkelman was great. Clearly moved by the final results.",/review/rw8742845/?ref_=tt_urv

23 December 2022,chazzer-43886,9," Nail-biting psychological chaos.
","Deception, betrayal, treachery: this reality TV programme has it all. The mental madness inside both the players and the viewers is exilerating. You as a observer are constantly on the edge of your seat wondering weather the players have made the right decision, rooting for the traitors and at the same time hoping the faithful banish correctly.",/review/rw8742845/?ref_=tt_urv

10 December 2022,kpassa,1," Painful To Watch
","My wife's friend has a child working for the production company so I have to sit in and watch this drivel. The premise with Claudia Winkleman leading a bunch of wannabee TV celebrities in a murder mystery reality series sounded good enough but the reality of this reality show is that everyone is trying so hard to be over the top in their emotional responses to the most mundane of situations that it is beyond farcical. I have watched 5 episodes so far and their reactions to stress would make a room full of nursery children seem calm and rational by comparison. It would be funny if it didn't look so forced and phony. I guess you're supposed to throw in with a few of the contestants but they are all so unlikable that I just sit there no caring who gets murdered, banished or stays. I have read that Claudia Winkleman is now the highest paid performer on British television. Unfortunately she's more like McDonald's than Shakespeare: massive quantities but rubbish quality. She must be crying all the way to the bank. As for me, I just have to grin, bear it and pray for it to end.",/review/rw8742845/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2023,Lejink,1," And Then There Were...
","This new BBC reality TV show has been a big success with viewers for those who like that kind of thing. Perhaps cashing in on the current television and cinema fads for whodunits, it takes nearly two dozen members of the public, although in truth a fair number of them seem to be performers of some type, at least two are actors, another is a comedian, to a remote, luxurious Scottish castle along with gloomy presenter Claudia Winkleman.",/review/rw8742845/?ref_=tt_urv

","I found this to be one of the best shows of recent years, genuinely gripping. To me it's similar to the likes of Golden Balls with Jasper Carrott. It's all about having a poker face, steady nerves and taking chances.",/review/rw8742845/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have literally just binge watched the whole 12 episodes in a day and a half! There NEEDS to be a 2nd series. I found this show on a whim on bbc I player and I can not even express how happy I am to have found this! From the first 10 minutes of the first episode, I knew that this was going to be a brilliant show. I was completely gripped and enticed the whole way through. This is going to be the best show on telly if there is a second series, and let me tell you, I will 100% be watching it. Best tv show I have ever watched!! It has to be a 10/10 couldn't have wrote it better!!!! Adore this show.",/review/rw8742845/?ref_=tt_urv

",As the interaction between the 'players' is the most interesting part of the game the game element where cash is earned doesn't really gel (I often just fast forward that bit) I think the producers just thought they had to have something interesting/exciting/outdoors cos it's Scotland.,/review/rw8742845/?ref_=tt_urv

","As a family we're not big reality tv fans. And as a basically decent human being I don't enjoy watching 'social experiments' which aim to pit people against each other and cause hurt and upset, which is precisely what this show does.",/review/rw8742845/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2022,colinhackett,1," It went from a 10 to a 1
","So this show has had me gripped for several weeks now it has been an amazing program to watch. The concept of the game is amazing, the creators are unbelievably talented people to come up with a gameshow as good as this. It pits normal people against each other for cash prizes, what better way for drama, however the last episode left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. All throughout the previous episodes no one has been allowed to (probably by the producers of the show) say anything remotely revealing so as to obviously give away the identity of any of the other players. Amanda said nothing when Will voted her off. But blow me, the final had Kieron say what he said to Will was totally unforgivable and should not have been allowed. And how contradictory was Hannah, she believed absolutely everything that Will said throughout the entire show but turned on him in a flash because of that single comment. It completely spoilt the ending of the show. It wasn't in keeping with the spirit of the rest of the game and the players. Will had played the game of his life and deserved the win over all of them.",/review/rw8742845/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2022,TheRealSylar,7," Great idea same old flaws
","So it's a great concept, put a group of strangers in a stately home and get them to do tasks for money. One group are faithfuls so they feel all self righteous while some are forced to be traitors. The traitors need to carefully murder people in the night without being suspected as a traitor. This is done by a nightly meeting/witch-hunt around a table every evening. There are two flaws and these are traditional to most games like this. Firstly there's the hated protections the producers put in to fix the results. This works by letting everyone be eliminated as per the format and then one person gets singled out who can't be allowed to be subjected to these rules. It's been used in everything from X factor to Big Brother, but suddenly turns a fair and fun competition into an absolute farce. Producers should not interfere, it doesn't add drama it just makes the program into a fix. Maybe the person in question is likeable/hateable maybe they are an actor the show bought in and can't be eliminated because they are being fed information by the producers. Either way, it should stop. Have confidence in the cast delivering the format to the rules. Second fault is similar to the first, a good idea was to add the option of seduction to the traitors this increases the chance of the traitors winning if someone joins. It's not a fault but giving people the choice was never going to work as the traitors are hated by the pious faithfuls. So by having the choice they are naturally going to refuse, so why allow them the choice, again it probably goes back to the original flaw. The fact that they have recruited an actor who is being paid to be faithful and influence the group according to the producers decisions.",/review/rw8742845/?ref_=tt_urv
