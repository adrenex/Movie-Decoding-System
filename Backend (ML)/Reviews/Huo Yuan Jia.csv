30 May 2015,hitchcockthelegend,7," Brothers In Arms.
","Albert and Allen Hughes direct, produce and co-write (with Michael Henry Brown) this tale about Anthony Curtis (Larenz Tate), a South Bronx boy who goes off to fight in Vietnam, to then return after his tours of duty to find things just aren't the same anymore. The follow up to their incendiary debut, Menace II Society, the Hughes brothers deliver another in your face picture that is quite frankly on a perpetual downer. This is no bad thing, though, as long as you are not looking to be cheered up.",/review/rw7179995/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2002,Special-K88,," delivers big for the right fans
","Gripping, poignant story about a young black man growing up in the 1960s Bronx whose parents groom him to follow in the footsteps of his college grad older brother. He has his own plans however, and enlists in the Marine Corps where he survives four years of brutal warfare in Vietnam. He returns home to try and make a new life for himself, but a struggling economy and lack of formal education gradually draw him into a life of crime. An effective portrayal of black involvement in Vietnam, with good performances, powerful scenes, and shockingly graphic violence. Tate is commanding in the lead, and Tucker a real surprise as his drug-addicted pal. Not for all tastes, but well-crafted and well-made. ***",/review/rw7179995/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Dead Presidents"" is a classic in my book. I could suffice with that statement but I'll add a bit more. It was a well acted and well directed drama that seemed to be funny when it needed to be (thank you Chris Tucker), dramatic when it needed to be, and even violent when it needed to be. Some of, if not most of the violence was pretty graphic--that can be taken as a positive or negative. I'm not perturbed by it, but I can see how some are.",/review/rw7179995/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2005,Johnny0581,9," Great movie
","I really enjoyed this movie. Everyone in it did an excellent job and it was very gripping. It keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. Larenz Tate, in his best role ever, plays Anthony Curtis, a young black man from late 1960's The Bronx, who is just a regular guy who hangs out with his friends played by Chris Tucker also in his best role ever as Skip, and Freddy Rodriguez as Jose. Shortly after graduation from high school, Anthony decides he doesn't want to follow his big brother's path of going to college but instead, joining the Marine Corps and fight for his country. Shortly thereafter, we are taken to Vietnam with the boys and we meet some other interesting characters, one of them a psychotic preacher, Cleon, played by Bokeem Woodbine,and the Vietnam sequences are executed very realistically and are very bloody. After a while, we are taken back to the boogie down Bronx, where Anthony upon returning to the old neighborhood after four years,realizes that things are even worse than before, and everyone, including his pre-Vietnam girlfriend, Juanita, all have taken their lives in a different direction. Anthony is now a father, and cannot find a job anywhere and realizes that his own country has turned his back on him and many young black veterans from 'Nam, including his old boys Skip and Jose. We also meet Kirby, played by Keith David, a once cold and ruthless hustler, who has now left the life because the corruption of the city has forced him to quit his old habits, and Juanita's sister Delilah, played by N'Bushe Wright, who is an activist with the Black Panthers. Pretty soon all of these characters, save Juanita, fed up with their lives and their situation, get together to plan a stickup on an armored truck that is making a pickup of old dollar bills and is taking them to a location in Washington to burn them. The stickup sequence is very well made, but of course, bloody. This movie is filled with great performances, the best coming from Larenz Tate, Bokeem Woodbine and Keith David, heart-pounding action and good dialogue. A Hughes Brothers' classic. 9.5 out of 10.",/review/rw7179995/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2004,gator1110,10," Great Movie
","This was a great movie, and I think it was overlooked. It is one my favorites due to the unique storytelling and action. This movie is way better than 90% of the crap that comes out today. The acting is also superb, and I think it Chris Tucker's greatest performance. Even though the story has a lot of action, it's very believable, which is hard to do in Hollywood. For those who haven't seen this movie I suggest you go and rent it now, it's a modern day classic. Sit back and be prepared to watch a great moment in filmaking. It's definitely underrated. I think if it was promoted better it might have done better, especially since most war movies do well.",/review/rw7179995/?ref_=tt_urv

19 June 2001,martymaster,," A strong movie about life for a black man after the Vietnam war
","For all those who liked the movie ""Menace 2 Society"",you are going to love this one. This movie features the star from Menace to Society ""Larenz Tate"" and the well known ""Chris Tucker"". This is a very violent movie and have a few very gory scenes of the Vietnam war,but that is okay because this movie really shows how difficult it must have been for a black man growing up in the Bronx in the 60's.And it shows how life is for him and his friends after coming home from the Vietnam war. The language in this movie is of course very tough and rough and I could actually count the f-word 247 times in this movie and that speaks for it's self.",/review/rw7179995/?ref_=tt_urv

20 February 2002,d3ei,7," great (esp.Tucker)
","Chris Tucker is hilarious in this movie, he has great on screen charisma, and he speaks his lines very fluidly, as if he was improvising. Larenz Tate is great as well, being able to pull off the young version of his character, since he has a boyish face.  And Bokeem Woodbine reminds me of Samuel L. Jackson in this movie.  The cinematography is also great and so is the acting overall.  Like everyone says, its not so much as a heist movie, but a reflection on the hardships of the black individual, such as finding work and drug abuse; after fighting a war that wasnt really meant for them or their country.",/review/rw7179995/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2003,isitwewin5,6," An abridged, urbanized version of ""The Deer Hunter""
","The Hughes Brothers tried to play up the same angle with ""Dead Presidents"" as Micheal Cimino and Louis Garfinkle did with ""The Deer Hunter"" by portraying the social effects that the Vietnam war had on its young veterans.  And for a while, it seemed as though they were quite successful. But in the end, it became apparent why ""The Dead Presidents"" fell short of the Academy recognition that ""The Deer Hunter"" won.",/review/rw7179995/?ref_=tt_urv

If you like in to deep, set it off or boys in the hood then you will absolutely love it. Only movie I watch more often is poetic justice and new jack city.

17 November 2008,johnnyboyz,7," Never clear cut in its genre but definitely clear cut in its study, Dead Presidents is an interesting and tragic tale of desperation following Vietnam.
","Dead Presidents hammers home its point in its final scene, a quite brilliant and excruciating in its execution scene in the sense we may want these characters to get away with what they're doing. The scene is a heist, created between a handful of people who have come to know each other through the years and we have come to understand their predicaments. The finale sums up the sad, sad desperation some of the characters have had to resort to given their life and what has happened to them and captures how hard the times get when they get hard in the first place.",/review/rw7179995/?ref_=tt_urv

6 September 2020,lukem-52760,8," ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT AS GOOD AS ANYTHING TARANTINO OR SCORSESE HAS DONE!!!
","The 2nd movie of the Awesome Hughes bro's after their smash hit instant Classic MENACE 2 SOCIETY, this movie is truly a masterful piece of Cinema, it's part Urban Drama, part War film & part Heist Thriller all crafted around being a period piece. We get the swinging soulful 1960's explored & the very gritty, bleak & dark 1970's explored through the streets of Brooklyn as we follow our main lead, the excellent baby-faced LARENZE TATE, who blasted his way on to the screen in the hood Classic Menace 2 Society, here he's cast as the lead & gives another excellent performance, he goes to Vietnam & becomes a good soldier & a good man but when he gets back his old neighbourhood is a struggling bleak place, the facts of a black man returning home to nothing is all harsh in it's reality of the time, there's a mean streak of realism throughout the film just like Menace, they fought a war for America that they didn't want to & came back disturbed & with nothing!!!
This is a fantastic character study too as we witness the main group of friends start to fall apart after returning home from Nam such as Chris Tucker & Freddie Rodriguez who both give superb performances as does the whole incredible cast with Keith David (Platoon, They Live) & Terrance Howard (Hustle & Flow, Iron-man) & of Course as mentioned, Chris Tucker (Friday, Jackie Brown) & Freddie Rodriguez (Harsh Times, Planet Terror) & Bokeem Woodbine (Riddick, The Rock) all these make a great ensemble cast & interesting characters.",/review/rw7179995/?ref_=tt_urv

2 October 2005,Hang_All_Drunkdrivers,7," Pretty good show but i didn't like the ending
",Larenz Tate does a great job in this movie about young blacks in the 60s and 70s. He spends a few years in Vietnam and then comes home to a dead-end life and takes part in an armed robbery that sends him to prison at the end. That's the part i didn't like. In the courtroom he goes berzerk when the judge gives him 15 to life but hell - several people were killed in the robbery including a cop! I thought he'd be executed and was surprised at the light sentence and dumbfounded when his character objected to the severity.,/review/rw7179995/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2006,Li_85,10," Great Underrated Powerful Movie
","I did not expect much from Dead Presidents when i saw it on my video shop. The cover doesn't look great and i haven't heard of this film. I enjoyed Menace to society, Boyz N the hood and juice. But After these releases there hasn't been any great Black (Hood) Crime movies. There have been so many disgraceful movies that star some rapper used to promote the movies. I gave Dead Presidents a chance, and I'm glad i did. This was a Masterpiece, directed by Hughes Brothers after Hit movie Menace 2 Society. The Hughes Brothers impress once again. Starring highly underrated actor Larenz tate in a powerful, Superb performance. Alongside Chris Tucker in a supporting role. This is a Great Action movie, with some serious situations.",/review/rw7179995/?ref_=tt_urv

30 April 2001,stamper,7," Dead Presidents? Where???
","I really do not know what to make of this movie. I do not even understand it's title (maybe it is because I'm European). Anyway this is not a bad movie. It is about a black man and how his life is affected by the time he lives in and the choices he made. It's about a man who could have gone to college but goes to fight in the Vietnam War (a white man's war) and his experiences in that war and after that war. Somehow this does not sound bad right? But it is not good my friends. I really could not get into the story and the characters (maybe that's my fault) But one thing I really missed here was suspense, well worked out characters and stuff. All this film had was a lot of blood. Not recommended if you want to see a good film about war. I was a bit entertained though by lots of blood and some gory stuff I've never seen before.",/review/rw7179995/?ref_=tt_urv

14 May 2000,fred-83,," pretentious and dead serious
","This movie starts out pretty ok, but unfortunately descends into predictable, pretentious and dead serious melodrama after the Vietnam sequences. The best parts are the bloodletting parts and a nightmare sequence. SPOILER! In the end it falls apart completely, the believability being thrown out the window. Seems to me that the preacher-character had a pretty good life, so what was his motivation for joining the heist? And subtle the dialogue is not. One can appreciate the message though, but it could have been handled less obviously and with more finesse.",/review/rw7179995/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2006,nihao,," Déja-Vu Festival
","This movie jumps from one movie-cliché to another. Even a half-hearted movie buff can't avoid wincing at the amount of 'déja-vu' moments the Hughes Bros. chuck at you... There's Scorsese 'moments' galore (even DeNiro film-debut re-makes), and ideas from Lynch's ""Wild at Heart"" are randomly (and stupidly) used here and there. Oliver Stone is ransacked in the Vietnam sequences, as is Coppola (in sloppy ""Apocalypse Now"" re-creations). In fact all is told in such a heavy-handed,un-intelligent way, that the viewer is 'turned off' pretty quickly. No one likes to be treated like a moron, least of all a movie-buff... So who was this movie made for? Audiences who have never seen the seminal movies of the last 25 years? Oh! It was a surprise to see the excellent Martin Sheen in the un-billed role of a heartless war-vet judge. At least he managed to avoid being hit by a flying chair. I sat through this and wished I had avoided this graceless BOMB!",/review/rw7179995/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2021,kevin_robbins,10," This is an all time great movie that is a must see
","Dead Presidents (1995) is currently available on Tubi. The storyline follows childhood friends as they wrap up high school and join the military during the Vietnam War. When they return home they find life has been turned upside down. Friends, family, girlfriends and children have all changed within their standing in the neighborhood and they have to find new ways to survive...when surviving becomes more and more challenging, the friends decide to use their skillsets learned in the war to make a living. This movie is directed by Albert & Allen Hughes (Menace II Society) and stars Larenz Tate (Menace II Society), Chris Tucker (Rush Hour), Keith David (Requiem for a Dream), Freddy Rodríguez (Planet Terror) and Terrence Howard (Hustle & Flow). The storyline from beginning to end is perfect. Every character's backstory, characteristics and dialogue was excellent. This film also does a great job of showing the challenges of returning from war and adapting to society. The cinematography is so clever and well done, especially for attacking multiple settings the way it did - tough urban life and impossible war scenarios. The movie is aided by one of the best soundtracks in cinematic history. The conclusion is so heart felt and dramatic. Overall this is an all time great movie that is a must see and easy 10/10.",/review/rw7179995/?ref_=tt_urv
