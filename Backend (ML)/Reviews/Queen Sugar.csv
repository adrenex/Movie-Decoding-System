7 December 2002,Buddy-51,," gripping performance by Hayek
","Salma Hayek (uni-brow and all) gives a genuinely great performance as `Frida,' the Mexican artist who is more famous, perhaps, as the wife of Diego Rivera than as a painter in her own right - although Rivera himself always insisted that it was Frida who had the greater talent.",/review/rw3182573/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2005,ma-cortes,7," Splendid movie about two excellent Mexican painters and their troublesome relationship
","The movie deals with the biography of Frida Kalho (well performed by Salma Hayek , though Laura San Giacomo was originally set to play her but was dropped when fans objected to a non-Mexican playing the role) who after a terrible accident with a trolley causes herself a crippling injury , then she gets away from her parents (Roger Rees and Patricia Spinola) to live on the paintings . She falls in love with famed muralist Diego Rivera (Alfred Molina , he gained 50 lbs , 23 kg , for this character) who bears a separated marriage (to Valeria Golino) . Later on , Frida is wedded to Diego and the troubles come out .",/review/rw3182573/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2020,aciessi,8," Her Story.
","Frida is a biopic, as decadent and beautiful as the art of Frida Kahlo. I can't imagine how you could make it any other way. Yes, we follow Frida through her dysfunctional and broken relationship with both Diego Rivera and the international socialist movement. But the way this story is told is key. The editing and cinematography pays enormous tribute to Frida's paintings and the genre of art that she represents. Salma Hayek is tremendous as Frida. Alfred Molina is tremendous as Diego. It's thoroughly exquisite.",/review/rw3182573/?ref_=tt_urv

4 April 2005,smoothhoney1265,," Outstanding!
","Usually, when you see a biopic about a famous artist and genius you either get to see a tragic, suffering creature or an idealized God. And often it's always the same: He/she was born, had a difficult childhood, created some masterpieces, had some affairs (usually with actors/actresses or/and musicians) and dies a sad and lonely death. But what a refreshing difference ""Frida"" was! Frida Kahlo's life was more suffering than joy, yet the movie does not pity her all the time but shows Frida's lust for life, love, art and her husband Diegor Riviera.",/review/rw3182573/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2002,EmperorNortonII,8," ¡Viva Frida!
","""Frida"" is a beautifully done biopic about Mexican artist and icon Frida Kahlo.  Salma Hayek plays this role very well.  She exhibits all the passion that goes into being an artist, especially when playing off Alfred Molina, who plays Diego Rivera, husband of Frida Kahlo, and a famous Mexican artist in his own right.  What really impressed me was the artistic references in the movie.  I loved seeing the paintings coming to life!  I also liked the surreal animated sequences, particularly the hospital nightmare, populated with Day of the Dead-style skeletons.  Few movies have ever made me regard them as a work of art.  ""Frida"" is definitely one of them!",/review/rw3182573/?ref_=tt_urv

","It wouldn't matter what you might show or say - people who have taken a liking to an 'artist' or their particular 'style' will defend them regardless. So it probably is with Frida Kahlo and Diago Rivera. Every country must have its acclaimed legends good or bad - the USA with Pollock and Warhol, Spain with Picasso and so it goes - it's the law of economics and superiority, etc...Oh, not to mention art....",/review/rw3182573/?ref_=tt_urv

24 February 2004,claudio_carvalho,8," The Story of a Great Mexican Artist, With a Stunning Performance of Salma Hayek
","Frida Kahlo (Salma Hayek) is an tempestuous teenager, when  she suffers a bus accident in Mexico. Her column and leg have multiples fractures and she is impaled by a metal bar. Her father and mother spend all the money they have in surgeries and treatments, and in the end, also due to her will and strength, she walks again. Frida shows her paintings to the famous painter, intellectual and communist Diego Rivera (Alfred Molina) to criticize them. He finds them excellent and they become friend, lovers and get married to each other. Diego is very unfaithful to her and has many night stands with his models, but when he has an affair with Frida's sister Cristina, their marriage ends and they divorce. In the 30's, Leon Trotsky (Geoffrey Rush) gets political asylum in Mexico and is lodged with his wife in the house of Frida's parents. Frida and Trotsky have an affair, when Trotsky's wife ask him to move to another place. Rivera moves to USA and Frida has a gangrene in her toes. They are amputated and Frida gets worse and worse, using pain killers, steel jackets and other treatment. But she starts painting maybe her best pictures. Rivera comes back to Frida and gets married with her for the second time, and stays with her until her death. The story of this Mexican artist is wonderfully presented in this movie, with a stunning performance of Salma Hayek. Frida is showed as a great artist, revolutionary human being, having a great sexuality, feeling pain due to her accident, but having a great pleasure in life. All the cast and the direction are excellent. The theme song (`Burn It Blue'), from the Brazilian Caetano Veloso, is wonderful and won the Oscar. The make-up also won an Oscar. An excellent entertainment indicated for any audience. My vote is eight.",/review/rw3182573/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2007,damienmuldoon,8," art, communism and sex
","I watched this film for the first time, last night,and, it is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. There are shades of ""Surviving Picasso"" about it. Yet, this movie transcends the Picasso film on a number of levels. Where ""Surviving Picasso"" is all about Anthony Hopkins masterful performance, ""Frida"" has a chemistry between its leading actors that you just don't see enough of in modern cinema. Yes, Salma Hayek inhabits the character of Frida and makes it entirely her own. But Alfred Molina's portrayal of her overweight, philandering husband really brings this movie to life. History is important to this movie also. Although removed from the turbulent events dominating European politics in the 1930s, Mexico embraces the ideology that will soon tear Europe apart and reflects that ideology in its art. Diego Rivera, as portrayed by Molina, is certainly a greater lover of women and painting than he is of political ideology, but the fact that he plays host to the exiled Trotsky shows that he is willing to put himself in harms way for the sake of his political principles. Trotsky is played charmingly by Geoffery Rush and his introduction to the story sends Diego and Frida's marriage to another level. This movie never fails to surprise you and if you have not seen it yet, you should.",/review/rw3182573/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2004,gws-2,7," A near miss
","""Frida"" is saved from mediocrity by the wonderful performances of Selma Hayek and Alfred Molina, and by its imaginative cinematography. Unfortunately, the underlying story of the love affair between the title character, Frida Kahlo, and her husband, Diego Rivera, tells an unpleasant tale of irresponsibility and betrayal.  Nevertheless, Kahlo's art is cleverly used to tell her story and Hayek's and Molina's terrific performances manage to invest Kahlo and Rivera with an attractiveness I suspect they lacked in real life.  This is a good although not a great film; recommended, 7 out of 10.",/review/rw3182573/?ref_=tt_urv

1 October 2003,TxMike,," Vanity project for Hayek, producer and actress, moderately interesting.
","""Frida"" is one of those movies, if you identify with the characters, or just admire their work, then it is totally engrossing. The film is well made. However, even though I enjoy good films based on real people, this one doesn't have much residual impact on me. ""Frida""'s paintings are interesting, and like Pollock, imagery arises from her subconscious and reflects the difficulties she had. But that doesn't in itself make it good art, but maybe interesting art. I'm glad I saw ""Frida"", a free DVD loan from my public library system. She certainly had an interesting life, roughly 1922 through the early 1950s covered in this movie. The critic Berardinelli has a good, complete and accurate review. Ebert is too generous with this one.",/review/rw3182573/?ref_=tt_urv

","Now I know that Frida Kahlo had an accident, was involved with Diego Rivera and Trotski, and had strange eyebrows. I also know that Selma Hayak is a babe, and I know a lot about her breasts. Among the things I don't know: what Kahlo's relation to women was; how she learned to paint; what painters she admired; what her relation to the 'revolution' was; what the relation was between suffering and art. I am left to imagine how this absolutely perfect body on which the camera dotes so obsessively could possibly contain the pain it is supposed to harbor (every forty minutes or so the director reminds us of this). But then, I get a really cool lesbian-dancing scene, which I suppose was more important than any of this trivial stuff. And did I mention the boobs?",/review/rw3182573/?ref_=tt_urv

9 April 2007,Alex-Tsander,2," Disappointing, corny, uninformative, confused and cliché-ridden,
","Having studied the history of art academically for five years at college and university, I was aware of Kahlo only vaguely, as a shadowy player on the fringes of the Surrealist movement. I was familiar with a few of her self-portraits and knew about the appalling accident that had such an impact on her life. My first criticism of this movie is that it adds very little to this outline. ",/review/rw3182573/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2015,bregund,6," The titular character deserved much better
","Frida's life was a soap opera, and seemingly tailor-made for a film, but the tiny budget and mediocre performances don't do justice for such a brilliant artist. The lethargic pacing and frustrating sense of unexplored avenues gives the viewer the sense of an unfinished film. Salma Hayek is suitable in the main role, but she lacks the finesse and stage presence to portray such an iconic figure. Alfred Molina, normally a brilliant, chameleonic actor who vanishes into whatever role he plays, seems strangely inert. Even Geoffrey Rush as Trotsky isn't that great.",/review/rw3182573/?ref_=tt_urv
