26 December 2019,Sleepin_Dragon,8," It was delightful.
","I used to love the classic series with Jon Pertwee, so I had my reservations about a reboot, in reality I totally enjoyed it, as did the whole family. It was fun, entertaining and just lovely. Mackenzie Crook was excellent as Worzel Gummidge, I thought he looked incredible, and gave a very good, sincere performance. I wonder what the future holds for this show, it was pure escapism. Steve Pemberton gave a fine performance, the youngsters were very good also.",/review/rw5359160/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have just watched the first episode of this two part series and found it wonderfully imaginative even for a near 70 year-old like me. Mackenzie Crook played Worzel to perfection with his words of wisdom and the robin chicks in his pocket was a nice touch. The two children, having experienced a little bit of magic in their lives, reacted with a sense of wonder that I would have felt at that age. I hope that a longer series is planned for 2020/21. I will be watching!",/review/rw5359160/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2019,paulsarah-14069,10," Well worth watching
",I remember the original from years ago and it bought back memories. The casting was good and although a simple story it's very enjoyable and entertaining. Mackenzie Crook makes a good worzel and it would be nice for the BBC to explore making a series of it as it's different from some of the things on telly today.,/review/rw5359160/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2019,flamingofair,10," Beautifully updated, with stunning cinematography hy
","Just watched the first episode, a gentle, funny and engaging adaptation.
Mackenzie Crook has captured the essence of Worzel perfectly, a kindly but scatty scarecrow, looking after the balance of nature.
The CGI effects are cleverly done, really bringing alive the illusion of the scarecrow.
The only problem - it's really made me wish for summer in the English countryside again!",/review/rw5359160/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2019,burmarose,10," A delight for all age groups
","Excellent work by Mackenzie Crook in this updated Worzel Gummidge. I loved the original as a child but I like this even better. Two unhappy children are fostered to a farm where they are mistaken for fellow scarecrows by Worzel. The plot, about the seasons being locked, is simple enough for the youngest child to follow but the pace is cracking and the characters well drawn. Vicki Pepperdine is superb as the cantankerous Aunt Sally. There are some laugh out loud lines, as when Worzel enquires at the meeting with a murder of crows what they want in return for a favour ""Cash...and guns."" Scorsese, eat your heart out!",/review/rw5359160/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2019,paulsarah-14069,10," More please BBC
",Loved this episode and I sincerely hope there will be more. Cleverly written and educational in places. I watched the original but this is more than a worthy continuation of the books. Full marks and credit to the beeb and Mackenzie Crook for bringing something fresh and original back to our screens. More please and ignore the fuddie duddies who can't move on from the original. Excellent,/review/rw5359160/?ref_=tt_urv

","We watch as an adult family and laughed all the way through it, Brilliantly written and acted. BBC, please make it a series.",/review/rw5359160/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2019,studio-56239,10," He does it again!
","The wholesomeness of Mackenzie's writing is something to be cherished! Absolutely wonderful episode we've just watched together (with 8 year old daughter and wife).
This simply has to be made into an ongoing series. This in the kind of TV I remember watching growing up - totally magical and absorbing.",/review/rw5359160/?ref_=tt_urv

","Forget the original version and wallow in the excellent casting, leisurely pace and beautiful countryside. There are hints of The Detectorist's subtle humour and use of camerawork to bring the best out of the rural locations but by and large it is just gentle storytelling to please young and older viewers alike. A pleasant antidote to other TV programmes and a treasure unearthed this Christmas.",/review/rw5359160/?ref_=tt_urv

27 December 2019,stuartharris-95144,9," Christmas telly as it should be.
","Mackenzie crook has taken a series I watched as a kid and brought it bang up to date without making it a platform to preach what bad people we are. There are messages there that are relevant but he does it with subtlety so you hear it and listen. All that aside it is beautiful to look at, funny and a good way to spend two hours of your life. This is what Christmas tv should be - original programmes that are good.",/review/rw5359160/?ref_=tt_urv

",Watched this with my grand children - we were all enchanted with this version. Very gentle with lovely scenery. Faithful to the story. Utterly charming. Particularly liked the gathering of the scarecrows and the folk song while they worked their magic!,/review/rw5359160/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2019,glynis-48670,10," Simply perfect - don't miss it

29 December 2019,RobCattani,10," Pure Perfection
","I'm not a great wordsmith so I will keep this short, also there are no words to truly describe how beautiful these adaptions are, Mr Crook should be very,very proud of himself because he has created two masterpieces ,being a huge fan od Detectorists I watched expecting a treat but this was so much better than I could have wished for, perfect casting in all areas ,especially the two kids and loads of beautiful scenary and eco messages, Mr Crook is a nature lover , a bloody great bloke and a bordeline genius ,I can only hope he will stay in UK and make many more masterpieces like this and Detectorists ,I'm sure he will, A national treasure in every sense.",/review/rw5359160/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2019,rvallans,10," Safe Hands
","As I've been saying for weeks on social media Worzel Gummidge is in safe hands with Mackenzie Crook. Most people have dismissed it without even watching , an absolute triumph in story telling. Hopefully more to follow please",/review/rw5359160/?ref_=tt_urv

New v Old. Don't bother. Think fresh interpretation.
Is the new great? Yes
Was the old great? Yes
Is the new better? Why bother querying, just love it, for what it is. I certainly do.",/review/rw5359160/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2019,rptrezise,8," Charming and quite heartwarming.
","Not sure why anyone is negative about this. Have just watched the first one and it's very pleasant. Casting is well done and the characters, particularly the kids, well acted and not in the least obnoxious - something unusual when this seems to be the case all too often.
Saw MC interviewed about it and seemed exceptionally humble and just hoped people liked it. Rather have.
Harmless, pleasant and enjoyable.
Disregard the killjoys of The Sun and Mail. I'm old enough to remember the original and this does it no harm. Looking forward to second episode.",/review/rw5359160/?ref_=tt_urv

17 May 2021,kimdino-1,9," Beautiful magical hours
","This is not to be compared with the Jon Pertwee series. They are very different offerings. While the earlier rendition was something to keep the kids quiet for a short time with a humourous story, this series is something much richer.",/review/rw5359160/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2020,sjo-15,10," Great - a treat for all ages
","What a lovely program.
I was unsure at first. I thought it was another example of the idea tank being empty so lets rehash something else I loved in my childhood.
I was wrong.
What a lovely story, lovely setting and lovely gentle drama this is.
The scarecrows and their world are great - lovely innocent fun.
Mackenzie Crook has got this just right.",/review/rw5359160/?ref_=tt_urv
