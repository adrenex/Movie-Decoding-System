26 September 2019,gibbs-18172,9," A good vintage, it gets better with age
","The barmy and bizarre comedy game show that pits mainly comedians against each in a series of hilarious tasks started life on the unusual place of UK Golds, and Dave channel. The station more well know for repeats and re runs.",/review/rw6658328/?ref_=tt_urv

",You have 45 minutes to spare and haven't laughed in years. Make me laugh little Alex Horn.,/review/rw6658328/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2019,deniseactress,10," The FUNNIEST show ever!
",And I just happened to stumble upon it randomly never heard of it before. I saw the USA version but the UK version is side splitting hilarious.,/review/rw6658328/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2019,Kittypants1979,10," Literally the most I've ever laughed at a TV show
","I was in a really deep depression (really, I have mental health issues) and I started to watch a random episode of this and got into it, I ended up howling with laughter like I never have before.
I have now watched every episode and always really look forward to a new series.
It so funny but in such a simple way and it also has the tip top gold of the UK comedy scene.
Watch it now!",/review/rw6658328/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2021,leesimon-26357,10," Best series in existence
","I am overjoyed at the success this show has seen. It is so funny, so clever, so exciting, and overall so fun to watch. I watch and re-watch each series regularly.
Highly, highly recommended.",/review/rw6658328/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2019,mjb301086,10," Love it!
",It's so utterly ridiculous and silly but man I love it! Hope it goes on forever,/review/rw6658328/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2020,ericanaess,9," Funny and entertaining
","I have to admit that when my husband wanted to watch this, I had never heard of it and was skeptical. But when I saw the good reviews on here, I said ok. Glad we did! We have only watched seasons 4&5, but thought they were both funny. I think 5 is a bit better though. I would love to do some of these types of challenges with my students!",/review/rw6658328/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2019,steelthrough,10," No other show like it... in fits every time I watch it!
",I've watched all seasons multiple times and it still has me in fits. No other show has me laughing like this one. The relationship between Greg and Alex is hysterical and I couldn't imagine any other duo pulling it off like they do. The mix of comedians is great and I've since gone on to enjoy many of them in other TV shows. The wait for each new season is unreal but totally worth it each and every time!,/review/rw6658328/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2019,kendrageorge,10," Comedy gold
","Such a simple concept, executed flawlessly! Greg is a perfect host, Alex is a pure genius for coming up with everything, brilliant choice of contestants.",/review/rw6658328/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2021,GW42,10," A Simple Show With Hilariously Chaotic Results
","The combination of Greg Davis's Authority, Little Alex Horns IPad, 5 confused and often deranged comedians and challenges from a school fun day from hell somehow creates the perfect equation for comedy.",/review/rw6658328/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2018,d-tank,10," It's only Dave but I love it!
","Yes it's on Dave but hold fire it's bloody brilliant! First review on IMD and I've been a member for over 7 years (signed in with Facebook), just give it ago people. Peace!",/review/rw6658328/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2021,beverleyhunniford,9," Must watch - it's funny
","It's one of those shows that had passed me by. Then I saw a bit of one episode, something about eggs, balloons and a frying pan. Then a few months later, a bit more, but the same episode unless eggs, balloons and frying pans crop up a lot (must have been on Dave). As 4 On Demand have Taskmaster from series 1, I opted to watch from the beginning. I regularly find I'm laughing so much it hurts. There are indeed, many eggs, loads of balloons and several frying pans.",/review/rw6658328/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2020,budgefudge,10," One of the Funniest Shows on British TV
","There is something special about the humor of Taskmaster. It is a funny combination of the subtle remarks of the comedians and the overtly absurd tasks they have to complete. Although the first few series are great, they still hadn't found that balance which series 4/5 onward nails. Greg Davies and Alex Horne's comedic chemistry is truly phenomenal. Also the music and editing is surprisingly good too.",/review/rw6658328/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2019,soirk,10," Original and brilliantly executed
","It's a show that offers what no other show does. To a degree, it's quality comes down to the quality of the guests or competitors. Alex Horne has given birth to a brilliant concept and his rapport with Greg Davies is magical and makes the show. Each series has had at least one brilliant guest and the tasks are usually amazing and bring out amazing insights into the competitors minds, which in some cases is scary!",/review/rw6658328/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2020,klaythoring,10," Just the Greatest
","I have rewatched this show over and over, introduced everyone I know to it and pounce on new episodes with glee!",/review/rw6658328/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2021,elodiedanzelman,10," This show makes me proud to be british
","Firstly, Alex Horne is a genius. This show is just incredible. Every series is hilarious and unique and the tasks are great! So many great comedians have taken part , all bringing there own unique humour and take on the tasks making this programme so enjoyable. Greg Davies as the hilarious headteacher-like taskmaster and ""Little Alex Horneeee!"" are what make Taskmaster so special though. This show is fantastic and i hope it continues for years to come!",/review/rw6658328/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2021,simianfriday,10," Simply the best.
","This show is simply the best comedy game show I've seen - hands down. It's funny, it's clever, it's unique, and it's just *FUN* in the best ways imaginable.",/review/rw6658328/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2020,goof1couk,10," Why did it take me so long to give it a go!
","I hate myself for ignoring the number of ads I watched promoting the show. 2020 has been a year to forget but I will always remember it fondly for the year I binged and I binged on this absolute genius show. The task are excellent, the calibre of contestants is extremely high and Greg and (little) Alex Horne are the couple you look at and wonder 'who is the big spoon and who is the little spoon' just watch it! If you don't enjoy this show you don't deserve it!",/review/rw6658328/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2021,rafidchy-04631,10," Amazing and very addicting
",You'll first watch a couple of clips on YouTube and then a couple more and then start to watch the episodes chronologically and voila! You're addicted! Your next 2 weeks is covered full off surprises and tasks!,/review/rw6658328/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2021,barlsmith,10," Fantastic
","Excellent, bingeable show. Greg and little Alex have perfect chemistry, the tasks are always great. My only critique would be of some of the guest comedians but that critique would not lower my score at all.",/review/rw6658328/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2019,Darkside-Reviewer,7," Best show on Dave
",This is comedy and creativeness brought together to bring you something new putting comedian's and presenters together and giving them the kind of tasks you'd give children on activity afternoon makes for some interesting situations and comedy gold.,/review/rw6658328/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2021,ameliaberk,10," Great telly
","Brilliant, unique, hilarious. It has truly grown as a show over the past ten series, and I look forward to see it continue for years to come. Greg's dynamic with Alex and the contestants is almost always funny, and I love seeing everyone's differing approaches to the tasks (and their outcomes).",/review/rw6658328/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2019,benshorthouse,10," Very Very funny
",This is always an amazing show the chemistry and the comedians they bring always are amazing. It's a great refreshing show,/review/rw6658328/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2019,thomasharris-67958,10," >>>> INCREDIBLE <<<<
","The best show on TV, every element is comedy perfection. Incredible chemistry between Greg and Alex, brilliant range of contestants and outrageously clever tasks. Nothing else like it!",/review/rw6658328/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2021,dylan-morrissey-22480,10," Sometimes, shows just work.
",Love the show. Every second of it. Can't rate it highly enough! Every contestant works so well each season and Greg and Alex are incredible and work so well together.,/review/rw6658328/?ref_=tt_urv
