28 September 2011,evan_harvey,7," Quite good, but can be confusing
","Before you watch this film, I recommend going to YouTube and watch a doco titled ""Serial Killers - The Bodies in the Barrels"". It's about 40 mins long, but fills in a lot of details that you might struggle to understand in the film.",/review/rw6436834/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2014,hitchcockthelegend,8," The Boddies in the Barrels Murders.
","The press junket and first wave of critical notices built Snowtown up as a throat ripper that will cause you nightmares. That didn't do it any favours as per expectation levels for the horror enthusiast. However, this is a superb piece of film making, a real gritty and grainy deconstruction of the human condition gone sour. As with all films of this type that are based on real life incidents, it pays to read up on the facts if you be so inclined. ",/review/rw6436834/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2011,seth_isurus,," A harrowingly realistic portrayal of torture and murder
","Snowtown is probably the most disturbing movie I have ever seen. (Note: To back that statement up, I have watched most so called 'torture-porn' flicks, including hard-edged foreign stuff like Martyrs and Audition.)",/review/rw6436834/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2011,HumanoidOfFlesh,8," Snowtown Murders
","The Snowtown Murders also known as the Bodies in Barrels murders were the murders of 11(the twelfth charge of Suzanne Allen was dropped due to lack of evidence)people in South Australia, Australia between August 1992 and May 1999.The crimes were uncovered when the remains of eight victims were found in barrels of acid located in a rented former bank building in Snowtown, South Australia on 20 May 1999.The leader of the perpetrators was John Justin Bunting.He hated paedophiles,gays,drug users and obese people.The victims were horribly tortured before death using everyday tools such as pincers,pliers and clamps.The final victim of Bunting and his murderous crew was cannibalized.""Snowtown"" is an unsettling crime drama based on The Snowtown Murders.The acting is great,the atmosphere of decaying landscape is bleak and there are some brutal scenes of torture,murder and animal dismemberment.8 murders out of 10.",/review/rw6436834/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2011,helraiza,10," Chilling
","I don't understand why people are coming down on this film, i thought it was amazing and spectacularly represented the emotions of the people involved rather than the actions. I am glad it didn't go into all the violence into more detail even though i know the real killings were worse than depicted in the film. I think that it was not the intention of the director to have another gory wolf creek serial killer story. ",/review/rw6436834/?ref_=tt_urv

25 September 2017,BA_Harrison,5," Poor Skippy!
","Snowtown, based on a true story, takes place just North of Adelaide, Australia, where a vulnerable young man, Jamie (Lucas Pittaway), falls in with a psychopath, John (Daniel Henshall), who has an intense hatred for paedophiles, gays, the obese, and drug users. Beginning with the harassment of a perverted neighbour (by chucking kangaroo parts onto his doorstep), John, Jamie, and a couple of other cohorts escalate their attacks, turning to murder.",/review/rw6436834/?ref_=tt_urv

19 May 2011,Loader1976,7," Disturbing and affecting.

6 January 2012,p_imdb-238-926380,3," Bad, randomly cut together
","This film is boring due to bad realization. You don't understand: who is who, why people are like they are, what relation they have. You can't connect dots. The movie just passes along, and you don't care that much as it seems that scenes are randomly cut together, there is no real story to understand.",/review/rw6436834/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2013,videorama-759-859391,9," Definitely not a no show, Snowtown does Adelaide proud
","When hearing of this film being cast, I had no idea, this film would be this good, or so well received, at it's premiere's. As from all the hearsay, over it's sickening scenes, which had people walking out, turning away, or their stomachs churning, I found it an enigma. That one notorious torture bath scene for me, wasn't anything really disturbing, especially if compared to Wolf Creek. Let's face it, it could of been much more gory, which the film wisely held back on, with respect to the families of the victims, these gang of paedophile and gay haters killed, led of course by the notorious John Bunting. He's played with unforgettable menace by Daniel Henshall, in a a tour de force performance, one with a face that will stay with you for many years to come. All the other performers, mostly untrained actors, bring amazingly real performances. A great move. The film wouldn't have the same impactfull effect, if professionals were used, where everyone should be commended. Two nude scenes, one involving The Vsaislakas's kids being filmed nude by their Mom's current lover/paedophile, the other involving Bunting being entertained by a bare corpulent dancer (gees this guy really is sick) really disgusted me, although the real disgust was in the hideous crimes. Actually the CI reenacted documentary is more graphic. You actually see the top inside of the open barrels. But a shockingly true story like this grabs you, and you really learn about these monsters. The handling and flow of the story is great in a 120 minute well told masterpiece. The haunting ending of that vault door closing, in that notorious bank, before factual truths of the killer's arrests read across the screen, impactfully works. Snowtown is beautifully filmed and edited too. It uses more grainy picture that works favorably from it's first long dolly shot of fields and farms, as we head north along Port Augusta road, to it's haunting night shots in the house's yards and on the empty streets of the infamous town, which I've visited once or twice, in the last couple of years. Notable performances are that of Louise Harris at Vsaislakas's Mum, and the two paedophile filled roles. The dead on portrayal of Barry Lane, creeped me out, while the actor, Heath Ledger lookalike doesn't emit the same kinetic energy, as the oldest and easily led son, James Vsaislakas, the real one who copped it. He's still quite good in a great film that warrants viewing by all, well probably not everyone. Though nothing holds a candle to Henshall's amazingly real portrayal-what naturalistic actors are made of. Snowtown makes good use of location too, revisiting the areas of the killers. We are even shown the Centrelink, angle which led to the killers, pilfering the funds off the victims, where in the small lounge, outside the office, James is befriended by a kid, with a pet python. For director Kurzel, Snowtown is a top rate, feature, his baby, and one of course that is not gonna be loved or favored by everyone, in what is S.A's most sadistic serial killer case that will live on and haunt the memory for many years to come.",/review/rw6436834/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2011,pat_deayts,9," You don't enjoy it; you experience it.
","Snowtown follows the experience of young Jamie Vlassakis as he partakes in the infamous 'bodies in the barrels' murders. Director Justin Kurzel has created a film that gradually pulls away the illusion of justified vigilantism to reveal the sadistic and evil core of John Bunting and his co-accused. The rare scenes of violence have such a profound impact that they are difficult to witness, the imagery of the Australian welfare suburb is captured with such florescent realism that you can almost taste the atmosphere. While at times fragmented, Snowtown is a rare and expertly crafted biopic that will tear at your senses and stun you into submission",/review/rw6436834/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2012,nishy2012,5," very tedious and confusing film
","I saw this film get good reviews and thought I would give it a go, like you do. I sat through it to the end even though nothing really seemed to happen and the events in the film were quite random and I did start hoping it would finish soon. I think the film-makers were assuming people would have prior knowledge of the events of the film before viewing it, as it seemed to veer from scene to scene quite randomly, i got the gist of what was happening but it was not really compulsive viewing. The story matter is based on real-life events and I found it to be grim viewing, with little reward or insight into the characters, and I felt the boy playing the lead was not very interesting to watch. I guess I expect to be entertained or gain some insight into something when I watch a film but in this case neither of these things happened. Quite dull all in all.",/review/rw6436834/?ref_=tt_urv

","After all the critical praise I read about this movie, before going in to watch, I did expect more than I got. So maybe I was a little bit preconceived and my expectations should have been lower.

7 December 2011,skay_baltimore,4," ***Spoilers*** Snowtown tried to underplay its hand. But it went too far.
","I can understand the director not wanting to over-sensationalize an already highly sensationalistic story line. However, this film goes way too far in the opposite direction, and as a result, misses the mark by a country mile. Even knowing the actual facts of the case doesn't help, although it does aid somewhat in the understanding of what's happening on screen.",/review/rw6436834/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2014,Leofwine_draca,6," Harrowing, distressing, incredibly powerful
","SNOWTOWN is a true-life story about a serial killer and his associates who were prevalent in Australia during the 1990s. A low-key production that goes for gritty realism above everything else, the film this most reminded me of was HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER; it has the same level of harrowing and distressing subject matter while being incredibly powerful at the same time.",/review/rw6436834/?ref_=tt_urv

","I didn't quite know what to expect when I put this DVD into my player, but it certainly wasn't this. Snowtown was so much better than what I hoped for, and it left me with a satisfaction which only some movies manage to do for me. Of course I knew on forehand that it was a movie about serial killings, but it got well above all those cliché SK movies that have begotten so common. ",/review/rw6436834/?ref_=tt_urv

27 December 2012,bennyhagen,," Beyond entertainment.
","Well, I have some ambivalent feelings here. Surely Snowtown Murders deserves several awards for what it is. The raw portrait of psychopathy is fleshed out and probably perfect, delivered trough profound performances and classically skillful direction. Also, the agenda works on a level that few directors dare to, or even can work on, reflecting information in a way that it actually appears as meaningful as it can and should be. Also director Justin Kurzel refrains from any voyeurism where most other directors would have given in to the temptation. This is a serious theme and Kurzel threats it as such. And this is exactly the point. Putting some queer sense of enjoyment beside, this movie is not meant to be enjoyed and it probably can not be for most people. This serves it's agenda and it works, but you must ask yourself: is there entertainment for you beyond entertainment? Obviously, if you are a film student, there is a lot to gaze on here, but besides that, is there anything you can really get out of this movie that is worth voluntarily spending two hours of your life on? Unfortunately, to know, you must see for yourself.",/review/rw6436834/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2021,misanthr0pist,4," Ineffective slow burn
","I'm all for an effective slow burn, but this was unfortunately just a drag, with little to no pay-off.
The case itself is incredibly disturbing, and just as interesting, but watch one of the many documentaries about it if you want to learn what actually happened in Snowtown.",/review/rw6436834/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2011,rad81,8," Suspenseful, authentic and confronting.
","Brilliant in it's authenticity and simplicity. The attention to detail, costume and set design deserve recognition and credit. As the viewer you actually feel like your in the 90s, from the Nike Air sneakers to the Sega Master System etc. There is no clear distinction between characters at the beginning of the film, who are complex to say the least.This may leave some audience members confused, but also add to the intended emotions of the film. The actual murders were committed amongst the seemingly mundane and relatively normal lower class suburbs of Adelaide. The director Justin Kurzel, does a fine job at recreating that image. I loved this film because I am some what a crime buff and have a profound interest in Australian criminal history. This movie captures the very essence that is Snowtown. Crime buffs especially will enjoy this movie. The director doesn't necessarily rely on graphic imagery to the extent some people may think. More the psychological game of fear and suspense is applied through out the feature with impeccable brilliance. My heart was racing for a majority of the time, even the quieter moments don't allow you time to relax as the suspense builds. Snowtown is definitely not for the faint hearted or squeamish, but it is for those who can appreciate gritty Aussie crime flicks.",/review/rw6436834/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2021,alex_i-30519,9," The most disturbing film I have ever seen
","I watched this film about 5 years ago, and its still on my mind. Honestly I didnt know what start rating to give it, as its just so... vile. The reason I settled on high number, is because its supposed to be a horror. And wow. It is.
I have seen some other really graphic films (martyrs, irreversible etc.) But this is by far the most disturbing. I honestly felt physically sick at some points, the bathroom scene made me feel so so uncomfortable I couldn't bare it. It is one of those films you only ever watch once, and will stay with you for a very long time.",/review/rw6436834/?ref_=tt_urv
