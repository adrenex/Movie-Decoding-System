19 October 2017,s-2448,10," Don't judge a book by it's cover
","I know many people who completely rejected this show after they saw one shot of the animation. Me, being a die-hard Scooby-doo fan, was skeptical, but tried it out anyway. I have to say this is for sure the funniest Scooby-doo incarnation since the original. The voice actors do a great job, the stories are hilarious, and it is overall, a great show. That cliché phrase, don't judge a book by it's cover, is definitely in play here.",/review/rw5920093/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2018,conallturley,8," The funniest show in the franchise
","Be Cool, Scooby-Doo! is another great addition to the franchise after my personal favourite series Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated. Being the 12th incarnation of the show, you'd think the mileage would have ran out by now. Being a massive Scooby-Doo fan myself, however, I would feel saddened if they stopped producing shows, especially if they are to the quality of the latest two series.",/review/rw5920093/?ref_=tt_urv

20 October 2015,blytheandferb,9," Flawed, But Still Good
","People were admittedly skeptical about this show because of the artwork and the promos, and while the show has faults, I think it's genuinely good. This show is about the gang (Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy, and Scooby) going on a road trip together when school is over. They encounter lots of monsters and ghosts, and have to figure out who's behind it. There's never been a Scooby Doo series I don't like, and this show is no exception. While the humor can be perfected a bit, each episode has me laughing a lot. The gang is still themselves though. Yes, Daphne is a bit dumbed down, but she's still funny and helpful, and her gimmicks don't overstay their welcome. The show has a nice Phineas And Ferb vibe to it, though that might be due to Jon Colton Barry and Zac Moncrief. If you look past the weird art, I say give it a shot.",/review/rw5920093/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2016,rb-939-19665,10," The FUNNEST Scooby Doo since the original!
","Long time Scooby fan here. When I first started watching the new series, I thought it was great... and now that I've given it some more time, I've totally fallen in love with it. Yes, the animation is different. But geez... what the heck is the big deal? Things change. At first I thought it a bit ""odd""... but very quickly it became part of the shows atmosphere and personality. Call it ""Family Guy"" style animation or something like that if you want... but I gotta tell ya, that style has been around for 2+ decades now, so it's not just some current-trendy thing, and I think it works perfectly with the show... which is a phenomenal blend of smart, funny, witty, silly... all rolled into one. This show is a LOT less serious than the previous ""Mystery Inc"" series, so changing over to a less serious animation style I think was a really great choice to set it apart and rise above the past.",/review/rw5920093/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2017,alissongomes-72392,10," Basically the same Scooby-Doo we know, but funnier.
","Asides the art style, this is a great show that improved a part of the classic Scooby-Doo formula: the comedy. I don't know about the American cast changes, but I do know about the Brazilian ones. Only the Fred voice actor wasn't changed here. It's not worse, the new cast do a nice job, I just don't understand why they changed the cast from ""What's new, Scooby-Doo?"" that also worked on ""Mystery inc."". The designs are understandably hated but it's not noticeable on the go. Also, honestly only Velma looks really uglier. As I said earlier, they improved, and flawlessly, the comedy. The comedy is not absent in the classic formula, the slap-sticky gags and the chase scenes are awesome, not a surprise Scooby-Doo is a success afterall, it's that they try to make you laugh by literally putting jokes now. The characters are also a bit more improved and a bit less clichéd; Fred is now more of an exaggerated leader than a handsome, strong one. Velma didn't actually change that much, but looks nerdier. The Shaggy/Scooby-Doo couple is pretty much the same as well, being the mayor change in the group Daphne. I don't know if I hate or like the new Daphne, although there's nothing that detestable about her new personality. The pacing is the same, I personally enjoy the chase scenes of the classic formula and on this show it's similar to the ""What's new"" ones, specially the rock 'n' roll soundtrack. The animation is pretty good, it has the same quality level/style of cartoons like Bunnicula and Wabbit; it looks differently, but it's certainly not a lazy work. ""Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!"" is easily one of the best Scooby-Doo versions, it's equally entertaining and funnier. If you give it a chance, you won't regret it. You know what they say, don't judge a book by its cover. Here's an example.",/review/rw5920093/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2018,jwwalrath-227-85487,10," Funny!!
","This is by far my favorite Scooby-Doo show. It is really funny. As an adult, I found the jokes to be surprisingly clever, like Phineas and Ferb level.",/review/rw5920093/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2017,papanda,8," Pretty good actually
","Call me a pessimist, but I was skeptical with this show at first. After seeing the animation style, I thought it would be another crap remake that they just pumped out of the factory. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I actually enjoy this more than almost any other Scooby Doo remakes. First I love what they've done with Daphne. In lots of Scooby Doo shows, she and Fred have the most bland personalities. She goes from prissy, rich, and a fashionista, to a quirky down-to-earth character that's just trying to find her passion in life... By trying every hobby on earth, and I love that new take on her. Second, even though the humor can be corny at times (It is a kid show after all) there are still plenty of moments that get a genuine snicker out of me. It has it's moments. Third, they introduce multiple suspicious characters at the beginning of the episodes, leaving you to get involved and see if you can guess which one is behind the mask. I think that's a cool idea to have kids honing their deduction skills, and have them feeling like an actual member of the a Mystery inc. gang.",/review/rw5920093/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2020,andrewroy-04316,8," One of the stronger Scooby Doo shows, and easily the funniest
","Like many others, I was hesitant to watch Be Cool due to the art style, but quickly realized how much of a non-issue it becomes when you get into the cleverness of the show. Be Cool gives as much depth to all 5 characters as we've seen in any other show - none are reductive tropes, all are fully fleshed out, interesting people. Daphne is the clearest example of this, with her positivity and zany bits she has each episode. Shaggy is fantastic, shown as a much smarter and more clever guy than before, perhaps my favorite iteration of Shaggy yet. Velma has nice backstory, and Scooby talks more here than in any previous show I'd say. At its heart, and particularly in its best episodes, it is Fred who brings the show together. The People Vs Fred Jones, Some Fred Time, and the 2 part ending to the show with Professor Huh are amazing episodes, and each centers on a fascinating examination of Fred's psychology. He is the force that drives the gang towards every new mystery, and is the one who is most invested in the gang for what they do. Daphne cares more about the people, Velma cares more about the outcome, but Fred loves the gang for what it represents. The final episode with Professor Huh was a fascinating turning on its head of Fred's father from Mystery Incorporated. In MI, his father seemed like he cared but ended up not being so good after all (his relationship with Fred is also not what it appears, but I'll avoid spoilers). Here, his father is a criminal and the set up makes us think it's a similar story, where he saw his father's mistakes and solved mysteries as a way to not be like him and stop people like him. The episode progression is masterfully done, and the way it ties up a few past threads is brilliant. It's always enjoyable and funny, and at its best it is a fantastic show. What holds me back from putting it in tier 1 with MI, SDWAY, and WNSD is that aside from a handful of inspired episodes, many did feel overly formulaic. Even then, the show is self-aware enough to poke fun at how they always do the same thing, such as Shaggy bemoaning the way they get followed in splitting up. The mysteries were a bit hit or miss, with some great clever solutions but also some that were pretty random and had few clues or interesting mystery elements. In almost every episode, I could name the minute by minute progression of the show and be about right. The great, comedic writing and deeper characters are enough for me to give it a great rating of an 8, and I never finished an episode thinking there was nothing interesting in it, but a few episodes do stand out as truly brilliant. Particularly for anyone who likes Scooby Doo this is an absolute treat as the clever jokes playing off of historic character and episode tropes are frequent and consistently well done, and it really does have some of the best moments in each of the five characters' histories. Highly recommended, Be Cool has far more depth than it may seem at first glance.",/review/rw5920093/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2015,dantalia,9," Really enjoyable for the most part.
","It would actually be an 8.7/10. Anyway, the Show in general is good, I don't favor the Style used to Animate, it isn't very fluent, but, it still looks pretty good. The Humor is really entertaining, some Jokes fell flat, but, most came out really entertaining. Most People just give this a bad score due to the Nostalgia getting to them, or the Character Style not looking like the Original, but, they tried something new; the Outcome, it's great that they aren't using the Classic Style from the Original in my Opinion. I recommend watching the Show if you're into Comedy and the Scooby-Doo Series. Overall, the Show is great and it shouldn't be receiving bad reception.",/review/rw5920093/?ref_=tt_urv

28 October 2017,muaaz-ali93,10," Still laughing
","Well, as a genuine scooby doo fan for the last twenty years. I have seen every other iteration of scooby doo that has been released. At first. I was also quite suspicious about the character overhaul. But when I actually watched around the first five. I started to get into it and it's only because the jokes were actually great. They might have been targeted to kids but they can make anyone laugh as well. I never laughed while watching the 70's show where there was a background laugh to amuse us. But here, it was actually funny. The overall mystery theme is there but the addition of jokes is something that has made BE cool much better than rest. If Mystery incorporated isn't going to be continued and the scooby doo is going to continue with random mysteries than I would love to see Be cool scooby doo continue for even 10 seasons.",/review/rw5920093/?ref_=tt_urv

","Myself and my husband are in our forties no kids and just LOVE Be Cool Scooby Doo. This version with the jokes and one liners are hilarious and even when the same ones come on we have seen a number of times before we still laugh. Please make more! Yes it looks different but its not much different to family guy and American dad and not that much of a big deal, they still do the mysteries but now with the added much loved humour.",/review/rw5920093/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2017,rasheedthomas-68306,7," Finally! An interesting reboot out of so many!
",Went to my local Barnes and Nobles store to look for childhood cartoons that I can hold on to and ended up buying this DVD with some others because I wanted to give something modern a try. The art style made me feel like this was going to be another forced Scooby- Doo project since Warner Bros. have been overdoing Scooby-Doo since the DC's New 52 started. The art is lazy and I believe DC and Cartoon Network are getting lazier as time moves on. I mean look at horrific Teen Titans Go cartoon. But I was hoping this DVD wasn't a waste of time and money. ,/review/rw5920093/?ref_=tt_urv

","I honestly can't fathom how anyone could say ANYthing bad about this show. Not only is this the the best Scooby Doo ever created, but it's also one of the funniest kids cartoons I've ever seen. It's absolutely hilarious... playing to both adults and kids perfectly. It's interesting, smart, witty, endlessly entertaining, and just downright FUN. Seriously... I have been watching Scooby Doo for over 4 decades now... I still carry a Scooby Doo lunch box to work... and I have zero reservations in saying that this is simply the best ever.

9 October 2015,xandaking,8," Genuinely Enjoyable
","If we take all nostalgia aside you would have to admit Be Cool, Scooby Doo is a good show. Albeit the animation style is quirky, I would argue that it fits the humour perfectly. Ever since the first images were released many people have been outraged, not even giving it a chance. But if we look past the animation style it is still a great show.",/review/rw5920093/?ref_=tt_urv

1 June 2021,adotson-98233,7," Not the best incarnation, but still a very fun show
","""Be Cool, Scooby Doo"" is a very breezy fun show for kids to enjoy, What I liked was that this series still managed to keep some of the heart of the other shows while still providing some new things. The comedy too isn't too bad, and I did laugh a few times. Theres some cool things they do, and they try to incorporate some facts about certain mysteries which I think is very cool. Now there are a few issues mainly the character design. I don't hate the design, but it decently feels a little cheaper than some other shows of this franchise. Some of the characters at time can be a little annoying, but not too much. Overall this show has some iffy charter designs, and some jokes don't land, but it's far from bad. It's fun, fast paced, and the mysteries are still very fun to watch.",/review/rw5920093/?ref_=tt_urv

22 November 2018,tommypezmaster,1," A huge disgrace to the Scooby Doo franchise
","Whoever thought up Be Cool Scooby Doo needs to be hunted down and shot. It is suppose to be a more comedic take on the original series, but it is very insulting and dull. The ""heroes"" are stupid and weak. The villains are worst. The plot is clichéd, the art is simple, and there is nothing redeeming about it. This is like most mean spirited comedy shows: predictable, lackluster, and annoying. Even though it is meant for a young audience, not many people will enjoy this slapped together piece of crud. I am glad it's short lived. It is one of the worst animated reboot series ever made period.",/review/rw5920093/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2020,Tuefer_Benz,9," One of the high points of the entire franchise
","People tend to focus on the designs and overlook the excellent attention to character. The best Fred, hands down. Explores his obsession with solving mysteries (rather than traps like Mystery Incorporated and the recent movies) and makes him a person willing to become more self-aware. Daphne is drawn to adventure, not a crush on Fred. When she's not doing her zaniness of the week she shows that her hyper-privileged background has given her a certain savvy about how the world works. Wonderful voice acting by Welker and Griffin too. Why a person as brilliant as Velma would hang out with the gang is addressed. Micucci is a fine replacement for the terrific Cohn. Lillard's Shaggy is great as ever, and this Shaggy questions his role in the gang more than usual. Scooby is given his funniest lines ever.",/review/rw5920093/?ref_=tt_urv
