23 November 2020,kosmasp,9," This is ... me/you/it
","I'm not a fan of musicals in general. Really I mostly can't see their appeal, but from time to time, I do find myself really enjoying one of them, especially if they are as well done as this. And the mid piece/song ""This is me"" is so good .. excellent! Superb! Any other great word you can think of. I had goosebumps listening to it.",/review/rw6340225/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2020,EmmaNelly,8," Better than I expected.
",This was the perfect family night movie. I loved the music although at first I thought it would be annoying. I enjoyed the scenes and the costumes and everything about this magical film. I would definitely watch it again.,/review/rw6340225/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2019,Brandon-Donlon,8," Initially avoided this movie, but when I watched it I felt like an idiot.
","To start off this review I'd like to say that before I ever watched this movie I had the opinion that it was going to be rubbish, solely because of how blown up the movie was. Everywhere I went it was ""The Greatest Showman"". I thought that perhaps it would be a mediocre film at best, blown out of proportion by a craze.",/review/rw6340225/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have watched this film approximately twenty or more times. That is in no way an exaggeration and I may be low-calling it. Sometimes, I just have it on in the background while I work out or in the morning or while getting ready for work or I play it while cooking in the evening. ",/review/rw6340225/?ref_=tt_urv

27 December 2017,jecal,10," Surpassed My Expectations
","This is possibly one of the best films I have ever seen in this genre.
From the start to finish, I felt that there was some inaudible and invisible metronome setting the overall pace of the film, a consistent rhythm within many rhythms, if that makes sense. Everything about this film had perfect timing. Editing was seamless. Attention to detail was mind blowing, costumes outstanding. Special effects... whoa. Acting was flawless. I really can't find anything to criticize. 
To summarize in a sentence, first class family entertainment.",/review/rw6340225/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2018,zkonedog,7," A Unique Presentation Befitting Barnum Himself
","The success of ""La La Land"" opened Hollywood up to the musical again, and ""The Greatest Showman"" is able to take full advantage. While traditionally the story of P.T. Barnum would be told as a biopic, here it is given a flourish that perhaps the old ringmaster himself would appreciate.",/review/rw6340225/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2020,xjumper65,9," A Musical for the Masses
","It's hard to come up with something that hasn't already been said. Are critics are wrong? Yes. Does it have great music? Absolutely. Will you want to watch it again and again? Almost certainly. The entire cast does phenomenally well singing and dancing and for many, this achievement will be the first line in their biographies. It's a musical that is generally inspiring and evokes good feelings, but still takes you on an emotional journey. It's far from a documentary on P.T. Barnum, but that's not it's purpose. As someone obsessed with Hamilton to the point where I listened to the soundtrack everyday for 2 years before seeing it live on Broadway, I avoided watching this one because I just assumed it couldn't even come close. I was wrong. I'm not saying it's better than Hamilton or even as good because I don't think anything will ever be, but The Greatest Showman is definitely a modern classic that earns a place on the list of must-see musicals. Despite its 19th century setting, the songs are fresh, modern, up-beat numbers that can only be described as instant classics. Just try NOT singing along, I dare you. This is not an old school musical like West Side Story or The Sound of Music; it's very modern in the best sense of the word. The choreography and dancing are also first rate and the movie engages you and sweeps you along so well that by the end, you won't even believe it's been an hour and forty-five minutes. I could watch this weekly and never tire of it. Rather than the critics, trust the viewer reviews, the box office numbers, and the fact that it stayed popular in theaters for so long, they had to forcibly pull it before it's popularity waned because the DVD was about to drop and the streaming deals were about to kick in. If you've ever seen a single musical you liked, you're sure to love this one. If you've never enjoyed a musical before, the. this may be the one to bring you into the fold.",/review/rw6340225/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2017,sunchick116-872-583383,10," Move over 'la la land', this is how you musical.
","Now THIS is how you do a film! What an epic masterpiece! I don't understand the critics criticism of the lack of a story. There was A very clear cut journey of barnum's desire to be accepted and then learning what is really important in life. All the songs were so catchy, and more our importantly, inspirational. They had something to say. Makes me sad to see so many missed the message of this very important movie, just because it was wrapped up in a fun experience. Can't say enough good things about this film. It's just fantastic. Our audience clapped at the end.",/review/rw6340225/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2019,BlueIrisDaisy,10," One of the best movies I've ever seen
","Absolutely beautiful movie. Visually stunning, fantastic acting, songs you'll keep singing for months after. And the songs are catchy without being cheesy. Love the choreography as well. You can't sit still while watching this movie!
The story is very interesting and moving, and the issues they face are still relevant today which makes it very relatable. I've watched it three times and it makes me well up every time, my husband as well.
If you haven't seen it yet, go see it! Even if you're not normally into musicals, I'd still give it a chance :)",/review/rw6340225/?ref_=tt_urv

","Love musicals, always have from a very young age seeing the likes of 'The Wizard of Oz', 'West Side Story', 'The Sound of Music', 'Calamity Jane', 'Singin in the Rain' and Disney musicals. So there is absolutely no bias against musicals, though there are bad ones out there and ones that are still enjoyable or mixed where stories, scripts or both are not strong suits.

","I'm sorry folks but the critics are brain dead, The system is rigged by movie studios paying off these worthless critics to only favor certain movies, they should be ashamed of themselves, hope you can sleep at nights knowing users outnumber your worthless rigged pay off reviews. I'm not a musical type person at all but this movie touched me in every aspect of the movie, I had tingles running down my body and couldn't hold back my tears. If this movie doesn't touch you, then you don't have a heart, period and that's coming from a right wing conservative.This is by far the Greatest movie of 2017....plan on going to see it again. Also, bought the Soundtrack too. Two Thumbs Up.",/review/rw6340225/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2018,excalibur107,7," A Birthday Surprise
","Sunday was my niece's birthday. 16. I invited her and two of her friends to do whatever they wanted. They chose to stay home, eat cake and watch The Greatest Showman on HBO and I thought Oh no. But, I had cake with them and sat to watch this Michael Gracy, who? Michael Gracy to see the story of PT Barnum with Hugh Jackman. Sentimental and pretty, yes but also, engrossing, moving, beautiful and structured in such a way that doesn't fall into the usual biopic traps. It moves at a breathless pace with smart and unexpected transitions. Hugh Jackman is great and Michelle Williams truthful to a fault. She's never less than that. What a wonderful actress. Zac Effron gives, what it may very well be, his most convincing performance and the Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson was a revelation to me. The script by Jenny Bicks and the remarkable Bill Condon tells a classic tale with contemporary rhythms and contemporary pace. Needless to say, I enjoyed it much more that I could possibly had imagine. So, thank you Lilli, happy 16!",/review/rw6340225/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2018,Hitchcoc,9," Great Fun
","When I saw the first trailer, I thought this would be fun. Then I started reading about it, especially local critics. I'm pretty picky and don't have much time for bad musicals. This pretty much floored me. The songs were pristine. The choreography was creative and fun. The casting worked wonderfully as did the special effects. I'm only taking a point away because it was so utterly contrived. But I thought Jackman and Ephron did yeoman duty as the leads. The circus bits were great. The ""freaks"" were engaging and fun. I wished it had a slightly sharper edge and a little more internal conflict, but the message put forth was just fine. Go see it because it is great fun.",/review/rw6340225/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2018,hertl,10," As Soon As It Was Over, I Wanted to See It Again
","I love the circus. I love quality cinema. Not since Billy Rose's Jumbo (1962) has a motion picture so successfully combined these two elements. I wouldn't be surprised if it won the same awards as Cecil B. DeMille's The Greatest Show on Earth (1952). Michael Gracey skillfully brought together the best music, choreography, cast, cinematography, visual effects, costumes, and set decoration I have seen in recent years, all fresh and original, and integrated them into nothing short of a masterpiece.",/review/rw6340225/?ref_=tt_urv

","It has been SO long since a movie/musical made me feel so...HAPPY!
This movie is absolutely FANTASTIC! Everything from the incredible, toe-tapping, music to the heartfelt, dream-filled, story-line! I was so immersed in the movie that at some point I totally forgot I was sitting in a packed theater on Christmas Night! I'll even admit that I broke the cardinal rule and actually turned on my cell phone to download the the ENTIRE soundtrack while still in the theater...and I was only two songs in!! I will also admit that I am a 42yr old who left that theater feeling like a little kid again, wishing that I can twirl my way to the car without being looked at as crazy! LOL!! I've already seen it twice in as many days, and I plan on seeing it TONS more until I can own it for myself! It is DEFINITELY a movie that you have to experience in a theater though, so PLEASE ignore the snub-nosed critics and go see this magical film! You won't regret it!",/review/rw6340225/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2017,bkrauser-81-311064,6," Good Choreography but Sloppy Story
","A musical movie about P.T. Barnum told with all great reverence to P.T. Barnum, featuring P.T. Barnum's Museum of Curiosities...so why not just make ""Barnum"" the stage musical? The answer to that question seems to be because then they couldn't get the guys from La La Land to do the music; fair enough. But if director Michael Gracey and screenwriter Jenny Bicks were set on custom making this celebration of glitz, chicanery and humbug they could have at least opted for a little more connective tissue.",/review/rw6340225/?ref_=tt_urv

26 February 2018,ccamp89,5," A sugar rush
","Quite a frustrating film. The musical numbers are far and away its strongest attribute, which is obviously what any good musical should strive for. Although they aren't all showstoppers, there are some genuinely excellent sequences with tight, kinetic editing, great rhythmic camera movements, and vibrant choreography. The first proper musical number that acts as a prologue to Barnum's life was quite impressive with its fluid execution and ability to convey a large amount of information in a short period of time (which ironically is a quality that ends up being to the film's detriment when viewed as a whole... more on that later). Jackman's and Efron's bar duet is another fun and energetic sequence with a lot of cool camerawork and infectious energy. Essentially all of the songs are pleasant, catchy, and memorable as well, if a bit vanilla.",/review/rw6340225/?ref_=tt_urv
