","In a world where their femininity is bought and sold, two sex workers find themselves in love with one another and can see a world of happiness, if only they can get through the darkness that exists in the heart of their lives.",/review/rw8726744/?ref_=tt_urv

","It needs to be accentuated how wonderfully refreshing it is to see a movie that portrays sex work so frankly. No romanticization or fetishization, no judgments or condescension, no frills, just a matter-of-fact depiction of the day to day business. It's important to note this not just because it's a welcome rarity in cinema, but also because it's the backdrop for the story to unfold. From the outside looking in 'Glück' will be regarded first and foremost as a lesbian romance; I readily admit it's that premise which first drew me in. And this is indeed just what we get, with drama to follow from the trajectory and complications thereof. Like the picture's outlook on the profession, however, the romance is presented very baldly, with no build-up and no embellishment - and so it is with everything else about the feature, to be honest. In fact, Dascha Dauenhauer's quietly rich, pensive score, lending flavor to the mood of any moment, may be the one aspect to in any way dress up the proceedings. And what the film is more than anything is a tale simply of shifting dynamics between people, and complications in our lives, at the intersections of love, family, social gatherings, and a very particular kind of work. So, yes, 'Glück' is a lesbian romance, but only insofar as it's a component of the tableau before us.",/review/rw8726744/?ref_=tt_urv
