17 November 2016,Mr-Fusion,6," An imperfect joke
","When ""The Killing Joke"" is actually about the source material, it's a decent adaptation. It's dialogue-faithful, the tone is good, and really, if they've gotten Conroy and Hamill as the two leads, you know they're taking this seriously. And that infamous scene is incredibly effective.",/review/rw5904193/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2016,Rendanlovell,4," A bland retelling of a powerful novel
","One of the most acclaimed graphic novels of all time has now come to the big screen. Not only is this one of the most acclaimed novels ever but it's one of the most controversial. The story is basically an origin tale for the infamous Batman villain, The Joker. When this movie was initially announced back at the beginning of 2016 there was some serious hype surrounding it. Especially when it received an R rating. One thing that really made me nervous though was how quickly this actually released. Obviously, it could've been in production long before it was announced back at the beginning of the year, but after seeing the film, I don't think that's the case.",/review/rw5904193/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2016,Quinoa1984,5," the mixed bag joke
","It may seem like this is a high rating given the backlash DC animated The Killing Joke has received, however this is an averaged out rating.  In honesty this isn't a very good movie, despite the fact that when the filmmakers and adapter Brian Azzarello (do I hasten to call him a 'screenwriter' after this one credit?) stick to the original Alan Moore source it's a dark and involving delight. It's what comes before it, how they make it into a ""full movie"" that things fall apart.  This is a schizophrenic experience full of high highs, generic lows and some what the almighty Jesus bloody hell for good measure.",/review/rw5904193/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2016,timdalton007,7," Something That Could Have Been Among The Best Comic Adaptations...
","The Killing Joke (that is the graphic novel written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Brian Bolland) is considered one of the definitive Batman/Joker stories ever told. It's a controversial one to be sure as well with what Moore chose to do to one of its supporting characters. So when it was announced that it was, at last, receiving a screen adaptation, fans couldn't help but be excited. When the news came that one of the definitive Batman/Joker performance teams (Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill) were playing those roles, it was even harder to be excited. So much so that despite being slated to go straight to DVD, it received a successful yet brief cinema run as well. Was it to prove to be as successful as its original comic counterpart?

","The ogn material this adaptation was based on, was released on 1988, by Alan Moore & Bryan Bolland. It was one of the most disturbing, nightmarish made in UK stories, that gave an even more psychish tone to Joker as a character and turned (unfortunately) eventually Batgirl into Oracle.",/review/rw5904193/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2016,bob the moo,," Roundly poor
","I have read the graphic novel from which this film comes, but it has been years and I did not bring anything to this film version other than the hope that it would be a good film. I also didn't care that it got an R-rating in the US; I cannot think of a film that was 'good' simply because it was graphic, and those excited that a franchise got such a rating are really missing the point. Anyway, watching the film was a serious disappointment. The first half was dull and lacking anything that really linked to the second half in a satisfying manner. I really do not care whether or not it is in the source material, for me it was more that it was dull and disconnected. The second half I the film proper and to be fair it is better, but not as good as it needed to be.",/review/rw5904193/?ref_=tt_urv

","I am not much into Batman, but I wanted to watch this because of all the hype of it being R-rated and because I liked the trailer. It is a bit longer than an hour and in it there are only defective people. The R-ratedness was not really something that I noticed, really. Maybe because I am from Europe.

","Batman warns off his young protege Batgirl for getting too close to and complacent about the case they are involved on. Initially defiant, Batgirl subsequently reacts by having sudden impulsive sex with Batman, then by quitting as Batgirl. The Joker, looking to prove that takes merely a single bad experience to push someone into madness (as evidenced by the tragedy of his own origin), shoots Barbara Gordon (Batgirl) and pralyses, then kidnaps her father Commissioner Gordon and taunts him with pictures of his daughter, naked and damaged. But Gordon does not break, and directs Batman to bring The Joker in by the book.",/review/rw5904193/?ref_=tt_urv

","Batman: The Killing Joke is a bad adaptation of an iconic story. It's brought down by the prolonged prologue which is boring, generic and has characters do things that are very out of character and uncomfortable. The prologue also takes up the majority of the run time. By then the last 30 mins, which are actually quite good and faithful to the source material and the great performances from Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy, aren't enough to save it.",/review/rw5904193/?ref_=tt_urv

2 January 2017,thesuperskamaster,6," It should have been the best Batman movie...
","I have to admit, I was a little disappointed in this one. Which is frustrating, because as a whole it was actually pretty good, but there were some problems that really should not have been there. The Killing Joke is my all-time favorite graphic novel. I have read and re-read it dozens of times, so when I heard DC was making a Killing Joke movie, I was ecstatic. When I heard they got Kevin Conroy (the one true Batman) and Mark Hamill (the best Joker ever) for it? I literally ran around squeeing with joy-- and I'm a grown man. When I caught wind of the special, one-night-only event to see it in theaters? I pulled out my wallet and got tickets, because my favorite Batman thing ever was going to be a movie. It's never fair to expect perfection of a movie adaptation, so I let myself go along for the ride as it started with a Batgirl story. I nodded, thinking ""Cool, this'll set up the Killing Joke stuff that happens with her to have more emotional weight."" And it should have, but then it went in a direction I still feel very uncomfortable with every time I think about it-- spoiler: Batman and Batgirl have sex. Okaaaaayyyy.... Yeah, no, that should only happen in the context of Dick Grayson being Batman when Bruce has disappeared. There is an uncomfortably large age gap, it's not true to the characters, and it's just weird. Even though the story keeps showing us Barbara wanting it, it's still not right because of everything about who they are as characters. Then, after that... interesting... encounter, we move into the actual Killing Joke turf. I will say that section was well-adapted and definitely worth watching. But another complaint about this movie is that the art quality was very inconsistent, and often was downright bad. Did I expect it to look exactly like the graphic novel? No. But did I want it to be at least on the higher-quality end of the scale for DC animated movies? Of course I did, and it was probably the worst looking one to date.",/review/rw5904193/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's been awhile since I read the graphic novel but when I found out they were making an animated movie based on the book, I was excited, I couldn't wait to see it then when I found out it was being shown on HBO & not The Cartoon Network like I expected it was going to be, I was even more excited.I thought it was going to be (For some stupid reason) exactly like the graphic novel.I guess it's true, the book is always better than the movie.Watching Batman: The Killing Joke was like watching an episode/movie of Batman: The Animated Series but with sex & extreme violence.This movie was not for the kids.Since it was more like watching Batman: The Animated Series, the sex & extreme violence felt unnecessary.It didn't add anything to the movie at all.If this movie was supposed to be based on the graphic novel then they should've stuck to the story.At times I also found the movie to be boring.When it was over, the only thing I felt was disappointment.There are kid friendly Batman animated movies that are a million times better than this 1.I suggest watching any of them or picking up the graphic novel instead",/review/rw5904193/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2020,freemantle_uk,7," Great looking adaptation
","Based on Alan Moore's graphic novel, The Killing Joke was a brilliant animated film with some of the best action sequences in a DC Animated film. But when that's the first thing I can say about the film then it proves that there is something wrong with it. The Killing Joke was bogged down by a 30 minute prologue just to show Barbara Gordon quitting as Batgirl and all the violence and swearing felt like the filmmakers desperately trying to prove how adult their story was. When the film does go into The Killing Joke storyline it was a faithful adaptation of the graphic novel.",/review/rw5904193/?ref_=tt_urv
