9 June 2022,FeastMode,4," Interestingly weird but extremely dull
","This movie starts out great, with an awesomely dark opening scene to set the mood. It's really weird immediately and reaches high levels of grossness, but I surprisingly dug it. In many movies set in the future, it really isn't much different except for the technology and a few aesthetics. But here, we see a really interesting depiction of where humanity ends up, some of which I find scarily possible.",/review/rw8198287/?ref_=tt_urv

4 June 2022,cgearheart,5," The synopsis
","Mortensen plays a grunting Sith Lord with acid reflux who's constantly playing with himself. Then they talk about organs or something and sex but there's never any sex and then Kristen Stewart appears a few times as a nervous crying lady who's turned on by Mortensen. And then there's subplots about child murder, poisonous candy bars, a dinosaur bone high chair that feeds you crappy raviolis, and a whole lot of other whacky stuff. Also Lea Seydoux is there and she helps cut Mortensen up. I really didn't understand it but I sure had fun explaining it.",/review/rw8198287/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2022,kevin_robbins,8," The entire movie feels like it is building up to a worthwhile and tremendous climax that the film never hits; but conceptually, this is brilliant
",Crimes of the Future (2022) is a movie my wife and I saw in theatres last night. The storyline follows a future where surgery and pain is the new sex. In the future they don't feel pain so they push the limits of the human body. They've gone so far in their experiments the human body has begun to evolve in new ways science has never seen and the government wishes to hide from society. Underground observations has become the rage to whiteness surgeries that explore the human body and its evolution.,/review/rw8198287/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2022,Victor_Fallon,5," Nice idea barely explored.
","Some people in the future muck about with their saucy organs and that's about it. Some of the effects and prosthetics are creative, but some of them are bobbins.",/review/rw8198287/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2022,Xstal,3," Rotten to the Core...
","An extremely dystopian look at the future, full of scalpels, tattooed growths but not enough suture, the metaphors perish, no personas to cherish, synthetic, superficial, fascicle culture.",/review/rw8198287/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2022,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,9," Thought-provoking and original sci-fi with fresh ideas that you have to go along with 100%; a true work of art.
","Crimes of the Future is an original and thought-provoking sci-fi arthouse film, featuring great performances from Léa Seydoux, Viggo Mortensen and Kristen Stewart.",/review/rw8198287/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2022,eagandersongil,7," Surgery is the new sex. The depreciation of the natural.
","""crimes of the future"" is an efficient film, it does a lot with little, without big sets and gigantic practical effects, everything is very simple but very convincing, the scenery compositions are dirty with a dark photograph, always looking for an intrinsic degradation, the effects practical are good, the few CGI are weak, but the sound editing is magnificent, always looking for sounds that seek the viewer's discomfort, another positive point is the performances, the duo Vigo mortise and Léa Seydoux are very good, Viggo manages to show all the pain and anguish of her character with her body and vocal posture, Kristen is another highlight, making an anxious and paranoid character the actress delivers a very good performance, despite her little screen time, but the best point here, I bring the classic and brilliant Canadian director, david cronenberg, is his script, which, despite being a little confusing, has as its main premise the limit of art, its contradictions and subversive appreciations, its criminal lity, and with that it makes a self-reflection of its own filmography, the film is also a critique of state bureaucracy and government intervention in art, all on a derogatory dystopian futuristic science fiction plan. The feature has some problems, the biggest one is perhaps the subtexts that are open and not always completed. We don't have the best version of Cronenberg here, but his style remains authorial and inviting. Grade 7/10.",/review/rw8198287/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2022,danew13,5," Hard to Watch,and You Wonder Why You Did
",This flick is off the wall even for Cronenberg. And I'm amazed that such well known actors made this dark and almost plotless film.,/review/rw8198287/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2022,MamadNobari97,2," What Was the Point Exactly?
","And I don't want to go to YT and watch a 20-minute video explaining to me the ""deep"" and philosophical themes and ideas of this movie. If a movie can't even in the tiniest way tell me itself what it's actually about, then something is wrong and I don't consider that a good movie. And I'm not talking about movies with actual mindbending plots that you have to watch or read an explanation to get the ending and the story, I'm talking about the movie that doesn't even try to hint at what it actually wants to say. So if I didn't enjoy the story, if I didn't enjoy the way the movie is shot, and if I didn't even enjoy the acting of everyone in this world who act like complete weirdos, and if I didn't like the weird and confusing dialogue, and I only kinda liked the music and some of the body horror stuff, I can't really give it a high or even a mediocre rating.",/review/rw8198287/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2022,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,8," A surprisingly pleasant return to form from Cronenberg!
",A lot of people are passionately disliking this film and I'm not really sure what they were expecting. Have they forgotten what classic Cronenberg films are actually like? Have they lost the plot in their own skewed fantasy of a David Cronenberg film that's been distorted over years of non-exposure while his ever-emboldening reputation only feeds each delusional individual's twisted perception of his filmography?,/review/rw8198287/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2023,Sleepin_Dragon,6," Interesting, slow at times, shocking in parts.
","It's actually quite hard to piece together what the plot is, my basic interpretation, is that performing artist Saul is willing to undergo next step surgery, a Dystopian future, where people seemingly no longer feel any pain.",/review/rw8198287/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2022,nicolasroop,2," Cronenberg has lost his touch in this absolute bore of a film
","Well, that was a complete waste of my time. Talk about a movie that is equally as weird as it is boring. There is so much going on, yet nothing is happening at the same time, and not a single bit of it is explained well enough to grasp. David Cronenberg has officially lost his touch as a filmmaker. Not to mention this one might win an award for the worst cinematography ever put to screen. A vast majority of the scenes were so dark that I couldn't see what was on screen and I felt like I was just staring at silhouettes of characters talking. Combine that with some really terrible cgi and you've got a recipe for the ugliest movie ever made. The only strong aspect the film has going for it is the acting. You can tell the actors really gave it their all with the material they were given. Overall, the film felt like a complete waste, and a half baked effort on behalf of the director. There is definitely a reason as to why I was the only one in the theater for this one. Also, for the preview to make this film out to be so disturbing, I can assure you it is not. Hell, it's even very light on the blood and gore, which the preview built up as well. Majorly disappointed in that category. I can recommend this film for people who want to take a nap, it will definitely put you to sleep. 1 fleshy instrument out of 5.",/review/rw8198287/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2022,ashfordofficial,1," Conflicted
","Overall confusing because it has a lot of futuristic terms that is pretty vague and hard to understand. The pacing was slow and character interactions were all weird and bland. The story was nonsensical, I couldn't connect or engage with it. I didn't liked most of the performances because of the soulless dialogue delivery. It seems some cast members picked randomly without an audition.",/review/rw8198287/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2022,RebelPanda,8," Misunderstood
","I was in shock after this ended. All I could do was sit there and watch the credits roll. When I finally walked out, the usher said ""Wow, you survived,"" because multiple people walked out early. ""Survived"" is a very appropriate word for this, it's not something you watch, but endure. I get the strong sensation that Cronenberg is disillusioned with modern film and wanted to make his own attempt at progressing the art medium forward. With all of the discussion of corpses, body parts, and conflating art with mutilation, the message comes across clearly. The ""Crimes of the Future"" the title refers to are embracing the evolution of art and mutating human anatomy.",/review/rw8198287/?ref_=tt_urv

3 June 2022,ferguson-6,7," Don't spill
","Greetings again from the darkness. So, what happens when society evolves to the point that pain barely exists? Well, of course, people will then desire pain for pleasure and will go to extremes to experience the new forbidden bruised fruit. Anyone familiar with filmmaker David Cronenberg's 40+ year career is already anticipating 'what else' the master of 'body horror' and twisted provocations will add to the proceedings. And the answer is ... plenty.",/review/rw8198287/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2022,ReadingFilm,1," why is Viggo walking around in a ninja costume?
","That should be renamed crimes against humanity. The director is just getting off in his old age, putting naked young girls on screen. Good for him. But it is clear to me Cronenberg detests life, humanity, any kind of spiritual existence, and just twists the subjective universe into grotesque tangents. I prefer to see the beauty of life. To elevate rather than put down. Problem is we are in a Cronenberg world now already, so none of this is satire. The true movie would have everyone being horrified at the grotesqueness of beautiful, blonde, white, chiseled people, while the goblins in the crowd gasp and faint.",/review/rw8198287/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2022,tevernaugh-76446,3," Dull and lack luster... a lot of missed potential
",This is a cool concept but it was poorly executed and the story was not told very well. The visuals weren't as great as it was advertised and then the movie just suddenly ends without anything worth while happening. Overall it left me questioning whether this whole movie even needed to be made...the concept will draw you in but there is nothing that really holds your attention.,/review/rw8198287/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2022,rockinwaffles,1," I honestly don't know how this is rated so highly right now.
","This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time. I went in not having watched a trailer or reading anything about it because trailers these days give so much away, and I like Cronenberg, so I was down for a sci-fi film with elements of horror. I don't know what I just watched. The first five minutes, my jaw was on the floor and I was ready to leave if it continued like that. It made me expect something along the lines of Mother or Climax. The rest of the movie? Terrible CGI effects, bad acting from Viggo Mortensen, story elements that made zero sense and way too much exposition about the wrong things. This movie came across as incredibly pretentious, it felt like a bunch of half thought out ideas, it tried to be shocking for the sake of it. It seemed like a film an art student made with a small studio budget. One scene looked like it could be a Chemical Brothers music video. This is the first movie I've seen in a long time that's genuinely bad. It's not even so bad it's good, it's just BAD.",/review/rw8198287/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2022,robinmaes-06129,1," Don't believe the hype.

26 June 2022,jtindahouse,4," A Complete miss
","David Cronenberg films are very hit and miss for me. When he's good, he's great. When it's bad though it is usually terrible. 'Crimes of the Future' is a case of the latter. I don't know what this film was supposed to be but it missed on every level.",/review/rw8198287/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2022,robertt-76462,6," A Metaphorical Look At Ourselves
","My thoughts on ""Crimes"" is more of a deep-dive into the metaphorical meanings within Cronenberg's on-the-nose, satirical (albeit horrific) and sometimes humorous view of modern-day technology (ex: eating chair, sleeping bed, autopsy bed), exhibitionism and voyeurism (ex: Saul, Caprice, Timlin, two women with drills), pop culture (ex: Klinik/Ear Man, others), celebrity status (Saul and Caprice), and ultimately the ""plastic"" society that we have become (ex: plastic eaters, non-plastic eaters, and those ""evolving"" into eating plastic. There are also the ""policing agencies"" (Cope, Wippet, Timlin) that tries to regulate and/or terminate humanities permanent decline into a meaningless existence of seeking out ever-greater, ""shocking"" sensualities (ex: government's attempts to regulate social media and the moral decline of society).",/review/rw8198287/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2022,Lockout_Salties,8," More thought-provoking than disturbing, but a solid watch regardless
","After eight years, Cronenberg is finally back with the simple premise: what if humans could no longer feel pain? And, for the most part, he's able to expand on this idea to create one of his most interesting features, and a very welcome return to cinema. It's certainly a movie to avoid if you want something flat-out scary, but if you're looking for something more idea-driven, this could be a great watch.",/review/rw8198287/?ref_=tt_urv
