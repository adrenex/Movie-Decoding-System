4 October 2021,jamdub-61934,2," Open your wallet 50!
","First episode showed promise for the first 30 minutes. Then came the club scene! Cheaply done! This is what Power suffered from early on but with better acting and a stronger script it survived. They need to put the money into the production and script. Scenes with 2-3 people in them, no volume background shots to add that believable ambience, no spacing and pacing to the direction. And the club scene had maybe 20 people walking around. You could see that the same people were walking around in circles on camera. If this is a scene which shows a poppin club night for a big guy in the dope game, come on?! I know Starz Paid 50 but he isn't putting it into his production. 2nd episode had us laughing. Again, cheaply made, poor acting and unbelievable script.",/review/rw7385433/?ref_=tt_urv

","First season was mildly entertaining,thought forgettable being written with so many stereotypes and tropes and being formulaic.",/review/rw7385433/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2021,darrel076,3," Laughable.
",This show has skipped every detail of what they are doing and glossed over the rest. The way they do everything is wrong. I don't think think anyone writing has even seen drugs before. With bad acting and bad writing atkeast the show isn't realistic. It's consistent in that way.,/review/rw7385433/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2021,jstrlxeh,2," Had Such High Hopes
","I had such high hopes for this series. I barely made it through the first episode and only lasted for about 20 minutes of the second. I just found it boring and very poorly acted. Not to mention every second word was the ""n"" word. It got extremely tiresome to listen to after the 2000th time.",/review/rw7385433/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2021,wivavog,1," Not gangster , GROSS!
","I love 99% of gangster shows and movies. Dont care about color. This is a big waste of time and money. Only people making out. Are the networks and associates. Getting paid well for ruining modern tv lol. This MIGHT be based on someone's life. But who cares honestly. Trillions have lived. I think they could of found a story. Better then this with ease. Esp given the time they chose and being based ini NEWYORK. Not like anything more interesting happened there. Doesn't have the qualities of any successful show. Such as good actors ( might be ok in other things.) , good execution , a good foundation, good directing , writing, ect! Seems like all there efforts and depth. Go into the absolutely disgusting sex scenes. Which helps the story line how? I mean if you want to watch porn watch porn. Tired of every show acting like the more sex the more woke you are..... Just pathetic and really shows off the industries inability to write quality entertainment. Without 98% filler. I guess they think everyone is just a bunch of sheep. Willing to pay extra for any trash. While not saying anything. Wait, that's what's been going on...... America what happen to self respect ? We look ignorant across the world for many reasons we can solve with ease! I thought we were better then this. But , keep getting proved wrong. Very sad times. But if all that turns you on. Then this show is for you!",/review/rw7385433/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2021,ThomasJ_9120,2," BMF trying to be the next Power , low bar to set
",This show has the worst lead and supporting actors I've ever seen aside from a D list movie or some cheap 70s porn movie. 50 Cent should stick to making music because making want to be gangster shows isn't something he's good at The bad acting is only the beginning of BMFS Problems.,/review/rw7385433/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2021,cornydanielson,3," Off to a bad start
",Throughout the duration of the episode I couldn't help but notice how bad the acting was and how cliche and poorly paced the episode was as well. The dialogue is often pretty corny and left me laughing most of the time but I'll be tuning in to see if maybe to gets better from here.,/review/rw7385433/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2021,ThaRider,2," Lil Meech
","He cannot act.!! Easy word actor of the whole series. He's trying too hard and it is awful. It appears since he's playing his father he has to have the most lines and his ""acting"" is terrible!! He talks likes he has mush in his mouth! Not saying much for the guy that plays Terry at least he has more acting experience but he's not very convincing as the character.",/review/rw7385433/?ref_=tt_urv

5 October 2021,mimiybyazphil,3," Tacky, and Sad!
","I hate to agree with the low reviewers but this
show is tacky! Bad acting, inconsistent lines,like calling a child Zoe one second and
ZOEY the next! Even the theme song is irratating! Why Tasha Smith, the Queen of ""Ghetto Babymamas""
tried her hand at directing escapes me!",/review/rw7385433/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2021,iangoga,1," Worst Series Ever! Big Disappointment
","W T F... I was looking forward to this. It looks cheap, filmed with an 1980's camera , Actors can't act, it looks forced and just awkward! Worst series I've ever watched. Wow...",/review/rw7385433/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2022,ajikude,3," boring.. generic..not close to Power series
",Just boring.. very bored..its not Power or Power Book or Raising Kanan good... Very generic.. The actiing js mediocre.... the script is boring.. Many flat spots... the script is boring...i really have to force myself to watch this... The editing ia bad...The costume looks kinda authentic thats the only plus... But too generic.... Almost fell asleep.. No yense gripping moments .. The cinematography is mediocre... how did this score over a 7.0? Even with nothing else on it's boring... too many flat boring scenese... the dialogue is corny.. the script is predictable... the sound editing is really mediocre too..,/review/rw7385433/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2021,tombradyhomes,3," Could be a decent show but....
",Could be a decent show but the actor playing Meech is terrible. Seems like the other actors are professional at least. The story is way to superficial and full of non-violence bs. Fleshing out the characters would have helped along with adding more scenes of crime and business. Hard to get past Meech's acting though.,/review/rw7385433/?ref_=tt_urv

5 October 2021,santurcedc,1," BMF Is Degrading To The Black Community

8 October 2021,arpyrealestate,3," Acting is Bad and Story is rushed and Weak
","I fell asleep on the first episode twice, this is show is boring and cliche. Everything is just cliche, especially after coming off of shows like Snowfall and Raising Kanan. And the acting...it's subpar. These poor lead guys were not ready at all, especially the young Big Meech role. They needed a lot more work to be cohesive and convincing. It's like watching them screen test on the final take..yawn.",/review/rw7385433/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2021,yeezyclout,2," Cliche - Take away BMF title and we wouldn't care
","The series is bad. Bad acting, the baby father is the one of the few decent actors on the series. Outside of that it's very cliche, predictable, low budget and when I say low budget understand that I'm not speaking monetary. I mean low budget in the sense of creativity, effort and poor continuity. I've seen big budget blockbusters that look cheap and I've seen indie small budget films look all time amazing. This series had so much potential. The biggest mistake is basing it in the past, because the entire BMF story that most are familiar with was Meech as an adult and the over the top lifestyle. So at some point they will have to evolve to modern day 2000s unless they continue to do poorly written flash backs. It doesn't make sense to stretch this debacle past story for 3-4 seasons then progress to modern day with adult meech. The series is a "" hot mess"".",/review/rw7385433/?ref_=tt_urv

29 September 2021,brandonneicke,9," Very good
","Very good show. I like the writing and directing. Story is based off a true story and of course it's been done before and to be honest this isn't overly original just yet. However the actors are good, the writing is good and I like the directing. Lil meech definitely can act. Very impressed.",/review/rw7385433/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2021,elliotjeory,7," The Lamar show
","Even though this is about big Meech, I don't like his character, I think Lamar is the best character, he's the OG. Plus, Meech swears too much. So much he's incoherent. Also has some corny story to it that doesn't help. Either make it gangster or don't.",/review/rw7385433/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2021,mbenzicron,1," Didn't anything for me.
","My nephew suggested I see this show because I enjoyed POWER, but after watching two episodes of BMF, I got bored with it and stopped watching. That show wasn't as good as POWER. Wasn't as good as Power.",/review/rw7385433/?ref_=tt_urv

11 November 2021,selketentr,1," Can't Follow
","Too much cursing....too much use of ebonics... I don't know what they are talking about. Turned on close caption, but that didn't help. Too difficult to follow. And, too dark. Not enough lighting. Story line seems hopeless for all characters involved. Every week dark, hopeless situations.",/review/rw7385433/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2021,trimblair,1," Another series about black gangsters

27 September 2021,wjosephjorob,9," Fear as Strength
","First of all, this program got off to a good start, the actors all have great chemistry, that's important also it's not playing out like a soap opera, while the story is episodic, the socio-economic theme of poverty rears it's ugly head and make two young men choose a path where most men dread going, fear is a monster, you don't know how it will strike at you, it's like a thief in the night, some people grasp it and use to conquer their goals, episode one touched on that issue quite a bit, I liked what I saw so far, 50 CENT continues to bring to the public interesting crime dramas that resonate to fans of that genre.",/review/rw7385433/?ref_=tt_urv
