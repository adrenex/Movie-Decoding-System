28 July 2018,planktonrules,8," This one surprised me.
","When I saw ""Open Season"", my first impression was that the film looked a bit substandard compared to the higher quality Pixar movies which preceded it. While this opinion didn't change much during the course of the movie, I was surprised that I ended up really liking it anyway. Why? Because the writing was so good...and it's worth seeing.",/review/rw4678489/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2006,Smells_Like_Cheese,10," Are you kidding me?! 5.5?! I had so much fun watching Open Season!
","I was very much looking forward to seeing Open Season on it's first weekend, but I was a bit worried when I saw only a 5.5 on IMDb, because normally, most of the users are right about these movies. But my friends and I still wanted to see this fun looking picture, so we saw it tonight and may I say that I am surprised by you IMDb users who didn't like this film, everyone is entitled to an opinion, I agree. But seriously, how could you not like this film? It has amazing animation, fun characters, and hilarious jokes for kids as well as adults! ",/review/rw4678489/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2018,cricketbat,9," I hope my kids like it as much as I do.
","Maybe I'm a little forgiving of this movie because of the positive memories it's associated with, but I really do think that Open Season is an entertaining film for parents and children. It has a number of jokes that make me laugh each time I watch it. I hope my kids like it as much as I do.",/review/rw4678489/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2006,bsmithindian,10," Great movie, quit bashing it!!!
","I can't understand what everyone is fussing about this film for. I saw it on the IMAX 3D and I honestly thought it was hilarious. I caught myself laughing out loud on many occasions. Seriously, this film is not ""violent"" by any means. To me, I really felt relieved to see some humor and scenes similar to the old Looney Tunes cartoons that used to be considered great, but are now considered evil and horrible.",/review/rw4678489/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2020,Breumaster,6," I Like Those Two Animated Underdogs
","This movie was released in 2006, so the animations are not up to date, but still watchable. I like styl of the figures and the simple but lovely characters they made. Some jokes are silly, but there are enough jokes for the whole family. I guess it is mainly made for children at the age of 6 to 10 years. Some jokes are only for the parents, so they can have an entertaining time, too. It's no milestone, there were several better animated movies inbetween, like e.g. 'Inside Out' or 'Wreck-It Ralph'. Compareable animated movies about friendship are a dozen each year. In this case I like the two underdogs Boog, the civilized Bear and Elliot the looser elk, who build a partnership to survive in the woods. It's an unequal team like Stan and Ollie. I would recommend that for families with children between 6 to 10 years old. It's a nice movie for rainy days.",/review/rw4678489/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2006,DICK STEEL,5," A Nutshell Review: Open Season
","OK, this year alone probably saw a record number of talking animal animations, with countless of punchlines filled with pop culture references, and big name stars attached to the projects, that it's about time we give the genre a good break, rather than churning them out continuously with more misses than hits.",/review/rw4678489/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2018,treykrumel,9," very good movie for kids alike
","I have to say this show stayed completely flawless when it first came out. what was especially intelligent is the writing which makes so much sense and it is also relatable. characters are funny and unique in their own way. the pilot wasn't that dull but rather exciting. I really do wish they would do at least a open season 3 for my flavor and for everyone else would consider this to be as satisfying.
9/10 quality entertainment and family fun.",/review/rw4678489/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2006,amarosi,7," See It In IMAX 3D
","The kids loved it, and I was not bored, and that is more than what you usually end up with these days. The 3D IMAX is truly amazing, if you are already paying the theater admission then IMAX is definitely the way to go. The story is not original, to say the least, but they know it and keep it short. I liked the voice talent, although this ""the wiener dog has a German accent"" thing gets old fast. A lot of people seem to hate this one with a vengeance (look at the distribution of the votes with all those people giving 1), but it still gets a 5.5 average, so that gives you a pretty good idea. This is no Incredibles by any means, but the two little girls I took enjoyed it a heck of a lot more than Cars. Mostly harmless family fun with a few bathroom jokes thrown in: enjoy!",/review/rw4678489/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2020,dilipbts,9," Open season
","Matin Lawrence and Ashton Kutcher rock as the big bear ""Boog"" and the comic sidekick deer ""Elliot"". Unfortunately, the story was bland and the jokes were only mildly funny, so it will not be one of the best kids movies you're going to see this year. The ""Laugh out loud"" index was maybe a 5-10 (laughs per movie). ""Over the Hedge"" was closer to 20-30 for comparative purposes. ""Boog"" and ""Elliot"" were well played. The Scottish squirrels, Beavers and Rabbits were funny, but the rest of the characters didn't make much of an impression. Although somewhat entertaining, it was quickly forgotten after we left the theater (with the exception of the Austin Powers like shadow scene behind the curtain). If you need to take the kids out to a movie, this is funny enough to make it worthwhile, but don't get your expectations up to high.",/review/rw4678489/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2006,sacoody,9," Martin Lawrence and Ashton Kutcher strike again.
","I laughed so much through this movie I know I will have to see it twice because I had to have missed some of the funny parts. Very clean, which was surprising since Lawrence was in it, but so worth the time I spent watching it. It breaks your heart when Beth has to leave Boog in the woods but to see him overcome all the obstacles thrown in his path, is very amusing from the eyes of an animal. Aston Kutcher was hilarious as Eliot. I didn't realize he could be so funny and amusing. This movie I highly recommend to anyone with children regardless of their ages, if you want to spend time with your children in a clean environment. I intend to go back and take my neighbors children to see it also.",/review/rw4678489/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2014,Seraphion,6," Quite a good entertainment, but not more than that
","The story is nice, looking at hunting activity from the perspective of the ones being hunted. It is also being developed well with having additional complications. But the whole thing doesn't seem to hold together. The funny stuff doesn't really get funny. Martin Lawrence and Ashton's Kutcher's effort for crazy voices did just a little to help the movie to be funny. One strange thing I notice is that only Elliot, the one-antler goofed up mule deer that is the animal which stands on his rear feet beside Boog the Grizzly bear. It's quite normal to see bears and smaller critters like rabbits, squirrels and skunks portrayed standing on their rear feet because bear do that in reality. But concerning Elliot, he is the only other big animal who does that, while the other mule deer, including his love interest Giselle, stands on all four legs.",/review/rw4678489/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2006,KungFu-tse,6," Knock-off of every CGI animated movie previously released.
","I'd have to agree with the critics on this one. When you release so many CGI movies with talking animals, there is a point at which mediocrity becomes common place. Open Season is no exception.",/review/rw4678489/?ref_=tt_urv

15 October 2006,rlnutt,8," It's cute... plain and simple!
","OK... I'm a hunter and I usually roll my eyes at animators with their anti-hunting stance. The ones that make the hunters look like jerks and the animals are much smarter and more in tune with nature... blah, blah, blah! ",/review/rw4678489/?ref_=tt_urv

","What's a 'unihorn' you may ask? Well, it's a deer that only has one antler, of course. And you'll only see one in the new Sony Pictures Animation film, Open Season, starring Martin Lawrence, Debra Messing, Ashton Kutcher, Gary Sinise, Jon Favreau, and many more.",/review/rw4678489/?ref_=tt_urv

2 October 2006,janeroo,9," Great animal welfare message!
","Way beyond Elmer Fudd vs. Bugs Bunny (I keep reading reviews saying ""been there, done that"")! Not only was it a very cute, entertaining flick, but what a wonderful message regarding animals - anti-hunting, respect their territory and don't try to domesticate what is not meant to be domesticated, even a plug for spay/neuter when they point out Mr. Weenie is ""fixed"". The animation was good - aside from one or two odd looking creatures (the little doe), I thought they were cute. And the campiness of the scenes added a little something different. All the actors who did voices did a terrific job. I am not a Martin Lawrence fan, but he rocked as Boog. And Ashton as Elliot was hysterical. It's no ""Finding Nemo"" or ""Toy Story"" but for a cute flick one afternoon, it's better than expected. Enjoy!",/review/rw4678489/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2010,TheLittleSongbird,7," Fun movie
","I will admit Open Season isn't outstanding, but it was likable and fun. It is too short however, there are some predictable parts in the story and it occasionally feels too rushed. That said, it looks wonderful, with some lovely backgrounds and colours and the character designs are agreeable. The soundtrack is cool, the script has its funny moments with some of the more adult humour decently done and enough wit to satisfy anybody and the characters are likable especially Grizzly. Also the voice acting is surprisingly good, I was surprised at some of the choices(ie. Billy Connolly) of those to do the voices but all breathed life more than adequately to these fun characters. Overall I liked it, it was flawed yes but it was fun, that's all that matters at the end of the day. 7/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw4678489/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2008,Naylie,10," Perfect Movie! Perfect cast! Perfect everything!
","A lot of times, we have our point of views on movies and stuff that don't always agree with the other person or it may do depending how you see it, but I can't argue with this. On September 29 2006, Sony Pictures has brought us the first animated feature and that film is Open Season. Successful or not, I don't care what people say. I believe in movies and movies should be love with respect! The story starts out about a 900 pound grizzly bear named Boog who was raised in the small town of Timberline by a pretty park ranger named Beth. His life takes a turn when he encounters a fun-loving one single antler mule deer named Elliot who is full of energy and high spirit. The movie follows them on their adventure through the woods, but a hunter named Shaw is on their trail from preventing them to get back home.",/review/rw4678489/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2022,aidanratesmovies,7," Far from great, but quite fun
","Although it's beginning is pretty mediocre and its fish out of water formula can feel predictable at times- Open Season manages to be a very entertaining and often pretty funny little animated endeavor. Being the first film from Sony Pictures animation, I was honestly surprised at how little effort was made to make this a big franchise like Toy Story for Pixar, Shrek for Dreamworks, or hell even Hoodwinked had a sequel that made it to theaters! Somehow though, this franchise truly ended up getting the boot with nothing but straight to DVD sequels and quite horrible ones at that. Thinking back on how awful the third one was that I accidentally caught year ago on Cartoon Network, I had some serious doubts about the quality of this one going in. Its beginning is incredibly lackluster, perhaps the most generic buildup I have ever seen for an animated film- which is quite shocking because once the film gets going- it pulls a total 180 and manages to be quite fun. I enjoyed the look of the animals and creatures throughout, and found its animation style a little dated but quite fun to watch- certainly pretty good for the time. The plot has its ups and downs and ends up feeling like a bit of a discount Over the Hedge at times, but some of the jokes throughout are absolutely hilarious- not to mention it's incredibly wild moments (especially with its fight scene at the end), and a surprisingly touching ending that surprisingly somehow made me cry. In the end, Open Season isn't no masterpiece, nor does it challenge Sony's other great works like Arthur Christmas or even Surf's Up, but it does manage to be a rather good watch and certainly deserves less hate than what it got.",/review/rw4678489/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2006,quest4748,10," Wild, wild life!
","I saw an advance screening of ""Open Season"" earlier this evening (the only advance screening I've ever been to that started at 6pm, which must've been done so kids could see it and still get home at a decent hour).",/review/rw4678489/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2007,cybertigger1,6," Cute, a few laughs, nothing original
","I saw this movie today and I have to disagree with those who compare it to ""The Incredibles"" or ""Cars."" It's only slightly above average and not in any way original. There are a couple of laugh-out-loud scenes: When Boog and Elliot are fighting behind stage curtains and to the audience who can see only their shadows on the curtain, it looks as if Boog is gutting Elliot and splashing blood everywhere (actually the ""guts"" are ropes Elliot is tangled up in, and the ""blood"" is paint); and the scene where Elliot is explaining to Boog how to go to the bathroom in the woods, and suddenly just lets go with a stream of deer nuggets (thank heavens they don't show the grizzly dropping his droppings, though).",/review/rw4678489/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2006,BlackCat725,7," A funny, sweet film!
","I saw this over the weekend with five 9-year-old boys, three 40ish adults and my 72-year-old mom. We ALL enjoyed it and thought it was cute and funny! It's too bad that it had to be released at the tail end of a year with so many other animated movies, but I think this one holds up against any of them for entertainment value. I thought the voice casting was great, and I LOVED the music. It was a simple story that you know is all going to work out in the end, but that's just fine with me. If I want complexity and angst and dark endings, I'll go see something else. ",/review/rw4678489/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2007,Reineke86,10," One Of The Best Animated Movies Ever
","""Open Season"" uses more adult and over-the-edge-humor than any other animated movie in the last few years. The characters are great. Much better than some animated side kicks we've seen this year. Ashton Kutcher, Martin Lawrance and Billy Conelly did a great job and also the music in this picture is very well chosen. The animation is brilliant and some shots will clearly blow your mind.",/review/rw4678489/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2019,rsv-20605,9," very well executed movie, I enjoyed every minute of it.
","In Open Season, a movie filled with fun and adventure, we see the bond between a local park ranger and her bear named Boog grow strong. But when Boog becomes a little too big to be living in the neighborhood, he has to be transported by helicopter into the scary wilderness. As he tries to adjust his lifestyle from being pampered to living on his own, he meets many animal friends, one being a deer named Elliot, who tries his best to teach Boog the ways of the wild. All in all, i felt that the movie had subpar animations but had great acting to portray the message of the protection of wildlife and exploring the outside world.
One scene that really portrayed the message of protecting Wildlife was when the antagonist of the story, Shaw, an evil hunter who will do anything to rack up kills even if it means killing the most beloved animals, tries to kill a deer on the road by running it over in the middle of broad day light. The way Elliot the deer explains his fear or being hunted and the way it has affected him was said kind of made me realize that illegal hunting is actually something that goes on nowadays, maybe not specifically in Hawaii, but other states, whether it be in local forests or refuge parks like the one in the movie. it also made me realized that there are people like Shaw out there in this world that continue to hunt illegally with the intention of building up pride and this movie did a perfect job of portraying that.",/review/rw4678489/?ref_=tt_urv
