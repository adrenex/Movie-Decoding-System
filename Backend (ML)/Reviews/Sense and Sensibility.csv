15 November 2020,filipemanuelneto,5," Rewrite the history of the most iconic pharaoh of Ancient Egypt.
","Personally, and although I like to watch it, I have a lot of itchiness with films and TV series based on historical material. They usually end up having so little rigor in the way they show the past and the real historical characters that they become worthy of my hatred or my disdain, as a historian. This series is another one, with an aggravating tone: we don't know as much as we wanted about Tutankhamun's life. In fact, as far as we know, Tutankhamun is one of the most unlit pharaohs of the dynasty to which he belonged. The story of his father, Akhenaten, is much more interesting in that he led a serious religious conflict in the heart of Egypt, a country where Pharaoh was also head of the state religion. However, it is not possible to escape the fascination that this young king has on us. He is, with his funerary mask, the face of Ancient Egypt.",/review/rw3281407/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2015,kols,9," A pleasant surprise
","Saw the trailer on the same day Tut premiered on Spike and watched the first episode out of little more than curiosity: What in the world could they do with a character who, despite being a twentieth century celebrity, is unknown in detail?",/review/rw3281407/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2015,vincentlynch-moonoi,7," Despite its faults, a great story nicely done...but heavily fictionalized
",I hope that people watching this realize it's pretty thin on history.,/review/rw3281407/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2015,joycekonig,9," kudos to Spike TV for a good show
","The costumes were absolutely gorgeous. The deceit, treachery and politics all seemed very apropos to today's goings on in the world. The photography was good and the scenes were engrossing. Good casting using Ben Kingsley, and the young Pharaoh was also well-cast.",/review/rw3281407/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2015,gaugeta,10," Highly Recommended
","To start the 3 part series tries to tell the story of king TUT within that 3 episode time span with the little knowledge known about the boy king.The casting was spot on and the performances were on par with what is expected from the characters especially the pharaoh.Do not look for a history lesson here since you won't be able to find it.You can find good battle scenes,nice scenery but its not for kids though for obvious reasons.",/review/rw3281407/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2015,starbase202,7," Like traveling back in time to ancient Egypt !
","I was delighted to learn of the TUT mini-series shortly prior to its start so that I did not miss it. Since I never visited Egypt before the recent Mid-East turmoils I like to see of much of its history and culture as possible on TV. This docu-drama satisfied my needs very nicely. The use of Morocco for filming was the perfect choice. And the costume and set designs, as well as make-up are worthy of Emmy awards. However, I feel that some of the acting was periodically heavy handed and should have been toned down on occasion. But I was very pleased with the end result. And hopefully, this same production company team will be able to produce such wonderful programs in the future.",/review/rw3281407/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2015,nicholls_les,8," Very Well Made and Watchable
","Sometimes we forget how good modern production values are. The sets on this mini series were outstanding and showed ancient Eygpt in it's full glory. Avan Jogia who plays Tut did a great job, he looked and acted the part brilliantly and he even stole scenes he played opposite Ben Kingsley.",/review/rw3281407/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2015,mauvemoonlight,10," Absolutely Splendid
","I would give this 20 stars if it were possible. I felt this was the best drama, with great acting, plot and action I have ever seen.",/review/rw3281407/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2015,yvonneflowers,10," Loved it!
","Loved the costumes, actors, and most of all the Pharaoh they chose! I liked the drama set up! I haven't been exited about a show in a while and this one is entertaining. I found the relationships with his high priest and his general similar to what goes on in politics today. I wish it was a series not a mini series as I'm loving the content. It is definitely not appropriate for kids though. I liked how there was a mixture of hate and anger linked to the pharaoh by everyone around him. You can never hold the spotlight too long because everybody wants it. I feel that is very humanly behavior being portrayed in these series of ""Tut"". I want to see the king in television more often he brightened my night.",/review/rw3281407/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2015,mike-ryan455,5," A poor imitation that doesn't satisfy
","Spike tried to follow a tried and true recipe that HBO has used very successfully. Pick a mysterious and fantastic time and place. Put some young, attractive people and have them unfold a great story as they have a lot of sex and violent fighting. We've all seen how incredibly successful their ""Game of Thrones"" is. They also struck gold with ""Rome"" and other epic sagas like ""The Sopranos"" and ""True Blood."" Unfortunately, Spike didn't follow all the little details of HBO's recipe that has yielded such a delicious array of guilty pleasures.",/review/rw3281407/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2015,gielvdsteenhoven,5," Missed the mark
","Ancient Eqypt is a piece of history that has been somewhat overlooked by modern day filmmakers. ""Tut"" is supposed to fill the gap, but sadly fails on a lot of levels.",/review/rw3281407/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2015,lvanhooz-54527,10," absolutely wonderful acting, well worth time to watch
","Very refreshing to watch such a well written series, wonderful actors, believable sets, and story line. Wonderful to see that there is still some quality movie making instead of some of the dribble that is being made these days. ",/review/rw3281407/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2015,lynpalmer1,7," 99% fictional account of the Boy King (Tut)
","Since very little is known about the actual life of the most famous Egyptian King in history (due to the discovery of his perfectly intact tomb and mummy)it should be stressed that this story is pure speculation and fiction. The truth, based on recent revelations, would suggest King Tut's physical appearance and abilities left a lot to be desired. Here, besides a slight limp, he is physically beautiful and somewhat of an action hero. The real Tut most likely never saw battle or ventured far from his palace. Anyway, suspend the disbelief and watch it anyway. The scenery, sets and costumes are gorgeous. The plot is the usual mix of royal back stabbing, political intrigue, murder, incest, heir to the throne story lines. A somewhat unbelievable love interest is thrown in, I guess to add more drama. And even though anyone with a basic knowledge of history knows it will not end well for the boy king, his death was still sad and touching. The boy playing Tut did a fine job, as did most of the cast here. However, there was one scene between Tut's wife/sister and her lover that made me laugh out loud. I'm pretty sure the term ""it's o.k."" was never uttered in Ancient Egypt. Did anyone else catch this? A lot more gore than I expected, especially in part 3 and some not for the kiddies sex scenes. Overall, pretty enjoyable sword and sandal romp. But somehow it makes it even sadder that we will never know the truth about the most famous Pharaoh that ever lived, at least since he was discovered in the 1920's by Howard Carter.",/review/rw3281407/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2020,valstone52,2," Waste of time.
","Why wasn't tut's mother and father portrayed? Why didn't they use his wife /sister name as it was in real life? I love everything about Egypt, but this movie really sucks. Hell lon Chaney in the mummy was better than this mess.",/review/rw3281407/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2015,edhubie-807-69066,8," Not Bad a For Made For TV Movie
",Not sure if this is Spike TVs first attempt for a TV movie but if it is it was well done. Giving the network is considered a guy's version of Lifetime it definitely had all the elements you'd expect in a movie made for fuys while appealing to the women too. Action packed battle scenes betrayal love and destiny.,/review/rw3281407/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2017,ospage,1," Another stupid, politically correct historical travesty made in USA
","Do you have jobless black actors? Are they frustrated that their ethnic group has no history? Well, don't worry! You can just fabricate some historical phantasmagoria about black Mitanni people, Tut's black wife, and a fictitious black general, and slap it together for the average North American audience. The average American just doesn't know, where Mitanni was, but he is well informed that every great historical figure born in Africa was black. Even Hannibal was black, after all. They just aired it on the History Channel! And why Tut wasn't portrayed as a black pharaoh, after all?!",/review/rw3281407/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2016,RichardvonLust,4," A trash production that trashes history
","It is difficult to describe just how bad this production is. Besides depicting interior design in 18th. Dynasty Egypt as a carbon copy of 21st. Century luxury hotels, the events described are almost entirely fabricated. ",/review/rw3281407/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2015,unpaid_movie_critic,7," ""Game of Thrones"" in Egypt
","Just watched the first episode of this TV Show. ""Tut"" (2015) seems for me a good and interesting TV Show with bunch of famous actors, fine picture and for sure with proper soundtrack. The most important thing that we as spectators should understand, is that creators of this TV Show has a lot of examples like ""Game of Thrones"" (2011 – ), ""Spartacus"" (2010-2013), ""Vikings"" (2013 – ), ""Rome"" (2005–2007), etc. So all cons must be considered and removed!",/review/rw3281407/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2015,chem-dantzler-973-550031,10," It was a fix for my GoT withdrawal!
","I thought it was excellent! The Plot kept my attention and made me look forward to the next episode. I was elated that I didn't have to wait until the following week to watch again. I thought it was well cast, I appreciated the acting, and and production. Not knowing the route the series was going to take and how close to the facts the series would remain made it somewhat suspenseful. I appreciated the fact that they tried to adhere to some of the archaeological findings. I enjoyed the pace of the series and have encouraged all of my friends to watch it. It definitely was a fix for my game of Thrones withdrawal. I think anytime you can sit through a 6 hour mini series it has to be good!! I give it a 10!",/review/rw3281407/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2015,Chuckcb66,," Very entertaining!!
",This show was a total and pleasant surprise. I would of loved to see it have a chance to developed more but all and all a very good show. People dogging this show lose sight that is TV show not a documentary full of facts and figures. The show served it's purpose of providing drama and a very good story. From a production stand point I thought it was outstanding. Actors and actresses who I've never heard of had a chance to shine and for the most part did a very respectable job. As with most TV drama there are going to parts that could of hit the editorial floor but for Spike TV to feature a show off this magnitude I thought it was well done and definitely worth watching!,/review/rw3281407/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2015,cmurray-880-703065,1," Awful for so Many Reasons
","OK, even if you ignore the total lack of historical accuracy, misrepresentation of cultural and ethnic reality (Egyptians with hair and black Mittanis!), and countless production mistakes and gaffs, the script and acting are just terrible! I mean really! Can't you tell a good story and still represent at least the spirit of a period and culture in an artful manner with soulful characters? The old Steve Reeves Hercules flicks were better than this abomination. I think the producers were shooting for a ""Hunger Games Goes to Egypt"" kind of thing......Seriously.....Nothing can save this mess...Poor Sir Ben Kingsley! From Ghandi to this...perhaps he helped with the fake English accents....",/review/rw3281407/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2015,michelvega,5," Tut who?
","I'm sorry to say I got bored watching this TV movie. Very predictable. The only thing we actually know about the boy king is that he was young when he kicked the bucket. I got the impression of a B movie like Scorpion King, though a bit better.",/review/rw3281407/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2018,barrys-2,1," An Historical Disaster
","The number of historical errors in the first 10 minutes of this ""drama"" were so numerous, that I couldn't watch any more. The film begins with Akhenaten dying in Memphis. He died in Armana. Tutankaton (his original name) didn't leave Armana until the third year after Akhenaten's death. Eqyptians at this time eschewed facial hair, in fact they removed all hair from their heads, faces, and bodies. To show Akhenaten with a real beard is preposterous; he would have had an Osird, a false beard. To show some of his underlings with facial hair is also wrong. Akhenaten never allowed himself to touch the ground in Arnana; he was carried from place to place. As he only worshiped one god, Aton, the paintings of other gods in the beginning scene of the film is nonsense. And where did they get the idea that Akhenaten was poisoned? Akhenaten's remains (KV55} are little more than bones with no soft tissues to provide clues to his death. I could go on, but this should be enough to show you how little regard this potboiler paid to historical accuracy. Hollywood seems incapable of making a decent, realistic film about ancient Egypt. Perhaps, someday, someone will achieve this, but ""Tut"" is so far removed from historical reality as to be laughable.",/review/rw3281407/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2020,eryui,6," Very cheap sorry
","Considering was realized in 2015 the whole thing, the production, looks a bit too cheap to my eyes, comparing to other historical miniseries. The mixture of dialogs, photography , camera works, and acting feels a bit not authentic and cheap according to the actual standard. A pity for the story and for Ben Kingsley that still a great actor.",/review/rw3281407/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2015,quincytheodore,6," The boy's journey to kingship is undeniably painted with lavish production, yet it's also unevenly slow and devoid of novelty.
","Right from the start, Tut presents itself with grand and gorgeous set. It certainly boasts high presentation, ranging from the colorful costume, immense environment to heavy amount of make-up. The goal is clearly to make an epic tale, however it's also disjointed in many areas as the narrative progresses with slow political build up and occasional melodramatic romance.",/review/rw3281407/?ref_=tt_urv
