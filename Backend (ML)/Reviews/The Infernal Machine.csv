24 January 2022,BrnzReviews,10," A Review Of How I Enjoyed My Time Watching Bel Air.
","Now this is the review of how i enjoyed my time watching bel air. What i loved about this was the originality behind literally everything, the cast were great at adapting to different scenes and making our childhoods awesome, the stories were great and hilarious. The relationship between Will & Uncle Phil really is a funny one, i just loved these two working together it really was an experience of stitches and aching from laughter. I used to rush home from.school to watch this on VIVA, the good ole days.",/review/rw0277674/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," One of the best sitcoms ever created!
","I grew up watching The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and still love it to this day. Everyone knows by now what it's about, it's about a street kid from Philadelphia that moves to Bel-Air to live with his rich Uncle, Aunt, cousins and their butler. I watched it so much that I still know every line of the theme song. Is a classic sitcom from the 90's. I even still watch it when it's on now. I know they just did a reboot of the series but you can't reboot a classic like this and expect it to even be half as good. The entire cast is hilarious which is led by a very young Will Smith. It's easily one of the best sitcoms from the 90's. It's one of those shows where you can watch it as much as you want and it's still funny. I'll always love this show!",/review/rw0277674/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2022,Supermanfan-13,9," Still funny!
","If you grew up in the 90's then you were a fan of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air! Even if you didn't, you are still probably a fan because it's just a flat out funny show. This is where Will Smith started his career, no one knew at the time he would become the actor he is today but most saw a bright future. Now, he lost his mind at the Oscars when he slapped Chris Rock and he will always be remembered for that but that still doesn't take away from the fact that he's had a great career and this was the start. I still laugh when I watch the reruns on tv just as much as I did when I was a kid watching it.",/review/rw0277674/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2005,dee.reid,," Still fresh after all these years
","I like to think of ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" as a memorable rap song from a time when it wasn't afraid to be creative or witty. Think of a song by Public Enemy, De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, or hell, even The Fresh Prince's duo with DJ Jazzy Jeff (who guest stars frequently as Jazz), as the two were known back in rap's Golden Age as DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince.",/review/rw0277674/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2003,quixoboy,," My all-time favourite TV series
","Of all the shows, I believe that ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" is the one with which I can most identify with, since I have surely seen every single episode at least a dozen times - and yet it STILL never gets tired! I cannot get sick of this show, and it's making me a bit disturbed! Just what is it that makes this show so continually appealing, even around seven years since its final episode? I'm not sure...it's certainly not just one element. Every part of this show is magic: the wonderful acting from all involved; the witty (and often painfully hysterical) one-liners and banter between characters; the hip, cool atmosphere; the music...it all perfectly fits into what has to be one of the most remarkable and well-made sitcoms of the '90s.",/review/rw0277674/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2018,ComedyFan2010,9," One of the best sitcoms from the 90's
","It is already so long ago. Now Will Smith is the same age as uncle Phil was at the end of the show. And James Avery who portrayed Philip Banks is unfortunately dead. But the show itself hasn't lost it's humor and charm. I enjoyed it to the fullest rewatching it now, and actually watching it for the first time from beginning to the end.",/review/rw0277674/?ref_=tt_urv

21 August 2007,vince200002000,10," Hilarious comedy that everyone can enjoy
","This show is my favourite show on nick@nite. It's the only TV show that really makes me laugh. Of coarse that's only one great aspect of the show's magical touch of comedy. The acting is great and the show's characters each have their own individual and comical personality that the viewer may relate too. The storyline of the series is quite interesting. A city boy, Will Smith who was born and raised in West Philadelphia was sent to live with his rich aunt and uncle in Bel-Air.",/review/rw0277674/?ref_=tt_urv

7 May 2022,gracynmartin,9," Absolutely Love
",Could not stop laughing while watching this. This family gives you so many life lessons to top it off. Every character is loveable and Will's character development is top notch.,/review/rw0277674/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2003,DominqueZarinha,," THE BEST COMEDY OF ALL TIME!!!!!
","I absolutely love this show! I cannot ever recall an episode in which I did not laugh. Will Smith is so hilarious, everything he says always cracks me up. He also has this way of making eye contact with the camera whenever he's done something stupid or did something clever. I love the way Will always picks on Carlton and Uncle Phil. Will Smith, I think he's one of the best megastars in the world today. Vivian (Daphane Maxwell Reid and Janet Hubert Whitten), both portrayed the character excellently I must say. Carlton, what can I say? He always cracks me up. I'll never forget the episode where he and Will were imprisoned and Carlton started freaking out, wow, man, I literally fell down laughing away. Ashley (Tatyana Ali) I love her character. Uncle Phil (James Avery), he's a lawyer turned judge and a father who teaches good moral values to his children. I love his character. There is also Geoffrey. Wow, he is the most sarcastic butler around. He always makes fun of Uncle Phil and boy do I get off with laughter whenever I see him. But the show only had one problem and that was the character Hilary. No offence to Karyn Parsons whom I think is a beautiful and talented actress but the character of Hilary was seriously messed up. Here you have a 21 year old woman still living with her parents and won't go out to look for a job. All she concerned with is the way she looks. I think Hilary was the most annoying person on show. I HATED HILARY. She shouldn't have been like that. Gosh, everytime I had to see her, I would switch the channel until that part was gone. But nevertheless, I still loved the show. I've been watching the reruns since 2000 and I must say, I never get fed up of it. I look forward to it EVERYDAY. I was surprised that it was not included on RANK's Top 25 comedies of all time. This show should have at the top. If anyone does not think this show is funny, then something must be wrong. If I feel depressed and need a good laugh, all I have to do is watch this show and get tonnes of jokes. I wish they would have like the whole 5 or 6 seasons on DVD or VHS so I could go buy it. I give this show two thumbs up. Rating- 10/10, 100% Pure and raw comedy!",/review/rw0277674/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2017,smetin,9," First-time experience - well worth it!
","OK, so I never watched this as a kid growing up. I was into manga, nickelodeon, Disney etc. However, now I am 25 i decided to go through all the TV shows I missed whilst growing up and this was one of them. Boy oh boy, I was not disappointed. Despite the last show being run over 20 years ago, this comedy is well worth the watch. Will Smith is obviously the star, but the performances by every single person in the Banks family was memorable. Some episodes were there just for the laughs, some were slower and some had serious learning reflections. The latter is what made this show stand out. Going from an episode that made me laugh to one with a serious message of gun control or racism sets this show apart from the majority of sitcoms. It was, well, a fresh experience.

29 May 2001,Brian-272,," Sexy, upscale, funny, and intelligent that was ""The, Fresh Prince of Bel-Air""!
","Inner-city rap met upscale Beverly Hills society in this black sitcom. Philadelphia homeboy Will Smith was off to Beverly Hills to live with his rich, pretentious relatives the Banks. Only you had differences occur Will brought a little soul to the strict Beverly Hills mansion, only to be taught a few things by the Banks as well. The Banks family had the uncle of Will that was Philip (James Avery) a successful attorney who knew all about the problems a black man faced in a white society. The Banks had two daughters who I describe both as being just as sexy and beautiful as ever first the oldest and spoiled Hillary (Karyn Parsons) and the youngest the pretty Ashley (Tatyana Ali). The Banks family always had to deal with problems in life and had fun of it in the process. The theme song by Smith and partner Jeff Townes ""Parents Just Don't Understand"" said it all. You can now catch the reruns of the famous Will Smith on both cable channels TBS and WGN this popular black sitcom is still well enjoyed.",/review/rw0277674/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2022,ashwinultra,10," Fresh writing, emotional richness, and great comedy
","This is truly one of the most underrated 90s sitcoms, because it's writing is so fine that it incorporates the full spectrum of emotion in it- happy moments, moments that break your heart, moments that make you grateful for your family, and much more. So don't believe those fools who say that this show isn't much, because this show truly is one of the only shows of those times that also shows Black people and the intricacies of their lives in realistic, endearing ways.",/review/rw0277674/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2021,vlad-95474,10," One of the best shows I've ever seen in my life.
","Everything here works. Will Smith, still young, already demonstrated that he would be a big star. Even though he was the center of the series, the other characters gave their private shows, especially Carlton (Ribeiro).",/review/rw0277674/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2002,SMLA11,," Favorite show ever
","The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air is definitely the best show ever.  It is hard to laugh at nearly every joke, but they make it possible in this.  Every character is awesome.  This started Will Smith and I am proud to say that this was good.  The storylines in this are excellent.  Every character is well developed perfectly.  James Avery and the two Vivians are really good as the parents.  They convinced me perfectly.  Alfonso Ribeiro is perfect as the dorky cousin of Will and he convinced me very much.  Karyn Parsons is good as the snobby cousin and she definitely convinced me.  Tatyana Ali is good as Ashley and her character developed for the better over the time. Joseph Marcell is perfect as the butler Geoffrey and he made me laugh everytime he said something funny.  Ross Bagley is convincing as little Nicky and he was cool.  And last, but definitely not least, is Will Smith. He convinced me very much as the hood who changes when he moves in with his rich family and I loved his character the most.",/review/rw0277674/?ref_=tt_urv

9 November 2022,bzins-72503,10," More then a show
","I was sick. Then dad was sick. And there was one thing 8 years later that I am just now connecting with this experience; The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. I was 18, and my Crohn's was so severe that it took a few days for the doctors to even realize how bad things were. I remember drinking Go-Lightly for a colonoscopy I had the next day. It was late, and my dad had decided to stay with me alone. One of the few times this happened, but I don't blame him. Things were more touch and go than I realized. I remember drinking that nasty stuff-getting through it only by watching 30 min episodes of Fresh Prince with my dad, and hearing him tell me how brave I was. What I didn't realize at the time, is this show would get us through more than my illness. It got us through his as well.",/review/rw0277674/?ref_=tt_urv
