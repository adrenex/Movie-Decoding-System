","The Frankenstein origin story a bit tweaked. I'm guessing you're familiar with it, not only because of countless movies being made about it, but because of the original story too. Or maybe you just heard about it. This takes a more fantastical turn for it and tries to make it as entertaining as possible.",/review/rw3026378/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2014,Quebec_Dragon,6," I... didn't find it so bad.
","I must admit that I enjoyed watching this supernatural action flick heavy on CGI effects despite its flaws. I wondered why afterwards. First, it seemed to follow from the book events and made a good point that the creature is not actually called Frankenstein. However, the ""creature"" itself, played by a strong Aaron Eckhart (Harvey Dent in Dark Knight) did not look like any previous incarnation. Mostly, it looked like a normal-sized, muscular, even handsome man with scars, not like a tall, grotesque, patchwork of a man as it should have been. So, the film following this trend of making ""monsters"" sexy bugged me, but the performance of Eckhart won me over. He might not have emoted much, as befitted the character who didn't learn how, but he certainly had the charisma and gravitas necessary. He didn't look the part but he acted the haunted, grim part very well.",/review/rw3026378/?ref_=tt_urv

31 May 2014,EdgarST,7," Fine Entertainment
","I definitely saw another movie than the one seen by those who have given this two stars or less, or who complain that they have not seen anything worst than this. Well, they have seen very little or perhaps they have not realized how often they are fed with very bad movie junk, under the disguise of art or top entertainment... As I enjoyed the films animated by Ray Harryhausen, with their cyclops, harpies, Medusas, fighting skeletons, or giants as the unforgettable Thalos (from Jason and the Argonauts), what I saw I enjoyed very much -except for the score, which has become a plague in almost all American cinema of today, a mixture of pastiche sounds inherited from Jerry Goldsmith and all the others, plus the obnoxious little rock number for the end credits. The tension falters a bit in the very last moment, when the thousands of corpses are about to be reanimated, but for the rest it was fine airhead entertainment. If you are looking to have a good time with another fable of the struggle of agents of Good against the Evil, with no romance out of place (between the monster and a scientist?), efficient special effects and the fast rhythm of American (or Australian, for the case) adventure film, watch it, and leave Malick, Weerasethakul or Sorrentino for another time. (P.S. I did not see Mary Shelley's name in big letters in the end credits, so if it is there somewhere, I guess one has to look for it with a magnifying glass, among the endless list of line, executive, associate and whatever producers).",/review/rw3026378/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2014,PWNYCNY,8," A humanized version of an iconic Hollywood creature.
","Stop beating up on this movie. It does not deserve such shoddy treatment. This is not a bad movie. It's part sci-fi, part horror, with the emphasis on the former. The Frankenstein creation is humanized. There is nothing wrong with that. The movie successfully places the creature in the present. He even has a name. Aaron Eckhart delivers a wonderful performance as the first artificially created humanoid. He gives his character depth. This movie is not a ripoff of the original movie. True, the story is contrived, but it is also entertaining. The forces of good and evil are clearly defined and their struggle for supremacy plausible within the context of the story. The movie asks the audience to accept as a premise that there are metaphysical forces at work that are not readily discernible. For some, that may be a bit of a stretch, but remember: it's a movie. The movie is entertaining, well-acted, has good continuity and a briskly paced story. This movie is worth watching.",/review/rw3026378/?ref_=tt_urv

","Let's talk plainly here... A poodle could of seen this trailer and automatically knew this wasn't going to be Hollywood masterpiece. If you saw the trailer and then still bought a ticket, then you don't have anything to complain about if you hated this film. This movie is about Gargoyles, Demons and Frankenstein!!! I doubt the best movie minds of all time could of turned this plot into a well made movie. It's SCIENCE FICTION people, not every film can get an 8.0 on IMDb. ",/review/rw3026378/?ref_=tt_urv

","With a miserable 5% on Rotten Tomatoes, it seems like I, Frankenstein is one of the worst movies in 2014 and it is only January. The abysmal rating made me lower my expectations and surprisingly it is a solid entertainment. Sure, it doesn't impress on any level but for a January movie, it is an entertaining one.",/review/rw3026378/?ref_=tt_urv

However he is attacked by demons but he kills one of them and Gargoyles save him and take him to a Cathedral where the Gargoyles Order gathers. The Queen of the Gargoyles Leonore (Miranda Otto) keeps Dr. Frankenstein's journal together with the treasures of the Order and gives the name of Adam to the creature. Then she explains to Adam that there is an ancient war between the Gargoyles that are angels and demons under the command of the Prince Naberius (Bill Nighy). She also invites Adam to join the Gargoyles in the war against demons, but Adam prefers to isolate in a remote place.",/review/rw3026378/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2014,moviexclusive,," For better or for worse, this action-heavy, plot-light fantasy is an unabashed attempt at replicating the success of the 'Underworld' franchise
","Where before it was vampires versus werewolves, it is the battle of the gargoyles and demons that takes centrestage in the fantasy action thriller 'I, Frankenstein'. Based on the Darkstorm Studios graphic novel by one of the creators of 'Underworld', it tells of its titular character's struggle between good and evil in the midst of an all-out, centuries old war among two immortal clans of superhuman creatures. But as exciting as that may sound, you'll quickly find that the burden of 'Underworld' hangs too heavily like an anchor around its neck.",/review/rw3026378/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2014,zardoz-13,8," Frankenstein Sans Nuts & Bolts!!!
","A cleverly reimagined but lightweight horror chiller, ""I, Frankenstein"" qualifies as an entertaining, PG-13 rated, supernatural saga about the further adventures of the infamous monster. ""Tomorrow, When the War Began"" writer & director Stuart Beattie and ""Underworld"" scenarist Kevin Grevioux, who wrote the Darkstorm Studios graphic novel prequel, have forged a fast-moving fantasy that borrows from the ""Underworld"" franchise, ""Legion,"" ""Priest,"" ""Batman,"" and ""Constantine."" Unlike previous ""Frankenstein"" films, however, ""I, Frankenstein"" occurs in a contemporary setting after a brief 18th century prologue. Our stitched together protagonist finds himself caught between an order of virtuous Gargoyles and wicked Demons in an apocalyptic battle for the fate of Earth. Essentially, with regard to Biblical time-lines, the action takes place after the fall of Satan. Leading man Aaron Eckhart has definitely surpassed himself not only with his chiseled, six-pack physique as the centuries old monster, but also with a haunted performance that evokes sympathy for the anti-heroic monster. Mind you, Frankenstein's monster remains a treacherous character, rough-hewn-around-the-edges, without a twinkle in his gimlet eyes. When Eckhart isn't striking a cool, anti-heroic pose, Bill Nighy's nefarious villain-in-charge mesmerizes us with another polished performance. Naturally, Nighy is cast as the supreme Demon, Prince Naberius, who looks quite a sight when he shape-shifts into a Demon. Listening to this seasoned British actor deliver his dialogue with a succulent relish for each syllable is a treat in itself. Meantime, director Beattie stages several exciting entrances and exits by both the Gargoyles and our hero. Heroes and villains love to plunge through ceilings like Michael Keaton did as the Caped Crusader in the 1989 ""Batman."" The close-quarters combat sequences are reminiscent of ""Priest"" (2011) with the monster wielding two-and-a-half foot-long sticks. The settings and the costumes imbue the action with atmosphere. ""Wolverine"" director of photography Ross Emery makes everything appear visually resplendent, particularly when Demons die in battle. When a Demon dies, its body glows incandescently and then erupts into fireballs.",/review/rw3026378/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2014,matthewssilverhammer,1," It's Shocking Movies This Bad Can Get Made
","The trailer for I, Frankenstein says it all. Does the dialogue look stupid and clichéd? Yep! Does the action look boring and uninspired? Yep! Does it look like it was made BY middle schoolers FOR middle schoolers? You got it! Nothing will surprise you here. It hits every predictable beat and hits them with the grace and subtlety of a cow walking a tightropeawkwardly and dumbly. The characters are rote and predictable, the makeup and cg (while not bad) is leftover from ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"", and the entire viewing experience is laborious and forgettable. Set in modern times, Frank is over 200 years old and gets caught in the middle of a war going on between gargoyles, demons, and other fantastical characters. Clearly this isn't Karloff's Frankenstein; it's more in the vein of stylized Gothic action films like Underworld or Blade. Gone is the stumbling, sympathetic horror of the Mary Shelley; instead we have a Batman-wannabe shooting for mysteriously cool and coming off as just lazy and unrelatable. Poor Aaron Eckhart is still trying to find where he fits in Hollywood, and this isn't it. Fun game idea: see how long you can stay awake through this movie. Sure, there are copious fight scenes and mildly complex characters but no rational explanation for anything plot-wise. It may have helped if the filmmakers had their tongues more firmly planted in their cheeks, but instead we are left laughing AT them instead of WITH them. With so many great things in theatres right now, don't waste your time on this.",/review/rw3026378/?ref_=tt_urv

4 May 2014,Jerghal,7," Adjust your expectations
","If you see the film you can't help but think how much the visual style resembles 'Underworld'. Story wise it leans more towards 'Van Helsing'. I guess those bad memories are the reason it failed to make any money. I personally thought it wasn't too bad: good VFX, decent action, nice production design. Okay, so they story is somewhat nonsensical but it isn't a drama but rather light popcorn entertainment. Ackhart's performance is functional but nothing worth of any award. They also were smart enough to keep the length at a snappy 92 mins and not drag it out to 130 mins like Van Helsing did. Maybe not cinema material but I can see this doing solid business in the video rental circuit.",/review/rw3026378/?ref_=tt_urv

","There's something to be said for big, dumb blockbusters featuring immortal creatures of the undead, gargoyles, demons and a whole lot of CGI. That's especially true now, during awards season, when the cinemas are otherwise crowded with Important Movies that might be worthy but difficult to watch. I, Frankenstein even lurches into cineplexes with a bit more credibility than is typically attached to C-grade movies: usually reliable character actors Aaron Eckhart, Miranda Otto and Bill Nighy have signed on to rain hellfire (or something) down on one another.

We're told (right at the beginning) through a particularly succinct voice-over, that Frankenstein's monster, here played by Aaron Eckhart, found his place in society by helping a secret order of Gargoyles to fight demons (please don't laugh).
