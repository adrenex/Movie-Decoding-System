22 August 2014,KineticSeoul,7," I thought it was a entertaining ride.
","I am one of the few that actually had more fun with this sequel than the first one. Sure, it has elements that has been done in other movies before, except it revolves around living cars. But the creativity and clever moments makes this one a entertaining ride. While the first one's protagonist was Lightning this time, the likable hillbilly truck Mater takes the spotlight. Sure, he maybe dunce but he is a likable and funny dunce. One of the premise that doesn't get old for me, is where a average or below Joe gets put in a over a top situation. And some of the characters surrounding him or her mistakenly think he or she to be some sort of a amazing hero or heroine. The dialogue is hip and fun, the comedic parts may seem a bit childish, but it's clever and I personally thought it was funny. The animation goes into another level with this one, and the detail when it comes to the environments which takes place in Radiator Springs, Japan, Paris and England. And the animation is again superb and better. Sure, it's not in depth or emotional as the other Pixar movies, but it's still a entertaining good time. I also think the transition to Mater was a good idea, because it brings out a certain amount of uniqueness. As a matter of fact this movie kinda reminded me of animated version ""Tucker & Dale vs. Evil"", except it's for the whole family to enjoy.",/review/rw8125738/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2011,bopdog,10," Dazzling and charming!
","I knew I would like this film, but I was very pleasantly surprised at how amazing I found it. As a hold-out and a bit of a cranky git, I confess I am one of those who find the 3D experience an annoyance. Maybe if they someday come up with a contraption-free (no glasses) way to see it, I might like it. My cinema only had it in 3D. Drat.",/review/rw8125738/?ref_=tt_urv

19 July 2015,cleontico,8," Why so much hate? It was okay
","I keep reading reviews for Cars 2 and I am kind of surprised. Some people went as far as comparing it to the Star Wars prequels. Sure, Cars 2 definitely is no ""Finding Nemo"" or ""Toy Story."" But it sure was fun, at least for me. The plot was an obvious reference to James Bond and Mission Impossible. I enjoyed the spy gadgets and political overtones. It was action-packed and not only enjoyable for little kids, but for older kids and adults too. Why all the hate? Heck, even Roger Ebert and Rolling Stone liked it!",/review/rw8125738/?ref_=tt_urv

26 June 2011,dfranzen70,10," Top shelf sequel
","Pixar seems immune to the problems that studios normally have with their sequels, in that Pixar's sequels don't, you know, stink. Cars 2, like the Toy Story films, captures every bit of sincerity, thrills, and pitch-perfect animation that the original did. It's a beautifully shot movie with terrific voice characterizations, including a surprisingly awesome turn by Larry the Cable Guy.",/review/rw8125738/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2011,Loving_Silence,7," A Great Summer Film, that the whole family can enjoy
","We all know that Pixar makes incredible movies, I personally have never disliked a Pixar film. The first ""Cars"" film, was a great movie, not a perfect film. It was one of the least better films, Pixar has made, but that's like saying, Insomnia was one of Christopher Nolan's worst films. I had high expectations when coming to see the film, like I always have before I see a Pixar film.",/review/rw8125738/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2011,markdroulston,3," Such a disappointment
","16 years ago, Pixar Animation Studios released the first feature length computer animated film in history, Toy Story. What followed was an incredible run of success, an 11 film hot streak that yielded dozens of awards (including 11 Oscars), billions of dollars in box office receipts, and the admiration of audiences and critics everywhere. Year after year Pixar was a company you could rely on, and while not all the films were perfect, they all were at least of decent quality, and light years ahead of their competition from the likes of Dreamworks and Sony. So therefore it's heart-breaking to say that Pixar's hot streak has come to a crashing halt in 2011. Cars 2 is not just the weakest film in Pixar's catalogue, it is the worst high-profile animated release for some time.",/review/rw8125738/?ref_=tt_urv

","We hoped it would never happen, but no one is perfect. Even the best can stumble. This had to happen eventually. Even the string of terrific Disney's classic films and the 90s Disney Renaissance didn't last forever. I'm afraid that, yes, Pixar has made a bad film.",/review/rw8125738/?ref_=tt_urv

",car2 was actually was a good movie. I Don't KNOW WHY THIS got negative reviews . its actually a good family film for both children and adults. the action is great the animation everything. I mean seriously I don't care if mater is the main character nothing is wrong with it. even though it doesn't have emotional moments like the original its still insetting. the songs just feel nice to listen to its sounds nice. Spoiler alert there a part s o well crafted when radiator springs is fighting the lemons . cars the original is great this was twice as good as the original and Is looking forward to see Cars 3,/review/rw8125738/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2011,TourettesPersonal,7," Something's Missing
","The saddest thing about Pixar today is, they don't know what movie they are going to release on their 25th Anniversary since one of their upcoming projects ""Newt"" was cancelled despite from Blue Sky's Rio plot. Cars 2 feels like it's a direct-to-DVD film. It's not really bad but it's just unnecessary. Though, the action is pretty cool. The kids will enjoy it but the rest is like Rango. Instead of Western Themes, it's Spy movies. The story isn't bad except it doesn't give anything emotional and heartwarming unlike the other Pixar movies. Cars 2 is pretty fun but the most important ingredient of their movies is missing.",/review/rw8125738/?ref_=tt_urv

","Cars 2 was great movie from 2011 along with Winnie The Pooh in my opinion i understand why people hate it,it's because Tow Mater became a superficial character in the film guys i like Tow Mater but only in 1st and 3rd movie, he always helped Mcqueen come on this movie needs positive reviews rather than hate.",/review/rw8125738/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Cars 2"" is an unusual case of a highly anticipated film that was not simultaneously released here locally as in the States. I wonder why? Anyway after I watched this film, I think I know why.

","Spies Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) and Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) are trying to contact an American spy to help stop an evil plot. The problem, Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) was mistaken as the American spy. Meanwhile Mater had accepted a challenge on behave of Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson).

17 February 2014,cayers4042,6," Not As Good As the First But Still Good.
","I know I'm WAY late on this by over a year. Overall I liked it. Loved a lot of the new characters, especially Finn McMissile and the arrogant Italian car guy (whatever his name was). Liked Raoue Carole as well. I just had two major pet peeves with it: it focused on Mater. Mater already had his own little spin-off of ""Mater's Tall Tales"" which I love. A movie centered on him just didn't do it for me. Had it been on Lightning (like the first one) or any other character I would have been okay. It may have to do with the fact that I'm no Mater fan. My second beef was Doc Hudson wasn't in it. I know why, I understand wanting to honor Paul Newman (whom I adored), hate to sound callous, but the show goes on. If he ended up with a different voice then so be it. Better yet, he could have been in it for a few seconds, and just not say anything at all. Fillmore's voice actor passed and he was still in it so to me there was no excuse not to have Doc in it. My two cents, of course.",/review/rw8125738/?ref_=tt_urv

","Cars 2 The sequel to Pixar's success movie about one car's journey to achieve his dreams follows the same premise; however it's Mater turn in the fast lane, this time. When Lightning McQueen brings his best friend along to a world cup racing championship, based in Tokyo, Mater finds himself caught up in serious matters concerning spy cars and terrorism on an international level. What turns out to be a series of potentially deadly situations throws Mater into a fast-paced world of secrecy, gadgets, guns, disguises and heroics. It's James Bond meets the original Cars, in this film packed with racing, romance and rendezvous. A fun flick for the whole family to enjoy!",/review/rw8125738/?ref_=tt_urv

","The best of Pixar's films have protagonists who are a small part of a very large world and are almost helpless against incredible odds - Toy Story, Wall-E, Finding Nemo etc. The protagonists of Cars are very big in a very small world, so do not play to the strengths of Pixar.",/review/rw8125738/?ref_=tt_urv

It is definitely not for adults but if your kid likes movies like James Bond, Mission Impossible and Ocean's Eleven but you don't want to see all the violence sex and bad language show them this they will have a blast. Also it has an amazing soundtrack.",/review/rw8125738/?ref_=tt_urv
