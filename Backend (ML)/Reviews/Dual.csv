23 May 2022,imseeg,," This director has made a comedy and a mystery before. This movie though is in another undefinable category...
","This movie is NOT targetted at an audience to make money for shareholders, it's made for artistic reasons. It's not made to entertain you, but I do still think it is ONLY interesting for a niche audience of arthouse movie fans.",/review/rw8071552/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2022,FeastMode,8," The best kind of weird
","I feel like this movie will be divisive. This kind of weird will work for some but not for others. And I am certain this movie will piss off many people. But for me, everything worked. This movie is awesome.",/review/rw8071552/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2022,JustSayingKOA,3," I thought double the Karen Gillan would double the fun...boy was I wrong.
","The premise was interesting, the follow through was not. The original had no personality what so ever, I swear she's an early robot prototype. The clone is like a kid trapped in an adult body. The real question isn't what will happen when they dual, but why isn't she suing the hospital for guaranteeing her death so she decided to clone herself only to find out she isn't dying and that 2% actually rolled up and now she faces a 50/50 chance of being murdered because of them. Why is it even a law that if two people exist they have to dual to the death? If someone has identical twins, do they have to dual to the death at adulthood too? Pretty silly if you ask me. This movie dragged on in a lot of parts, only the curiosity of who won in the end kept me going...I was even going to fast forward to the end but didn't want to miss anything exciting if it happened...and no I didn't miss anything at all. Time not well spent. As for the ending...complete let down. I wish I didn't watch this movie at all.",/review/rw8071552/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2022,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,6," Deadpan dark comedy.
","This is a dark comedy in the absurdity category. Everyone delivers their lines with a deadpan delivery. Unfortunately, the stoic delivery also makes it slow. It has some good jokes like the dog that gets the arrow in the eye from across the street and the clone has constitutional rights and the original has to pay support? Lol.",/review/rw8071552/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2022,gab-67599,2," Boring!
",If you like SLOW movies with build up to absolutely nothing then this is your movie! As for me I will never see it again and will not recommend it. Only good thing was the guy in it (The trainer) I think he is fine. Girl was annoying af!,/review/rw8071552/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2022,AnotherPersonInTheWorld,2," Is it supposed to be a comedy?
","Maybe it's supposed to be dry humour and they just completely failed at that, cause let's face it it's not a thriller or sci fi. What were the notes they gave Karen Gillan? ""We need you to give a robotic performance, but do it like your an actress who doesn't know how to act""?",/review/rw8071552/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2022,just_in_case,4," Very disappointing. Dry humor doesn't work.
","I wish I'd have known it was the ""Art of Self-Defense"" guy going into this. I was expecting something vey different from the trailer. Something more interesting or exciting. Even knowing that now I still dont think it comes close to measuring up.",/review/rw8071552/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2022,jtindahouse,8," Dry/dark humour with an interesting story
",I would like to meet writer/director Riley Stearns. His films have a very unique sense of humour about them and I would like to know if that's how he naturally is. They are very dry and quite dark. You never quite know if you're supposed to be laughing or not. I think most of the time you are.,/review/rw8071552/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2022,octomancer,7," Much better than some reviews led me to believe
","But it still has its flaws. Overall though, I enjoyed it and I'm glad I watched. It's a long way away from being a waste of my time, of which other reviewers accuse it.",/review/rw8071552/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2022,Xstal,5," Imposter Syndrome...
","Imagine there's a clone, who's now living in your home, an almost perfect doppelganger, taken straight from the lab's hanger. It's a sympathetic swap, as your time has come to drop, all your family need to know, is you'll never let them go.",/review/rw8071552/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2022,nwcoug,7," Thought-Provoking, Weird, and a Solid 7.5.
","Great Sci-Fi that relies on the story and not unnecessary over-the-top special effects. I felt like this movie could be telling about what we have in store in the future. Every character is somewhat robotic, and without feeling or personality...much like a society where indoctrination has voided all critical thought and reason. That's my take anyway.",/review/rw8071552/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2022,thao,2," Tries hard to be deep but ends up being silly.
","The acting is wooden, the script is both badly written (everything is spelled out) and very silly. Even the whole concept makes no sense at all.",/review/rw8071552/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,classicsoncall,8," ""You always kill the ones you love.""
","I'm not surprised by the relatively low IMDb rating for this movie here on IMDb, a '5.8' at the time I write this review. For this viewer however, I found the concept of the film highly original and totally whack. I'm sure the folks at 'Black Mirror' would be proud. I think the average person watching the film tries to look at it as a serious picture when it's really not meant to be. The situations and dialog are intentionally absurd to the point of being hysterical. The high water mark for me was when Sarah (Karen Gillan) was advised by her attorney (Darren McStay) to hire a combat trainer for a forced duel against her clone, having overcome a ninety eight percent probability of dying. Much of the dialog in the story is couched in deadpan black humor; the back and forth between Sarah and her doctor regarding the unaccountable two percent was brilliantly scripted. I also got a big kick out of combat trainer Trent's (Aaron Paul) suggestion of an alternate method of paying for his services. Come on now, you all know where you thought that was going now, didn't you? When it turned out to be hip-hop lessons, I thought I'd fall off the couch! Look, I'm probably not going to be able to convince the haters of this movie to change their mind, but if you come at it from a different perspective, you might find the story creatively amusing. There's also the uniquely double entendre'd nature of the title, since the 'duals' of the story are destined to 'duel' for the right of survivorship.",/review/rw8071552/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2022,random-70778,," Premise could have worked as a short, but as a film it is interminable and boring
",I don't care if you are in the mood for somethin lowbrow or highbrow: it is a stone cold fact you will be looking at the time remaining when this film still has over an hour to go.,/review/rw8071552/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2022,chenp-54708,7," Flawed, but still engaging and interesting throughout

17 April 2022,shadowofhero-46519,3," Boredom reigns here.
",Since Dr Who hasn't ripped them big anymore. This movie promises a lot of stories but is dead boring.,/review/rw8071552/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2022,jimsin101,8," Yorgos Lanthimos has a double
",I loved this film and it deserves much better ratings.,/review/rw8071552/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2022,JoBloTheMovieCritic,7," Dual
","7/10 - 2022 is turning out to be the year of oddly charming dance sequences (between this and the similarly surprisingly good Fresh), but in all seriousness, this dystopian tale that features a whole lot of Karen Gillan is thoroughly captivating and thought-provoking.",/review/rw8071552/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2022,adrian-m-miller,1," Just no.....worst premise in movie history
","I thought perhaps Karen Gillan might be able to save or do something with it, but no.",/review/rw8071552/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2022,john_lubinski,10," Never in my life have I seen a second movie that is so unfairly hated by IMDB users.
","Dual is dark and wild, it engages the viewer from beginning to end. The Arthouse we want. Karen Gillan is the diamond of this movie. Don't be influenced by poor ratings and negative opinions.",/review/rw8071552/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2022,DKSPL,10," Why so many negative comments? I don't get it.
","Movie is fine. Good script, good acting (amazing Karen). Not boring. What more could you possibly want? I don't know why this movie attracts so many haters.",/review/rw8071552/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2022,Intermissionman_,7," Under the Radar Indy
","DUAL sounded Interesting so I rented, Found it to be a uniquely DARK SCI FI. Karen Gillan pulls off the Duality role with ease. Aaron Paul also Good as Assassin Trainer. Cool Plot, You have to buy into the Cloning and Dying right away then story twists along nicely from there. Bit Disappointed with Ending though. Filmed in Finland. Soundtrack fits the Mood.",/review/rw8071552/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2022,stylss,5," highly recommend watching Swan Song (2021) instead
","Had they kept the same energy from the opening scene, this would have been great. The majority of this felt predictable, robotic, dull, and forced.",/review/rw8071552/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2022,TxMike,," Dual persons and possibly a two person duel.
","This is NOT a mainstream movie by any stretch. It is brought to us by a young writer-director whose specialty is unusual, quirky stories. I was anxious to see it because it stars Karen Gillan, I am a big fan, I could watch and listen to her read a phone book and be entertained.",/review/rw8071552/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2022,blackmelo,6," started off so well
","The first half of the movie I was thinking it was going to be one of the best films I had seen in a long time. Then suddenly it was the end and there were so many unanswered questions my rating dropped from a solid 10 to well not sure. I was very disappointed with the ending. Like the director thought ok originally I wanted a duel but lets just drop the duel and leave a million unanswered questions instead. Like what happened to the car? Clearly she didn't know how to drive any more which answers who she was in the end but the ending was so disappointing imo. Out of all the endings the director could have picked they decided ok now lets think of the worst way to end this film and lets go with that... It was the most cowardly way to end the film. Maybe that was the point? The coward wins? Ok I shouldn't give out any spoilers. It's worth watching for the first 1 hour and 30 minutes just be prepared to be utterly disappointed there isn't a further 30 minutes to wrap it up. I can also see how some people didn't like the emotionless acting. I really liked it. The whole time I was wondering whether she was autistic or not. I thought it was a great portrayal of someone who has autism so just like neurotypical people don't understand autistic people some people I can see might not understand or like how autistic people think. There are also some disturbing scenes akin to a horror movie. So if you are autistic and like horror I think you would really enjoy it but at the same time you will cringe at the ridiculous way the director chose to end it. It was a film, the director had no problem showing someone kill a dog but then decided a duel was too much? No, I did not like the ending one bit. I was really looking forward to the duel. I thought that was the point of the whole film but it just ended off on a bit of a sad depressing note. I did laugh quite a bit in the first hour, I loved the acting but the ending was too pathetic. She clearly had problems living with herself after what she did in the last 5 minutes which she already hinted she would but I am not surprised after what she did in the end which was the ultimate cowards way to end the duel.",/review/rw8071552/?ref_=tt_urv
