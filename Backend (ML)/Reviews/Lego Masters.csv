18 September 2003,bisz,," Hilarious!! Original!!
","Dharma & Greg has changed how I view sitcoms.  Having seen all of D&G I don't find anything else to be as funny as it used to be.  Frasier, Home Improvement, Drew Carey, According to Jim, Sports Night, all used to be my favorites but now none of them make me bellow out in laughter as hard and as often as Dharma & Greg does.",/review/rw1523914/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 1999,canto-3,," Jenna and Thomas are the couple of the century!!
","I really love Dharma & Greg. It shows the life of a young couple, in a very funny way. The episodes were hilarious and the actors were great! All the characters are great! There isn't that ""I Hate Him"" character. Dharma is hilarious and Greg is very cool, too. I think Jenna and Thomas are the couple of the century!!",/review/rw1523914/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2003,sminkydink,," Sadly Missed
","""Dharma & Greg"" is one of my favourite shows of recent years. It's cute and smart and I'm missing it already! I absolutely adore Jenna Elfman and I thought that the chemistry between herself and Thomas Gibson was absolutely infalliable. For the most part, the supporting cast were strong too, particularly the continuous bickering between Kitty and Edward (Susan Sullivan and Mitch Ryan) In the last series I missed my other favourite character, Jane (Shae D'Lyn), very much.",/review/rw1523914/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2003,cobain4ever494,," Great Television
","The show is great, plain and simple. Absolutely funny, mixing a nice balance of silliness and humor, with wit and drama. The show at times can really pull at you and make you think. The culture clash--social clash is more accurate--is eye opening and brings out real ideas and social issues. But never strays from the comedy. It's been nearly two years since the show ended, but I still watch and love the show. To be honest I barely had seen the show when it still produced new episodes, but I still love it and find that it still relates to what's going on in society now. Like I said, the show is great. Plain and simple.",/review/rw1523914/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2005,melissa-264,," This show inspired me in real life
","Dharma & Greg is my all-time favorite TV show, and I was in hog heaven with the re-runs. I wish they were still on regularly. I always considered the character of ""Dharma"" as ""my idol"" and really loved the idealistic marriage portrayed on the show, peppered with real issues that happen with real relationships. I yearned to have such a loving, happy marriage. Then, last year, on the first date with my now-husband, we discussed the show and it turned out he loved it and felt the same way about it. We are now in a wonderful, Dharma&Greg-esquire marriage filled with surprises, kookiness, hot, adventurous sex and lots of communication and love. Thanks for the inspiration!",/review/rw1523914/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2001,CELLIOTT10,," Jenna Elfman is absolutely hillarious
","In this excellent comedy series Dharma (Elfman) and Greg (Gibson) are a married couple and it's basically about what happens to them each week (a bit like ""Friends"" (1994). I would reccomend this TV Series to anyone who loves humour. The supporting characters are also a smash. Especially Susan Sullivan who plays the snobby rich housewife in the role of Gregs mother. She's fabulous. Watch Dharma and Greg. You'll love it.",/review/rw1523914/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2001,Nicola-J-B,," It. Is. Funny.
","Sometimes there is no need to deeply analyse television. Whatever Dharma and Greg is saying about free spirited living isn't really the issue. This programme is a comedy. It makes people laugh. And, in my opinion, it does this well. The relationship between Dharma and Greg is admirable, an example of a strong, love-filled and happy marital life, which is what we need more of. So no matter what some people say about it, my advice is to watch it and laugh.",/review/rw1523914/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2000,ziolon,," High quality viewing.
","You see sitcoms coming through that just aren't funny (ala Suddenly Susan, Jesse), but Dharma and Greg is hilarious. Dharma's free-spirited antics are hysterical, and both Greg's and Dharma's parents add something so special that no other shows have. In New Zealand, we are in our second season, and it rates very highly. In my opinion, the best sitcom on today. 9/10",/review/rw1523914/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2013,Bronco46,9," How everyone would like their lives to be.
","I guess real men aren't supposed to like a show like this. It's a rom-com to the max; but it's so well written and casted it draws you in. Besides I'm a real man and I like it. There's not just one or two really good characters; there's at least six of the regulars that so much fun, you can't imagine the show cast with anyone else. You really come to like these people, care for them, worry about them. I found the show in re-runs and thank goodness they're running all the episodes one after the other; I'm more then two thirds of the way thru, and I'm sorry to see it coming to and end. It's hard to rate these episodes they're all quite good; the lowest I've down rated one to a 7. Most are 8's and 9's with several 10's. Excellent show.",/review/rw1523914/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2005,jeffreykopp,," There's more depth to the parents
","Yes, there are parallels to ""I Love Lucy,"" but with a degree of introspection which was impossible for TV in those days. I regard this show as one of the last of the US broadcast networks' ""second golden age,"" which emerged at the end of the seventies.",/review/rw1523914/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2007,wchngliu,4," The Sickly Sweet Sentimentality Of This Show Turned Me Off
","I am not a fan of Dharma and Greg myself and neither was I keen on the jokes and the humour in the show. The plot sounded promising at first but the sickly sweet sentimentality of the romance theme, eventually grated on me. I didn't warm to the humour, having said that the show wasn't entirely funny itself. I don't mind the romantic element in sitcoms but I much prefer it as a sub-plot where the show also focuses on the coming together of the male and female couple. Likewise, they start out as friends, or as workmates, who then become friends and then as eventual lovers. Much better that way I suppose as opposed to it functioning as the main plot. Dharma and Greg was an almost cutesy-like sitcom, but the fact that with those two already together as a couple, it felt like that it was because of this that there wasn't much else to offer to the story. I do think that unlike other sitcom couples, there will never be a real-life couple like Dharma and Greg; well, I very much doubt that a relationship of their type would work as it did in real life, just like in the series. As a dramedy- type of show, Dharma and Greg may fare better in this sense but as a sitcom and with the premise of this show, the result is disappointing and thus, it just doesn't pay off effectively. The whole hippies /yuppies concept in the context of the relationships in D&G, was one I found nauseating and cumbersome.",/review/rw1523914/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 1999,jacksonc,," TOO SILLY
","I admit to never having watched a whole episode mainly because of the suffocating puerile silliness of the overall show. Yes, Elfman is attractive. However, that is not enough. As talented as she may be, she is no Lucille Ball. I think that is what she perceives herself as being. Sight gags and pratfalls do not make up for writing. I believe this show will beach itself and die in two or three seasons.",/review/rw1523914/?ref_=tt_urv

6 December 2002,flex6218,," The Straight ""Will and Grace""
","Let's face it Dharma and Greg is a wonderful show, funny,poignant, cute.......and on point. But the best single description of Dharma & Greg is ""The Straight Will & Grace"". I am sorry that D & G was taken off the air before it reached it's full potential",/review/rw1523914/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2015,monsterb-72498,10," I love this show!!
","I absolutely adore this show! I can't find anything else that quite compares. It's romantic, it's funny, it's witty, it's silly and it's fun. It's brilliantly written and acted perfectly with characters that actually make me laugh, unlike other sitcoms. It's the perfect example of how opposites attract and the comedy that ensues as the characters react to lifestyles or situations they wouldn't otherwise encounter. Above all, it's a show about love, respect and open communication. Dharma and Greg epitomize the perfectly imperfect fun loving relationship. I love watching re-runs (I bought the whole series) in my kitchen while I make dinner. It's light hearted, makes me feel good and entertains me while I cook. I only wish there were more episodes!",/review/rw1523914/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2004,SonicStuart,8," Hilarious!
","This is one of my favorite TV Comedy sitcoms! Jenna Elfman is very funny as Dharma. This show also reminds me of another comedy TV sitcom called Will and Grace! Dhrama and Greg kind of remind me of the way both my parents grew up, one grew up as a hippie and the other grew up as a civilized individual. Dhrama is a free-spirited yoga instructor with an incredible knack for looking on the bright side. Raised by hippie parents, she was taught to shun convention, trust her wildest instincts, and find the joy in everyday life. Her husband, Greg is a conservative, Harvard-educated attorney and the yin to Dharma's yang. Married on their first date, they have remained committed to each other from day one, despite the obstacles presented by the world around them. But this show is really funny! I hope they put this show out on DVD. Great sitcom overall.",/review/rw1523914/?ref_=tt_urv

","To my regret, I didn't discover Dharma and Greg until it was in syndication after it had ended as a series. I have since become a big fan and hope someday they do a reunion of sorts. From listening to Chuck Lorre, Jenna Elfman, Mimi Kennedy, Alan Rachins, Susan Sullivan and Mitchell Ryan comment about it on the DVDs, the show was perfectly cast.",/review/rw1523914/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2017,SnoopyStyle,7," Jenna Elfman revelation
","Dharma Freedom Finkelstein (Jenna Elfman) comes from hippie parents, Larry Finkelstein (Alan Rachins) and Abby O'Neil (Mimi Kennedy). Greg Clifford Montgomery (Thomas Gibson) comes from rich conservative parents, Kitty (Susan Sullivan) and Edward Montgomery (Mitchell Ryan). Dharma and Greg met as children riding on the NY subway. They meet again on the San Francisco subway. They go out on a date and get married in Vegas before the date ends. Greg works with his sleazy friend Pete Cavanaugh (Joel Murray) in the DA office. Dharma often goes out with her wild neighbor Jane (Shae D'lyn) with fake accents. Greg moves in with Dharma and her dog Stinky and Stinky's dog Nuncio. Celia is the Montgomery maid. Marci, Claire, and Susan are some of the teachers at the alternative learning co-op. Marlene is the grumpy legal secretary.

8 August 2004,caspian1978,6," Elfman's 15 minutes of fame
","Dharma & Greg hit the American television audience like an atomic bomb. It soon became a favorite to many viewers and hit hard at award shows and top ten lists. Then, the show had its moments and quickly disappeared. In 1997, Jenna Elfman entered the spotlight and took everyone's attention. Being as clever and funny as her name, Jenna Elfman seemed to be climbing the comedic charts as the next ""Lucy."" Then....it all ended. Much like the popularity of the show, Elfman's high profile career slowly went away. The show had a great premise and the cast was very like-able as the series went on. However, it came and went so quickly, the show never had its chance, like Elfman to be block buster material. A great romantic comedy series.",/review/rw1523914/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2006,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,9," An absolute ABC classic!
","""DHARMA & GREG,"" is my opinion, is an absolute ABC classic! I'm not sure I've seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it. It's hard to say which episode was my favorite. However, I think it was always funny when a mishap occurred. I always laughed at that. Despite the fact that it only lasted five seasons, it would have been nice if all the main characters stayed with the show throughout its entire run. It seems that no one stays with a show throughout its entire run. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, I hope they bring it back on the air for fans of the show to see.",/review/rw1523914/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2019,estathena2,8," Between your zen & funny bone
","I adored the series when it was 1st broadcast & thanks to hulu binge watching gifts the viewer with a more seamless flow from one episode to the next - at least for the first 2 seasons. The 3rd season is where the writing dips a bit & from then on struggles to recapture its initial brilliance. Also, Dharma's ever-changing hair length, shade, & style becomes a little distracting.",/review/rw1523914/?ref_=tt_urv

","this is the basic virtue of a decent sitcom. in this case is the axis. because it is one of the most inspired portraits of the clash between two opposite spirits and about the realistic chemistry between theirs. and this is the fact who impress. the acting becomes more significant than the story itself, Jenna Elfman has the entire liberty to use each nuance of her generous character, Thomas Gibson is the ideal partner and the sitcom becomes an useful pledge for tolerance. and this is the most important fact. ""Dharma & Greg"" has the virtue to seems be so simple than nothing could define it. a story of love and survive. a smart script and good actors. and, sure, a lot of events. so, a real seductive sitcom.",/review/rw1523914/?ref_=tt_urv
