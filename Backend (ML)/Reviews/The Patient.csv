3 May 2022,paul_haakonsen,7," Rather enjoyable...
","Initially I sat down to watch the 2022 animated movie ""The Bad Guys"" with very little expectation. Why? Well, because I wasn't sure what I was getting into here, aside from it being an animated movie that my son wanted to watch. But with it being an animated movie that I hadn't already seen, of course I opted to watch it with my son.",/review/rw8113622/?ref_=tt_urv

21 May 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,7," Fun for the entire fam.
","Great characters, some real LOL moments, and a nice, fun and cohesive story. Great animation and sound. It felt a little long for 100 mins, probably due to the predictability, although there was a fun twist.",/review/rw8113622/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2022,iamianiman,7," The Bad Guys taught us one thing; never judge a film by its trailer/poster.
","Low expectations were what I had when the trailer first appeared on my phone screen. I wasn't even interested to watch it 'till the end. I would roll my eyes on the animation style, it's not eye-catching nor it is impressive.",/review/rw8113622/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2022,UniqueParticle,9," One of the best animated experiences
","Highly entertaining villain/good guys story that is lovable for all ages! The colors are so vibrant throughout and heartwarming character driven great time; I bet the actors involved had a lot of fun. The Bad Guys are great thieves for good or bad reasons with the encouragement of push pops and life long friends. I loved this more than I could've imagined! The soundtrack is amazing and the story flows very well, I'd recommend to anyone.",/review/rw8113622/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2022,subxerogravity,7," An animation gem!
","So, it looks to me that the Bad Guys was influenced by the anime Lupin the third. Makes perfect sense, so many animated movies and series are. Sam Rockwell's Big Bad Wolf is a total play on this. Although I did notice that Disney's Seeing Red has a similar look so it looks like anime is getting even more intergraded in everything. I'm good with it!",/review/rw8113622/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2022,ayoreinf,8," Fun, character driven movie that works, even if some faults are definitely there
","This one, as another reviewer has already said , has wonderfully written characters (obviously - written and performed). It's not original - I couldn't care less - once again: originality as is, is overrated in my personal book. So despite obvious similarities with Zootopia I still enjoyed it wholeheartedly. Some of the plot twists can be spotted miles ahead - it doesn't matter. Once we got to know and like these lovely characters we just want to see the story through and know how it all ended for them. Only problem is - most of the climax of the movie doesn't really make sense. Or to put it simply, think it out carefully and you'll realize - it couldn't happen the way the movie explains it. I'd give it 10 stars if it was making sense. And then again - it's not as important as it could be in other movies.",/review/rw8113622/?ref_=tt_urv

",Already one of the best films of the 2020 decade and one of Dreamworks' best films in a long time.,/review/rw8113622/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2022,doomedmac,7," The Bad Guys is good!
","Of course the animation is a massive highlight, and I also enjoyed the story, characters, and some of the plot twists. It's a tad predictable and not incredibly funny but hey! I had a really good time.",/review/rw8113622/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2022,rht1369,7," An overnight viral sensation...
","This is fun light hearted animation. The story is entertaining and adorable at times. The humor is to my liking: even though some jokes are predictable, they're still well placed and executed well. I personally enjoyed the art style combining 3D animation with comic style 2D drawings. Kudos to the animators, the faces of the characters were very expressive.",/review/rw8113622/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2022,ol-11,8," Surprisingly good
","I completely agree with the first reviewer: I had low expectation after seeing the trailer, too. But ""The Bad Guys"" turned out to be a very clever movie, well-made, with a sophisticated script, and fast-moving. Most importantly: It's not taking itself too seriously. I mean: A shark as a master of disguise!?",/review/rw8113622/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2022,rafiado,8," The Style Was So üò´üòç
","The Animation Style was so good i really love it 2D but it's 3D if im not wrong its called 2.5D, i like The story to, not to fast and not complicated and... i like The plot twist it has a twist and a twist again. All the Best about this movie is the Animation Style i like the new Dreamworks Style i think like every production House of animation Try a new Style like Pixar did after ""Soul"". You should Watch this with your family now on Cinemas.",/review/rw8113622/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2022,Clank_Zoka,10," A Return to Form from DreamWorks!
","The new DreamWorks film seems very ambitious and something that I have never seen from them before, which is crazy, so it's based on the wonderful book series by Aaron Blabey, along with a all star cast and directed by Pierre Perifel who worked on the Bilby short from the studio, most of their recent films have either been fun or mediocre, How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World was the last DreamWorks film that was amazing with everything else in between being just not as strong and even forgettable, but with this there's definitely a lot of hype surrounding this film from the way it looks and the wacky sense of humour and I am very excited about this, I did read a few of the book in preparation for this film, so I saw it yesterday at a early preview or ""see it first"" if you will and..... no joke, this is the best DreamWorks film in years, I'm not kidding, this is exactly what I wanted and this is what I missed about their writing and style, so let's talk about it!",/review/rw8113622/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2022,masonsaul,8," Great animated movie
","The Bad Guys uses a familiar story to explore familiar themes but that doesn't stop it from being a great animated movie that's really heartwarming, funny and consistently fast paced with a really strong message at its core.",/review/rw8113622/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2022,wisemanfromtowne,5," Predictable/cliche but watchable.
","Same ole same ole story of bad guys being used a by a so called good guy who just so happens to be just another bad who sets them up and frames them for a crime they didn't commit and in the end, the bad guys redeem themselves and are hailed as the true good guys yada yada yada. Whether animated or film, the story premise is predictable and cliche but a solid one time family been there and done that watch. Hey Hollywood....it's time for some fresh material. Enough of this recycling.....üò¥üò¥üò¥",/review/rw8113622/?ref_=tt_urv

6 June 2022,planktonrules,7," Not exactly life-changing, but enjoyable.
","""The Bad Guys"" is the newest CGI film from Dreamworks...the same folks who brought us ""Shrek"", ""Madagascar"" and ""Kung Fu Panda"". I saw it tonight and it was a nice film...not exactly brilliant or life-changing but enjoyable.",/review/rw8113622/?ref_=tt_urv

",".. The Guinea pig lab animal scene, omg omg omg, it filled me with glee - seriously yall - it's such a wackily conceived scene, that it made my whole weekend - Granted, I'm a fan of these big budget animations - but the absurdity of this is too good - overall I really enjoy the concept of attempting to redeem the 'bad guys' oh and the wolf's tail wag - well.. Just watch.",/review/rw8113622/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2022,kakko2,7," Not Bad for Bad Guys
","I'll be honest, The Bad Guys is far from masterpieces like Pixar's Up, Wall-E, and the plot is rather predictable. But who am I kidding, almost all animations are predictable since they're made for kids so that shouldn't be a problem, as long as they're enjoyable. Fortunately for The Bad Guys, now I wouldn't say the movie 'nailed it', but it turned out to be pretty decent.",/review/rw8113622/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2022,nogodnomasters,8," Better than Cake
","The film opens with a wolf and a snake talking in a restaurant that looked like it came out of Pulp Fiction. They are part of a crime group that includes a shark, a tarantula and a piranha who has gas issues. They decide to steal the Golden Dolphin award handed out annually to the city's best citizen. This year it goes to a guinea pig , the snake's favorite food. Better than cake.",/review/rw8113622/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2022,donmurray29,9," Fun, action, laughs, and lots of crime film homages
","Imagine Oceans 11, the car chases from Ronin, Bullet, and Blues Brothers, along with the crazy humor,with great animation, it's all here! I've seen it twice with the previews we had here and it opens fully in the next few days, I will see it a third time. There are some problems, which really, don't soil the film at all, the pace is fast in the action the driving scenes, the dialogue is snappy, and the voice acting is spot on, but best of all, it is very funny and entertaining. The music by Daniel Pemberton, he did, Into the Spiderverse, is rocking from start to finish. Even the end credits have story going into it. It's in my films of the year list and this 2022 has had some gems, already.",/review/rw8113622/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2022,FeastMode,6," Not bad... get it?
","Please forgive that terrible joke. This is a pretty good family movie with a great cast and fun story. I love the animation style, it's almost like a combination of realistic and cartoonish. Some aspects look hand-drawn while others look like real photos with a cartoon effect. I don't think I've seen anything like it.",/review/rw8113622/?ref_=tt_urv

4 May 2022,daisukereds,8," I knew you were good
","While it feels like it was made for children and the plot is rather straightforward.. this movie has style in spades. Choreography, Camerawork and Visuals are simply the best part! With action scenes that are worth repeat-watching, and a touch of hand-painted flare here and there to bump it up a notch. I was impressed with how creative it gets.",/review/rw8113622/?ref_=tt_urv
