6 December 2017,tigerfish50,8," Seduction and Disappointment
","The excellent Season 1 (8/10*) of 'The Girlfriend Experience' related how a law student ventured into high-end prostitution while interning at a big-city legal firm in order to pay the bills. Riley Keogh's portrayal of the main character Christine won a Golden Globe nomination, as her understated performance depicted the psychological cost of pretending affection to entitled executives while selling them her body. The scripts for each episode remained focused on the escort work throughout, with Keogh's micro-expressions betraying inner conflicts and guarded emotions as Christine subtly adjusted her persona to please various clients, lovers and employers. The series revealed how prostitution affected her personal life and law career, and ultimately derailed both.",/review/rw3651573/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2021,notanaxkiller-107-287911,5," Rating Trilogy
","I gave this series a 5 on the ratings list. The first season was a ten. It was everything that it could be. Riley Keough was a treat. The subject matter was what I expected. Season two I rated a three. Nothing there to hold my attention. The actors, AND acting was less than acceptable. Season three, through 6 episodes I've rated a two. It's no longer about a ""girlfriend experience"". It's about businesses interested in money, and artificial intelligence. The name no longer has any relevance to the story line. On top of that it is EXTREEMLY boring. If they had called it ""AI and Pheromones In The Time of Sexual Ambiguity"" and had better writers, it might have received a better reception. I added my ratings, and divided them by 3 for the three seasons, and the result was 5. It's a flawed ratings system. Each season should be separately rated.",/review/rw3651573/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2017,FinneganBear,1," Season 2 was awful.
","Season 1 was a well written, well acted character study of Christine Reade, who transforms from smart, ""good girl"", from a good family, who does well in law school, receives an internship at a prestigious firm but winds up a high priced call girl. Christine was not a particularly likeable character but her transformation from one world into another was spellbinding. ",/review/rw3651573/?ref_=tt_urv

",Wow l never known her from before this but Riley Keogh was amazing in it I started to watch second season not knowing she was not in it ...when I realised I stopped watching . WTF were they thinking . !!! She was the show.,/review/rw3651573/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2021,ObscureFilmLover,3," Season Three -As Disappointing as They Come
",Season One of GFE was an unexpected delight. Riley Keogh gave a brave uninhibited performance. Lodge Kerrigan and Amy Seimitz were the show runners and brought enough difference to the subject matter that the tension in the narrative benefited from it. In Season Two Kerrigan and Seimitz are each given their own story line over five episodes and it was an epic failure because each were now unrestrained in their vision and it did not work.,/review/rw3651573/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2021,Hallelujah289,6," Wish I could rate the seasons differently
","Season 1 had a lot of sex, even too much sex to the point that it got repetitive. But what it had was an intriguing probably sociopathic character who tries out being an escort and getting a little more than money from it. Interesting, complex character study, with an actual plot with good secondary characters as well. 7 or sometimes 8 out of 10 for me.",/review/rw3651573/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2016,FinneganBear,1," Riley Keough is fantastic.
","There are two things going on in this series: the story line and the acting of Riley Keough. The series is done in 13 half-hour episodes so there is little time for providing background or explanations. Rather, the intent and motivations of Christine/Chelsea/Amanda are expressed entirely in the body language, vocal tones, eyes and expressions of Ms. Keough. It is a complex character but by the end of the series I felt I understood this character as I have understood few others. Being previously unfamiliar with Ms. Keough, I was frankly stunned by her acting talent. In the later episodes, the story line transitions from the inner turmoil of the main character while living a dual life into her life entirely as a call girl. This gives Ms. Keough less to do in terms of portraying the multiple aspects of her character. The series suffers for this. Many viewers will focus on the sex scenes, some of which are probably too long if not unnecessary. This is a shame because it takes the focus away from the incredible job Ms. Keough does in realistically portraying a character trying to exist in two vastly different worlds while trying to prevent those worlds from colliding. With a less gifted actress, GFE would be a run of the mill drama. What sets this series apart is Ms. Keough's fascinating portrayal of a complex character. She makes it well worth watching and I look forward to her next project.",/review/rw3651573/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2021,UniqueParticle,9," Bold, provocative and well done business conglomerate
","Worth watching for Riley Keogh at least the first couple seasons! Odd the series originally came out in 2010 and continued in the last couple years especially since the new ones seem poorly rated but I'm enjoying the beginning so far. The Girlfriend Experience has a errie vibe it seems I crave that although that's barely part of it the drama is astonishing! In other roles Riley is masterful like this very good in horror roles, I think she can do anything.",/review/rw3651573/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2016,lambiepie-2,8," Cold and detached
","I never saw the previous film nor read the book so I went into this series not knowing much about it, and being totally ignorant to it all. What I finally figured out about the Girlfriend Experience is that it was just that, a young woman pushing herself off as giving men that GF experience while trying to find out who she was and wrestling with her self with loving it beyond her advertised GF experience and conflicted by it.",/review/rw3651573/?ref_=tt_urv

11 April 2016,bjarias,8," ..been done before... this one measures up..
","This is a very good production with very few weaknesses. The one most comes to mind is every time the Christine character comes on screen.. I can't but help see Kaya Scodelario from 'Skins.' And that's the dilemma, as both these actors have a very 'youthful' appearance... and high-end escorts in major urban areas need a more mature 'look' to be able to mingle seamlessly in upper business and social circles. Keough does very well though, and she is without doubt a very talented actor. Just a thought in this series, she should be made to appear (dress) older whenever possible. The remainder of the cast is solid, and the script is well.. what it is. They're trying to make it more intriguing, and for the most part they do pull it off. And it should have been decided to do forty-something minute episodes versus the twenty-something. Good dramas have something taken away in half-hour slots. I'd really like to see TGE go on and mature at least another couple seasons.",/review/rw3651573/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2017,TheAnimalMother,3," A Story Of Greed Intoxicated Human Zombies
","Let me start by saying that I thought the original film of the same name, was brutally bad in nearly every way. However the premise and theme had potential I thought, so I decided to check the series out in hopes that it may far exceed the film. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case at all. This series is if anything, probably worse than the film.",/review/rw3651573/?ref_=tt_urv

","I loved season 1 but I have no idea what they were thinking this season. It is boring as hell and I want the story line from season 1 back please. Season 2 is a mess.....it is uncomfortable and just plain boring to watch. Riley Keough in season 1 was so good. She is beautiful, dark, and mischievous. She really carried this show. Louisa Krause in season 2 is not suited for a part like this. I am so mad this show has been ruined.",/review/rw3651573/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2021,caspian1978,7," Why Season 3 Sucked
","For starters, the plot for Season 3 sucked. As a stand alone premise, sure the story has some merit, but when your audience demands sex, nudity, sex, exotic tones and even more sex, the last thing you want to do is showcase something plastic and fake like season 3. Most of the season was an ongoing tease. While Season 1 and Season 2 dives right into the erotic overtones of the stories plot, Season 3 drags for multiple episodes until you start to get any shock or substance that resembles the first two seasons. Even worse, the entire season teases us with Julia Goldani Telles, who is unable to carry the show. Although beautiful, her performance is empty. Unlike Riley Keough and Louisa Krause, Telles does not make herself vulnerable to her character. Keough and Krause both took on this raw subject matter which is the reason why the Girlfriend Experience has an audience. Instead, Telles spends most of the storyline talking when the audience demands action. Yes, the sex element is the selling point but the meaningless sex that Season 3 showcased is only physical. The previous seasons captured a real, raw and vulnerable action that deserved its audience. Season 3 was as fake and the cyber story plot and equal with his performances. Everyone acts like mannequins with no real emotion. Besides some moments of eye candy, Season 3 has nothing to offer its audience.",/review/rw3651573/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2016,nikolazekoviczonin,3," Boring, flat, frigid in any sense...
","They announced this as: sexy, intriguing, dark experience.. and made something totally opposite of that. I am not sure was it intentional or the actors did bad job but god there is no single emotion this series can extract from you beside total boredom and sleepiness. Girl should portrait independent strong woman that loves sex and money, she just look like introvert frigid girl with that empty look and same face when brushing her teeth or having orgasms, no difference. Even her reasons for doing it are not clear trough the all episodes, she just barely mentioned that her school was expensive. I cant not to think that target group for this was just horny teens or middle aged creeps because of so much bad sex scenes with older people, but even then it would be miss because i can not imagine level of horny-ness that someone will find those scenes sexy or attractive in any way. Why is she looking all the time like molested sex trafficking victim? Isn't she supposed to love sex? How can we believe that all that millionaires are crazy about her and wiling to pay thousands and ruin their families to spend some more time with her? The producer should at least pay themselves some real escort girl for night and see why they earn so much, how entertaining and sexy they must be to be in the business. Girl in movie looks cute and sexy but on photos, in communication with people around her she looks like creep. So again, maybe i missed the all point of movie, maybe they wanted to show us something that i can not understand at the moment, but for me this show is just boring.",/review/rw3651573/?ref_=tt_urv

19 April 2016,cstaum,8," Cold but still inviting
","The show is delivered in a cold, unemotional manner that sets the tone. It seems similar to Mr. Robot and American Psycho in a lot of ways. People going through motions of life but mainly pretending. There is no intro for the show - the episodes start and eventually the title of the show displays on screen.",/review/rw3651573/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2016,alex_van_beek,6," Entertaining titillation with ultimately a missed logical reward of substance but I like it anyway
","If my summary title of this could be the whole review, then I would leave it at that. I enjoyed watching this show, I did so during a day and I was compelled each time to follow up with the next episode- and not just for the gorgeous and fantastically sexy Riley Keough (I felt like seeing Elvis' granddaughter's tits was kind of something I wanted to do) but also for the storyline which really built up nicely ...only to sort of let it down in the end and just do nothing with all that tension, missing out on a massively rewarding and expected treat. The finale was anticlimactic and made me think that the more thought provoking and emotional aspects of this show were an accidental byproduct of just creating a vehicle to showcase Riley Keough's tits. I don't want to believe that but the cynic in me more than entertains the possibility of a TV network hoping to rope in some higher ratings by just conceding to the lowest common denominator. This show really had some terrific moments and whether clumsily or accidentally discards them in a faux-ironic act of having a bland bit of light neo-pornographic airtime substitute for a resolution, twist, or at the very least anything that resembled the conclusion of a coherent train of thought.",/review/rw3651573/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2018,sesbjorn-241-62754,8," Alienation in the modern world
","Very interesting series, well crafted, thought-provoking, both intriguing and depressing to watch... As I see it, it's very much about being obsessed about material wealth and the independence in having money and how that can be a very addictive substitute for real intimacy and trust in one's life. And it's about being addicted to different sorts of short-term pleasures, arising from as well as creating more loneliness. And it's about power, having control and protect oneself in an environment, where everyone are objects or means to an end for each other... The world of lawyers, corporates etc. And it's about a modern society, where basic human needs for connection, sharing our whole being including our sexuality, are capitalised... A society where friendship and love often are substituted by professional relations... The series main focus is on sexual relations and the sex business - but the same dynamics also applies to how therapists, coaches and other professionals can be substitutes, when there's a lack of trust in friends and family...",/review/rw3651573/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2017,redwhiteandblue1776,2," Season Two - Boring, not sexy, dull
","About the only thing duller and less interesting then the program are the sets. The political ""story"" is a total flop. Boring from the very start. Not sure what the director is try to do with the no furniture, no pictures (or anything else) on the wall, white everything and somewhat attractive girls running around with no makeup. Maybe the director is trying to match the flat people and sets with the flat plot. Hey it worked. About 3 shows and it just never got any better so I quit. Big waist of television air time. Why this show hasn't been cancelled is a mystery.",/review/rw3651573/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2022,Reznik_T,8," Season 1 is excellent television!
","I finished the first nine episodes of season 1 and I'm completely surprised by how good this show is. Yes, there is nudity, yes, there are sex scenes and yes, Riley Keough is absolutely gorgeous, but this show is so much more than just that. It's a character study with an outstanding performance by Keough and the filmmaking is as good as you'll see in any tv show out there. The camera work and the sound design is especially well done. Also, starting from episodes 7-8 the level of suspense starts going up quite quickly and it's hard to stop watching it.",/review/rw3651573/?ref_=tt_urv

","While many may hate this series for politically correct reasons or because they are not used to adult pacing (as opposed to juvenile comic book-style movies full of flashy editing), I was taken in by it ... but mostly because of Riley Keough, who is a very natural, subtle actress. The series features a little titillation here and there, but it's tasteful, artfully photographed, and looks great. ",/review/rw3651573/?ref_=tt_urv
