28 July 2018,jmb-68085,7," Not what I expected...
","This was on my to-watch list for quite a while before I gave it a chance. Holy crap this movie is good. Not ten stars good, obviously, but man it throws some curve balls. All of the actors were competent and believable. The tension builds and builds. The ending was stereotypical but didn't detract from the film at all. Wonder how much time Patrick Stewart had to spend in makeup to play a skinhead lol.",/review/rw3318758/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2021,gbill-74877,6," Entertaining
","Great setup, which has a punk band taking what turns out to be a very bad gig (jeez that's an understatement) and ending up fighting for their lives against neo-Nazis. Early on the cinematography is quite good, and it segues to a feeling of claustrophobia that enhances the drama. It felt like it could have led to something more, however, and ended up as a standard drama. Patrick Stewart is suitably menacing even when all the character motivations don't seem to add up, and was a nice addition to the cast. I loved how they showed that the attack dog was simply loyal to its owner, which was probably my favorite moment in the film. It's not a bad watch and engaging throughout, just not something particularly inspiring.",/review/rw3318758/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2016,Giacomo_De_Bello,7," 7.5/10
","A punk rock band is brought into playing at skinhead club. After their set, whilst hey are leaving the club, by mistake they end up in the wrong room and witness a murder. Tension rises between the club managers and the band who are forced into a room and trapped in there whilst Darcy (Patrick Stewart), the head of the skinhead fellowship as well as the owner of the club, tries to put together a plan before things go too south.",/review/rw3318758/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2016,Deimos-remus,10," White Knuckle filmmaking at its best
","First off, want to say R.I.P Anton Yelchin. Such a tragedy for someone so young and promising to pass. He was incredible in this, I felt he was really coming into his own as an actor. --- After watching Saulnier's excellent and understated Blue Ruin, the director immediately became one to watch out for. A director that knows how to direct characters with subtlety and nuance, but with intensity and brutality as well. ",/review/rw3318758/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2016,Screen_Blitz,9," Extremely violent, gory but wildly exhilarating from beginning to end
","Director Jeremy Saulnier exercises high pressure suspense and astonishing realism in this white-knuckle thriller following his surprising success with the ultra-violent 'Blue Ruins'. Though it doesn't fall deep in the category of originality or even groundbreaking in any sense, the intriguing fashion in which Saulnier executes this film and the immersive cinematography by Sean Porter used to capture the harrowing intensity and gloomy visuals result in a highly effective slasher treat; and even labeling the results effective feels like an understatement. While the shocking level of bloody violence and gore more than not make this tough sit-through, especially for the weak stomach; Saulnier pervades a true sense of realism in a way in which the film never feels exploitative, but wildly authentic. So this film follows a punk rock band consisting of twenty-something year olds including lead singer Tiger (played by Callum Turner), guitarist Sam (played by Alia Shawkat), bassist Pat (played by Anton Yelchin), and drummer Reece (played by Joe Cole). When the band is offered a gig by a radio host named Tad, they find themselves performing at nowhere other than an old bar run by neo-Nazi skinheads. After a successful performance, the band and their friend Amber (played by Imogen Poots) rushes out to their green room where they witness a murder by the hands of a sadistic skinhead. In fear of being held responsible for the murders, skinhead leader Darcy Banker (played by Patrick Stewart) arrives an orders his gangs to eliminate the witnesses, leading the band to a bloody fight for survival.",/review/rw3318758/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2018,nitro999,8," A must watch if you have any appreciation of indie efforts
","I watched this movie because I so enjoyed Jeremy Saulnier's ""Blue Ruin"" in which I thought all the characters were 'real' people and the action believable. If you want a brief respite from Hollywood's high-dollar, high-tech gloss then you will probably enjoy this depiction of a nitty gritty, down and dirty, all out, no holds barred fight for survival. Set aside a couple of hours and give this movie a watch. The acting was good, particularly from Patrick Stewart whose appearance in this Indie effort lent it some Hollywood 'depth'. The movie would have been just fine without him, but it was good to see him playing a cool part in a low budget show. Okay, there were a couple of 'oh-I-wish-I'd-had-my-eyes-closed-when-that-happened' moments but nothing too far out. As in ""Blue Ruin"", all the characters had a 'real people' feel. Highly recommended - by me anyway. On my 0 to 9 scale an 8.",/review/rw3318758/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2016,drownsoda90,9," Tension galore
","""Green Room"" follows a vagabond punk band traveling through Oregon, where they book a show at what they come to find out is a neo-nazi skinhead punk club. The show goes well enough, but after they become witnesses to a murder, the group—along with a female regular at the club— are held hostage at the instruction of the community's head honcho.",/review/rw3318758/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2016,WalterSoprano,8," Violence at its most chilling and effective!
",I have seen some crazy violent films from cannibal holocaust to a Serbian film but no other film that comes to mind executes violence as un settling as this. For me I mean this in a positive way for others the violence could be the very thing to turn them off to it and possibly ruin the movie. May this be a forewarning for some and a recommendation for those who might be interested.,/review/rw3318758/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2018,Sleepin_Dragon,8," Hold on to your hat, this is flat out viewing.
","After the first ten minutes I came close to switching it off, I couldn't see why the ratings for it were so high, but......When the band finish their performance the film comes to life, it's hard hitting, dramatic and gripping, described as an adrenaline rush, that's a good description, very edge of the seat viewing. The quality of the film also seems to flick into action at the same point, what starts off as a slow and padded beginning transforms into a slick, well acted movie. Patrick Stewart is excellent, very menacing in a subtle way, but star of the show has to be Imogen Poots, who is fantastic. The ending is hugely dramatic too, I have to ask though, why always are Staffys used, they get such a bad deal in movies, but are the best dogs!",/review/rw3318758/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2016,ThomasDrufke,9," Jeremy Saulnier Does it Again
","Green Room is full of visceral thrills, gritty violence, and real characters forced into situations where they have to do despicable things. And to be quite honest, that's absolutely terrifying to watch for 90 minutes.",/review/rw3318758/?ref_=tt_urv

1 December 2021,jon_pratt12345,7," Brutal and dread filled
","A straight forward, brutal story. Compelling characters and exciting progression of dread. I really felt a strong sense of danger and realism in this film which is a rare experience. Very well acted and aggressively directed.",/review/rw3318758/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2016,Boristhemoggy,3," Sorry, B movie if ever there was one.
","I'm flabbergasted with some of the reviews on here, and especially when someone stated that Patrick Stewart had said he had to set his security before he went to bed as the film was that horrific. I think that's marketing because it's not the horrific at all. ",/review/rw3318758/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2020,barrelhousegutboy,8," Mystery of one and done bands finally solved?
","No label punk band living out of a van while on the road for shoestring tour wind up in a very bad situation. After the last gig is a bust and short gas money to get back home they get a line on a walk-in that will net them the cash to return home. The off the beaten path country bar for old school skins turns out to be run by an organized 4th Reich gang. The set finished they are on the way out the door when a forgotten phone leads to the night that kills the band.
I initially passed on seeing this based on blurbs that made the movie sound like yet another Hollyweird screed on how inbred racist white hillbillies are killing the world's love with their hate. You have to be pretty thick if that is what you take from this film.
This is a lean and solid thriller about coming afoul of criminal enterprise by happenstance. Characters are fleshed out just enough to set the table, the meal comes in the form of hyper realism of wound FX, believable violence, and an interplay between antagonist and protagonist that is refreshingly smart and gritty. Aside from sticking your arm out the door and splitting up the typical dumbassery that tend to sneak into movies of this type is refreshingly absent. No preaching, no virtue signalling. An organized concealed criminal enterprise with experience staying off the radar vs some fairly streetwise and tactical not going to be your victim targets.
And while the movie is absolutely worth seeing based on merit alone the inclusion of Patrick Stewart as leader of the gang is just the cherry on top not to be missed. If you are a fan of the genre don't let this gem slip by you.",/review/rw3318758/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2016,zetes,9," Fantastic thriller
","Jeremy Saulnier showed a ton of promise with his previous film, Blue Ruin, and his follow-up is even better. This is one of the tautest, nastiest thrillers in recent memory. If you like wincing at movies and watching them through your fingers, this is definitely for you! A nobody punk band calling themselves The Ain't Rights (Anton Yelchin, Alia Shawkat, Joe Cole and Callum Turner) is a long way from home and their ""tour"" has hardly given them enough money to live, let alone buy gas (they siphon). A fan sets them up with a gig at a secret skinhead bar, and it would hardly be punk to turn such a thing down. They quickly find themselves over their heads when they witness a horrific crime and try to call the cops. Cops aren't welcome, and soon the band finds themselves locked up in the club's green room, along with the murder victim's best friend (Imogen Poots) awaiting probably murder. They're smart, though, and attempt a defense, but they're hopelessly outnumbered. Patrick Stewart plays the skinhead ringleader. Other recognizable actors include Macon Blair (star of Blue Ruin) and Mark Webber. It's always great to see real talent behind genre films, and I deeply hope Saulnier keeps it up.",/review/rw3318758/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2020,anthonyduffy,3," Am I missing something?
","I've heard people rave about this film and seen the high reviews. I'm not sure what I missed... I'd assumed there'd be something beneath the surface that would add substance to a gorey B-Movie, but I just don't see it. Patrick Stewart as a Neo Nazi is the only reason I won't rate it lower. Sub par slasher with delusions of grandeur. Nowhere near the cultish status it strives for.",/review/rw3318758/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2015,Sergeant_Tibbs,7," Thrives on a sense of dread rather than subversive tension like Blue Ruin.
","Besides the notable cast, Jeremy Saulnier's Green Room is most likely closer to his 2007 horror comedy Murder Party than his sleeper 2014 thriller Blue Ruin. One of the most pleasant surprises of last year, it was very nice to see that Saulnier managed to gather up a follow-up in a relatively quick time – the gap from festival run to general release date notwithstanding. Green Room continues the vein of comically inept people in violent situations, but it's too crowded and lacks the subversiveness that made Blue Ruin so riveting. More characters means more bloodshed, but it uses that a crutch to get easy thrills rather than spending time getting us invested. Nevertheless, on concept alone it's destined for cult status, but lets hope Saulnier has a better idea up his sleeve next. ",/review/rw3318758/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2022,paul_haakonsen,5," Meh... It sort of failed to deliver...
","Right, well with a statement that reads ""delivers maximum shock and awe"" brandished on the movie's cover, I must admit that I was harboring some expectations to writer and director Jeremy Saulnier's 2015 thriller. Sure, as I sat down in 2022 to watch ""Green Room"", then I hadn't even heard about it. So I wasn't really sure what I was in for.",/review/rw3318758/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2016,t-dooley-69-386916,7," A Brilliantly compelling thriller
",A punk band are on tour trying to build up a following and get the 'vibe' going. It is going down like a pork pie at a bar mitzvah and then they get offered an actual paying gig; only it is out in the wilds of the Pacific North west of America. On arrival it looks a bit down market to be honest.,/review/rw3318758/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2017,Matt_Layden,8," What's your 'desert-island' band?
","Saulnier's Blue Ruin was a shotgun blast to the chest of intense thrills from an unknown director. I had no idea what to expect from Blue Ruin, but when it was over my wife simply turned to me and said, ""That was intense"". So I was excited to see his next film get some big name recognition on board. The late Anton Yelchin, Imogen Poots, Alia Shaukat and Picard himself, Patrick Stewart showcase their talents in this nail bitter of a follow-up.",/review/rw3318758/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2016,chaos-rampant,," Minor thread
","The blueprint for this one is laid out early in the scene with the interview; not the form, but the energy of shared experience that pumps blood on the inside, or so it goes. So let me chuck away the form. Plotwise it's about a band who witnessed what they shouldn't have, holed up in a club. No matter, good things can be made from anything. The form is a bit more polished than most horror films but hardly anything worth noting.",/review/rw3318758/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2016,mikey187-818-899620,1," Painful , very poor
","Poor film. How anyone can rate it I don't know . It just makes no sense . A couple of feeble humans stuck in a building on the middle of no where while the skin heads have numbers in abundance , guns , human eating dogs , but a women with a fire extinguisher and a high pitched microphone can do better. Why don't they all just go in the place in the beginning and kill them? They know the band aren't armed yet they don't go into the room with a thin rotting old door, and instead they send packs of two in. It's just so stupid . It's a situation that in real life , would have been over in 5 minutes , yet you have to sit and wait for a painful amount of time for them to escape instead.",/review/rw3318758/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2016,Hey_Sweden,6," Not bad, but nothing groundbreaking.
","""Green Room"" is a decent enough thriller starring Anton Yelchin, Joe Cole, Alia Shawkat, and Callum Turner as the members of a punk band named The Ain't Rights (or the Aren't Rights, if you prefer). One night, they're the musical act at an isolated night club catering to Neo Nazi skinheads. Before they can leave, they are witness to a murder, and the people running the club have confined them to a room so that they can deal with the problem in their own way. The Ain't Rights will then be forced to deal with the evil club owner, Darcy (the great Patrick Stewart), and his unrelenting minions.",/review/rw3318758/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2015,horrorinpureform,9," The Green Room may not be the best movie I've seen this year (although it also may be). It is the most entertaining and thrilling one by far though, that's for certain.
","A punk band made up of poor friends tours in a broken van, playing their songs at hole-in-the-wall places. They unknowingly are sent to play a gig at a neo-nazi commune. It goes ""OK"" until they accidentally enter a room where a girl has just been murdered, and are locked inside by the neo-Nazis. A mostly-enclosed game of cat- and-mouse ensues between the band members and the skinheads. ",/review/rw3318758/?ref_=tt_urv
