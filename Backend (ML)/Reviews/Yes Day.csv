12 December 2021,shelbythuylinh,7," Went Downhill After Crawford Left
",And how that it should had been Prima Donna Damon Wayans leaving and how that he sabotage his own show to have those under him cater to him. Sad that the show went down though no fault of Seann William Scott's in the last season.,/review/rw4160184/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2018,Akshay_Patel1985,10," If Clayne Goes we all Go..... Love the show. Each and Every part of it.
","Love the show and don't miss a single episode. Have taken an Amazon Prime subscription just to watch this show the day it releases. 
Riggs and Murtah are each 50% of the reason i love this show... And if rumours are true... I am soon gonna loose 50% of the reason to watch the show... And 50% is toooooooo less a reason to continue watching it. 
I know Riggs may have goofed up a lil too much for the producers/etc to have taken such a stern action.... But, from what i read....Clayne C. has apologized. I say, give him one more chance ""officially"" and if he continues make it public and remove him fron season 3....(Fans will understand) ....but until then.... He is an integral part of the show and anyone else will take time to (if only he may) do justice to the role.... A bet i dont wanna wait and see materialize.... So, if season 3 has no Clayne.. .. There is no reason to continue watch the show..... ",/review/rw4160184/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Fun show that will hook you!
","Lethal Weapon really was a fun show that's definitely worth watching. It's obviously a reboot based of the movie franchise but set in the modern day. It was a lot better with Clayne Crawford but was still pretty good when Seann William Scott took his place. It has everything you would want from a show called Lethal Weapon...plenty of action, comedy, drama, twists, etc. It's a show that doesn't try to be anything it's not, it knows what kind of show it is and leans in to it. If you're looking for an action packed show with buddy comedy then you won't be disappointed in this. You'll be hooked before you know it.",/review/rw4160184/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2018,oatsart54,10," wrong
",He apologized and paid restitution for his behavior if he is not in the season 3 then you lost a viewer.He and Dayan make the show work to bring in a new Riggs is stupid and you lose tour fans of the show that I am sure of.He makes the show what it is and the character he plays is good acting so he is a little high strung and cares about the series do not condemn a man for trying to be all he can be. Even criminals pay their dept with jail time and want a new start in live so why can't you give him one,/review/rw4160184/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2018,weareone1111,10," Bring back Clayne
",Not watching Season 3; enjoy the plummet in ratings. We'd rather have Clayne with a replacement for Damon instead of no Clayne at all.,/review/rw4160184/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2017,dz1,9," Reminds me of the best of the 1980s
",This series really surprised me. It has been a long time since I looked forward to watching a show as much as this one every week. It reminds me of many good 80s cop or detective shows. No one has been able to equal the buddy cop or detective show formula of the 80s until now. Very well done indeed.,/review/rw4160184/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2018,pipedpiper,1," Just saw a preview of season 3
",What a joke this program is done with Riggs not in it show is over,/review/rw4160184/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2018,c_sims76,1," Season 3
",Could careless the reason why. You break up the main people in a franchise based on two characters and you get rid of one of those main characters. Dynamic is ruined. Screw Stiffler,/review/rw4160184/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2018,mojotre,4," Reported set issues and the apparent death of the guy that kept us coming back?
","Update: OK, made it through 3.25 episodes of Season 3. It is apparent Wayans' Murtaugh was never up to par with Glover but it was forgivable because Crawford's Riggs was very very good (Not going to say better than Gibson but really good). Sean Williams Scott is not bad but now the Murtaugh character is front, center and unwatchable.",/review/rw4160184/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2018,israeldjane,1," The end of a great show
","When i first heard of this show i was not excited. Ugh another remake. However, after watching the show i fell in love with the fabulous cast and especially the amazing Clayne Crawford. Unfortunately i will no longer be watching this show because of the firing of Clayne. One day i believe we will look back and realize the real reason he was let go was because diva Damon Wayne's couldn't handle being in Claynes shadow.",/review/rw4160184/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2018,jerelc,10," Do. Not. Fire. Crawford!!!!!!!!!
","It will be the end of this show. Clayne Crawford is a better, deeper Riggs than Mel Gibson ever was, and I LOVE those movies! But this Riggs is deeper and more nuanced. Maybe because there are more hours available to develop him. Firing Crawford will be the end of this show. They are apparently not replacing Crawford with someone else to play Riggs, so at least there is that. But it will be a different show. And not nearly as good. I'm sorry but Damon Wayans and his family is not enough to carry the show forward.",/review/rw4160184/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2018,brentstansfield,1," Sean Scott as a Replacement? What are they thinking?
","Yup, this one is done! How they think this series will survive without Clayne is crazy. And the American Pie guy is his replacement? What, is Wayans trying to turn this into a vaudeville show? I king of expected Wayons to leave the show first, he and his brothers are well known for leaving good shows. To fire Clayne when Wayans was probably going to quit eventually anyway was a bad move. I found his character annoying and very predictable. If they had fired him and left Clayne in place I think the show could have gone on, Wayans never wanted to do the show in the first place. So if I worked for the network I would put a fork in this one before the next season, it's done! I used to give the show a 8.5 star rating, if they actually do this, I will tune into the first show and if I don't see Clayne, I will turn it off with a new rating of 0.",/review/rw4160184/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2018,hntemple-54433,10," Clayne was the 10 stars.......without him, I would rate it a 1 star.
","Clayne Crawford MADE this show. Not only as the actor playing Riggs, but also because he was a driving mind behind a lot of the scenes. He's an artist dedicated to his profession and the art of filmmaking. Without him, scenes are going to be sub-par & half assed because Damon Wayans is lazy and entitled. Zero respect for the producers of Lethal Weapon and FOX network for the shady and crappy way they treated Clayne while pampering Damon. ",/review/rw4160184/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2018,darinkellett,10," Crawford's exit would be Lethal
","The news of Fox's firing of Clayne Crawford, if true, would end one of the most entertaining shows on television. The on screen chemistry between Crawford and Wayans is incredible. The two actors are irreplaceable in their roles. Crawford excels at capturing Riggs, improving on Mel Gibson's portrayal of the mega flawed character.",/review/rw4160184/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2016,jdoneagain,10," Don't believe the naysayers
","No spoilers - but the TV show played like a big Hollywood production. When I discovered McG was directing and producing the show (at the opening credits), my expectations went up considerably. ",/review/rw4160184/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2018,dmbjprose,10," I won't watch this show without Clayne Crawford!
",I loved this show from the start but If Clayne Crawford is out...so am I. There's no show without him.,/review/rw4160184/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2018,dwpatter53,5," Quality of Murtaugh character declining
","The Damon Wayans/Roger Murtaugh character is becoming more and more an idiotic nut case.
Painful and embarrassing to watch.",/review/rw4160184/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2018,jfchester,10," Without Crawford, I am out
","Just cancel the show if you take out Clayne Crawford.
The magic between him and Damon Wayans can't be replaced, and certainly not with Stifler. Don't get me wrong, I like Seann William Scott, but you can't change one for another.
Crawford did a great job to build on Mel Gibson character, bringing him in the 2000s.",/review/rw4160184/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2018,mafaralda,9," So it´s the end of a great show...
","I have watched and loved this show for two seasons...but...now they have fired Clayne Crawford so I will not watch it anymore. The show is the two of them and nothing else, Damon Wyans must really be blind or stupid if he does not understand that...this Sean William Scott cannot compare to CC and I have absolutely no wish to watch this becoming ""BLAND WEAPON"" instead of Lethal Weapon...because that is what it will become...bland without Clayne. So I´m saying ""goodbye and thanks for all the fish"".....",/review/rw4160184/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2018,dforce10,9," Was a great show
","Lethal Weapon was one of my favourite shows but now that Clayne Crawford has been forced out I won't be watching anymore. Try taking Mel Gibson out of the original Lethal Weapon movies and replacing him with Steve Martin, those movies would have sucked just like the 3rd season with Stifler is going to suck. I bet they're going ro keep what happened to Riggs open ended so that they can beg Clayne Crawford to come back when the show fails",/review/rw4160184/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2018,moonlightbridge,," NO CLAYNE NO LETHAL WEAPON! YOU FIRED A GREAT AMERICAN ACTOR!
",Clayne Crawford is one of the best american actors & he is the reason why I watched the show. He did an amazing job!! Since you fired Clayne I WON'T watch the show anymore! Many lies were told about Clayne but you have his interview where he opened up about EVERYTHING! Search on youtube for his interview.,/review/rw4160184/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2018,AdrienneGrayceMusic,1," Was a 10 star til they dropped Clayne as Riggs
","I am so furious at the Show for removing Clayne as Riggs. HE WAS THE SHOW. They fired him for no reason. The show was very good. Very entertaining, and the chemistry on screen between the two characters was amazing. Now they dropped him and added Sean Williams Scott [Aka: Stiffler] to the show in his place. Now i can no longer take this show seriously. You can't remove a main character and expect a show to go on. Had to give a 1 star for season 3. It was a 10 while Riggs was still on. Now the show stinks..",/review/rw4160184/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2018,HeatherRobinson_25,10," Do not fire the reason I look forward every week
","This show will not work with out Wayans and Crawford 's on screen chemistry. I will sorely be disappointed if they don't both return for a Season 3. This show has been an amazing fresh story line from an over saturated good guy vs bad guy line up. I won't be interested in watching if Crawford doesn't return, he makes the whole show.",/review/rw4160184/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2018,paulsarah-14069,1," Dead in the water
",I used to love this show so much but how can you have a lethal weapon without Riggs. Clayne was excellent and made the show what it was. Having read his take on things I feel sorry for how he was treated. The show won't be a success without him and it will lose viewers. Fox need to change the title of the show as it's injustice to the films. I wonder what Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are thinking.,/review/rw4160184/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2018,epenn428,8," If Clayne goes, so do I!
",Season 1 was amazing! I watched every episode & then bought the bluray & watched it until season 2 began. Season 2 started & seemed to be on a downhill slide to the end.,/review/rw4160184/?ref_=tt_urv
