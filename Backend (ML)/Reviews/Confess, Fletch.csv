4 April 2016,hewilson2-72-796868,10," Well Done on Every Level
","It would be difficult to review 11.22.63 without spoiling it at every turn, so I won't. Instead, let me just say then that it has an excellent pedigree - a Stephen King novel - is well written and well acted. I'm a crusty oldish (emphasis on ish) curmudgeon and an amateur writer myself who thinks he has seen everything and is beyond every surprise and every tear jerk. Well, I was wrong. Once my teenage son suggested it to me, this series grabbed me by the throat, first minute, and never let go. Every cliché applies including ""riveting"" and ""edge of seat."" The bottom line though is that it is interesting, exciting and engrossing. Watch it. Now.",/review/rw3434431/?ref_=tt_urv

18 February 2016,modironak,9," Super Interesting and Must Watch !!
",It has been a long time I have seen James Franco look so promising in a role. Last time when I saw him so good was in 127 Hours. He has done complete justice to the character in the premiere of this show and seems to be in his comfort zone. ,/review/rw3434431/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2022,ocool180,8," Great story
",Damn good miniseries. The story is very intriguing had you hooked on the first episode. The worst thing about it is James Franco. Not the character just the actor but he did a pretty good job. Just not a fan of him. I liked the book but the mini series was great. It give me a different outlook on the book. If you're looking for a good storyline interesting characters this is the miniseries you would like to watch.,/review/rw3434431/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2020,lakeshore-98711,9," Unforgettable
","Its hard to do a movie or series about time travel and alternate realities so that we dont say thats silly or not possible and turn it off. Stephen like all of us plays what ifs In his mind and has translated it to book and tv series to perfection. The Kennedy assassination was a world wide event that every person knew about and as a young teenager it blasted my mind and what i was doing when i heard about it is the clearest memory i have to this day. ,Stephen has written this book to give us a fabulous what if. james Franco is terrific and everyone else is also totally invested in their parts. Its a great mini series that kept me involved start to finish. A great binge watch.",/review/rw3434431/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2016,redwingsm,10," All I can say is WOW.
","Stephen King is one of my favorite authors, however his movies and TV stints have left a lot to be desired with a few exceptions (Shawshank, Green Mile). I have to say, this is his best work yet, and it's not even a movie. I get to enjoy this for a while to come and am very excited to do so.",/review/rw3434431/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2016,Pickwick12,10," True to the Book, Very Promising
","James Franco exercises his full acting range in this adaptation of Stephen King's taut, time-travel thriller. Early on, it's very true to the plot, style, and tone of King's book, so fans of the novel should be pleased if it continues in the same way. At the same time, those unfamiliar with the book are thrown into an engaging world with its own quirks and rules. Franco navigates moments of surprising pathos and surprising humor with ease, pulling the viewer into Epping's experiences and showing us his thoughts and feelings, even when dialogue is sparse.",/review/rw3434431/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2021,spideryaman,10," Insanely good!
","Not a King fan to be honest, I have given his books multiple chances but I guess his style wasn't my cup of tea. IT, the movie, was bad, and The Dead Zone was a great show but unfortunately was stopped long years ago. Finally, I can say that a book was done right on the screen and became successful.",/review/rw3434431/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2016,jesperjensen-11365,9," It really made me think, what if........
","Jake Epping, a high school teacher, travels back in time by a time portal, revealed to him from his friend, Cafe owner Al Templeton, the portal are in the cafe backroom closet, and makes it possible to time travel, but only from the present day and back to the 1960s — specifically, October 21st. Dying of cancer, Al asks Jake to travel back to the 1960s and prevent the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Time travel stories can be a tricky thing, but 11.22.63 sets up the rules clearly and immediately. By the end of the opening episode, viewers should be fairly well acquainted with what Jake needs to do, why Al can't do it anymore, and the steps needed to get there. It all sounds completely ridiculous (""go back in time and stop the assassination of JFK!""), but 11.22.63 finds the right balance in Jake between disbelief and an earnest desire to try it anyway. The time travel isn't the mystery — not yet. Instead, the show pivots immediately into a glossy 1960s thriller, peppered with some of King's trademark horror.",/review/rw3434431/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2016,ejanereed,7," Wasn't what it started out to be
",Started out with an excellent premise and was set up to be a truly exceptional piece of Television....sets looked great ...acting pretty good...script was alright...but that storyline of what would happen if Kennedy had lived?...now that was a powerful story to be told. For the first few episodes it seemed that was the way it was going...then It changed into a love story and the Kennedy narrative became a side issue....don't get me wrong it still hurtled along at a right old pace and was still very watchable but the main premise was lost...no more so that after Jakes mission was completed and he returned to the present to find a wasteland of some kind of post apocalyptic wilderness...of which we spent 5 minutes learning or not as the case may be of what went so wrong...surely that was worth an episode in it's own right?....the immediate after affect of the shooting too was hurried and not well thought through with the phone call from JFK being a bit too easy and contrived considering there were so many questions left unanswered etc Overall ...a very watchable piece of TV...the ending was lovely...but not what I had expected from how it all started...and that's my only beef with it...I wanted to see a world where Kennedy had lived...and didn't,/review/rw3434431/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2017,zkonedog,6," Great Concept Held Back By One Key Casting Decision
","The novel 11/22/63 was one of the greatest books I have ever read, from my favorite author of all-time. Suffice it to say that this miniseries had a lot to live up to for me. While I generally enjoyed the series, it was severely hampered by one key mistake from the get-go: casting James Franco as the main lead.",/review/rw3434431/?ref_=tt_urv

26 December 2021,ten-thousand-marbles,6," More romantic drama than sci-fi thriller
","I expected a little more with Stephen King and JJ Abrams being involved, but this adaptation just didn't wow me. It's a decent story and is fairly watchable, but I anticipated things to have a little more punch. The story lags in spots and gets a little too wrapped up in the personal drama of the characters. Had it delivered more on the sci-fi/time travel and political thriller themes, it would have had the muscle needed to make it a great production.",/review/rw3434431/?ref_=tt_urv

1 December 2019,Derache,7," A good concept, but rushed.
","I liked this show, I have yet to read the book, but the concept here was very good. However the whole concept seemed almost pointless as jake only resets once and does not fail in saving the president. Some scenes in the series seemed rather stretched out and didn't flow properly in the film, however the film itself wasn't bad nor amazing. Despite this being an original film, it somehow just felt like it was a copy of other films, and the ending was were the cliches manifested the most. It was a decent film, not amazing though.",/review/rw3434431/?ref_=tt_urv

16 February 2016,zacharyogoode,9," When Franco Shaves His Goatee, the Show Finds its Flow.
","I am a fan of the book 11.22.63, and I was pretty excited to hear about an adaptation being made into a mini-series. My excitement only continued to grow when I learned that JJ Abrams and James Franco were attached. That being said, when I sat down to watch it, I had some high hopes going in. At first, my hopes were kind of dwindled. Upon starting the show, I thought that maybe Franco was not the best choice to play Jake Epping. As I continued watching, I noticed that it wasn't Franco, but rather that the show itself felt rushed during the beginning. However, to my viewing pleasure, once Franco totally commits to going back to the 60s (and he shaves that ridiculous goatee) the show really starts to come together. I guess the writers were just not as focused on the beginning of the show because it is such a good turnaround when he gets into the 60s (the beginning is not awful, just not great like the latter half). Also, the show does not follow the book 100% which is fine by me. I like when shows/movies try to create there own ideas, but still stay true to the basics of the book. Without spoiling the show for anyone, I believe 11.22.63 is going to be a great show when it is all said and done. Besides the beginning, Franco does a fantastic job as Epping as he showcases his dramatic (with comedy thrown in) work by dealing with the emotions of a present day guy traveling back to the 60s. Franco was the right choice for Epping! Overall, the show kept me thoroughly entertained for an hour and twenty minutes. So, if you can sit through about 10 minutes of a rushed plot, then I would definitely recommend giving this show a shot. King, Abrams, and Franco... How could it go wrong?!",/review/rw3434431/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2016,JohnLamberio,9," Superb show, intriguing and beguiling with massive potential.
","I've rarely left reviews for TV shows, but this has me hooked with it's premise. The ability to change history, for the better. But each time you go back, history resets itself to the original timeline. And regardless of how long you stay in the past, when you come back...only 2 minutes will have passed in the present! Saving John F. Kennedy is the primary motive for ""Mr Amberson"" (Played impeccably by Franco). Yet will it result in a better world should he succeed? Massive questions and plenty of unpredictability. Franco is beset by a number of moral dilemma's, trying to make sense of doing a bad acts which will benefit the greater good. But the moment he comes close to changing the future, time itself pushes back in emphatic fashion.",/review/rw3434431/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2016,Serva,1," Poorly done and not faithful to the source material
","I've read the book and while it's not the best ever, I liked it. It's an interesting premise although as it turns out the premise of trying to prevent JFK's murder is more of a mcguffin than what the book is actually about. The book sets up Jake's character perfectly by starting off right when his wife has left him and his mood right there and then (he feels bad about it but doesn't cry). This is a perfect introduction to his character, and it's sad how it's handled in the series. He just haphazardly signs the divorce documents and that's it. And they are already at Al's diner where in the book it takes a long time for him to get there. I feel this difference represents well what has gone wrong in the adaptation from the book to the TV mini series. It's very rushed and completely omits many important details when dealing with characters, scenes and places. And it does this over and over again.",/review/rw3434431/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2016,abraxis0,4," Mystery sci-fi thriller..uhh NO
",More like mystery romantic drama. The show has so far proved to be 80% romantic subplots 15% character exposition and 5% actual story. In fact the plot about a teacher travelling back in time to stop Lee Harvey Oswald from killing JFK is just a skeleton on which they hang the romantic subplots and has very little to actually do with any of the substance of the show. So if What attracted you to the show is that premise and it is a really interesting one this show will make for very tedious watching because that is just there to touch on here and there but it is not the main focus of the show. The focus of the show is the romance between the teacher and the lady. With each passing episode I find myself giving less and less of a crap.,/review/rw3434431/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2016,constanza-nm,4," A series of unfortunate events by James Franco frown facial expression.
","We were looking for series to watch and my boyfriend found this one. It had very good reviews so we went with it. I wasn't completely convinced because I'm not a huge fan of science fiction stories, however, I was willing to give it a try. I just want to say right away that I DIND'T READ THE BOOK, I've realized that most comments are from people that have read it, I guess for those people watching this television show is far more exciting, for me it was just another series and my point of view is from the perspective of a viewer, nothing more. And I have to say I was disappointed. By the third episode I was over the whole thing. It's supposed to be a story about time travel, well let me tell you, there is not too much about that, instead there are a series of unfortunate events surrounding the lead character, who by the way make horrible decisions, including a romance that doesn't really made that much sense. I don't know, it just doesn't work for me, I can take a slow pace production, but I didn't really care if he manages to fulfill his goal or not, the truth is that I don't care about James Franco portrayal of Jake, you don't feel sympathy towards him, honestly, he makes the same facial expression during the whole season. There are other ways to express feelings Franco, get rid of the frown face. Besides some secondary characters (specially Bill, I loved that guy) there is not so much to acknowledge. (By the way, Jake manages to screwed up the life of everyone around him) It even has one of the worst and more cliché dialogues I've ever seen ""You save my life"" ""No, you save my life"" WHAT! You're an English teacher/time travel and that's the best you can come out with? I would not recommend it, I was so mad with it that I didn't finish it and just read what happened in the final episodes online.",/review/rw3434431/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2018,wildblueyonder,7," I liked it, don't regret it... can't help feeling it coulda been a lot better.

19 March 2016,Smeagolisashe,6," Missing The Best Part of a Great Story
",Stephen King is such an amazing writer but I have yet to watch a production that he is involved in that isn't extremely disappointing. It's almost as if he can't see what makes his stories so wonderful. One of the best parts of this story was the character having to go back to the future to reset. I understand this couldn't occur nearly as much as it did in the book but Jake never resets. In my opinion resetting was a crucial part of the story. Also so little attention was paid to the details. They had great sets but almost every single car was perfectly restored. ,/review/rw3434431/?ref_=tt_urv
