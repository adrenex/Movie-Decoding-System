28 March 2020,Top_Dawg_Critic,8," Anxiety level start to finish: ðŸ’¯
","I'm really shocked the critics slammed this film, and at its low IMDb rating. My blood pressure and anxiety levels were red-zone from start 00:01 to 95:00 ending.",/review/rw5418466/?ref_=tt_urv

","As a fan of William Eubank's 2014 film ""The Signal"" I was pretty excited for this. The Signal offered a lot of thrills and suspense and a twist ending that leaves you gobsmacked.",/review/rw5418466/?ref_=tt_urv

","Right, well as I sat down to watch the 2020 movie ""Underwater"" from writers Brian Duffield and Adam Cozad, I must admit that I didn't really have much of any expectations for the movie.",/review/rw5418466/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2020,Bertaut,7," A well-made creature-feature; it may not be original, but it is entertaining
","The last film distributed by 20th Century Fox before they were rebranded as 20th Century Studios by Disney, Underwater was shot in early 2017 for $50 million and then sat on a shelf for over two years. Now that it's finally seeing the light of day, there's a real sense of Disney just wanting to be rid of Fox's clutter, and they either didn't know how to promote it or didn't want to promote it, as the marketing campaign has been next to invisible (and the bland title certainly doesn't help), with the film grossing a paltry $7 million in its opening weekend. From Disney's perspective, of course, releasing it in the January release window makes sense, as it's a period traditionally dominated by duds and cast-offs - films the studios don't care about for one reason or another. A recent high-profile example is ",/review/rw5418466/?ref_=tt_urv

26 September 2020,justin-fencsak,6," It's the Abyss meets Alien
",Kristen Stewart plays the heroine in this moderate budgeted film that takes place underwater during a massive weird earthquake that is devouring the world she and her friends live in. It's not as scary as is it given its family friendly PG-13 rating but its a decent rental.,/review/rw5418466/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2020,zkonedog,3," Great Idea But No Execution Of It
","Deep sea explorations are something that have always fascinated me. We've gone to the moon and beyond, yet there are places deep below the ocean floor that have yet to be discovered, harboring any number of creatures not seen by human eyes. ""Underwater"" tries to play off that premise, but fails to execute it successfully in any really meaningful way.",/review/rw5418466/?ref_=tt_urv

10 January 2020,subxerogravity,7," I'm impressed by how much I liked it.
","I went into the theater thinking nothing of it and came out thinking it's good.
It's a strange type of mediocre. The film hits just the right marks but it does not get you excited just sparked enough to enjoy it.
Underwater moves too fast to be boring, which is good for this suspenseful film, but it also moves too fast to truly take notice of the cast of characters.
Some highlights of the cast are. Vincent Cassell, who was amazing as the station's captain. Makes we wish there was a new Star Trek or other science fiction series that needed a captain cause he would kill.
Another Highlight is TJ Miller. I'm surprise his name got on the poster cause I herd he was one of those guys in Hollywood that got canceled. The thing is, he is a supporting actor used for comedy relief and on this horror-like film, he did his job to perfection as the type of character who points out when they are in a horror cliche right on cue.
I should mention Kristan Stewart but I was not really impressed with her starring role because the advantage of being the star did nothing to improve her acting. Sorry, I'm just not impressed with anything she's done.
This movie is the closet that's ever happen. I can never say I don't like a kristan Stewart film cause I found this movie very watchable.",/review/rw5418466/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2020,iamianiman,5," Underwater is a mixed attempt at finding new resources for our entertainment industry.
","Remember three years ago, there was a movie called Life acted by Ryan Reynolds, Jake Gyllenhaal & Rebecca Ferguson? Okay, but instead of venturing into space, let's dive into water. And that's what you get from this movie, just that this is worse from Life. Not that it is bad either.",/review/rw5418466/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2020,elliotjeory,2," It was just noise
","The film jumps in with no back story just crash bang wallop, noise noise noise shakey camera. It makes the Meg look like Jaws.",/review/rw5418466/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2020,rivertam26,9," Pleasant surprise
","What a pleasant surprise especially in January. Kristen Stewart stars as a young woman living seven miles beneath the surface on a drilling station that ends up unearthing some terrifying creatures. The movie starts off with a bang as the station she's in begins to implode. Immediately it's a race against time as she hooks up with other survivors and the captain devises a plan that will have them walking across the dark ocean floor where they're not alone. With a rich, dark and sometimes intentionally muddled cinematography you are introduced to a spacious, endless world filled with floating debris that feels both wide and frighteningly claustrophobic. Funny guy TJ Miller, the awesome Vincent Cassel and cutie John Gallagher Jr. fill out some of the other supporting roles. Theres not a lot of setup but director William Eubank of the Signal establishes an intense, edge of your seat atmosphere accompanied by stylish cinematography and a mounting sense of dread. The movie is fun and is filled with homages to Alien and lovecraft all the while creating something new of it's own. The culmination of events left me wanting just a tiny bit more but I loved the retro feel as well as throwing itself so wholeheartedly into being an aquatic horror enormous sized creature feature. Although the story and characters aren't developed as well as you would hope the situational genre entry is anchored by a strong bad ass and against type lead performance from Kristen Stewart. This is one I'll definitely be seeing again in theaters.",/review/rw5418466/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2020,Otte1,3," Tries to be a little of everything and fails
","This was bad, really really bad. Movies steals, er borrows heavily from Aliens, The Descent, The Meg and never stays on point long enough to follow.",/review/rw5418466/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2020,robfollower,8," ""UNDERWATER"" RISES ABOVE EXPECTATIONS
","Underwater is a location-based thriller that's beyond easy to lose yourself within. Kristen Stewart enthusiastically fights against sea monsters of an extraterrestrial brand, while also combating natural dangers that come along with humans invading where they should not.",/review/rw5418466/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2020,kaefab,5," No developpement what so ever or explanation
","The movie starts with a bang, not even 5 minutes into it the disaster starts the whole station is flooded, we get bits and piece of survivors here and there, they all meet in a lab room and decide the next step for survival.",/review/rw5418466/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2020,Leofwine_draca,6," Average execution
","UNDERWATER is the latest ALIEN rip-off and another ""underwater base"" flick in the spirit of THE ABYSS and LEVIATHAN. Sadly, it's a distinctly average movie let down by a ton of murky underwater photography which is almost as boring as the lengthy undersea scenes in THUNDERBALL. You can't make out what's going on in these scenes apart from an overload of CGI and they're really disappointing. The rest is a predictable story with the usual disaster staples and sudden deaths, although it gets more interesting towards the climax. I'm a huge Lovecraft fan so I loved the main creature in this, although the human-size ones are too obviously ALIEN derived. Kristen Stewart is a poor choice for lead but Jessica Henwick and Vincent Cassel are better. UNDERWATER's okay, but you'd be better off sticking with LEVIATHAN for a more-fun movie.",/review/rw5418466/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2020,intrepidami,5," If the movie has Zero character development...
","....horrendous acting, no explanation for what happens, lacks a great deal of real scares, and is constantly shot in dark to save money, you can expect about 20 shill regular reviewers to tell you it was one of the best movies they ever saw, or the very over used ""better than expected"" in their reviews. The check from Fox/Disney is in the mail!",/review/rw5418466/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2022,solid-rock800,6," Decent bit of scary fun
","Sure, this movie isn't exactly a masterpiece, but I wasn't really expecting one other. It's a bit of scary fluff that's more or less in line with what you expect, based on the movies concept/trailer.",/review/rw5418466/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2020,trashymcjunkbox-1,6," Well crafted B-movie fun
","It may be damning with faint praise, but it's better than I thought it would be. If you love sci-fi/fantasy/action genre films and don't go in expecting a masterpiece, you could have a good time. What it lacks in originality it makes up for in craft. It looks great, has fine actors doing good work, and nice production design. Kristen Stewart shows she has the chops to carry a movie, even without a stellar story, and it delivers enough good action and tension to make up for its shortcomings.",/review/rw5418466/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2020,mageh,3," Barely enjoyable cliche
","It is a travesty to compare masterpiece ""Alien"" to this mediocre film. As many reviewers stated: bad acting, bad script, no originality, even the effects are boring, it was too dark to see anything. The monsters are not even scary. At certain point i was rooting for the creature to eat all of them just to be done with this stupidity (don't even get me started on the science part).
