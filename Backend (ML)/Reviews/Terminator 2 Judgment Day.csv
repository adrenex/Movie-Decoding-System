22 January 2021,redx1708,7," Not bad, but.........
","The main problem with IMDB ratings is that people often throws 10 at shows just because they like them. So yes, I enjoyed Gotham, but rating it 10 is just as absurd as some people rating it 1. I think that the most accurate way of rating shows is not going from 10 and down, but to start at 5 which should be considered average.
Now Gotham is clearly above average, but it's not without flaws. Most of the acting is good, in a few cases even very good, but in other cases really bad. And then there's the question about how the show holds up quality over 100+ episodes. As we all know most series show a decline in quality the longer they run, and Gotham is no exception. 1st season was very good and the 2nd and 3rd were pretty much ok too, but already in 2nd season there were signs of the writers having trouble coming up with fresh ideas, and that trend became more and more obvious as the show went on. Again, this is a show worth watching, but I think 7 is a fair overall rating.",/review/rw4026432/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2022,Supermanfan-13,8," Definitely Worth Watching!
","I though Gotham did a great job at building the world of Batman as he grew up and before he actually became Batman. Jim Gordon (Ben McKenzie), Harvey Bullock (Donal Logue) and the villains were all the real stars of this show. The only weak link is the actor who played Bruce Wayne (David Mazouz). He just doesn't come off as someone who can play a tough guy or beat people up, quite the opposite actually. All his fight scenes were so unbelievable and actually made me laugh. But overall the show is very good and worth watching!",/review/rw4026432/?ref_=tt_urv

23 January 2018,highmarksreviews,8," Origins Told Right
","Gotham has long been the TV show many like to pick at, its first season, while compelling was mostly a mundane origin tale. Happy to report that since that time, the show has evolved into something really special. Lavish, atmospheric set pieces, great performances and a constant drift from episodic story arcs are just a few qualities to love about this show. Moreover it does justice to many comic book characters that everyone knows. While it does face some tonal inconsistency and gets the villain-of-the-week treatment on occasion, at least it builds its characters and does proper justice to them.",/review/rw4026432/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2014,fung0,9," Dark, gritty and intelligent - a brilliant start
","After just two episodes, this show seems to be drawing a lot of negative reviews. However, most of these come from comic-book uber-fans, resentful that there are no capes and masks in the show. Of course, that's exactly the point - this show is about the mythic Gotham *before* it exploded with 'super' heroes and 'super' villains. It uses the dark, surreal *style* of the Batman comics to ask some fascinating questions about morality and the relevance of 'extreme' characters in the real world.",/review/rw4026432/?ref_=tt_urv

30 March 2017,OllieSuave-007,7," Good introduction to the Batman characters, but a little overkill.

6 May 2015,kieranbattams,8," Complete Series 1 Review
","A show set in the Batman universe.. except without Batman? A lot of people didn't like this concept but i was one of the people who did. I wanted to see the villains' rise to power most of all.. but how would they be interesting with no Batman to counter them? Well that's where the early years of Jim Gordon come into play. The show follows Jim as he cracks strange cases whilst trying to help a young Bruce Wayne solve the mystery of his parents' murder. It seemed each week for a while we would see a new villain come in and act like they run Gotham City before Jim and Harvey Bullock shut them down, but it turned into more than that.",/review/rw4026432/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2015,cherold,7," Great at its best, but it's often not at its best
",I've been very frustrated by Gotham. The premise is solid. The characters are interesting. The actors are generally excellent. The atmosphere is wonderfully seedy. The overall story arc of corruption is quite good.,/review/rw4026432/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2021,classicsoncall,10," ""Yet in the darkness, there will be light."" - Alfred Pennyworth - Episode #5.12
","This is an exceptionally well done series spanning five seasons and a hundred episodes, and I wasn't bored watching a single one. It delves into the teenage life of Bruce Wayne (David Mazouz) and traces how the future Batman came to develop his thinking about crime and dealing with the criminals who made Gotham their base of operations. Most every character from the comic books is represented in the series, including all the major villains I can recall from my youth, along with a few I can't, like Magpie. Casting for the series was for the most part exceptional, you couldn't have asked for a better Oswald Cobblepot/Penguin than Robin Lord Taylor, or a more evilly inspired madman than Cameron Monaghan as the Valeska Brothers, each a different version of The Joker. Interestingly, The Joker was never mentioned by name in the story line, you would have to identify him on your own as a Batman fan. The only villain I thought was misrepresented was Bane, who I've always felt would have been perfect for a guy like pro wrestler Van Vader, or the hulking bruiser who went after Selina Kyle (Camren Bicondova) in the fifth season. He wasn't nearly as deadly here as the character from the comics who broke Batman's back to put him out of commission for a while. As for the principal characters, Ben McKenzie was effective as Jim Gordon, though I expected a grittier portrayal, and David Mazouz did a fine job as Bruce Wayne. I question whether the young Bruce Wayne should have accepted blame for so many of the bad things that happened to other characters and the city of Gotham itself because so many were out of his control, so that was a minor nitpick for this viewer. The final season did get to be a little more cartoonish than all that went before, but the series still wound up in fine fashion with a final glimpse of the new avenger of Gotham, returning to his city after an exile of ten years. I usually don't have the patience to pursue such a long running series, but in this case I'm glad I stuck with it. ""Gotham"" comes pretty close to giving the Dark Knight trilogy a run for it's money.",/review/rw4026432/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2015,karim_arabu,9," Better than season 1 give it a chance
","I must say, if you have an...average opinion of season 1, I don't blame you. The show was decent, good at times but it lacked continuity and it had way too many ""Villain of the week"" scenarios and all the side story lines were seen as irrelevant mostly.",/review/rw4026432/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2020,Tweekums,9," An impressive story showing the origins of many 'Batman' characters
","This series is set in Gotham City many years before Bruce Wayne became Batman. As it starts Bruce is a boy living with his billionaire parents; his life is soon changed when they are both murdered in front of him. Idealistic young policeman James Gordon is determined to solve the case; most of the other officers in the Gotham City Police Department, including his partner are corrupt. As Gordon goes after the criminals and gradually tries to clean up the department the criminals are also changing. As the show starts the criminals are regular gangsters but a new breed starts rise; characters destined to become the familiar supervillains who will be Batman's various Nemeses.",/review/rw4026432/?ref_=tt_urv

3 November 2017,uuallyhannosh,10," Most underrated show on TV
","I give this show a 9.2. It started out slow and i admit the first few seasons they were trying to find their flow and failed a few times, but this show has picked up its weight and gained the muscle to do it. It is now fleshed out with 70 percent of Gotham's excitement. It really truly is a remarkable show, the writers do a wonderful job building the city of Gotham to the dark knights world we know and love. Might I add maybe even the best performance of story building on any DC TV show. I would recommend this show to anyone who has a slight interest in batman, comics, or any super hero. Also, young Bruce Wayne is a great young bat. I believe he will actually grow up to look so much like the embodiment of batman, that they will have no choice but to make him the next great batman. They have built him so well.The cast is phenomenal, penguin is a character of a lifetime, Jerome aka joker(expect much more of him in the future) is the best joker I've ever seen. Jim Gordon was boring to me before this show, this show actually made me relate to Jim in so many ways i never did before. I love this show and I hope it stays on forever. God bless you Fox for this show. Truly phenomenal it makes me HAPPY! ",/review/rw4026432/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2015,theslayer2112,9," Simply put, brilliance on TV!!
","Of late, I have realized that TV content is getting developed much better than movies and I find myself binge-watching many recent TV series than movies. This is happening all the more because of the gripping and taut story lines (TV shows, given their length, used to ramble on about the plot, but thankfully no more) and brilliant overall delivery.

25 July 2021,Shellser17,8," Not really for Batman Fans
","As the title says it isn't necessarily for Batman fans, this show is mainly about detective Gordon and his investigations. I would sum this up as more of a show like CSI with a Gotham theme. It's dark gritty and grotesque. You see the true nature of Gotham and how dark the city actually is and why Batman in the future fights to keep it safe. Very interesting show, but if you're looking for that signature high flying Batman style action, it likely isn't for you.",/review/rw4026432/?ref_=tt_urv

Loved ALL the characters & the actors/actresses, except for Barbara as well, Erin Richards..also didn't play her part very well, very cringe, and also Cat, Camren Bicondova, very narcissistic & selfish, there was several times where I wanted to stop the show because of her & Barbara but I hung in there...",/review/rw4026432/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2018,alex_grant-41857,10," Gotham hits all the right notes
",Gotham is a unique and wonderful insight into the famous city before the birth of DC's most beloved hero. The show mixes comic book content with their own twists. On top of that they have one of the most talented casts on tv. To name but a few Ben McKenzie is an excellent lead as the young Jim Gordon. David Mazouz is a young man with extreme talent and handles every storyline that comes his way as Bruce Wayne grows up. Sean Pertwee is an ass kicking and witty version of Alfred to rival all those who have gone before. Whilst Robin Lord Taylor and Cory Michael Smith are nothing short of extraordinary in their portrayal's of the infamous Penguin and Riddler. Highly recommend it to any DC and in particular Batman fans. I love it and long may it continue!,/review/rw4026432/?ref_=tt_urv
