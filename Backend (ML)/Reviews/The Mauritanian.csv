1 March 2021,Instant_Palmer,7," Good Action Flick - Tense & Well-Paced
","Granted, the inside bank heist plot is implausible in 'Bastille Day' (retitled 'The Take' for its USA release), but the director James Watson paces the film so well with non-stop tense moments, and taps Idris Elba's innate tension-building talents and ability to deliver quick dialogue (as he does with Sorkin's trademark banter in 'Molly's Game'), that one overlooks the spectacularly unrealistic story of the intended heist.",/review/rw7800058/?ref_=tt_urv

20 February 2017,kosmasp,7," Don't mess with the Elba
","And no I'm not talking about a river. The charisma and screen presence Idris Elba projects is amazing. He can throw shades, have a stare-down and just generally make you do things without saying much. If someone like this is on the hunt to get you ... well you better run fast. But this is not just a chase movie. This has unfortunately some roots in reality with its terrorist attack theme.",/review/rw7800058/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2016,3xHCCH,8," Imposing and Exciting Idris Elba
","Idris Elba has been in big Marvel films like ""Thor"" and ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"", but I don't really know how he looked like without the Heimdall costume. He had a performance last year in the film ""Beasts of No Nation"" which triggered controversy when he was not nominated for an Oscar, but this was not shown locally. Just this year, he had been in two films, ""Zootopia"" and ""The Jungle Book."" However in both films, we only hear his deep imposing voice. With this film ""Bastille Day,"" we finally see Idris Elba as a modern day action hero, not far from the news that he is being touted to be the next James Bond. ",/review/rw7800058/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2016,fxdx4,7," A solid action thriller with no real political baggage! Enjoy
","This film (unfortunately) is most famous because it was set to come out at the same time as a Islamic terrorist attack in France, and one of the reasons I waited a while to watch this film was because I was wary of how Muslims would be portrayed in it etc. Let me without spoilers tell you this film is almost entirely unpolitical, with the 'Islamic threat' so far down the radar it can't even be said to be a theme.",/review/rw7800058/?ref_=tt_urv

","You have to forget that, during the making of this action film shot in Paris, the French capital was the scene of a brutal terrorist attack. Instead you have to go with the flow - and, boy, does it flow with constant flights and fights and a frenetically-cut chase sequence on rooftops that could have come straight out of a Bourne movie.

","Michael Mason (Richard Madden) is an American living in Paris living off his ability to pick pockets. The film catches our attention with a nude woman (Stéphane Caillard) walking through a crowd as a distraction.

His fugitive days don't last long as he is apprehended by CIA agent Briar (Idris Elba) who operates ""way off the reservation."" Is is attempting to find a girl and a bomber.

",The film is quite good. I just randomly picked it up to watch and it was a good watch. Not a single boring moment. Very good paced. Actors were good and believable.

1 July 2017,richard-1787,3," Just action/adventure
","There isn't much of anything to this movie, other than a lot of fast action, with the usual ""collateral damage."" Idris Elba is an actual actor, but he has no material to act with here. So, for that matter, is Thierry Godard, one of the leads in the French TV series Un Village français, but here he gets nothing at all.",/review/rw7800058/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2019,Kirpianuscus,," acceptable
","As not fan of action movies, my opinion is far to be more than subjective. ""Bastille Day"" is the work of good performances and interesting story , defind by twists and by the high expectations from Idris Elba, by memories about GoT for Richard Madden and by Paris as scene for action in pure form. Many familiar details. And acceptable propaganda for greatness of U.S.A. In rest, maybe, delight for fans of genre.",/review/rw7800058/?ref_=tt_urv

4 February 2017,cosmo_tiger,7," A movie that could have been generic but enough aspects just clicked and the movie became tense and exciting.
","""This is crazy. I don't work for the CIA."" Michael Mason (Madden) is an expert pick pocket that is working the streets of France. While sitting down counting his loot he notices a woman throw a large bag away. He walks to it and looks for cash. As he walks away the bag explodes and he is picked up as the only suspect for the bombing. Now Michael must work with the anti-terrorist force to try and figure out what happened and what will happen next. This is a very exciting, tense and entertaining movie. It keeps you guessing and really sets the tone right off with Michael being brought in. You are never really able to settle in and trust anyone. That detail adds something to the movie that is needed and helps you become more involved. Elba and Madden are great in their roles and their acting along with the little details it throws in really transforms this movie from just another ""let's stop terrorism"" movie into something that seems fresh. Overall, a movie that could have been generic but enough aspects just clicked and the movie became tense and exciting. I give this a high B.",/review/rw7800058/?ref_=tt_urv

","Interesting concept with the thief and stealing the wrong bag.But would've been a lot better, if it was all french. The movie is entertaining if you take it for what it is.

28 December 2016,Leofwine_draca,6," Watchable action thriller with a Parisian setting
","BASTILLE DAY is a solid action thriller made as a collaboration between Great Britain and France. I watched it under the ludicrous re-titling THE TAKE. Essentially this is a film in the style of intense French action cinema like MEA CULPA, with an added British cast doing American accents. The accent thing can be distracting in places but is far from horrendous as you'd expect. This is a short and snappy thriller with an interesting story enlivened by some great action sequences. My only real problem with it is that it doesn't have the drive and momentum it needs to make it a truly great film. The action bits are highlights and very well directed and edited, but outside of the action the story feels a little slower and more unfocused.",/review/rw7800058/?ref_=tt_urv
