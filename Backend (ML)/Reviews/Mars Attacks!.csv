12 August 2022,Idle_Hands08,5," The 90s are back... Sort of...
","It must now have been long enough that the 90s action films are considered ""classics"" as this is one of those good time movies that could have been released in 1996 alongside From Dusk Till Dawn... Although I just don't think the professional screen writers are currently hitting the mark... I mean we have the technology... Unsane was filmed on an iPhone 6 a few years back...!!! But it all comes down the story, great actors and directors can't really fix that...?!!",/review/rw8437278/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2022,tkdlifemagazine,6," James Foxx is Always Good
","Watchable but not great Jamie Foxx Action, vampire comedy. Foxx is always very watchable and good. Dave Franco and Snoop Dog make for a a great comedic element. The story of a down and out pool cleaner working the ""Day Shift"" to kill day walking vampires is ok. The action and fighting are laughable but fun to watch. This blends elements from ""From Dusk to Dawn"", and ""frightening Night"", as well as some buddy cop films. It passed the time, but not much more.",/review/rw8437278/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2022,namob-43673,4," A bit of fun, but mostly a trashy poor excuse of vampire movie with bad acting
","To no surprise to anyone this kinda suck. It is not unwatchable though so if you just want to have a few beers and relax with nonsense for a while, this is not the worst thing you can watch.",/review/rw8437278/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2022,elgrampo77,7," Honestly...
",...Snoop & Jamie in one movie AND killing vampires - what else do you need? Who cares about the plot or anything else.,/review/rw8437278/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2022,karinahatem,8," Way better than expected
","Well, this turned out to be a good entertaining action movie. Some will find it too bloody, which it is, but I kinda enjoyed it
I also liked the story. This was a well executed action movie, super packed with action from beg till end, story wise, they could have done a better job.",/review/rw8437278/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2022,star_hazard,7," Vampires. Blood. Mayhem. Cheesy.
",This is far from masterpiece especially with all the plotholes and disconnected information and cheesiness but overall I feel that it delivered on entertainment.,/review/rw8437278/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2022,nathanchasewomack,6," It's a fun film
","IMDB never ceases to entertain me with people ""critiquing"" movies as if they are seasoned students of film working for Roger Ebert reviewing Academy Award nominated films;/ aka 'serious films'. Lighten up. This movie checks all the Netflix cinematography boxes. All of their big budget films pay huge salaries up front to get a-list stars because they will not get a % of ticket sales. So, they have to cut $ from production & the end result is very bright color saturation, cheap sets & even cheaper cgi effects. The movie reminded me of a beloved 80's movie of mine, Return Of the Living Dead. It's equal comedy & camp as it is horror & gore. Jamie & Dave do what they do best. It's nowhere near award level stuff but it is highly entertaining if you like this kind of genre. It's not the type if movie you critique however. Jeez louise.",/review/rw8437278/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2022,zameerpro,6," Blood & Mayhem in a Lightweight Horror Comedy
","Dramatically, this is too bad, as first-time director J. J. Perry looks to have given this opportunity everything he's got action-wise. Perry long has been one of the busiest and most accomplished fight choreographers/stunt coordinators/second unit directors in the business; the Fast and Furious and John Wick series are merely among the most recent of his couple of decades of credits. On the basis of the evidence here, it's clear that Perry certainly knows how to shoot heavy-duty action. Unfortunately, there's precious little sense or coherence to the storytelling, so it remains to be seen what Perry could do with better constructed and more engaging material.",/review/rw8437278/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2022,lmahesa,6," Fantastic choreography... otherwise lacklustre.
","As per the title, the choreography was excellent - an easy 9/10. There was some impressive drone work as well, which is obvious if you're looking for it - detractors will be happy that there isn't very much. As for everything else...",/review/rw8437278/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2022,K_Rad88,6," probably would have been crap if no stars in it
",It's a fun movie with good effects and a lot of laughs - I watched it on a whim but usually I'm into more actual horror.,/review/rw8437278/?ref_=tt_urv

13 August 2022,Cr0wgrrl,8," Sometimes you just need a good, dumb, action-filled vampire hunting buddy cop movie
","This is that movie. It's not deep, and the dialogue's not Shakespeare, but the chemistry's good, the actors are having fun, some of the world-building is neat, and the fights are bloody nuts. You can tell the director used to be a stuntman because damn, some of the setups and choreography are impressive. Jamie Foxx and Dave Franco are having a lot of fun, and it shows.",/review/rw8437278/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2022,rtbradford,2," Utter Crapola
","I love vampire flicks and I like Jamie Fox, so I was looking forward to this movie. But unfortunately it's bad. REALLY bad. The dialogue is just so awful that it makes the movie difficult to watch. There's barely any acting; the plot is so thin it's not really a plot and the vampire lore is just pitiful and incidental to the very trite storyline. It's hard to enjoy it because it's just so stupid. I guess Netflix is so desperate for content that they'll green light any script at this point.",/review/rw8437278/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2022,joebloggscity,2," Training Day - Vampire comedy version - as bad as it sounds
",Short & not so sweet review. This simply 'sucks' but not in a good vampire way.,/review/rw8437278/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2022,LincolnSixEko,8," Fun to watch
","Look, Im not into vampire movies. At all. But I do like horror, action, and comedy. And I like Jamie Foxx. He's a good actor and has fun playing the character. Plus, we got Snoop in here too.",/review/rw8437278/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2022,yevhen114,7," good old-fashioned fun

13 August 2022,ashfordofficial,4," Amateur direction and script ruined it
",Cool visual and practical effects. The chemistry between Jamie Foxx and Dave Franco was fun watch. The vampire killing scenes were so fantastic and engaging to watch; thanks to the involvement of Chad Stahelski.,/review/rw8437278/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2022,PurpleCrayon2014,3," The Film Is Drowning In First-Timers
","The first time Director is really a Stunt Coordinator, the screenplay written by a first time in the industry author and another that keeps writing the same thing over and over and over..... What really killed this film, let ALL the air out of the balloon - Dave Franco. I grow so weary of these hacks that land gigs because they are related to someone who actually is talented or they know someone who knows someone who knows someone....... Jamie Foxx needed a quick payday and it's a travesty we don't have more of Snoop Dogg. Don't pay to watch this, as it would be more entertaining watching It's A Wonderful Life backwards.",/review/rw8437278/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2022,haines403,3," Lots of plot holes

19 August 2022,Paragon240,7," Day Shift is not without flaws but is a blast from start to finish with great action and fun characters.
","Did not expect to enjoy this as much as I did! Day Shift brings a fresh new vibe to the vampire hunter genre, with most of the movie taking place in the bright sunny suburbs of LA. The action and fight sequences near John Wick-level choreography (which is not surprising since Chad Stahelski is involved) and the world built by Day Shift is intriguing and worth further exploration in future films. Jamie Foxx and Dave Franco have fun buddy cop chemistry, and some of the other characters might not be well developed but are still entertaining. I would love to see more from this franchise.",/review/rw8437278/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2022,osaure,2," Amazing??
","It's amazing that in the IMDb reviews they only show the most positive reviews posting the most stars. When you dig a bit deeper you'll find that the true reviews, the ones that are buried, show it to be mediocre or down right bad. This movie is mediocre and clich√©. Uses a basic plot format, making it predictable, and tries to shock. Boring.",/review/rw8437278/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2022,jamesraymondwallace,8," JJ.perry from stunt man to first movie he ever made take a bow
",This film felt like John wick the raid dusk till dawn and blade all in one and one of the best movies Netflix has done took me back to the 80s and 90s action movies when directors took a chance and didn't take things so serious great action and cgi very enjoyable movie loved it nice to watch a movie with out any woke cxxp in it.,/review/rw8437278/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2022,arne-vst,4," Not good, not terrible. Just bad.
