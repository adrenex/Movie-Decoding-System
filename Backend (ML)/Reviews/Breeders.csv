19 November 2021,CinemaClown,," Visually Arresting But Narratively Hollow
","From the writer-director of Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy comes a stylishly crafted, smartly photographed & skilfully acted psychological horror that's swirling with nostalgia & affection for the Swinging Sixties. Last Night in Soho attempts to capture the dangers of romanticising the past while showcasing the dark side of show business only to throw it all away in the end.",/review/rw7771691/?ref_=tt_urv

3 November 2021,kevin_robbins,4," This is a frustrating film that had a lot going for it but felt like it didn't know where to go the last half of the movie
","Last Night in Soho (2021) is a movie my wife and I recently watched in theatres. The storyline follows a young lady raised by her grandmother in the country who heads off to fashion school in London. She struggles to adjust to the city and her classmates and decides to get a room of her own and away from people. She starts having visions and dreams once she moves about a young, naive woman like herself who tries to make it in London also and was badly taken advantage of. This movie is directed by Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead) and stars Thomasin McKenzie (Old), Anya Taylor-Joy (Queen's Gambit), Matt Smith (The Crown) and Terence Stamp (Superman). This movie had so much potential with a great premise and set-up, fantastic flashback sequences, a great cast and remarkable use of lighting, color and cinematography. The acting is also pretty good, though I'd say McKenzie's performance was a bit uneven, especially towards the end of the movie. This film after a good set-up falls apart and spins out of control to a messy and unorganized conclusion that gets painful to watch at times. The horror elements also don't align well with the premise and could have been executed so much better...I didn't love the use of CGI, especially when you discover the true plot and think back on where and when the horror elements took place. This is a frustrating film that had a lot going for it but felt like it didn't know where to go the last half of the movie. I'd score this a 3.5-4/10 and recommend skipping it.",/review/rw7771691/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2021,eddie_baggins,6," A beautifully shot film that can't reach the narrative goals it sets for itself
","His conquered the living dead with nothing more than unwanted vinyl records, alien invaders in small country towns and even managed to wrangle baby drivers but there's no doubt Last Night in Soho is beloved British director and critical darling Edgar Wright's most ambitious film yet and a film that doesn't always reach the lofty goals it sets for itself even if its a beautifully shot and unique thriller mixed with horror elements.",/review/rw7771691/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2021,aciessi,8," About Last Night..
","Last Night in Soho really had me hypnotized. I feel like that's a comment that will be said by a lot of people, but that's exactly the kind of effect this film has. Edgar Wright brings us a dreamy, groovy ghost story that heavily pays tribute to Suspiria, along with other film classics from the 60s and 70s. Being Britain's top film junkie, Edgar Wright can get a hold of a camera and make it seem like you're walking into a video store at full blast. His love of this specific genre of horror is just gushing here. His love of music is also as romantic as ever. Music plays just as important of a role here as it did in Baby Driver, even if the songs aren't full-on characters of their own. Mackenzie and Taylor-Joy carry this film fully on their shoulders, and by God, do they rock it. I've been incredibly impressed with Thomasin Mackenzie since Jojo Rabbit, and if this film doesn't rocket her career all the way to the top, nothing will. There's so much to love about this movie. It's a trace. No, it's a trip.",/review/rw7771691/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2021,kosmasp,9," Old school
","Edgar Wright seems to polarize with this movie. Although generally speaking the majority seem to love this as much as I did. Or in similar fashion - no pun intended. And for a genre movie it starts off ... well off (weird). You don't get a shocker, quite the opposite it starts off with a music number/dancing. Which makes sense when you think about it in hindsight and still sets a tone for the viewer - even if not one that is as menacing as the movie becomes later on.",/review/rw7771691/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2021,Neptune165,4," I wish this film worked for me
","One night is enough! This film is so over rated. The writing is so bad. The lead girl over acts from start to end. The bad CGI dead men who slept with Sandy look worse than the CGI zombies in I am Legend. I don't think horror when I see that. I just see the weak CGI. The guys who slept with sandy are not creepy at all. Their intent on getting laid is a bit creepy like sad pervs. But using them like some undead legions was zero on the creepy meter. The over used ""that's a beautifiul name"" was a weak line and they beat it to death. The Argento comparisons only go as far as some of the lighting. It comes nowhere near the golden era of his films from the 70's, 80s. Maybe anything from Trauma onward. You just knew that Diana Rigg wasn't just put in the film to be a quaint, old landlady. She's set up to be the last one you'd ever suspect. How do you see the ghost of a woman who is still alive?! The whole, you thought this character was the killer but wait no! It's actually this person. Obvious red herrings. You could se all of those coming up. I really wanted to like Last night but it was so bad on so many levels. The characters were so one dimensional cliches. I couldn't identify enough to get invested or care. The love interest black guy was good, but he was written, directed to be a doormat, weak whiny chump. This film isn't some glorious gumbo of film styles. It doesn't know if it wants to be a 60's throwback, a thriller mystery, a horror, a serial killer movie, a young woman going mad ala repulsion, a ghost ,supernatural film about a living person? The reviews are so over hyped. People just eat up anything and call it amazing these days. The characters are pretty much all horrible people, which is actually fine, but they're boring and movie characters should never be that. They aren't compromised in any interesting way, they're just oblivious to their own actions and have careless morality. The film also turns into a lazy ""me too"" thriller mid way through that left me pretty cold. The last 20 minutes or so are incredibly stupid and might have been my favorite thing about the movie, but probably not in the way the filmmaker intended. I just watched in awe at how morally bankrupt and forced everything became. A very petty and dumb movie in almost every way. A true stinker. Edgar Wright can make an excellent film, but there's zero evidence to that fact on display here.",/review/rw7771691/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2021,Marwan-Bob,7," I Liked the first half of the film very much, the second half it was not my thing.
","I understand what Edgar Wright tried to do, but I could not help but feel that this story would have been more intersting if it were less horror focused and more of a straightforward mystery with flashbacks.",/review/rw7771691/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2021,Calicodreamin,8," Enrapturing
","This movie had me hooked from the beginning. The vibe of the neon, eerily upbeat 60s music, and intense cinematography, is unmatched. Acting was decent and the storyline unpredictable (at least to me). A well made movie that haunts, not scares.",/review/rw7771691/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2021,ferguson-6,8," where the neon signs are pretty
","Greetings again from the darkness. Every once in a while a movie captures that magic feeling of being swept away, and this wild film from writer-director Edgar Wright and co-writer Kristy Wilson-Cairns (1917) did just that for me. This is my kind of psychological-horror-thriller and with the exception of one sequence that went a bit too ""slasher"" for my tastes, I had a blast watching it. I'll admit that, while also acknowledging more people will probably not enjoy this, than will. But for those who do, I feel confident they will share my enthusiasm.",/review/rw7771691/?ref_=tt_urv

29 October 2021,UniqueParticle,10," ""When we're alone we go downtown"" I absolutely loved this movie!
","Thomsen McKenzie and Anya Taylor Joy are exquisite! Last Night at Soho is brilliant, has one of the best soundtracks ever, and really well made by genius Edgar Wright. I loved the story so much about a girl that wants to be a designer and famous that starts experiencing something very different that I won't spoil anything everything with Alexandria (Anya) is so good. I was very surprised of the old folks that came to the movie, I guess they didn't mind the horror. Very deserving of the 7.6 rating and I'll definitely want to buy when available.",/review/rw7771691/?ref_=tt_urv

","I went on an Edgar Wright binge during lockdown, half just to see them again and half with an eye on the fact that ""Last Night in Soho"" was due out when the lockdown lifted.

18 January 2022,deloudelouvain,8," Good movie, excellent cinematography.
","The best thing about Last Night In Soho is the excellent cinematography. I think Edgar Wright outdid himself with this movie. The vibrant colors, the out of the ordinary shots, it all added a lot of quality in this most enjoyable movie to watch. The cast also did an excellent job, all very convincing playing their respective characters. As for the story the least we can say is that it's special. They keep you guessing for awhile, and even though I saw the end coming I was still very pleased with the outcome. If Edgar Wright continues making movies in this style he's got another fan from now on.",/review/rw7771691/?ref_=tt_urv
