30 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,10," Brilliant!
","The Leftovers is not only one of the most underrated TV shows of all-time but it's one of the best tv shows of all-time! It takes place three years after the disappearance of 2% of the world population and follows the lives of people in a small town near New York and how they cope with fall out of the event and try to figure out what happen to their loved ones. I have to admit that it's not for everyone, if your looking for a fast pace show with a lot of action the this isn't for you. This is one of the best written & acted shows of all-time. All you have to do is read through the reviews to see how loved this show really is. If you haven't seen this amazing show yet then do yourself a favor and go watch this as soon as possible!",/review/rw5708065/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2023,henrycoles9,10," No closure - at the end of the world
","The greatest drama series of all time, and I doubt anything I'm going to see down the line for the rest of my life will ever unseat ""The Leftovers.""",/review/rw5708065/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2023,ztigr,9," Lost, Fringe, and the Leftovers
","I don't want to include any spoilers so I'll concentrate this review on convincing you that if you liked Lost and Fringe, you'll like this show too. Justin Thereaux is amazing, if I hadn't seen him in the Mosquito Coast, I would not have realized how good he is. I'm also a huge Carrie Coon fan, and she is absolutely terrific here. The event of literally biblical proportions that sets the premise for the show is so thought provoking. Don't expect all the answers at the end of the series run, that's not its intention. Rather its meant to display the drama of people wrestling with these questions. Its a very wild ride, but in the end we see the human spirit's ability to overcome and find happiness in a very emotional finale. Stick with it.",/review/rw5708065/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2021,UniqueParticle,10," One of my favorites, glad I own the set!
","Love everything about The Leftovers the writing, soundtrack, acting, and the goosebumps vibe I get from it is sensational! Justin Theroux and Ann Dowd are riveting throughout, it's mind boggling Emmys weren't received more. The Leftovers will always remain in my top favorite shows and the creators really did something special. I really like the guilty remnants, everything with the Garvey family, and anyone else the story plays out so well!",/review/rw5708065/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2023,Supermanfan-13,10," One of the most underrated shows ever!
",The Leftovers is one of my favorite shows of all-time. Everything about this show is great but the writing and acting is what really makes this show so special. All you have to do is read through the reviews to see how loved this show really is. Every review has one thing in common and that's they almost all mention how underrated this show is. It doesn't get mentioned when people name the best show ever but it absolutely belongs among them. It may be a little slow for some people but it does pick up. This isn't a show where you can just have it on in the background while you do other things. You need to sit and pay attention and if you do that then I promise you'll enjoy it.,/review/rw5708065/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2020,IonicBreezeMachine,10," Came in skeptical, came out sad it was over
","When Lost was on, I wanted to like it, but the contrivances used to extend the mystery and conflict well past the point of tolerance were a turn off. In The Leftovers the aspects of Lost I didn't like are put to much better use because there's never any resolution promised for the events that transpire and it's more a character study of how broken people deal with extraordinary circumstances which they have no control over. Each season feels unique in how it gives us a view into a world that is shaken to its foundation. Not every aspect of the show works for me as I was never fond of the Guilty Remnant cult or Liv Tyler's character in relation to it, but given how they're a cult and they're not the focal point I was more forgiving of this plot point than The Others in Lost. At its core The Leftovers is a show about broken people trying to fix themselves in a world that is almost as broken as they are and it exceeds what it sets out to do.",/review/rw5708065/?ref_=tt_urv

16 November 2022,awsafzidane,9," A show for every person who has experienced loss or grief
","I started this show because of the interesting premise (and partly because of Damon Lindelof). I love to watch movies and series with complicated storylines. The plot synopsis made me think it's a similar kind of show. A story about the sudden departure of 2% of the world's population; a mystery drama. But I soon realized that it's not about The Departed, it's about The Leftovers, as the name suggests. It isn't about getting answers to the ""why""s or ""how""s, it's about the lives of the people who have to survive without knowing what happened to the people they love, losing their loved ones, but not getting any closure.",/review/rw5708065/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2023,terryj-70659,10," Great acting
","My god, I was gripped all the way through this, I know something is great when I can't wait to see the next episode! The acting was tremendous by Kevin, Matt and Nora. I watched all 3 seasons, although I must say season 3 was a little bit of a disappointment. I wish they made more seasons... 3 just wasn't enough for me, hopefully they will make another season soon. So underrated, I never even knew about it. I was bored one evening and I'd just purchased now tv when I saw a trailer for this. If only there were more talented writers like this. Escapism at its finest. Well worth a watch, I think you'll like it!!!",/review/rw5708065/?ref_=tt_urv

14 May 2019,cherold,8," Great second season, fascinating third, you're on your own for the first one though
","I watched the first episode of The Leftovers when the series debuted and found it intriguing but not that engaging. So I gave up on it until, many years later, I read an article about how the series turned itself into one of the best series ever in season 2. After after finding this is the general consensus, I decided to check it out.",/review/rw5708065/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2020,arandonnelly-02,10," The Greatest TV Series of All Time
","In my opinion, HBO's ""The Leftovers"" is the greatest television series ever created. I may have a huge love for other shows such as The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Fargo and Twin Peaks, but with great works of art, I look for intellectual and philosophical depth and stimulation to keep myself thinking. I love existentialist works of art that meditate issues such as life and death, and The Leftovers is no exception.",/review/rw5708065/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2022,akdis3,10," Nothing else like it.
","I loved every minute if this absolute gem of a show. Everything about it is surprising, confusing, ugly and beautiful. I've never loved being so confused and surprised. The writing is perfect. The acting impeccable. It's not often you can say that something is completely original. Having said all of that, as another reviewer said, it's not for everyone. You have to be willing to sit in your confusion and let the story play out. Try though. It's worth it.",/review/rw5708065/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2017,miguelneto-74936,10," a series that will always be marked in my life.
","The Leftovers is undoubtedly the most underrated series of these last times, the HBO series was in danger of being canceled by its low audience, but fortunately it was not, the series that is based on a book by Tom Perrota, and has Damon Lindelof the same Lindelof creator of the controversial Lost, but I am happy to say that Damon Lindelof redeemed himself with The Leftovers, in season 3 with only 28 episodes, the series is a little lens at first but then begins to engage a lot, with great characters, Kevin, Nora Matt, Laurie, Jill, Tom, Patti and etc, are many well-built characters, my favorite character in the series is Matt played by the great Christopher Eccleston, the cast of the series is great, Justin Theroux evolves a lot in the series, and the last Carrie Coon is an impeccable actress, she was totally snobbish in the Emmy, she should not only have been nominated, but she could have won, the cast also has Liv Tyler, Amy Brenneman, Chris Zylka , Margaret Qualley, Ann Dowd, Regina King, Kevin Carrol, and all of the greats, especially Amy, Regina and Ann Dowd, the series is brilliant with a great story and the series does not bother to explain the mystery, it's about the Leftovers, the series is steered impeccably, and the series has clear reference in the classic Twin Peaks, The Leftovers has an excellent 1 season, a 2 excellent and a 3 perfect with At least 6 masterpieces of 8 episodes, Damon Lindelof, Directors and the cast are congratulations for this masterpiece, has very slow episodes, but I would say that season 3 has no error, the soundtrack is melancholy, it is incredible, a work of Max Richter, and has episodes focused on 1 character, and Matt has 3 episodes focused, 1 each season and the 3 are masterpieces, The Leftovers is a striking and unforgettable series with a 3 season perfect and a satisfactory ending, it's sad to know er that this series was totally snubbed in the Emmy, a series that has ""only"" 98 in the metacritic.

29 November 2015,riseagainst1090,10," Season 2 is one of the greatest displays of art ever to be put on screen. Beautiful, thought provoking, powerful and intensely epic.
","Never before have I written a review on IMDb. Not a single one. Have been using this site since I was a young teenager (I am 25 now) and although I have been moved by and enthralled with television series and films in the past, never before has one compelled me this much to feel the need to formally post a review. That being said, The Leftovers made me write a review because it is one of the most criminally underrated, under watched and overlooked shows on television today (in America, at least). It is an absolute shame because this show is a true artistic and philosophical marvel. It forces you to truly think and truly feel while you are experiencing it, and that is something too few television shows and films do today. Nowadays, too many want a movie over a film; a show over a series. This masterpiece of a season, season 2, will be looked back upon one day as one of the greatest television seasons of any show all time. It is that rare new gem hidden amongst the knockoffs and hand me downs. Light years ahead of any competition.",/review/rw5708065/?ref_=tt_urv

","Just wanted to briefly review. A few years after I have watched this. Although slow in parts and a little laggy in the first season, This is absolutely the best and most moving TV show and story I have ever watched or experienced. Please watch if you are considering. Don't want to spoil anything: but a masterful exploration of grief and the finale is easily the best of any TV show!",/review/rw5708065/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2022,larryrr44,9," Perpetually Confused and Entertained
","I started watching this based on the claims that it was the ""best show on TV ever!"" whereas I would easily argue that for GOT. Nonetheless, I could see how this could be true from the first episode on as I was absolutely hooked for no other reason than that the next episode ""had to be the one where I would finally find out what was actually going on!""
Spoiler alert: I don't think you ever actually know what's going on or why or how but it's a truly enjoyable experience regardless. The acting is spectacular. Sexy Justin Theroux can also put forth an amazing performance. The soundtrack is incredible. I had to Google a few things like ""who are the Guilty Remnant and why do they smoke?""
Most people did not enjoy the ending or found it not an ending at all per-say, whereas I was satisfied with the finality of what was finally revealed to us.",/review/rw5708065/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2020,bloopville,5," I really don't care that the romances were resolved. I was more interested in the ""bigger"" stories.
","Apparently, Lindelof was quite aware of the dissatisfaction with the ""Lost"" final episode, so he determined that the romance between Nora and Kevin would be resolved. Also, most of the supporting character's arcs were tied up in a nice lttle bow.",/review/rw5708065/?ref_=tt_urv

","Now if you're someone who thinks Marvel movies are great, this show probably isn't for you. Nothing against you, or Marvel, but this show and Black Panther are at two different ends of the spectrum. This show is simply brilliant, it's thought provoking and cast perfectly. When you watch this show for the first time it's great, when you watch it for the second time, or dissect scenes on their own it's simply perfect.",/review/rw5708065/?ref_=tt_urv
