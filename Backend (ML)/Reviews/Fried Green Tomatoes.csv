","Simply put, some movies should never be remade. ""Oldboy"" serves as a stark reminder with only a few exceptions: Americanized remakes of beloved and admired foreign films inevitably result in disappointment. For viewers unfamiliar with the history behind Spike Lee's ""Oldboy,"" the 2013 film is a remake of the cult-classic 2003 South Korean film of the same name, directed by Chan-wook Park. The Korean masterpiece possess a highly stylized, gritty sensibility while providing an emotional depth to its characters. Iconic director Spike Lee's ""Oldboy"" is as a handsomely shot piece of genre entertainment, but it fails in its attempt to define itself, resulting into a completely pointless, watered-down underwhelming thriller.",/review/rw2981530/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2014,utgard14,4," Weak, Safe, and Uninteresting
","Remakes are generally a bad idea. The percentage of remakes that are equal to or better than the original is probably less than 1%. However, English-language remakes of foreign films (or vice-versa I suppose) are a slightly different story. The percentage is still low, but maybe not quite as low. Anyway, all of this is to say that while I was skeptical of an Oldboy remake, I was not 100% against it. The benefit that a remake of a foreign film has over a regular remake is that you are pretty much forced to make things different, at least a little, simply by virtue of different tastes and filmmaking styles between cultures. That's a good thing, in theory, because all of the good remakes I can think of changed things from the original. The cookie cutter shot-for-shot remakes are the worst. Oldboy (2013) is, unfortunately, not a good remake.",/review/rw2981530/?ref_=tt_urv

","OLDBOY is a grim and unpleasant film for sure, but compared to Park Chan-wook's Korean masterpiece, this remake is weak sauce indeed. Spike Lee's version of the tale is a grim and nihilistic outing that takes away most of the original's power and style, leaving it an oddly hollow, uninvolving, and nasty viewing experience.",/review/rw2981530/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2014,davidlee2014,3," Why?
","Why would they remake a film by the master? The whole idea behind remaking films is to remake something that was maybe a good idea but had bad execution. The original Oldboy is a 10 top to bottom, story, script, action, actors, direction, why did they try to remake perfection. ",/review/rw2981530/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2013,moviexclusive,6," Neither imaginative enough to stand on its own nor inspired enough as a successful remake, Spike Lee's 'reintepretation' is unlikely to find much of an appreciative audience
","Spike Lee's 'reimagining' of the Park Chan-Wook cult classic 'Oldboy' is a queer creature despite the notable absence of the original's iconic octopus-slurping scene. Those unfamiliar with Park's original, which itself was based on a late 1990s Japanese manga, will likely find it bizarre and even off-putting; and yet those who have seen and loved Park's 2004 Cannes Gran Prix winner are likely to dismiss this as mild and underwhelming compared to the original. But most of all, there is something distinctly Asian in the tale's themes of revenge and solitude that feel an odd and therefore unsatisfying fit for an Americanised ""reinterpretation"".",/review/rw2981530/?ref_=tt_urv

14 March 2018,Bored_Dragon,5," Desecration
","This is not a new adaptation of the same story, this is a bad copy of an existing movie. Most of it is literally copied from ""Oldeuboi"" (2003), and what was altered was changed to the worse. I suppose there would be no changes at all if there was no American puritanism. Only the sickest things were changed to adjust the movie for the western market, which is best seen in the way they mutilated ending. Spike Lee made a remake so lousy that I don't understand why Samuel L. Jackson had agreed to play in it. The only positive impression on me was left by the sweetness of Elizabeth Olsen, but no matter how much I enjoyed watching her, she failed to make me overlook how much everything else in the film was bad. I have a feeling that today too many movies rely on seduction of the male audience's by beautiful / cute / sexy girls, as well as the female part of it with the handsome actors, and on megalomaniac special effects, while the true values of the seventh art are neglected. This brings fast profits at the cinema box office, but there are fewer and fewer movies that can withstand test of time and not be forgotten as soon as something new comes out. If I had not seen the Korean version, I might have rated this bit higher, but the impression left by the original is too strong to be able to avoid comparing them throughout the whole duration of the remake. And compared to the original, the remake is really poor.",/review/rw2981530/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2013,shawneofthedead,5," A remake that's just about adequate on its own merits, but is hardly a patch on the film on which it was based.
","Hollywood remakes of Asian films are always an iffy proposition. How will the nuances and culturally-specific references translate across oceans and continents? Generally, however good the remakes, they rarely – if ever – eclipse the original films. In recent memory, perhaps only Martin Scorsese's The Departed, based on Infernal Affairs, has managed to find a life of its own. Other remakes, like The Lake House and Shall We Dance?, have sunk into ignominy. Spike Lee's Oldboy isn't completely terrible, but it does lose quite a bit of the dark, bruising, ambivalent flavour of Park Chan-Wook's 2003 Korean classic.",/review/rw2981530/?ref_=tt_urv

","Woody acting and product placement ruined this movie for me. i'm not sure how he did it, but spike lee even manged to make 20 years in captivity feel rushed and uneventful. to elaborate further, there was ZERO character development, everything felt pushed along, including the 20 years in the room. he was just a pitiful alcoholic for YEARS, then ""EPIPHANY"", a five minute montage of getting clean and getting in shape annnnd he's out. there was no passion to it, there was no empathy that you get from the original, you don't feel sorry for him. he's just a sociopath on a revenge spree. although, i think the big ending twist was done well, the overall movie was a snooze fest. they even managed to make a pivotal scene, the hallway fight, BORING and pushed along.",/review/rw2981530/?ref_=tt_urv

Reading various other reviews, the film was never going to be a hit with the so called ""connoisieur"" However, once I got over my own pomposity, I was pleasantly surprised and, admittedly with a nod to the original, don't think a much better job of a remake could have been managed.",/review/rw2981530/?ref_=tt_urv

","I hadn't watched the original when I watched the remake. And it captured my attention from beginning to the end. Josh Brolin was very good especially in the first half of the movie. He could make me hate him, but the problem is I never really liked the character at the second half, which was supposed to happen based on the story. And the best part of the movie, for me, is the twist, so shocking. So, it was satisfying for me. And after this I will try watching the original.",/review/rw2981530/?ref_=tt_urv

","Even though i went in to the movie pretending i was watching an entirely original movie, this remake was awful. The plot was ALMOST the same but he changed things that shouldn't have changed but kept small things exactly the same. The ending was a ""fairy tale"" type ending to please the audience. SHarlto i usually love his acting but in this movie he was almost like a cartoon character villain. Lee also overemphasizes the blood and gore. The fight scenes almost look all way too choreographed. Overall the plot changed made the movie less believable for me and ending definitely was a way of ""satisfying"" the audience.",/review/rw2981530/?ref_=tt_urv

12 August 2014,Reno-Rangan,6," History won't repeat, I mean sometime in a remake.
","One of my all time favorite world cinema is the Korean version of this movie. Remakes are okay, but some movies won't suit for recreation because of its masterpiece value, believing that won't come close for the second time. Just like Mona Lisa, Starry Night, Birth of Venus, The Last Supper and other arts, it should have left alone untouched. Like Japanese did, because it was their story after all. This American version was good, but very much commercialized with the fast pace approach kind of ruined. If I had not seen the original, probably I would have liked it. I knew the twist so I did not get the excitements in those parts. So those who are not familiar with the 2003 movie can definitely have a good time.",/review/rw2981530/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2014,suws1,8," People hate when a classic is remade, but this one is great!
","Oldboy is a remake or reimagination of the 2003 korean movie Oldeuboi. This new version has been badgered by both critics and viewers as a poor, shallow remake, that soils the memory of the original. I disagree. This one was great. The premise is the same as Oldeuboi, a man gets impriosoned for 20 years without knowing why, and when he gets out he seeks out vengeance. But its not that linear. The story is filled with mysteries, and keeps making the viewer asking questions, the same questions as the protagonist, despite him not being the most likable man. Why was he impriosioned, who did it, why was he released? Also the story is dark, twisted and leaves a bad taste in your mouth. A great story, a great mystery. The acting was very good, Josh Brolin does a very nice job, as does Sharlto Copley as the main antagonist. But the movie isn't without flaws. In my opinion the 20 years feel a little bit fast-paced, and don't feel like 20 years but maybe as 20 months. And some product placement was unnecessary. But overall great movie, unworthy of all the hate it has received. On a personal note, I have watched the original, and I liked this one very much. Everyone is comparing this one with the original, and I think that's a mistake. This is a new movie, a new take on the same premise, it has some homages to the original, and that's it. The original was brilliant, but it wasn't without flaw, and neither is this one.If you hate when someone makes a remake of a cult classic you love and you're not open to a new vision on that movie, stay away from this one. If you just love movies, and if you want to watch a great remake, a great reimagination, I think you will enjoy this very much.",/review/rw2981530/?ref_=tt_urv

13 March 2014,StevePulaski,3," A golden opportunity missed by Spike Lee to silence naysayers
","Spike Lee's Oldboy is a farcry from Park Chan-wok's original Korean film of the same name, and it's a farcry from a good film in general. The opening title informs us this is a ""Spike Lee Film,"" which should offput any fan or cinephile. In his two decades of filmmaking, Lee has always named his projects ""joints"" with an opening title card declaring itself ""A Spike Lee Joint."" The fact that Oldboy is a film and not a joint is offputting because it perhaps states a certain lack of confidence on his behalf. Even in his most professional films (IE: Malcolm X) he would always precede the events with the aforementioned title card.",/review/rw2981530/?ref_=tt_urv
