5 September 2022,stevecarr-11383,9," This is really engaging & clever
","Two kids of very different background become friends, with the added twist that somethings magical are going on if you're a Kid who believes the Obvious, or at least seem to be going on if you're and Adult being Objective. As in the best of these, there are parallel plot lines that will appeal to kid and adult viewers, simultaneously (spoiler: a jungle with venomous snakes might appear to the prejudiced Adult mind as the backyard vegetable patch). Acting by all is outstanding: reminiscent of Matilda, with sibling rivalry that will be interesting to watch play out. I gave it nine stars, only because you wouldn't believe me if I gave it 10. A nice discovery on a slow Labour Day weekend.",/review/rw8557201/?ref_=tt_urv
