13 January 2021,atlasmb,8," A Rewarding Romance
","When a hard-working L.A. event planner unexpectedly inherits a chalet in Vail, she reevaluates her life, quits her job, and moves to the resort town. Lacey Chabert plays Chelsea---who suddenly uproots her life---with her usual charm. She meets Owen (Tyler Hynes) there. He's a soft-spoken contractor who lives by Vail's more relaxed pace. Together they attempt to revive a portion of Vail and the restaurant run by Owen's father.",/review/rw7756745/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2020,Jackbv123,6," ""It's like a dream... It's not real""
","If you are adverse to plot holes, lack of reality, goofs and so forth, then this is probably not your movie. This movie really tried my patience on those fronts. So think of it as a fantasy, a dream world, then there's room to enjoy this movie.",/review/rw7756745/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2020,texasfolk,9," Tyler Hynes is Robin Williams
","Ok. It's a Hallmark movie. Girl meets obnoxious boy. Boy melts her heart. Someone has died. You know the ropes. But is it worth the watch?
Yeppers. Lacey is always the Hallmark princess. Tyler ab libs many of his lines and true to form they're gems.
Good story. Great scenery. Three best things. Lacey and Tyler aren't actors saying lines. They ARE the characters.
You don't hit the fast forward on the remote - except commercials. Third, it's a Penny Perry casted movie. She puts the magic together.
Great job Hallmark.",/review/rw7756745/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2020,cmather-22369,10," Love, love, love Lacey and Tyler!
","I so love the chemistry between Lacey and Tyler! Their bantering was fun! Tyler's wit and half smile is disarming! I have been a Lacey fan for a long time and she delivers wonderfully in this movie. I am a new Tyler Hynes fan and I find myself searching for one of his movies, I have watched them all multiple times! Please write another movie for him to star in soon! This movie had a great story, loveable characters all around and cute dialog!",/review/rw7756745/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2020,kauling,7," good start to 2020
","I'm always skeptical when watching a Lacey Chabert movie, entirely too much giggling & broad smiles for my liking. I agree with a previous reviewer, she toned that down for this role. The actors were in sync and the script was not bad. Good movie to kick off 2020.",/review/rw7756745/?ref_=tt_urv

15 March 2020,rightisright,6," Lacey Chabert saves a cliche fest.
","It's the old should I go back to my city job or stay in this delightful small town.
The male lead is basically a cardboard cutout. Somebody wake him up?
I believe that most of the ""Vail"" scenery is actually Calgary, but it's still pretty.
Lacey Chabert is, as always, stunning and full of delightful energy.",/review/rw7756745/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2020,ginasharp,10," Still smiling :D
","I LOVED this movie! This is a GEM. First time I ever saw snow tubing in a Hallmark movie, so funny. I actually clapped when they got to the bottom. It looked like they had so much fun and I was right there with them! I absolutely loved Lacey Chambers and Tyler Hynes. I will watch any movies with Lacey in them, she is one of my favs and her with Tyler was my top couple ever I believe! I smiled and laughed with this movie, they just seem so natural. I also loved the beautiful scenery and being in the winter time. My favorite 2020 HM so far! Cheers Hallmark :D",/review/rw7756745/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2020,Luvhallmark,7," It was cute! But
","I enjoyed the movie and yes people.....I know it's Hallmark (I do in fact luv Hallmark) but it offered very little in originality. Struggling restaurant/village, someone who should've been given a promotion was overlooked, handsome ""single"" guy who happens to be an architect but does handyman stuff and beautiful chalet left to niece by her uncle whom she hadn't seen in years because she was too busy working. I wish Hallmark didn't use the such similar scripts over and over again while only changing the leads. And what's with the kiss, why does it have to always happen in the very last scene, does Hallmark think we're going to change the channel or something. Cmon HM, you've got to do better than this. I rated it a 7 for the gorgeous scenic views in Canada, and of course TH is a very good actor and so is LC, I thought they had decent chemistry.",/review/rw7756745/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2020,alar62,10," 10 for the chemistry!
",Seen alot of Hallmark movies and what makes Winter in Vail different from the rest is the chemistry between the two lead actors. The scenes between Lacey Chabert and Tyler Hynes seem more ad-libbed than scripted and I enjoyed that playfulness between them. Not every Hallmark movie have characters/actors that really click-in this one they do and I hope they do a sequel.,/review/rw7756745/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2020,happyjack-29558,10," Classic Hallmark
","What a way to kick off Winterfest! The chemistry between Lacey and Tyler was believable and sweet. The storyline, perfect. It was a great movie to settle in with on a cold winter's night.",/review/rw7756745/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2020,phd_travel,6," Cookie cutter story
",The good thing is they film on location in Vail. Since it is like an advertisement for Vail that makes sense. The strudel thing is a little boring. The big dilemma here is whether or not to give up LA for Vail which isn't too small a town at least.,/review/rw7756745/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2020,bbbarth,9," One of Hallmark's Best!
","Really enjoyed the acting-wasn't ""sappy-sweet"" or ""high-school-playish"" like a lot of Hallmark movies. The actors were all believable, the story-line held my interest, and the photography was beautiful.",/review/rw7756745/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2020,toncincin,7," Cute story ...
","Lacey Chabert and Tyler Hynes were good together. It was a cute story - just the location was off! First of all, most of it was filmed in the Calgary area - not Vail, CO. And does anyone REALLY believe that Vail Village needs help? Has anyone ever been there during ski season OR during the summer? Vail Village is just fine. No need to ""revitalize"" it OR bring more people there. Instead of using an already established resort town, Hallmark might want to make a town up (like they did with Garrison, AK in Christmas Under Wraps.. yes - the fictitious restaurant could still need help. Just don't use an already existing bustling resort town!",/review/rw7756745/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2020,famielovez,10," Great chemistry. Beautiful location. Sweet Story.
","This Hallmark movie is full of chemistry between the two main actors. As you watch it, you can't help but smile and laugh with the characters. Hallmark definitely created a great movie with Lacey Chabert and Tyler Hynes. They need to be in more movies together. Great start to the winter movies",/review/rw7756745/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2022,TheLittleSongbird,7," Winter fun
","Lacey Chabert has always struck me as very watchable and can understand why she is a Hallmark favourite, though will agree that it was time that she toned things down a bit. Tyler Hynes is likewise worth watching more often than not, despite not all his films being good (same with Chabert). Was not sure about whether 'Winter in Vail' would be good or not, due to not caring for most of the 2020 Winterfest films and finding 2020 a very variable year for Hallmark (especially the Christmas output).",/review/rw7756745/?ref_=tt_urv

",I absolutely love Lacey Chabert and she didn't disappoint in this one. There is good chemistry between her and Tyler Hines. The story line is cute. The acting is good and believable. I'll be purchasing this one on DVD for my collection.,/review/rw7756745/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2021,adeloris,9," Almost 10!
","Great movie, Tyler was funny and Lacey was great! I would have given it a 10, but when they left that telescope outside to get covered in snow I had to take off a star!",/review/rw7756745/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2020,chiltonsjillfreeport,7," Best of Lacey Chabert
","I always want to turn Lacey Chabert down a few notches, so this was a first. She seemed human, instead of the windup Hallmark over-chirpy version.",/review/rw7756745/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2020,raun-1,2," Cutish
","It wasn't bad, but not so good. I watch these to lift my spirits. Especially now. But Chelsea seemed so frequently dour even when she should have been reasonably happy. Maybe it was because she was thinking too hard. In the end discussing Altair and Vega as being romantically together she said. . . ""it takes the starlight millions of years to get from here to there. Maybe they connected centuries ago, maybe they were just destined to be together."" Since Altair is 17 light years away and Vega is 25 light years away, it only takes 17 and 25 years, respectively, for the light from those stars to get here. We would know in 17 to 25 years if they got together. And the light going from here to there tells us nothing, it's the light from there to here that tells us if they are together.. How can you maintain a romantic atmosphere when she's saying stuff like that; stuff that makes you say, ""huh.""",/review/rw7756745/?ref_=tt_urv

14 January 2022,cujorocky,6," Not bad
","Lacey is good in everything, but I read where a critic says she giggles not stop in every movie. Omg he is right. She giggles constantly throughout her films. Like nonstop giggles. Wow must be her acting crutch like Brad Pitt eating in every movie or DiCaprio smoking in every scene. But they must have said the word ""strudel"" 75 times in this movie. It got soooo annoying!!",/review/rw7756745/?ref_=tt_urv
