26 March 2022,treydrier,4," Is the magic lost?
","Unlike the 1st two seasons I'm trying my best to get through season 3 but boy is it a monotonous confusing mess. Loved the 1st two seasons and was excited to watch season 3, only to be let down right away in episode 1. I will try and grind through season 3 but it won't be easy.",/review/rw5771359/?ref_=tt_urv

8 June 2020,TruthSeeker82,8," Intresting
","People are weird. Sometime really ridiculous TV series and movies gets very good reviews and sometime decent series gets bad. This TV series is the example of later. It's not an Emmy winning series but nevertheless quite interesting to watch. The actors are doing good job and the plot has some life to it. I am not sure, how come some science fiction movies and TV series, like Star Wars, gets high ratings, despite being quite away from reality but some get judged based on scientific laws.",/review/rw5771359/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2020,chrisstineb,9," Not a Bad Show - dystopian intrigue that leaves you thinking
","Don't be misled by the reviews. This show is interesting and leaves you wanting to know more about the setting. Is it an award winner - no. Is it entertaining and suspenseful - yes. Does the intrigue make you want to keep watching - absolutely.
I read the user reviews before watching but decided to give it a shot regardless of the low ratings because I was I intrigued by the concept. I haven't watched the movie nor have I read the source material. I've now watched 4 episodes and I'm hooked. To enjoy this show you first need to accept that the premise is unrealistic. What it does accomplish is a very interesting analogy of classism. Many people seem to dislike the police procedural plot. I enjoyed it and I think it succeeds as being a plot device to give the audience a tour of the train from the perspective of someone in the lowest class, while showing the massive injustices between the haves and the have nots.
Give Snowpiercer a chance if you enjoy dystopian genres and you aren't too picky about technical realism but want something that will make you think about the ugliness of wealth privilege.",/review/rw5771359/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2022,aquarianavenger,7," What!? Whyyyyy!!?
","The first two seasons were great. They had me intrigued and binging the whole thing, but season 3 has taken a nose dive. I would give the first 2 seasons an 8 or 9, but this season is a 5. I averaged it out to 7",/review/rw5771359/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2020,bc_global18,5," Weak lead
","The show has potential and seems to be at least similar in concept to the movie, but the male lead actor is just not good. Most of the time he has the same demeanor and expressions without any real emotion. Others are better especially Jennifer Connelly but I keep rooting for them to kill off the main guy. I don't think it's going to happen.",/review/rw5771359/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2020,DavidPetutschnig,8," I don't understand the bad reviews.
","First of all lets make one think clear, this is a show in a sci-fi setting and Sci-fi has always been experimenting with cheesy and illogical concepts. I don't know why people forgot that. Of cource the idea of a endlessly running train isn't realistic nor would the class system of the train work in real life, but thats not the point of the show. You wouldn't say that fighting with laser swords or travelling through time in a car is very realistic, but it is definitely fun to watch. That is why (at least for me) Snowpiercer works. Is it a show that would win awards for groundbraking acting or writing? No, probably not. But the story is definitely thrilling, the set pieces are fascinating and I am extremely invested in the show.",/review/rw5771359/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2022,BrandoYambo,6," What happened to this show??
","Like most people, I enjoyed the movie enough to give this show a chance. Season 1 was good enough, with some glaring issues but not TOO many. Season 2 was still watchable, but a clear decline in quality. As for Season 3, it has been painful just to get through each episode, and I'm only still going because I very rarely just stop watching something mid season after I've invested many hours in it already. I truly don't even know where to begin, when explaining why the current season has been so bad. Many reviews have already stated how bad of an actor the guy who plays Layton is, but even the characters who were once interesting and often likeable are barely recognizable anymore. Also, the attempts at artistic shots and dialogue fall flat every single time; it feels like a college student wrote most of the monologs. I'm currently on episode 8 of Season 3 and will, at the very least, finish with this season... but not because it is interesting or captivating. Rather, just out of a general curiosity to see where they're going with the show and to confirm my theory that it can't get any worse (even though episode 7 proved me to be painfully wrong already). You've been warned.",/review/rw5771359/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2020,chrisproudfoot-59026,8," Don't Take It Literally ... Enjoy the Ride. bad casting on Daveed.
","For those stating that the premise of a train wrapping around the globe that has to keep running is too unrealistic - that is correct. Though it's a great metaphor for how our class based elitist society is part of a never ending circle that, given the right circumstances , could entirely collapse at any moment.",/review/rw5771359/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2022,erkinkula,3," Stop Season 3 and write it again!
",Stop Season 3 and write it again! Script doesn't make sense at all now. Unnecessary and unlogical events to pass time. Layton's acting is getting worse and worse in every season. Jennifer Connelly was wonderful in both seasons and her leave is quickly forgotten in season 3.,/review/rw5771359/?ref_=tt_urv

5 January 2021,jflizard,2," I was so happy and then a bad actor ruined it all
","This was a tv show I was eager to watch because of the original movie and of course, because it had a star on it. And then I got so badly disappointed that the main character is such a bad actor !! I could not believe it ! I'm not an expert, not even a native English speaker but if I notice this so clearly I can imagine how Americans should have their heads filled with not so good feelings about such a bad and void acting . Please, replace the actor , do something about him because his performance is so annoying that i cannot see much beyond it. The story itself is ok to watch , nothing great but with some good episodes and some nice CGI at times... but really... main actor needs to be replaced !",/review/rw5771359/?ref_=tt_urv

13 November 2020,deloudelouvain,9," After a great movie a great series! Luckily I didn't listen to the negative reviews.
","I can't believe I almost passed on this brilliant show. I loved the movie when it came out in 2013. To me it was for sure one of the better movies from that year, and I watch tons of movies. Bong Joon Ho did a great job with Snowpiercer. So when I read all those very negative reviews about this new series, that it was unbelievably dissapointing, so bad etc... I almost decided not to waste my time with it, but then again I remembered how many times I watched great movies that were badly rated on IMDb that I decided to give it a shot. I'm so happy I did that, as this series is a fresh breath of air, completely what I hoped for after that brilliant movie. Not only is it extremely well made but the story is well thought of, keeps you wondering in suspense what will happen next. It's one of those series I can't help but binge watch. Brilliant acting from a large part of the cast, especially Jennifer Connelly. The first season flew by, it's now waiting impatiently for the next season in the hope it's of the same quality as this brilliant first season. I'm not going to write everything is perfect, like some of the rooms look too big to be in a train, but it's for sure entertaining if you can look beside futile things like that. In short, don't pay any attention to the negative reviews if you loved the movie from Bong Joon Ho. You won't be disappointed!",/review/rw5771359/?ref_=tt_urv

20 February 2021,jecskene,7," Good enough
","I know that people complain about Daveed's acting. I think people need to be aware that an actor should reflect the target audience. As a rule, the new generation is more cerebral than any that have come before. This takes on the appearance of being less animate and more tolerance for grey zone morality. We all remember Captain Kirk not lacking for an opinion on anything. That's not the new way of thinking. There are certainly enough decent actors that pull this show through; Sean Bean plays an excellent Wilford; we can witness both the menace, the desperate need for control and also the vulnerability. Jennifer Connelly's character is also highly engaging. Hers, imho, is the focal point of the whole series. Though seemingly morally grey, she is actually completely and selflessly dedicated to the survival of the human race. I also felt that Annalise Basso did an amazing job as a spoiled and demented rich kid but also with a character arc as well. Steven Ogg also does an amazing job as being, quite literally, the wild card; you never know what he is going to be up to.",/review/rw5771359/?ref_=tt_urv

18 February 2021,dnacowboys,8," Rescued by Mr Wilford
","The first season had its ups and downs but for the most part it was pretty lacklustre and to be frank, I'm not a fan of the shows lead. However, there was a palpable excitement coming over me during the final episode of season 1's finale when the engineers picked up Big Alice's signal. From the moment Sean Bean appeared on screen everything changed about snowpiercer. Sometimes it can take just one Actor to take a show by the scruff of the neck and drag it screaming and struggling up the ratings and it looks like the actor is Sean Bean.",/review/rw5771359/?ref_=tt_urv

5 April 2022,karwan49,4," Daveed Digis (Layton ) is acting is so bad
",This role to Daveed Digs is not suits him . When he is acting he is like so beginner . He shouldn't be a primer role . I really don't like the way he talk he needs to act like at least a true story like he is in that moment. But he is not I don't feel he acting at the role send the message to us so we can feel he actually enjoying it ... not like Jennifer Connelly she is absolutely amazing and she is actually knows how to flow or Sean Bean he is great . You feel when he is sad or happy or angry . But Daveed doesn't makes you feel when he needs to show us when he is angry or sad or emotional. I don't see I should continue to watch this show if he actually in that role.,/review/rw5771359/?ref_=tt_urv

21 October 2020,Digital_excitation,5," Round and round we go, a journey to nowhere without progress
","The series originated from a movie (based on a graphic novel): Snowpiercer. Snowpiercer is a train, about 5 times the size of a normal train, both in length, width and height, with an engine that never runs out of fuel. Some carts have three floors, to give you an idea, and the 1001 cart train is about 1 mile long. You really wonder where the recycling center for the sewage pipe is located, since it is a closed system, and how it's attached between carts. The story starts at revolution 12, the 7th year after departure, so a revolution is about 200 days. If the speed is about 80mph, the completely free of maintenance, snowed under icy track would be 192.000 miles.",/review/rw5771359/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2020,Top_Dawg_Critic,8," Interesting start, compared to the original film. Looks promising - thus far.
","S1E1: Well, so far so good. The cartoonish opening credit wasn't very promising, but the visuals and sets where excellent. The ""event"" that brings a tail forward is an interesting and clever way to start a series. The quaint introduction to the current main characters was done effectively, casting choices are decent. I'm sure more characters will be introduced in time. Looks promising thus far.",/review/rw5771359/?ref_=tt_urv
