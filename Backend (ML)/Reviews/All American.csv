16 April 2005,scottdpearson,9," A Classic (and great!) Romantic Comedy
",What I expected: A rather lame overly-stereotypical portrayal of a sports-mad guy and an equally lame stereotypical portrayal of the gal who likes him yet suffers while being second banana to his overly zealous support for his favorite sports team.,/review/rw1169568/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2005,elitt,6," This baseball film stays in the Park
","""Fever Pitch"" shows what obsessions or deep passions can do to a relationship when both partners don't share the same thing or at least at the same level. Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is a devout Red Sox fan. He is a fanatic. He goes to every game, his apartment looks like a Fenway Park gift shop, and he goes to Florida every spring to watch the team play in spring training when the games don't count. Lindsey (Drew Barrymoore) is a young executive on her way up in the real world and is more or less married to her job. When the two of them eventually go out on their first date, she gets really sick, and he stays the night and takes care of her. This blows her away and she is sold. The relationship is full steam ahead, but the problem is that it's wintertime and baseball season hasn't gotten started yet. She doesn't know what she is in for.",/review/rw1169568/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2006,jotix100,7," Take me out to the ball game!
","The Farrelly brothers, Bobby and Peter, are at it again. With ""Fever Pitch"" the creators of other films that have dealt with a lot of gross themes, abandon that tactic when they decided to bring Nick Hornby's film to the screen, something that it would have been hard to do. The novel, of the same title, dealt with a man's obsession with soccer, since it is set in England, where that sport consumes most of British sports fans. It's to the credit of the writing team of Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandell, to transform the book into a language that would appeal to most Americans, when they make their hero, a Boston Red Sox fan.",/review/rw1169568/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2005,noralee,8," Sweet and Charming Date Movie
","""Fever Pitch"" is a sweet and charming addition to the small genre of sports romances as date movies or movies a son could be willing to go to with his mother (though the guys in the audience got noticeably restless during the romantic scenes).",/review/rw1169568/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2005,imxo,7," Pretty Darn Good
","My daughter gets really put out at me when I refer to Drew Barrymore as looking as if she'd been hit in the face with a frying pan, not to mention her Dudley Dooright chin that Jay Leno would die for. How wonderful, then, when I discovered in ""Fever Pitch"" that I really like Miss Barrymore; and Jimmy Fallon; and the Red Sox; and Boston! This film is probably best characterized as a sweet, light comedy. To be absolutely stereotypical, the girls will like the movie for its romantic charm and Jimmy Fallon's vulnerability, and the boys will like it for all the male bonding and the depiction of sports mania.",/review/rw1169568/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2005,americas_for_sale,9," A different kind of Romantic Comedy
","I went to see Fever Pitch with my Mom, and I can say that we both loved it. It wasn't the typical romantic comedy where someone is pining for the other, and blah blah blah... You weren't waiting for the climatic first kiss or for them to finally get together. It was more real, because you saw them through the relationship, rather than the whole movie be about them getting together. People could actually relate to the film, because it didn't seem like extraordinary circumstances, or impossible situations. It was really funny, and I think it was Jimmy Fallon's best performance. All in all... I would definitely recommend it!",/review/rw1169568/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2005,ruth-boaz,7," It is what it is, a decent romantic comedy
","If you enjoy romantic comedies then you will find this tale of two 30 year old singles who fall in love during the American League pennant race satisfying. On the other hand, if you are hanging around waiting for Kill Bill Volume 3 or Sin City 2 then you probably should stay away. The plot contains the obligatory guy meets girl's friends, girl meets guy's friends, and guy meets girl's parents scenes. There is even a guy meets girl's pet dog scene. That's all par for the course in a movie like this. However, what I liked about it was that the plot delved into the decision making process people make as they begin to realize that their romantic interest is not perfect and is in fact a bit quirky. The plot centers around answering the questions; how much quirkiness is too much and how much love does it take to trump those quirks? It is interesting to see the characters work that out because deep down (if we admit it) we all have quirks. Barrymore does a very good job in her role and Fallon sorta surprised me -- he's good as well. I rate it a 7 out of 10 as a romantic comedy. Add one point if you are a baseball fan or romantically involved with one. Add another point if you are a Red Sox fan and subtract two points if you are a Yankees fan.",/review/rw1169568/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2006,MissPearBanana,7," Awwww
","I saw this movie on Thursdays night after having a really boring day. I had no expectations, those I had were rather negative. Being that the only movie I've ever watched Jimmy in is the American version of Taxi with Queen Latifah(?)...don't ask why! But seriously..this movie is so cute! Drew Barrymore is always sweet, but I almost fell in love with Fallon's character. Why can't I meet a cute nerd like that. :) Movies like that are excellent. Simple, sweet and necessary. Sunday on a Thursdays. I'm not even a sports fan, but it's something about American movies with baseball that fascinates me. Probably the fact that we don't have that sport here in Norway.",/review/rw1169568/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2019,Uriah43,5," Not a Homerun but a Cute Romantic-Comedy All the Same
","Ever since the day his uncle took him to Fenway Park as a young boy, ""Ben Wrightman"" (Jimmy Fallon) has been Red Sox fan. And thanks to his uncle bequeathing him season tickets upon his death, Ben never misses a home game and is devoted to them from early spring to late fall. Then one winter day he meets a young woman named ""Lindsey Meeks"" (Drew Barrymore) who is almost the complete opposite of him and they both fall in love. What Lindsey doesn't know, however, is the fanatical devotion Ben has for the Red Sox and this creates a huge problem for their relationship from that point on. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a cute romantic-comedy which benefited from the good chemistry between the two of them. Admittedly, there are some slow parts here and there and the humor isn't as sharp as it could have been, but even so it was an okay film for the most part and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Average.",/review/rw1169568/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2005,Barky44,7," A Decent Enough Distraction
","Fever Pitch is a fun enough movie. It has a lot of funny moments (including a hilariously disturbing shower scene). Like most romantic comedies, it has a ""dead zone"" in the middle where all the heavy, ""she's breaking up with me"" stuff happens, but other than that it continues to be funny until the end.",/review/rw1169568/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2017,zkonedog,8," The (Romantic) Life Of A Baseball Fanatic
","There are, to be sure, more than a few reasons to dislike this movie. It's cheesy as all get-up, as sappy as maple syrup, and the final scene is so unbelievable as to be laughable. Yet, at least for me, ""Fever Pitch"" works because of one factor: the ability to describe the life of a baseball die- hard.",/review/rw1169568/?ref_=tt_urv

9 February 2008,xredgarnetx,6," Dullish romantic comedy
","Drew Barrymore and Jimmy what's-his-name from SNL costar in FEVER PITCH, the story of a nice girl (albeit a 30-year-old ""girl"") who is dating a nebbish obsessed with the Red Sox. This constantly gets in the way of their relationship, so she breaks it off. He realizes how much he misses her and takes drastic action -- offering to sell his Sox season tickets -- to prove his love. It all ends in some slapstick schtick on the field at Fenway Park. Fallon (I had to look up his name to remind me) lacks screen presence, although he might remind some of a junior Mike Myers. Barrymore is OK, if you can accept her in the role of a junior business exec whose biological time clock is fast running out. The two unfortunately lack any serious chemistry, and the movie is just a series of clichés. I gave it one more point that I might have due to a number of colorful character actors surrounding Fallon whenever the setting is Fenway Park, which it frequently is.",/review/rw1169568/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2005,TheMovieMark,7," I now officially forgive Jimmy Fallon for ""Taxi""
","I have to admit that I went into Fever Pitch with low expectations. It's no huge revelation for me to say that Jimmy Fallon's last movie (Taxi) was Catwomanly bad, and the trailers for Fever Pitch were all right but didn't mesmerize me. I was already preparing some cheesy baseball puns for my review...",/review/rw1169568/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2006,Superunknovvn,6," Hornby? Nah!
","""Fever Pitch"" is supposed to be an adaptation of Nick Hornby's book ""Pitch Fever"". Only in the book Hornby himself is the main character. And he hasn't got an obsession with baseball, but with soccer. The rest is the same as in the movie, though. Or is it? The truth is ""Fever Pitch"" has almost nothing to do with the book. It has not so much been based on as it has been inspired by Hornby's novel. On its own ""Fever Pitch"" is a pretty romantic movie that tries to avoid going over the top with its humor most of the time. Jimmy Fallon and Drew Barrymore try their best not to be unbearable and succeed more or less. The Farrelly brothers clearly took the Weitz brothers as an example for how to get out of the dick joke business into more mature movies. Of course, ""Fever Pitch"" doesn't hold a candle to the wonderful ""About A Boy"", but you have to say that the Farrellys were given weaker material to work with in the first place. In its best moments the movie makes you chuckle and in its worst it makes you yawn and look at your watch. Yep, the big problem with ""Fever Pitch"" is that it drags on too long. Stripped from Hornby's hilarious observations on his favorite sport and its connections to his own life the story just isn't very interesting (which has also already been the problem with the first adaptation of the novel). What do we learn from that? Just because an author is popular doesn't mean that all his novel translate well to film. J.D. Salinger had a reason why he denied film makers to ever adapt his stories, you know?",/review/rw1169568/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2007,gtgleeson,3," Watch the UK version instead
","I've enjoyed Nick Hornby's books, and their movie adaptations, but this is the exception. It was a huge disappointment, especially the character of ""Ben"" (Fallon), who comes across as a moron with almost no redeeming features. ",/review/rw1169568/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2005,deadsenator,3," Awful, disjointed and scattered. - 3 of 10
","I was really hoping that Jimmy Fallon would do well with a major role in a Farrelly Bros film, but I was disappointed with the results. I liked about 30% of Jimmy's dialogue; the rest was sophomoric and silly. I love joking around too, but ""Wit is the salt of conversation, not the food."" (Confucius?) Even if some of the one-liner jokes were funny, it was too much. So much so, that I had a really tough time seeing the romantic side of this story. The relationship did not fit very well in my book. I didn't believe Drew Barrymore's character either. She didn't fit or flesh out her job very well, in my opinion. ",/review/rw1169568/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2005,george.schmidt,7," More of a solid double than a grand-slam of a rom-com; nice chemistry between Barrymore & Fallon
","FEVER PITCH (2005) *** Drew Barrymore, Jimmy Fallon, Jack Kehler, Ione Skye, KaDee Strickland, Marissa Jaret Winokur, James Sikking, JoBeth Williams, Lenny Clarke, Siobhan Fallon. Reasonably funny romantic comedy with Fallon and Barrymore falling in love with each other and dealing with Fallon's obsessive fanaticism with the Boston Red Sox that proves to be at times taxing and calls into question what true love really is  sacrifices for one another. Based on Nick Hornby's best-seller (his soccer freak fan is transplanted for obvious reasons by vet screen writing team Babaloo Mandel and Lowell Ganz) and a near-perfect fit for funmeister filmmakers Peter & Bobby Farrelly who eschew most of their gross-out humor for a valentine to the desperate cursed life of a Boston fan with a fairy-tale only-in-truth-being-stranger-than-fiction end results (the World Series win by the BoSox sent the original ending into a tailspin). Barrymore and Fallon's loosey-goosey chemistry is often on the mark but the Farrelly's are thisclose to being in Garry Marshall rom-com territory.",/review/rw1169568/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2006,reverendtom,3," Worst movie ever
","First off, I'm a native Cape Codder, a huge Red Sox fan and I was an extra in this film. I was in the 1980 flashback scene at the beginning. That's neither here nor there, though. What I've come to talk about his how god-awful this film is. First off, I hated Jimmy Fallon way before this film, but this one just cemented it. He is definitely one of the least funny comedic actors ever. If his tenure on SNL wasn't proof how talentless this guy really is, this film makes a strong case for him getting his SAG card revoked. The only redeeming quality of the film is that the 2004 Red Sox are in it. That's it. The humor is slim to none, the romance is pretty much extremely annoying. Drew Barrymore looks like she wishes she were somewhere else. Worst Farrelly Brothers film for sure and just a plain piece of crap film.",/review/rw1169568/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2005,bababear,1," I hope Drew got a LOT of money for being in this crap.
","Is this the worst movie I've ever seen? Mmm, not sure- I'm almost sixty and I've seen a lot of movies. But for sure it's the worst movie I've seen in this century, which means it was even worse than COLD MOUNTAIN and that's pretty bad.",/review/rw1169568/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2005,caspian1978,6," Soon to be Boston Cult Favorite
","I was not only an extra in this movie, I got to see it in Boston to a sold out cinema. Over a thousand Boston Red Sox / Farrelly fans jammed themselves into a movie theater near Boston Common to watch a comedy....about them....Red Sox fanatics! Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon star is this cute comedy about love and lust. The love is between the two young lovers. The lust is for the Red Sox winning the world series. Although Fallon is not a great actor, he is the best actor for the role. He is funny enough and gets the most laughs. Barrymore on the other hand is the same old Barrymore. At times, I felt supporting actress Ione Skye would have been a better actor for the role. All in all, all Boston Red Sox fans will love this movie. For the rest of the world, this is just a funny movie.",/review/rw1169568/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2021,schroederana,7," Need to see more of this duo
","When I heard about a movie featuring Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon, I was curious. Of course we all know they're two great comedians, but we had never actually seen them share the big screen. I was really happy to see that this pairing is perfect for this type of rom com. I've watched a lot of romantic comedies in my life, but this one still sticks out as one of the best. Whether it be the sweet but funny interactions between the two, or the fun storyline, it never fails to make me smile. It also helps that they really do have a lot of chemistry and so you're constantly rooting for them to end up together. If you love romance, comedy, or even baseball, I thoroughly recommend it.",/review/rw1169568/?ref_=tt_urv

","Remind to check the IMDb.com specs before subjecting myself to any more ""escapist"" summer fare.

","This is a romantic comedy starring Drew Barrymore as workaholic Lindsey Meeks and Jimmy Fallon as charming Ben Wrightman.

10 September 2005,Robert_duder,6," Some interest is there but overall disappoints
","Fever Pitch is just okay. That's all there is to it. Drew Barrymore has become a master of Romantic Comedy and she's definitely not what's wrong with Fever Pitch. She does an okay job but Fever Pitch just doesn't hit the home run that it could have. I will say this is quite a different kind of entry for comedy directors the Farrelly Brothers. I'm quite used to their brand of comedy being slapstick, gross out, over the top...but instead they created something much more subtle with this one. It's actually a ""normal"" romantic comedy. It's almost sweet!! Too sweet perhaps but sweet nonetheless.",/review/rw1169568/?ref_=tt_urv
