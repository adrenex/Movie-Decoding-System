7 December 2020,toddsgraham,7," A simple story w/some great chemistry between the leads...
","I enjoyed this Lifetime original Christmas movie. It is a low-key, simple story that focuses primarily on the dialogue between the leads, which is its strength, I thought. There is not much in way of sub-plots and other storylines in this one. The script was solid. Another reviewer on here talks of the various clich√©s and stereotypes used in the script. I notice some of these (plot devices) as well, but they did not bother me or take away from the film, from my viewing experience. To be fair, we are talking about the TV (romance) Christmas movie genre; it is not the most original genre of film. The strength in this one for me was the dialogue between the two leads, and of course the acting. The acting, overall, was strong. It was 90210 meets One Tree Hill (sorry, I could not help myself). Jessica Lowndes's portrayal of Hayley Parker, I thought, was pretty good. I agree with the other reviewers on here, I think, she has improved over the years (since 90210). Chad Michael Murray's performance (playing Paul) was strong. I think he does great in such roles, in this genre of film. Members of the One Tree Hill cast have been in some of the best Christmas movies I have seen this year (well done). The chemistry between the two is very strong, one of the strengths of the movie, I felt. The dialogue and interactions between them were convincing; it pulled me, as it were. I did feel the ending was rather rushed, or put differently, the writers could have done a better job setting up Hayley's reaction at the end. The supporting cast was good. No complaints about music or music editing, which has been an issue with some of Lifetime's Christmas movies this year. There is a little bit of festive cheer in this one too, but you should not expect a Hallmark production in this one. All and all, this is a low-key Christmas movie with some strong performances by the leads. It is a nice new edition to Lifetime's 2020 lineup. If you like dialogue and chemistry, this one is for you.",/review/rw8411251/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2022,TheLittleSongbird,7," Surprisingly good
","Expectations weren't particularly massive for 'Too Close for Christmas'. Am not a fan of Jessica Lowndes and have not been impressed by a lot of her performances. Chad Michael Murray generally has come on a lot, though some performances and films are better than others dependent on the material. The premise also wasn't wow worthy. But there was hope as there were good films in the unsurprisingly uneven 2020 Lifetime Christmas batch.",/review/rw8411251/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2021,manfredpeter-09628,8," Jessica Lowndes getting better
",OR this script and JMM make her seem better. Typical storyline but not annoying. Dialogue very believable. CMM made the romance work. Supporting characters entertaining.,/review/rw8411251/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2020,Jackbv123,7," Just enough different
",The story has a bit of snowed-in-for-Christmas and of newbie-event-plans-gala. But the approaches were different both in story and dialogue.,/review/rw8411251/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2021,adamjohns-42575,4," Just not enough this time.
","As much as I usually love him, Chad was actually quite an annoying character in this and as such, not easy to fall for. To be fair Jessica didn't do much for me either and not just because she's not a man. She was too perfect and it grated a bit.",/review/rw8411251/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2020,rebekahrox,7," Jessica improves with every movie.
",I have never been a fan of Jessica Lowndes with her Valleygirl/Kardasian inflection and her eyeliner. But she has really really improved. So much so that she is the main attraction in this very watchable movie. Her acting is very good and I can't always say that this has been the case. Her beauty has been indisputable but kind of unapproachable. She has scaled down the make up which has allowed her natural beauty to shine through. Well Done! Now to work on that unfortunate southern California accent.,/review/rw8411251/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2021,jenrn-09722,3," Started awful, slowly improved, ending was mediocre
","Well, I agree with other reviewers: Jessica Lowndes is definitely improving. But still cant believe someone who looks as good as she does, is so over-the-top insecure I almost every movie. Why doesn't she ever play someone who has some confidence? It has been so over done by her, then her character is so perfect at everything she does, that it comes off as ridiculous. She is still very wooden, but she does relax more this movie than I've seen her yet. Chad Michael Murray was great, once you get past the weird blond bushy hair. His character starts out as kind of a know-it-all but improves over the course of the movie. I agree with another reviewer that the conflict toward the end was very high school-ish. And someone as smart as her character is supposed to be, wouldn't have let the jealous girl's comments bother her. The conflict just seemed forced and the reunion was rediculously dramatic. I also thought the discussion of permant and ""making this a tradition"" was too much after only spending a week together.",/review/rw8411251/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2020,burlesonjesse5,4," VIEWS ON FILM review of Too Close for Christmas
","""Are you okay?"" That seems to get asked a lot in the Lifetime film I'm about to review. Yes I'm okay, we're okay, things are okay, it's okay. Geesh!",/review/rw8411251/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2021,djvang88,5," The hair!
",Couldn't get past Chad Michael Murray's bird nest hair. It was like someone roughed it up before every scene.. He was trying too hard to look rugged and ruffled and laid back. It just looked phony.,/review/rw8411251/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2021,hellejnz,4," Awful male lead
","I mean, we all know what to expect from a Christmas movie and this has it all. Houses that are way too heavily decorated, far too many homemade cookies and a local Christmas gala etc etc. This one however, has an awful male lead, he's kinda creepy even more so after they start to like each other. This turned me off the entire movie.",/review/rw8411251/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2020,savethewatchmaker,3," A boring script that the actors do absolutely nothing with.
",This movie's predictability honestly turns it into a snoozefest.,/review/rw8411251/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2021,rhonnie-43139,10," Good movie
",I usually find the lead actor really annoying but he was tolerable in this movie. The story wasn't unique because the lead actress usually has the same job and same conflicts in other Christmas movies.,/review/rw8411251/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2020,ralph_s-37346,7," Charming love story
","I have always been a fan of Jessica Lowdnes.
But it is my first time watching Chad Michael Murray and I like the way the two actors play off one another. It is a wonderful Christmas love story. The only affectation I found distracting is the character's eating granola in so many scenes. After watching this program I went looking for other movies starring Chad Michael Murray because I am interested to see what he did with other acting roles.",/review/rw8411251/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2020,tnkounlabouth,7," Soo...
",I mainly watched this movie because of CMM and Jessica Lowndes. This was an okay storyline. I wasn't expecting much from a Lifetime Chrisfmas movie. Everyone that watches these already know what will happen and such. I still loved it regardless and it kept me entertained.,/review/rw8411251/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2020,jagfannn,6," Jessica Lowndes Makes This One
","Lowndes does a great job here and that's a good thing, because Chad Michael Murray's overacting is pretty hard to stomach in this one. If you can get by his ridiculously over processed hair style (clearly provided by a taxidermist) you'll find his, or his Character's arrogance a little off-putting. Despite this however, the leads have chemistry in this movie, largely due to Lowndes. The story is interesting enough to hold your attention until the end and is worth watching.",/review/rw8411251/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2020,kevend-16818,10," Fabulous
","What a wonderful Christmas film. Jessica Lowndes was fabulous, I have watched and enjoyed everyone of her Hallmark/Lifetime films and they just get better and better, such a multi-talented lady and as ever, a strong female lead. The movie has a great supporting cast, everyone gels so perfectly. I found it funny with plenty of touching and romantic moments. It's the sort of film that you can put your feet up with a glass of brandy and watch from start to finish. It's a real early christmas present for sure. It might have been predictable for some but whats wrong with that when its such a great film. I loved it, one of those movies for me which you can watch over and over again and still feel good about it. 10/10 for me.",/review/rw8411251/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2020,chiltonsjillfreeport,3," House of Tropes
","Reasonable viewers quickly learn to keep modest expectations of a Hallmark/Lifetime holiday romance movie. Most are utterly predictable and long on stock characters and tropes (some of them grating). They're vanilla as hell, any romance is chaste, and 'merry' doings often have the feel of a forced march through a glossy Small Town America that never existed.",/review/rw8411251/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2020,mayhugh-92626,10," YES AMAZING MOVIE!!!!!!!
","Ok so if you were a fan of the shows One Tree Hill or 90210 from the early 2000's you know who Chad Michael Murray and Jessica Lowndes are. They were basically the heartthrobs of each of their shows. When I saw they were in a Christmas movie together as the leads I had to check it out. They did not disappoint. Their chemistry was amazing...it was so good in fact I actually had to google them after the movie to see if they were really together. They aren't, so that just made me even more impressed with their connection on screen. The storyline is great as well it is not cliche like a lot of other Christmas movies. I would definitely recommend this Christmas movie especially if you were already a fan of these two. Lifetime Christmas movies are giving Hallmark's Countdown to Christmas a run for their money lol.",/review/rw8411251/?ref_=tt_urv

27 November 2022,piparminttuz,3," So many things poorly done
","To start with the set-up; it's like people in charge have never seen real snow. What were those white sheets everywhere... You also don't get stuck on that little snow, not even with a bike, let alone with SUV. Also nobody had steam coming out their mouths with breath, even though it's suppose to be cold enough for snow to stay. (So below 0 celsius). The plot is also just awkward and predictable. Hate that people give up their dreams like that's a healthy way to fight for love. Always the same ending with these movies...As for characters; of course he is gifted with his hands and she is some big town girl who ends up revaluting her values. This movie is just boring and poorly made.",/review/rw8411251/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2022,sanaipatel,1," Really???
",Where do they keep getting the funds to make movies like this. Complete cliche trash. Chad Michael pls value yourself more than this man. There are SO many better stories out there waiting to be told.,/review/rw8411251/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2022,bernaproduktion,4," Who was responsible for the hair?
",OK...Who was responsible for Chads hair? I couldn't stop thinking about it and how yellow and messed up it was. He can be quite handsome but in this movie they just couldn't bring that out.,/review/rw8411251/?ref_=tt_urv

7 August 2022,odolcha,5," Very average
","Very average, predictable Christmas movie. Nothing touching or catching attention. It seems like nobody cared to make a good movie: neither the actors nor the director. I would not recommend to watch it as a special one- just put as background if you are bored)",/review/rw8411251/?ref_=tt_urv
