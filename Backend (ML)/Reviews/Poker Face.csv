1 July 2021,chancenconnect,8," Season 2 will make you hate Dave
",I don't know what it is exactly but I absolutely loved season 1 and now it's like in season 2 he's got so much hate coming at him it makes you believe he's a narcissistic awkward jerk.,/review/rw6139866/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2020,bigdbk,9," Satisfyingly Hilarious
","First two episodes were quirky, awkward and awesome! I was not a huge Lil Dicky fan, I am a 40 year old who only knew or liked 2-3 songs of his from a few years ago. After getting a gander of this funny dude and AMAZING rapper in action, I will be digging deeper into his catalogue and watching every episode. From one Dave to another üëçüèº üëçüèº Hope this show picks up a ton of viewers and sticks around.",/review/rw6139866/?ref_=tt_urv

",This is one of the funniest shows ive seen in a long time. The entire cast is great. I cant wait to see where they go with it,/review/rw6139866/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2020,kenjenkins-83136,8," A much needed comedy
","You can only watch Letterkenny, Archer, Workaholics, and Sunny so many times. TV needed a new edgy comedy and Dave is just that. Its smart, its crude, and it is really funny.",/review/rw6139866/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2021,ForrestRivers,10," This show doesn't suck but most of these reviews do.
","I just had to review to stick up for Dave, wow some of these reviews are just not accurate. Loved season 1, almost through season 2 after reading reviews bagging out how bad it is. People need to get a grip, this is one of the most creative, well articulated shows of recent memory. Season 2 is just as good as 1, completely different so much deeper, emotionally engaging and strange but still a creative masterpiece! Sit back, relax, get weird, have a few laughs, don't look to much into things and enjoy. Can't wait for season 3. I love Dave and everything about it. Great show. (ps. Some of you obviously aren't comfortable with your sexuality calling Lil Dicky gay, that's bromance comedy bro)",/review/rw6139866/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2021,chancenconnect,8," What the heck happened ???
",Season 1 was incredible and season 2 is just awkward and socially unconscious. Dave now to the world is a self centered ego maniac and a narcissistic nerd. Dave burd if you're really like this in real life id just give up.,/review/rw6139866/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2020,mary-56037,10," I never laugh but I laughed out loud
","Tv these days don't make me laugh as much as it used to and ""Dave"" can be a bit much especially the 2nd episode about the ""fmesilly"" blow up doll, but in the end made me laugh so hard I mean a good hard belly laugh. Has great music and beats and l love hearing some new lil dicky but this show is brilliant!! Definitely for viewers over 18, and I wouldn't watch it with your parents or anything but man we needed this show! I find myself upset after the new one that I have to wait a whole week!",/review/rw6139866/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2020,cmurphy-25508,10," Hilarious
","Not only is it hilarious but he's actually a great rapper and not just on the show but in real life. If you watch the two episodes that are currently available I highly recommend YouTubing his music. The song earth is not that funny and is sub par even though there are 30 singer/rappers on it it. However don't let that detour you. It's a great show and he's a great rapper, definitely more satirical then literal, I hope he comes out with a couple songs that are a little less comedic but either way, I've said it once and I'll say it again great rapper and great comedian. If you like comedy watch this show, if you like rap, watch this show. If you run out of good tv watch this show! I'm kind of mad there wasn't a complete season when I started watching this! I would binge watch the frick out of this bananas bullshish.",/review/rw6139866/?ref_=tt_urv

",A series that doesn't hold back the realities of what it's like to reach stardom as a rapper.,/review/rw6139866/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2021,x-35474,8," The second season isn't that bad
","Yes, the second season had a bad start. But it progressively got better. Not as good as season 1 mind you, but it gets better. Season 2 is more of a drama, than a comedy.",/review/rw6139866/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2021,shaunmcevoy-98833,9," Hi I'm Dave
","Where's this absolute gem been hiding? A show about and starring Lil Dicky I was onboard from minute 1, he's a hilarious rapper. This is truly a great show that had me in stitches and with some really touching scenes too, I can't recommend this enough it's honestly a superb tv show and I can't wait for season 2. I think other than Dave the best character is Gata that guy is so funny and in the episode about his Bi polar is acting goes to another level completely, what an incredible performance.",/review/rw6139866/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2021,briangoins-59472,10," Stop the hate
","All of these negative reviews are misleading, yes season was 1 was better and it's hard to follow that up but this season is about Dave going through a writers block a sort of depression because the might not say it but he does miss Ally which is the most reason he can't write. This season has been more emotional and doesn't have the same laughs but is just as good.",/review/rw6139866/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2021,kpetow-94005,4," What happened?!?!
",Season 1 was AMAZING! I was sooo excited for season 2 but what happened? It's no longer funny and is more uncomfortable than anything. When I watched episode 1 of season 2 I thought ok maybe they are just seeing up the story line but by episode 3 I was to disgusted to finish. I how it turns around and goes back to how season 1 was.,/review/rw6139866/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2020,tevernaugh-76446,9," HILARIOUS AND NEW
",This show is hilarious and raunchy!! A lot of shows try to be raunchy but just end up doing stupid atuff that's been done a million times. This show has a new level of raunchy hilarity! I dig it!,/review/rw6139866/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2020,Tvwatcherallthetime,10," Hi I'm Dave
","""Hi, I'm Dave"". I couldn't quit going around saying this. This show is hilarious. Music is really good. I wasn't expecting him to be a good rapper and a comedian. Con: the show should really be an hour long.",/review/rw6139866/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2021,collectorofsorts,5," Season 1 was Hilarious! Season 2, Not so much.
",What happened here? Did the show get new writers? Season 1 was awesome. I haven't laughed so much from this type of show in ages. Then season 2 got here and it's pretty stupid. How did they get Kareem to sign on for this drivel?,/review/rw6139866/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2021,wivavog,1," 2nd Season is sinking.
",Its looking like the pressure. Got to them. Season 1 was great. Literally every episode is good. The second season has been garbage. But I suppose its been consistent. 4 episodes and not one. That feels like season 1. Not one episode thats funny. Almost half over with the season. I cant believe theyve done such a horrid job. Like having a X nomination. Then year 2 you dont even register to exist. The writing has been awful. The subjects have been awful. Everything good about Dave. Has been stripped away. To a terrible show. This show should just be named alley. Which honestly was the only weak spot. IMO from season one. Thought season 2 was going to be amazing. Mainy hope they get it together. I really liked this show. Even Els is suddenly a jerk 24/7 now. Went from a tight team. To every man for them selves. Hate the new premise. Actively ruining it!,/review/rw6139866/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2021,chiguy17,1," Complete dreck!!!!
","Shouldn't there be someone likable in the cast? Especially the main character? Instead it's some hack, dork loser whom I'd be surprised if even his own parents liked him. There's literally NOTHING likable about him or the train wreck of this artistically bankrupt excuse for a show.",/review/rw6139866/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2020,austinhord79,10," ""Curb"" for a new generation
","The first two episodes available delivered the satisfying humor reminiscent of Seinfeld and Curb. Dicky has not only shown off his impressive acting range this far, but also his clever and hard-hitting bars all add to a fun and edgy comedy.",/review/rw6139866/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2021,chiguy17,1," AWFUL!
",I can't believe the shows FX/FXX is willing to produce and air. This is just absolute ridiculous tripe with NO likable characters at all. Aren't you supposed to root for the protagonist? Not wish him dead?,/review/rw6139866/?ref_=tt_urv

8 August 2020,RandomTard,2," This is just embarrassing
","I don't know what to say. The show is just difficult to watch because it's trying way too hard and failing even harder. It just makes me feel dirty and embarrassed for the people that made it. Not funny, not good.",/review/rw6139866/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2020,jester2055-113-954586,7," If you like Lil Dicky, you'll like this show
