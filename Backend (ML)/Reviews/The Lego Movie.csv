31 January 2001,d_fienberg,," Captures the Dark Comedy and Lyric Poetry of the Book
","I'm uncertain why the daughter of a Hollywood icon would select as her first director effort a nearly unfilmable book of linguistic time bombs and nearly unspeakable tragedy. Jeffrey Eugenides's book The Virgin Suicides is one of the underappreciated gems of the 1990s and surely Sophia Coppola must have known that the critics would have it out for anything she did (see reviews listed under ""acting: Part 3, The Godfather""). So Coppola, daughter of Francis Ford, decided to do something unexpected: She made a gem of a movie that's easy to like and complex enough to savour.",/review/rw1004991/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2011,PippinInOz,7," A group of men remember five teenage girls from their youth.
","I watched this film on video not too long after it was first released. Remember being a bit underwhelmed to be honest. However, after watching it again yesterday have changed my mind considerably. This is because this time I watched it with a different approach. The best way to describe this film (and recommend it hopefully) is probably to ask some questions which played on my mind for quite a while afterwards. These are only my interpretations, but here we go:",/review/rw1004991/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2005,Boba_Fett1138,6," A well crafted movie but the storytelling is lacking.
","""The Virgin Suicides"" is a sort of mixed bag. It's a beautiful made movie with wonderful directed sequences in it but the storytelling doesn't always makes sense and is simply terrible lacking at times. A case of 'style over substance' you can perhaps conclude.",/review/rw1004991/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2001,moonspinner55,7," ""How much can you write about dead trees?""
","A strange, surreal flight-of-fancy of death and love, remembrance and how romanticized our memories become. It's also very funny, tending to mix the black comedy of something like ""Heathers"" with the stifling suburban scenario of ""American Beauty"" (but it's better than both). Kirsten Dunst is fantastic as the foxiest of five golden-toned sisters in the mid-'70s who feel trapped by their parents (a peculiar, but not overly monstrous couple), trapped by their feelings, trapped by time. They can breathe--and live freely--only in their fantasies (and perhaps in death), but do their realities represent a prison? It's the talent of writer-director Sofia Coppola not to push everything over-the-top; she's careful, she leaves the viewer contemplating the characters' motivations and actions. The situation is indeed unexplainable, yet it is in our nature to expect a resolution, to expect concrete evidence as to WHY and demand an answer. Yet there are no answers to the sadness of the strangers who live across the street, even as we pass through their lives and through their houses. ""The Virgin Suicides"" offers fascinating food for thought. *** from ****",/review/rw1004991/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2015,SnoopyStyle,6," ethereal haunted teenage dream
","25 years ago in an affluent Detroit suburb, math teacher Ronald Lisbon (James Woods) and his wife (Kathleen Turner) have five beautiful girls. The neighborhood boys led by Tim Winer are all fascinated by them. The youngest Cecilia (Hanna Hall) tries to kill herself. Psychiatrist Dr. Horniker (Danny DeVito) tells the strict parents to let the girls interact with boys. They throw a party for the girls but Cecilia throws herself out the window impaling on the iron fence spikes. Father Moody (Scott Glenn) tries to comfort the family. Cecilia haunts everybody. Lux Lisbon (Kirsten Dunst) is the most outgoing and catches the eye of hunky Trip Fontaine (Josh Hartnett). Lux and the sisters Mary (A.J. Cook), Therese (Leslie Hayman) and Bonnie (Chelse Swain) would always hang out together. After a night out, the girls are kept inside with little outside contact.",/review/rw1004991/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2001,cinemaisdope,9," A depressing movie that is beautiful and timeless
","As far as really really good movies I've had the fortune of seeing recently the one that really stands out is a overlooked movie that came out last year called ""The Virgin Suicides."" The movie while one of the more depressing movies in recent memories is just brilliantly directed by first time director Sofia Coppola (it was also her first screenplay - quite impressive indeed). I thought you know going into this movie A) I'm a guy and B) depressing movies just sometimes make it really really tough for me to like the movie they have those endings where its like you emotionally feel like you have just fallen off a cliff... yet despite A) and B) I was very moved by this movie... the directing, cinematography, acting, music - all work extremely well hand in hand complementing each other. This movie will make you even more so want to enjoy every second and moment with those rare & special people you meet on the roads of life.",/review/rw1004991/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2006,Lady_Targaryen,6," First movie made by Sofia Coppola
","I expected more from ''The Virgin Suicides''. This movie is told to be so good and even having a big name as Sofia Coppola helped me to have a big interest in watching it. But I found it a little bit boring, and also without a purpose: Okay, the girls committed suicide because they hated the life they were having with their horrible mother (Kathleen Turner) and called the boys because they wanted them to be witnesses of their suicide. And? I really lacked some reality in this movie. Not only from the parent's isolation from the world(come on,any teenager I know would try to escape from that horrible parents,me included) but some scenes after the Lisbon's girls died are so out of place, like the party where people uses gas masks.",/review/rw1004991/?ref_=tt_urv

","In 1974, in Michigan, the lives of a group of teenage boys are affected by the suicide of five girls from the Lisbon family. Cecilia (13) (Hanna Hall), Lux (14) (Kirsten Dunst), Bonnie (15) (Chelse Swain), Mary (16) (A.J. Cook) and Therese (17) (Leslie Hayman) move with their Mathematics teacher father Mr. Lisbon (James Wood) and their possessive housewife mother Mrs. Lisbon (Kathleen Turner) to a calm suburb house. Their beauties attract the attention of a group of boys that meet in the house on the other side to watch the girls. When Cecilia commits suicide, the girls stay at home for a period, returning to school later. When the handsome football player Trip Fontaine (Josh Hartnett) seduces Lux and spends the night outside with her, Mrs. Lisbon locks the girls at home, leading them to commit massive suicide.",/review/rw1004991/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2001,kgx311,," Dreamy, poignant, captivating...a must-see!
","The Virgin Suicides. Just the name may scare away viewers from this film. But if you are a fan of the 1993 novel, you will appreciate the way this vivid portrayal captures the spirit of love, life, and death. The story begins with an introduction to the Lisbon family. Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon gave birth to five daughters: Cecile, Lux, Mary, Bonnie, and Therese, all ranging in ages from thirteen to seventeen. Following a suicide attempt from Cecile, her parents and sisters struggle to give her what they think she lacked before; love, attention, admiration. But somewhere along the way, Cecilia grew lost and constantly withdrew from many situations. One tragic night at a Lisbon party, Cecilia succeeds at committing suicide. What follows is a bittersweet experience in the girl's lives. The story is narrated by the neighborhood boys, who lust after the girls, collecting everything they can of theirs and holding meetings just to talk about the wonders of their forbidden fruit. After strict Mrs. Lisbon shuts the house in maximum security isolation, the girl's only contact with the outside world is through these boys. This poignant, beautiful drama, written and directed by newcomer Sofia Coppola, captures the smooth lifestyles of mid 1970s suburbia, along with the beauty and angst of teenage life. It shows us how deeply through the heart emotions can run, and how to get in touch with them. Kirsten Dunst, the beautiful and talented young actress that portrays the most rebellious of the sisters, is stunning and provacative. Her best work yet.",/review/rw1004991/?ref_=tt_urv

21 September 2005,Asa_Nisi_Masa2,5," Well-packaged, unobtrusive, tastefully done and... without substance
","Sofia Coppola's film is not unlike the music provided by Air for its soundtrack: nice, but a little bit hollow. All in all, I would say I enjoyed this film, just like all in all, I enjoy Air's music when someone puts on one of their CDs during a dinner party (Air is a favourite of many people who have dinner parties that I know). Air's music is immaculately packaged, unobtrusive, tasteful and on the whole, unobjectionable. Coppola's film is exactly the same. Liking Air and liking The Virgin Suicides is, if not a complete, absolute and irrefutable sign of having good taste, at least not a sign of having bad taste, that's for sure. But what exactly was this film about? The meaninglessness, hypocrisy and hollowness of suburbia and ""respectable"", bourgeois society (a favourite target for many artists). The voyeuristic nature of the media (another popular one). The spontaneity and genuineness of the young (epitomised by Cecilia, the youngest sister in the film), a spontaneity etc which is killed off and sucked dry by the stifling, unwritten rules of respectable, middle-class, white American society. The slow but steady death of nature at the hands of the human race. Yadda yadda. Can I object to any of these themes? No, of course I can't. They're all worthy themes and the film was nowhere near preachy about any of them. Credit to Coppola for that. As I said, this film is very tastefully done. I'm not sure though: The Virgin Suicides could be about some if not all of these things and more besides, yet it remains soft in focus, ""airy"" (not just in the soundtrack) and somehow, void of substance. Yet I cannot say I wasn't enjoying it as I was watching it, just as I cannot say I haven't enjoyed listening to Air playing in the background at a dinner party. But the enjoyment was never more than skin-deep. And to be honest, though I've been left with nothing negative from this film and the fashionable French band's music, I've also not been left with anything positive either - nothing that lasts, nothing to keep. This is all just... an unobjectionable lack of real substance with a very clever, unobjectionable appearance of substance. All very tastefully done, of course. 5/10",/review/rw1004991/?ref_=tt_urv

25 September 2007,Knewsense78,3," I wasted an hour and a half of my life!!!
","I can't believe it, that I actually sat through this crappy film, constantly hitting display on the good ol' DVD remote to see how much longer was left. And, while the movie only runs 97 minutes (including credits), it sure felt like an eternity!!! Hanna Hall plays Cecilia Lisbon, the youngest of the five Lisbon daughters, and is the first to off herself, even though it takes a second attempt before she succeeds, mind you. At first she tries in the tub with a razor, but that doesn't work. She goes to see a shrink (Danny Devito) who tells her parents (James Woods and Kathleen Turner, who seems to be lost in this role) that he thinks Cecilia just did it for attention. The parents decide to have a little get together for the girls in their basement and invite some of the neighborhood boys over. Cecilia doesn't seem like she is having fun so she excuses herself and makes her way upstairs. A little while later, a noise is heard and Mrs. Lisbon (Kathleen Turner) and the rest of her daughters and the boys make their way upstairs and out the front door, where Mr. Lisbon (James Woods) is holding Cecilia, who is draped over a fence, the spike in her back. She jumped out of the bedroom window and succeeded in offing herself this time. I found the acting by Kathleen Turner in this part to be just down right pathetic.",/review/rw1004991/?ref_=tt_urv

16 May 2001,MarshallStax,1," Just like adolescence...
","...this movie is awkward and interminable! An absolutely pretentious piece of twaddle defined by both a lack of focus and a failure to present believable characters, ""The Virgin Suicides"" is ample proof (if any was needed) that nepotism will get you everywhere in show business. This film suffers from a lack of point-of-view (I dare you to define who the protagonist really is) and, even more importantly, a lack of point! We are never made to care one whit for the lives (or deaths) of the Lisbon sisters, nor are we shown any traits that make us interested in the creepily voyeuristic boys who adore them for no ascertainable reason. From the pretentious voice-overs to the first-year film school blocking of scenes, this is an amazing waste of time and resources. ""The Virgin Suicides"" must certainly be in the running for worst film ever made. And Sophia Coppola, already reviled as an actress, has proved she can't direct, either. See ""Lost in Translation"", a nausea inducing movie about a crybaby child of privilege meeting a washed up actor with no amount of charm at all, for further reference.",/review/rw1004991/?ref_=tt_urv

17 September 2004,The_Void,3," Not a good film by any means
","The Virgin Suicides tries to be a lot of things: a haunting mystery, a coming of age tale, a character study and a story of the lengths that parents will go to protect their children. Although the film is all of these things; it doesn't do a single one of them well, and I therefore get the overall impression that whoever wrote the screenplay doesn't really know what they're doing. The fact that it was written by Sofia Coppola, makes a lot of sense. Many moments in the film are excruciating, either for being incredibly dull or just for being extremely corny. The parts that see the boys recount their 'relationship' with the girls is terrible; some of their lines are repulsive and I could do nothing but roll my eyes. This whole plot involving the boys came off as being undercooked all the way through; from what we saw of the two groups together, it would seem that they hardly knew each other. So why would a group of boys obsess over a group of girls that they hardly know? I don't care if Kirsten Dunst is one of them; just no.",/review/rw1004991/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2000,rowe-4,1," Boring and ineffective
","I found this film boring and ineffective- Sophia, I wanted to like it, but it left me with little to chew on.  It seemed as though everything had been thrown together with little thought of making it cohesive. There was potential for depth but it was never reached. You can be subtle and still give some clues (see _The Graduate_).  Supposedly it's true to the book, but maybe this was a time to take some liberties with the original story, and/or be creative with the script.  Neither gender was well represented either. The music was good; buy the soundtrack but skip the film.",/review/rw1004991/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2012,ratcat0,1," Tripe
","Seems as If Mr Coppola gave a few of his relatives a go at making a movie in the hope that they may follow in his or his nephews footsteps but unfortunately thats not the case. As well as Sofia there is another Coppola apart from Francis himself in the credits Purposefully boring with a couple of moments, The use of Hearts music gave this garbage even more reason to want to rip the DVD out of the drive and fling it like a Frisbee. Hearts' music is meant for radio and same can be said for such tunes from ELO and 10CC. There seemed to be no substance to this movie. If you hadn't read the book you would be wondering when something - anything was going to happen,. then the final scene where the girls committed suicide and that had no dramatic effect either. look at the scene from ""Girl Interrupted"" when that girl hung herself in her apartment... that was drama and heart wrenching. This was just Mogadon material. No wonder I picked it up at the bargain basement shop for $5.00. Don't waste your time.",/review/rw1004991/?ref_=tt_urv

23 January 2005,sara_o1,9," Sofia Coppola is a genius
","I've searched for this movie more than two years, cause I've read the book and I do love it. It's one of the most beautiful stories about teenagers that had ever been written. The suicides of these five beautiful girls aren't to be taken seriously, it's a metaphor the author uses. He wants so write about the strange and often really terrible feelings teenagers have. And Sofia Coppola created an atmosphere I can't describe. Just as a light wind on a hot summer day, if you know what I mean. She's really one of the greatest young directors (especially female) of our time. ""Lost in Translation"" is a masterpiece as well. The actors were good, Kirsten Dunst is such a great actress, she should do more movies like ""The Virgin Suicides"", where she really has to act. Josh Harnett is wonderful as Trip and the girls who play Therese, Mary, Bonnie and Cecilia, are great discoveries. If you like films with depth, films you have to think about, this one here is remarkable for you.
