29 June 2022,thejdrage,9," Came for Jeremy Allen White and the rest were also at his level
","To say this is an intense series is an understatement. Comedy - not so much, but just enough.",/review/rw8270367/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2022,cscott2331,10," I came for Lip. I stayed for the family.
","This show was great. It is NOT and I repeat not a comedy. Unless people like laughing at screaming, stressed out, sad, overworked chefs and restaurant workers. A few times I wanted to kill cousin, he was just off the rails and making decisions like a toddler then I realized he's sad, sad with things that have happened, his fractured family and generally with his life. He grew on me.",/review/rw8270367/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2022,midtownwarriors,8," Beautiful television
","Great acting, writing, direction. Shots and scenes are artful and not pretentious, soundtrack choice is excellent. Having worked in a kitchen and a fan of cooking/food shows, Bourdain, this is well conceived masterpiece.",/review/rw8270367/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2022,redproton88,10," If you can't take the heat
","Get out of the kitchen. This show is so spot on about how real kitchens function. Having worked in several high end and lower end restaurants. I can tell you this is the real deal. For all those low star reviewers, you just don't get it. This is not a glitzy Hollywood romanticized fantasy. Great acting, accurate terminology and technique. Absolutely love it! Hope there will be more.",/review/rw8270367/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2022,christophersarles,9," Outstanding! I didn't give it 10 because episodes are too short.
","Yes, it's NOT a comedy BIG DEAL! So tired of people who think ""oh that guy was in a comedy so this MUST be funny"" grow up! This is sometimes amusing sometimes sad but the cast and characters are VERY intriguing and multi layered.",/review/rw8270367/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2022,UniqueParticle,10," Masterful
","All cast is incredible especially Jeremy Alan White, the directing is exceptional, and the soundtrack is great! There's a lot of intensity I don't know how they do it so well, I wouldn't cause I have autism I'd be panicking. I like how IMDB classify's The Bear as a drama which is very true but it's also a comedy. Should've been part of the Emmy nominations maybe next go time, has some of the best acting! Very lovable all around.",/review/rw8270367/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2023,gallagherkellie,9," So damn good
",Holy cow this show is brilliant!,/review/rw8270367/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2022,amyruggles-54721,9," Dramedy not comedy
",I am really enjoying this show. I've made it through six episodes and the character development is great. I am already rooting for so many of the characters. It's turning into a real feel-good show. The casting and acting are great. I love the writing and the setting/cinematography are as realistic as it can get. With so many choices out there I find it oddly difficult to find shows that I truly enjoy. But this is one of them.,/review/rw8270367/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2022,mooveephantom,9," Phenomenal TV. Jeremy A. W. Broke my heart
","Although the entire cast is stellar, Jeremy Allen White Is the absolute super star of the show. His portrayal is so real, heartfelt, nuanced, and heartbreaking. His character is trying his best, A lot of the times failing, but also a lot of times winning. Very sympathetic portrayal. As someone who used to work in the restaurant industry, and still has family and friends working in professional kitchens, The material definitely hits close to home. Although there is many great comedic moments in the show and moments of funny awkwardness, this show is definitely an intense drama. There is so many things to unpack. But I think most people can enjoy this show due to the excellent writing, directing and acting. Even if you've never worked in the service industry before, we have all eaten out at restaurants and you know how crazy you can be. You will get it. The show does not relent. Each episode continues to get more and more intense. And The payoffs are excellent. Whether you love the characters or hate them, You really want to know what's going to happen with these people. Top tier TV. Highly recommend.",/review/rw8270367/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2023,DiCaprioFan13,8," Lives up to all the hype!
","The Bear absolutely lives up to all the hype that it's been getting. Normally this isn't a show that would interest me but after reading all the great reviews and seeing how it's on every ""best show of the year"" list I've seen so far I thought I'd give it go. This not only met my expectations but surpassed them in every way. This has been nominated for every award possible and deservingly so. I'm especially glad for Jeremy Allen White since I'm a big Shameless fan. He was fantastic in this and leads a great cast. I couldn't stop watching this, I binged the entire first season over the weekend and was disappointed when it was over. Glad to hear it was already renewed as I'm already looking forward to next season.",/review/rw8270367/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2022,Supermanfan-13,8," Great!
","The Bear is just as good as all these reviews are saying it is. I wasn't sure what to expect and the plot sounds like it might be kind of boring but it was anything but. It's an exciting, behind the scenes look at a demanding restaurant business in Chicago. The show will grab you and pull you in until the next thing you know you binged the entire season. I liked Jeremy Allen White (Lip) from Shameless and after reading all the great reviews I thought I'd give it a chance. I'm glad I did. It's just an extremely well written dramedy and the acting is so that they will really make you root for these characters to succeed. This is a show that will keep you entertained throughout each episode. I hope to see future seasons!",/review/rw8270367/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2022,caspian1978,8," Visual Anxiety
","The Bear is the best! At times funny and at most surreal and scary to anyone who has worked in a kitchen, the Bear is true visual anxiety with its fast paced and chaotic filming style. Jeremy Allen White
and Ebon Moss-Bachrach both are brilliant in their performances. The story is compelling and is equal to the believability of the cast. The Bear offers its audience multiple reasons to watch. Season 1 keeps the audience hungry for more.",/review/rw8270367/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2023,giguerm,9," Dustin Hoffman vibe
","I have never watched Shameless so I'm discovering Jeremy Allen White. I am in awe. I haven't seen that true vibe since early Dustin Hoffman (Kramer vs Kramer). The show is so raw and believable that you feel like a voyeur looking in a neighborhood restaurant and its staff. Just a slice of real life, delivered by a wonderful ensemble. I was late to the party but I'm happy I finally joined in. It's a gem, a breath of fresh air in this era of big budget series or predictable cop shows. And the chaotic environment is spot on. Having friends in the restaurant business, the chaos is real.",/review/rw8270367/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2022,othersidebar,8," Lip Goes to Culinary School
","Playing virtually the same character he played on Shameless, Jeremy White (Lip in Shameless) continues in a somewhat tatted and physically and emotionally scarred role but this time replacing substance abuse with culinary school. An amazing actor, but will he ever break out of the Chicago kid role? That remains to be seen.",/review/rw8270367/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2022,lmajka,9," Please tell me there's another season!
","I absolutely loved this show! From the first episode to the last, I was engaged the entire time. I was disappointed when it was over. I hope there will be another season with longer episodes and more episodes. Would love a deeper dive on some of the other characters too.",/review/rw8270367/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2022,kensaiamg,10," 8.5 is too low for this show.
","I came into this with zero expectations. As a matter of fact the first scene with the bear threw me off. I'm thinking to myself ""oh great, this is gonna be another one of those pretentious art pieces I don't have time for this"" but the good reviews had me stick it out and oh I am so glad I did. Not a fan of shameless. Don't really know who these actors are but Oliver Platt has a terrific track record. Didn't matter, by the time he showed up on screen I was already hooked. Easy 10 out of 10. Better give us a second season.",/review/rw8270367/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2022,katewalsh83,10," Intense but SO very goid
","This show was a little jarring at first - extremely chaotic but also incredibly authentic; they really nailed the controlled chaos that is restaurant life. The stress, the feeling of being in the weeds, the excitement - it's palpable. I've been a fan of Jeremy Allen White since Shameless (as I'm sure many others have been as well) and he nails the character of Carmy, our troubled protagonist. To find that he attended cooking school prior to the show only makes me respect him more, and his schooling definitely shows! The storyline is heartbreaking but relatable (in one way or another) and each episode just got better and better. 10/10, PLEASE bring this back for another season!!",/review/rw8270367/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2022,dpoland-76589,9," Wow. Intense but with heart
",What a great show. I want a second season but the show's impact might be ruined with more of the good stuff. Ayo who plays Syd was the breakout star but all casting fantastic.,/review/rw8270367/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2022,jamesheniff,9," Realistic Drama
","I've worked in a family owned restaurant in Chicago for decades. The intensity among family members and the dialog between workers is extremely realistic. All the characters in this series have depth which makes it believable. This show has no ""caricatures"" or ""cartoon-like"" people for comic relief. Excellent show!",/review/rw8270367/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2022,jordanjtoohey,10," I would like a season 2.... Now.
","This is the first review I have ever written on IMDB. THAT is how impactful this show was on me. I completely forgot I was watching actors perform, and genuinely felt as though I was watching real people go through real life drama, and comedy. Jeremy Allen White (Carmy) and Ayo Edebiri (Sydney) were spectacular. Don't get me wrong, the entire cast was phenomenal, but those two had me GLUED to the screen. I finished this entire show in one day, and I regret nothing. This series draws you in with an opening reminiscent of the movie ""Waiting,"" and after introducing heavy topics like suicide, addiction, alcoholism, familial stressors, battles with coworkers, trauma, and an overall feeling of existential dread, the series ends, and you just sit there and say, ""Wow."" I am SO happy I found this show. I'm going to tell everyone I see to watch this. Everyone needs to watch this. HARD 10/10.",/review/rw8270367/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2023,quaseprovisorio,8," very solid show
","The show puts you in the action immediately. You first see the screaming which is going to be part of this whole thing, the frantic and quick and stressful and, as the show goes, you kinda realize the characters are better and more dense than what you thought in the first place.",/review/rw8270367/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2022,briantsimonson-78218,9," everyone complaining about too much yelling would never last in a kitchen
","Most accurate representation of working in a kitchen i've seen in a tv show so far. The only beef i had was the main dude never wearing head covering, and you never see anyone washing their hands. The sous chef character sydney is more or less spot on. Also i get they are not trying to glorify excessive drinking because of the alcoholism backstory, but to not show then getting drinks once after work to decompress and complain about the shift is kinda weird and a big part of the culture for better or worse.",/review/rw8270367/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2022,spritals,10," The humanity is so Spot on!
","This is one of the richest, well developed stories of people. Given a high stress environment which we all know of as Life, how we all pick our ways through. Life is hard, unpredictable, complicated and messy. Our action and reactions make it brilliant, painful and exciting. Food is every humans center. And this show highlights the work it takes as individual people, with individual opinions, ideas and experiences to work together. Such a refreshing view of people, with all their layers, creating something so amazing!",/review/rw8270367/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2022,mywakinglife01,9," Im so glad I stuck with it
",I was going to bail on this show after the first couple of episodes as it seemed disjointed and chaotic. I'm so glad I didn't. It is chaotic but it's also honest and sweet. It's about grief and redemption. The family that you have and the family you make. So much more than just people yelling at each other in a kitchen like a lot of these reviews seem to allude. The ending is part sad yet immensely hopeful. The soundtrack is fantastic. The acting impeccable. I found myself having a strong emotional reaction at the last episode. It was a fantastic first season and I'm so glad it's already been renewed for season 2.,/review/rw8270367/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2022,williammillerc,10," I cannot say the words I want to
","My review would start out with a grand string of expletives, this show is on fire, literally. PTSD all the way. The scenes in the kitchen bring you right there to ""heard"", ""yes, chef"", ""hands"", ""pass"" with an insane intensity. If you've done it you know. The camera work is brilliant, never watched a lot of ""shameless"" because booze is a bit triggering. But this show is next level writing, acting, direction, cinematography etc, Shows that come out of the gate with the needle bouncing off the red line often crash but this one careens through personal trauma, despair, family dysfunction, and panic attacks with deft grace, I was watching on Hulu and wanted to bash the television when an ad appeared because it broke the scene. Are we going to leave hot food in the pass while someone tries to sell me insurance? Someone run this food! No. Words.",/review/rw8270367/?ref_=tt_urv
