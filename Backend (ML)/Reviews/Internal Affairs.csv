15 May 2021,ukproject,9," I Had To Abandon My Policy On Watching Cancelled TV Series - Colony is a Brilliant Show
",I absolutely hate watching mid story cancelled shows.,/review/rw4158451/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2020,Nemesis42,8," Why can't series producers behave honourably?
","Series three finished with a cliffhanger and no ending. Why the heck can't these production houses plan things better. I get it, ratings go down a bit, ditch the show.
Well in that case, plan and write the series so that the actual ending is at the end of series three without the need for a fourth series. Bloody dishonourable morons. Art and business don't mix so well. I want to know what happened !",/review/rw4158451/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2017,urthpainter,9," great writing, casting & acting...
",Can take you a long ways!,/review/rw4158451/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2016,steefan-92,9," This show is underrated and under-appreciated
","Title says it all and this got me scratching my head and asking myself, what the heck people want anymore. When I take a look at shows like The Shannara Chronicles (which I finished and don't even ask me why I had do so). with higher ranking, while show had lower production quality or most recent The 100 season, I don't think audience really knows itself.",/review/rw4158451/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2018,Lcarroll42,10," USA NETWORK IS AWFUL
","Colony was one of the top 2-3 shows on USA, and not only did they cancel this great show, but they allowed the show to end without ANY storyline completion. USA Network is a bunch of morons for canceling Colony.",/review/rw4158451/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2018,dissanctus,9," Intriguing, gutsy dystopian mystery
","I don't often write reviews, leaving this to more learned critics, but I just had to mention what a successful mix this is of drama and sci-fi thriller. The actors all do excellently, and the show benefits greatly from letting your imagination paint a worse picture due to what you don't see. 
There are ominous echoes of our own history here and there, as the occupying forces are rarely shown, but their power is obvious, especially given the traitorous collaboration of the government.
This show really keeps me looking forward to more of the unraveling mystery; what is the true intention of these mysterious invaders?
There are some gritty characters that work well and one feels for the family. The effects are few but shockingly effective.
All throughout the series manages to maintain a tense paranoid atmosphere which never allows you to relax.
I think it's a really good example of sci-fi TV and hope it continues until completion unlike so many promising shows today.",/review/rw4158451/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2021,MidoriAi,10," I NEED SEASON 4
",You can't let that ending like this!!,/review/rw4158451/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2018,arthurcooper,10," Yes, it starts as kind of a cop show. But it gets much better
","Yeah, this is TV without a game of thrones budget, so every single episode isn't packed with crazy sci-fi set pieces. Yeah, it does start off the first season with some slightly aggravating characters, and yeah, the first couple episodes do feel a little TOO much like some serialized cop show you've seen before. And, yes, you don't see aliens -- at first. But there's a lot more in store. If you give this show a shot, it goes in some in some very different directions, with some unexpected twists and great action. Also this is definitely NOT one of those shows where they do not want to move the main plot forward. Things change in very interesting ways and the characters get a lot more real. By season 3, this is nothing even close to a cop show.",/review/rw4158451/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2018,tranat71,10," Definitely don't just go by the Ratings. Read the user reviews. Then watch.
","Normally, there are just too many great shows to be watching shows rated ""7.3"".",/review/rw4158451/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2021,Lebowskidoo,8," Intellectual Science Fiction
","Colony is some pretty high.brow sci-fi for TV. Maybe it was a little too much so for most viewers. It veers from being evasive and mysterious to laying all its cards on the table to finally hitting a good groove in season three...only to be mercilessly cancelled without a satisfying conclusion. Reading what they had planned for seasons four and five is a real bummer, knowing we'll never see the war in space.",/review/rw4158451/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2018,courtneyknicely,10," Please Renew This Show!!
",Please please please bring this show back!! I was always on the edge of my seat. And to end it right when the war was finally starting!! It's all built up to this moment. Please at least give us closure. The Colony was a tremendous show. Please bring it back!!,/review/rw4158451/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2017,fabz,7," Gets better as the story progresses
","Colony has a fairly original premise. The characters are at times a bit hard to stomach, but overall it's a pleasant watching experience. I found it well worth sitting through an at times annoying first season just to get through to season 2, which is much more interesting. The character development in season 2 has been quite impressive and they are now much more acceptable heroes and anti-heroes. Worth watching.",/review/rw4158451/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2019,einarvasvik,10," What a shame!
","The cancelation of this show makes as much sense as the USA in general. Some fat, lazy a$$ decided it wasn´t worth continuing. Well, just as you are wrong in everything else måddafåkkas - you were wrong canceling this.",/review/rw4158451/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2019,sumerahmet-95326,10," Both sci fi and realistic
","This series doesn't only include sci fi but also it deals with human relations like what a family can do to protect itself or what sacrifices a human can make. There is both action and emotion in it. Unfortunately, This is an unfinished story. I hope there will be new episodes.",/review/rw4158451/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2022,tchitouniaram,6," Not bad...
","Probably would rate it a bit higher if not for the unfinished last season...Really unfair to people...Anyway, reasonable time killer, if nothing left to watch...",/review/rw4158451/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2019,Prophetik,8," I hope Netflix picks this back up it was pretty good
","Right when it starts to get super good you wanna cancel it ? Yeah it starts off slow and you're wondering if it's just another political show but it's not it's so much more they built momentum from season 1 to present it's very sad it was cancelled, i just got done watching it on netflix and thought it was amazing, i wanna know what happens next!",/review/rw4158451/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2018,Darren2589,7," Cancelled after three seasons.
","I'm so disappointed that they have cancelled the series at the end of season 3. We were just starting to get a grip of what was actually going on and it was about to kick off with the war. 
I can only imagine that this was going to sap the budget on SFX so they decided to can it. ",/review/rw4158451/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2018,rsvp321,," Hollywood continues swirling the toilet.
","Once again, an outstanding series gets cancelled because it doesn't make social issues, political messages, and pc, as the centre of each episode. All they offered was good sci fi and entertainment lol",/review/rw4158451/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2017,Rob_Taylor,6," Let's play....tick the TV script boxes!
","Yes folks! Sit down and let's check off the sins of this particular, by-the-numbers show.",/review/rw4158451/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2019,My-Two-Cent,9," Why was this cancelled?
","I don't understand why this show was cancelled because it progressively got better and better with each new episode and it's upsetting that Netflix picked up such a good unfinished show that in one more episode I'll be left wondering what would've/could've happened..
It'd be really cool if the creators of Colony could go the Deadwood route and at least give it a graceful exit with a made for TV movie..",/review/rw4158451/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2018,claudew-72515,10," Loved this series
",What a bunch of morons to cancel this series without some kind of ending. Will NEVER start a series again by USA,/review/rw4158451/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2020,marneederider,9," Too close to home
","One of the best science fiction TV shows I've ever seen. However, I just can't keep watching it, because it is too close to home regarding what is happening in the US.",/review/rw4158451/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2018,WatchAndSmile,1," 1/10. Please read why
","We watch the show and want to know the end.
The show was canceled the creators did not even bothered to create an ending for the show, abruptly ending it. That's just wrong and direspectful to the viewers who for 3 years wanted to find out what happened/what will happen.
They had plenty of time to do so but decided to just cancel it. Ouch!

15 March 2020,danieldwilkinson,10," Better as it went on!
","Gonna be honest I wasnt feeling this one at first, but the moment it turned out that Broussard was one of the ""red hats"" I got hooked! Since I'm all about the resistance in shows like this he became my favorite character, he was such a bad ass!. Will eventually became a bad ass as well.
As for the ending....I recall not being too satisfied with it.",/review/rw4158451/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2018,mmevanille-53097,9," Its slowly becoming of the better SciFi on Television
","I started watching Colony when it first was aired and thought it was good then, albeit a little slow moving in the first series and previously rated it a 7. Since then the writers have really jumped on the concept and brought more life to it, and is becoming one of the better SciFi shows on tv at the moment ( Perhaps only trailing The Expanse which is only one of two shows airing right now which I gave a 10 to). 
The story has complexity to it at a perfect balance. You have enough Scifi stuff to keep the nerds at bay, and being Alien technology you can get away with not having to explain too much Science stuff, but it also has interpersonal relationships which are realistic and interfamily dynamics, and would be liked even by those who generally dont like Scifi.
The cast has really gelled since the first series, Especially Bran, who I think has taken to his character really well. 
Highly Recommended. Hoping for a forth season already.",/review/rw4158451/?ref_=tt_urv
