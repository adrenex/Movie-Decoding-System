22 November 2003,Smells_Like_Cheese,7," The darker side of writing a script for a disaster movie
","Twister, one of the most successful movies of the 90's, mainly due to it's special effects and a lot of people's want for a natural disaster movie that is fun to watch, this was an extremely popular movie. I was only 11 when the movie was released and I was absolutely in love with it, in fact right after the movie was done, I wanted to become a storm chaser. That's how much I loved this movie; I grew up and forgot about the movie and decided on a new career. But I saw the DVD on sale and thought about how much I enjoyed the movie when I was younger, I'm sure it would be just as much fun to see it again. I have to say this wasn't as awesome as I remembered, in the theater it was like ""Oh, my God! Look at that flying cow! A house just flew across the road! That is so cool!"", now on my TV screen I was like ""Oh, wow, look at that cow. How the heck does a house fly across the road? Why isn't this as cool as I remembered it?"" Not to mention that the story wasn't as good as I remembered, granted I know that they had to fit in some kind of story with the whole plot of the twisters, but a lot of this movie is just plain unrealistic.",/review/rw5392232/?ref_=tt_urv

17 May 2022,mark.waltz,6," A big crowd pleading blockbuster hideous dinosaur of a fun bad movie.
","I'll watch this again when cows fly. Yes indeed, flying cows, idiot scientists chasing tornadoes down Oklahoma dirt roads, a lovable Auntie Em High character who had towels until she served everybody steak and eggs for breakfasts, an urban legend concerning a movie drive-in theater, a Contraption dentist shoved up a tornado's butt name Dorothy add a dog in the opening scene that looks like Toto. What more could you want in a summer blockbuster? Taco where they are very friendly with each other, but soon to be exposed beams vapid fiancee who is completely out of place in the midwest, and twin tornados that I'm surprised they didn't nickname Minneapolis and St. Paul. Oh, did I mention that they were flying cows?",/review/rw5392232/?ref_=tt_urv

7 April 2006,Workin_Man,7," I Have No Idea Why People Are Bashing This Movie
","Twister, in my opinion, is a really good action thriller. Personally, I don't know how people can bash this movie. I thought it was an amazing film!! The acting is great, the special effects are excellent, the action is intense, and this film actually has a great storyline to it. To me, a 5.9/10 rating for this film is atrocious. I think this film deserves so much better!! I was thinking of somewhere in between a 7 and an 8/10. But I have my opinion and other people have their own right?? I just find it hard to believe that people don't like this movie.",/review/rw5392232/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2008,movieguy81007,10," Fun Movie
","Twister is a fun movie to watch. I think Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt give excellent performances. This movie has a great soundtrack. I do not know why people hate this movie. This is one of Jan De Bont's best films. He also directed one of my other favorite movie Speed. Normally I think all of Van Halen's songs are trashy except for the songs for Twister. I like the sound and visual effects of this film. Not since The Wizard of Oz have I seen better tornadoes. The first time I saw this movie I was blown away. I actually like this better than Independence Day. I really like the end song ""Respect the Wind"" performed by Edward and Alex Van Halen. I wanna get the Twister Soundtrack.",/review/rw5392232/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2010,TheLittleSongbird,7," Twisted nostalgic fun!
","I like disaster movies when they are done right, and while Twister is no masterpiece it is a sort of guilty pleasure for me. I agree the script has its weak spots, the pace is rather pedestrian and the plot on the clichéd and unrealistic side of things. But Twister is nostalgic fun, with some decent direction and acting, complete with some pretty incredible special effects. The cinematography and scenery are also pretty good, and the score is effective.",/review/rw5392232/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2008,crose5,7," Nice pics of Oklahoma and fun special effects
","Having lived in Oklahoma all of my life, I was glad that they filmed a lot of it here. The film shows what it's really like here in rural Oklahoma, mostly green rolling country with trees, hills and water, with a few oil pumps and windmills thrown in. I don't need to add anything to the comments about the lack of scientific accuracy do I? My wife and I always note with interest that they occasionally get a few things right. The reason I will watch this movie again from time to time is that it is FUN. I love the exuberance of Bill Paxton's team; I know people like the Philip Seymour Hoffman character and I myself LOVE watching the buildup of a thunderstorm, seeing the sky turn green, and the way the air smells and feels before and after one of our storms. Yes, tornadoes are deadly threats, but we ALWAYS have warnings here. There would never be a drive-in theater full of people in cars with no idea that a funnel is on top of them, but, in this movie, that's beside the point. It's pure fun watching the screen ripped apart while Jack Nicholson is wielding the ax. If you are expecting true life reality, this is not your movie. Just go for the spectacle! The bit of reality in this movie, that Oklahoma is lovely in its own way, and that some people love thunderstorms and tornadoes was enough reality for me, and the rest is just the fun of a cinematic roller-coaster ride with some great special effects. It's not Shakespeare or even ""Titanic"", so don't expect more and just enjoy it for what it is!",/review/rw5392232/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2009,FiendishDramaturgy,8," Story driven with marvelous effects.
","It's hard to believe this was done as far back as 1996. It was phenomenal then and I still love watching this flick today. The plot is great, the effects are dynamite, and the dialog is natural with an easy flow, and the performances are awesome. It still surprises me, today. this was the film that made me stop dismissing Bill Paxton as an actor and Helen Hunt as a flibbertigibbet. But there is more to this film than the incredible effects.",/review/rw5392232/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2009,AlsExGal,7," A very watchable hokey action film
","This film is not high cinematic art. It was intended to be a summer blockbuster ""put your brain on hold"" action film when it was released in 1996, and that is what it was and still is. Its competition at the time was ""Independence Day"", which is an unwatchable hokey movie, and this movie is better than that film in that it is a watchable hokey movie. Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton play recently divorced storm chasers Jo and Bill Harding whose relationship was pulled apart by Jo's obsession with chasing tornadoes to the exclusion of wanting any kind of ""normal family life"" by Bill's definition. Bill has moved on and found a more conventional girl that he plans to marry (Jami Gertz). However, before he can move on, Bill needs Jo to sign some papers. He meets her ""in the field"" as she and her team from the university plan a day of chasing tornadoes through Oklahoma. Before they can conclude their business a storm calls the team to the chase, and Bill is drawn into the chase by necessity but kept there by his latent passion - for storm-chasing and maybe even for the marriage he left behind. The film features some great special effects, fast-paced action, and cringingly obvious dialog with the subtlety of a sledgehammer. However if you're just in the mood for an action-packed film with a feel-good after effect, this movie fits the bill.",/review/rw5392232/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2002,Movies8586,," Underrated action thriller!
","I thoroughly enjoyed TWISTER! I saw it in theaters and was completely blown away! (No pun intended.) I loved the big, loud, thrilling action sequences and the fun characters. Although most people criticize the writing as being poor, I actually thought most of it was quite clever. Unlike worse action movies, you actually understand the characters' personality.",/review/rw5392232/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2003,Gavintheman,," WHAT THE HELL IS EVERYONE'S PROBLEM WITH THIS FILM
","Ever since this films release in 1996, its very title has become synonymous with Bad films. Its been labelled stupid, loud, dumb and every other thing you can think of. Whilst I admit that the script aint hot and there's no real story in the film, the action is great, the special effects are brilliant, the film moves fast and provides a slambang rocking good ride. Im sorry that more films like this are not made. I love this film. When i saw it at the theatre, i was blown away (no pun intended). Bill paxton does a good job in the lead (yeah people have said that he is dull and that they should have found someone with more charisma. PUHLLLEASSSEEE). I'll watch this film a thousand times between now and the day I die. And for all the geniuses out there who call this film Crap. I hope you all get swept up in a windstorm, I really do.

15 March 1999,billybob-8,," My all-time favorite.
","Hey people come on! Give TWISTER another chance! Films, even action films, don't HAVE to have ""an inventive plot"" or ""decent performances"" or ""a script that wasn't written by a machine"" to be ""good."" All I need is light, noise, and lotsa 'splosions! Take those elements and paste over a thin layer of worn-out story borrowed from 10 or twelve other movies and you got a winner, thank you! Throw in some great acting-Bill Paxton's ""staring at the dirt"" moment alone FLOORS me. And ever notice how Helen Hunt is constantly bustling about with her head down whenever she's not scrunching her face into her patented ""I'm sad and cute"" look (Hello Oscar!)-that's ACTING! And Jamie Gertz! Welcome back to the cinema! I haven't seen you since LISTEN TO ME! And don't even get me started on the lovable ragamuffins known as the ""storm chasers""! The way they're thrown at us like we'll immediately love them! The way you're not sure how many of them there are! (And the fat red-hared ""dude""! That's what they mean by COOL! I mean COOL-AGE!) And Cary Elwes! What a great villian! He's in it for the money!(Hsss!) At first I wasn't sure what accent he was doing, since it changed every scene, but then I realized he was doing all of them! And the F/X! WOWWW!!! This movie follows the rule ""We got a computer, who needs a script?"". I love how the characters ""find"" the big tornado in the end-on a perfectly sunny day, no less-and drive right up to it with no damage done! I can't wait to try that myself!

15 October 2012,ironhorse_iv,6," Twister isn't that bad of a movie
","A storm is brewing in the distance indeed, because some critics are hating this film. Directed by Jan de Bont, Twister (1996) stars Helen Hunt, Bill Paxton, Cary Elwes, and Philip Seymour Hoffman. It's kind of funny that the original tag-line for the film was going to be ""It sucks"" but the producers felt that it worked too much to the advantage of disappointed audiences and critics. It's doesn't really suck in a bad way. It's a very entertaining piece—not that good, but not that bad. Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt as an estranged couple who chase tornadoes for a living surprising the dialogue between them is funny and catchy—it's felt very well written for a disaster movie. We follow these storm-chasers during a wild 24-hour-period in a quest to deploy a large piece of scientific equipment in the path of a tornado, in hopes of studying it's traits from the inside with a rag-tag team of scientists. Each supporting cast of the movie's crew of storm-chasers has its bits of character develop stereotypes and exaggerated caricatures of real people. You have the smart guy with the map, the computer guy, the film and camera crew but most of all; you got Dusty play by Philip Seymour Hoffman. It's very cool to see him in a role where he doesn't take himself so serious, because most of his roles after this movie were a big serious. While, not chasing storms, the viewer are treated with a sub-story of Bill getting suck into the thrill of storm chasing, forcing him to reconnect an relationship with Josie (Helen Hunt's character) and ignoring his relationship with his new girlfriend. We get a back story of Helen Hunt's character reasons why she track storms, in a way to get revenge on them, for the death of her father who die from one. Then you got the story of the rivalry of competing storm-chasing teams lead by Carl Elwes. Carl Elwes plays also a caricature of the evil, corporation man who in it for money rather than science opposite of Bill's character. Without giving too much out away—it's incredibly entertaining. It's a very cookie-cutter popcorn flick. The CGI tornadoes were great at the time of filming, plus it's pretty real to me. It's eye candy. Just don't take the sum-story so serious, and enjoy yourself. You would be blow away how some critics deem it 'bad', and find yourself having fun watching it.",/review/rw5392232/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2022,IonicBreezeMachine,5," The movie that brought back disaster flicks from their 70s grave, for better or worse
","Dr. Jo Harding (Helen Hunt) is a meteorologist and storm chaser obsessed with understanding twisters after having lost her father to one as a little girl. At a time when supercells are forming over Oklahoma, Jo is visited by her former colleague and estranged husband Bill (Bill Paxton) who has come to get her signature on divorce papers so he can move forward with his marriage to Dr. Melissa Reeves (Jami Gertz) and move on with his career change as a weatherman. Bill is sidetracked when he learns Jo and the team are prepping the usage of a revolutionary new research apparatus nicknamed ""Dorothy"" which Bill had helped develop which convinces him to stick around to his its deployment and stirs up old feelings. However, the group is in competition with corporate sponsored storm chaser Dr. Jonas Miller (Cary Elwes) a former colleague of Jo and Bill's who's money hungry and opportunistic and is prepping his own deployment of new research equipment which was stolen from Bill's design.",/review/rw5392232/?ref_=tt_urv

28 September 2008,Tucker_Keon,6," Twister, not just a party game
","Being from the west coast I never had a whole lot of interest in the natural phenomena showcased in this film. Where I live an inch of rain is headline news. I had absolutely no interest in Twister until I saw it was on late one boring night. Having nothing better to do, I obliged the television and payed attention. I found Twister to be what I call a nice bedtime movie. While it failed to anthropomorphize the tornado the way Backdraft successfully did with fire, the characters were well fleshed out, there was a healthy balance of comedy, drama and (at the time) cutting edge special FX. I found that as long as the viewer came in with no expectation, Twister would be a fun and easy to watch nappy time movie, perfect for watching on a rainy day, curled up with a blanket. So to sum everything up, don't expect an epic, emotionally charged extravaganza, but if you are willing to accept a decently woven story with reasonably believable characters, and have a rainy afternoon to kill, check out Twister. You shouldn't be too disappointed.",/review/rw5392232/?ref_=tt_urv

","Twister is so painfully dumb that I'm surprised I made it through the movie without sniffing glue.

","A lot of critics have bashed this movie for its simple plot, only-decent script, and reliance on special effects to sell. However, that's what it's SUPPOSED to be! If you go to see this movie, don't expect an Oscar-winning film. It's a very simple plot (No spoilers): A group of storm chasers are tracking a huge front spawning multiple tornadoes throughout Oklahoma, hoping to test a new weather sensory device that could possibly help with tornado warning systems. To complicate things, the former leader of the group (Bill Paxton) has come back to have his ex-wife and current supervisor of the team (Helen Hunt) sign the final divorce papers. However, he finds himself swept up (no pun intended) in joining the chase again. That's pretty much it; not outrageous nor all that thought provoking.",/review/rw5392232/?ref_=tt_urv

","You don't play with Mother Nature. That's common sense; anyone who does, well, I feel sorry for them. In ""Twister,"" Nature is given a frightening new dimension courtesy of breathtaking Hollywood CGI effects but it's dumbed down by a questionable script and dialogue (thanks to none other than novelist Michael Crichton himself as a co-author, along with wife Anne-Marie Martin) and sub-par acting.
