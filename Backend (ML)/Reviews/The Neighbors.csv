25 January 2023,tmravi-81247,10," Just couldn't stop thinking about this film ...
","The story of Donya, an Afghan immigrant, who was a translator for the US Army and left her country and family when the Taliban took over (again!). She is now relocated to Fremont, California, in a community of Afghan immigrants and trying to find meaning and purpose in her new home. Donya just can't sleep probably traumatized by her life and work for the US Army in Afghanistan. This is a tender story of the loneliness of being an immigrant played in with wry, comedic and zesty energy by Anaita Wali Zada. And then comes along a potential love interest, Jeremy Allen White (The Bear)....",/review/rw8830520/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is a beautiful story of an afghan girl, Donya, who moves to Fremont, a suburb in California. The movie is about her struggles as an immigrant, her longing for her family and her life as an immigrant in a new place making a new life which made it very relatable for me as an immigrant myself. The dynamics within the community are well captured. There are some twists and turns in the story that keep us laughing, crying and everything in between. The end keeps you longing for more. The cast is fabulous and picturization is unique. Being a bay area resident it's fun to find familiar spots through the movie. What a great production!",/review/rw8830520/?ref_=tt_urv

","A work of art indeed! I loved the film, Anahita Wali Zada brought her own experiences from Afghanistan and performed each scene flawlessly. The film especially speaks to those who are willing to take the time to reflect and immerse themselves in the protagonists joy and pain. Anahita will remain with me for some time.",/review/rw8830520/?ref_=tt_urv
