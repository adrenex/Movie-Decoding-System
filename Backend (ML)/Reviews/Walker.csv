20 November 2022,DiCaprioFan13,4," Why does Jared stutter ALL THE TIME?
","I was expecting so much more from this show. I'm a big Jared Padalecki fan from his time on Supernatural but it feels like he's gotten a lot worse as an actor. As most people have already pointed out, every and I mean every time he talks he stutters. Does he think that's good acting? He never did it on Supernatural or in interviews so it's not a speech impediment, he chooses to do this. And why has nobody told him to stop doing it? It's honestly distracting because like I said it's every time he opens his mouth. Also, the kids are the some of the most annoying teenagers on tv. I don't think anyone would mind if they were never on the show again. I almost fast forward through most of their scenes. I keep forcing myself to watch for some reason hoping it's going to get better but I think I'm out now.",/review/rw7566640/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2021,Supermanfan-13,8," Worth Watching!
","Walker is a lot better than I originally expected! I wasn't expecting much and the only reason I started watching it is because I'm a fan of Supernatural and wanted to see Jared Padalecki in another role. It started off pretty slow but I stuck with it and I'm glad I did because it gets a lot better. Jared Padalecki's character is a little like Sam from Supernatural but that's ok because it still works. The worst part of the show is how annoying the kids are. Padalecki also seems to mumble a lot which becomes distracting after a while. Other than that, Walker is a show that will definitely keep your attention, there are very few moments where you'll find yourself bored. I'll absolutely continue to watch it because it has gotten better and better as the show goes on.",/review/rw7566640/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2022,taraelaine87-677-550398,8," I started watching mainly because of Jared
","I enjoyed watching the original Walker as a kid. I started watching this reboot because of Jared. It has had a couple of slow moments , but over all is a great show. Season two has done somethings I was really hoping for. I won't spoil it.",/review/rw7566640/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2022,JaneBirmingham,8," It's getting there!
","The show is finding its footing. It *is* more of a family melodrama than anything else, so if you go into it with that understanding, you can just sit back and enjoy the ride. Great scenery, appealing actors. I wish it had a little more grit to it, though. True grit.",/review/rw7566640/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2022,cywebber,10," Awesome show
","Walker has twist plots keeps me interested and waiting on next episode. There are some funny parts, serious parts, sad parts just a good mixture in the show.",/review/rw7566640/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2022,Dawson-1234,6," Please kill off Stella Walker already!
","Would the writers please, for the love of God, please kill off Stella Walker already! Or at the very least write her character off the show by going off to college or write a lot less for her character. She's easily one of the most annoying characters on all of television. I have to literally fast forward through her scenes. She comes off as so entitled. The way she thinks she's entitled to so much including knowing all the information on an ongoing Texas Ranger case and how she thinks she's some badass is ridiculous. She just graduated High School and disrespects every adult on the show. I hate to say it but as badly as they character is written, the actress is just as bad. BOTH kids are terrible actors. They have to be related to someone to have gotten the job. Anyway, I'm almost ready to be done with this show because of her. The other criticisms I have are is they need to toughen up Liam. He's a Walker but comes across as an incompetent weakling. Lastly, like many reviews on here and other social media has pointed out...tell Jared to stop stuttering! For some reason I keep watching the show because I still find it entertaining and I like Jared but I don't know if I have much more left in me. If they try to make Stella a Ranger or cop I'm done. I think most people would be. The kids are ruining it for me and by reading through comments on here and other social media, most seem to hate the kids as much as I do...especially Stella!",/review/rw7566640/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2021,TruthLove13,10," Ranger Dad & Teen Kids Family Drama
","I am enjoying this one and am certainly going to keep coming back for more! I've read that some people didn't like the toned-down action, but I am savoring the warm, family feel of the series. It is wholesome and appropriate in so many ways, the kind of show that you can watch on a laid-back evening. There's just enough crime excitement with the sweetness of family life thrown in. Plenty of close, multicultural relationships to follow and a feeling of suspense. The best part for me is watching to see what the kids will do next and Walker's relationship with his children. Gotta love Augie with his smile and affable attitude looking like a mini, younger version of Padalecki! And Stella, despite her rebelliousness, is loyal at heart. Definitely a worthy addition to current television!",/review/rw7566640/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2022,carlabeamer,10," fun family drama with a great cast
","I thought the show got off to a rough start, but grew into itself around episode 5. The adult cast in particular work really well together and I am interested in both the ""mystery"" aspects as well as the family drama. I watched Supernatural and this role is a huge departure for Jared Padalecki and I think he really hit his stride. Interesting to see him playing someone who stands on his own and isn't always a part of a duo like it was with Sam & Dean Winchester.",/review/rw7566640/?ref_=tt_urv

7 February 2022,bd-allen,6," For the soap lovers not crime show followers.
",Do not understand the high ratings. I gave it a generous 6 and that was just based on season 1. Season 2 I have tried to watch but gave up the soap is driving me nuts.,/review/rw7566640/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2021,jmccormick-61834,," GREAT SHOW!!
","This show is amazing, the visuals, sound, characters especially, everything about this show just hits the right point! If your thinking of watching it but are worried because of the reviews, just watch it and you won't regret!!",/review/rw7566640/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2021,Whitneywest10,10," I went into this with...
","A heavy dose of skepticism. I was hoping it would be good without actually getting my hopes too high. Now, I'm in love with it. I think it's a proper reboot in my opinion. I watched Chuck Norris in random order. But from what I remember of it, I think this is a solid new spin on what a lot would consider to be a classic. I love all of the characters and their flawed personalities and the way they all interact with each other. I'm invested in almost every single character at this point. So now, I do have high hopes that this series will continue. I feel like there's a lot of potential here.",/review/rw7566640/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2021,trevino-19768,7," Im so interested in this family dynamic
","I wasn't expecting to like this so much!! The cast and chemistry is such a hit, and the story is compelling - I want to know more!! I love that Walker is nowhere near perfect and how Micki puts him in his place.
Watch this show along with me and lets see where it goes!!!",/review/rw7566640/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2022,bjklbrg-20065,9," Solid Show
","Good plot, good story, good writing and fantastic actors. This has turned the Chuck Norris show on its head by making this a more inclusive, family focused show instead of the macho posturing of the original. My only complaint is that, in his efforts to divorce himself from his character on Supernatural, lead actor Jared Padalecki goes a bit too far at times and makes the performance of Cordell Walker a stammering, sometimes bumbling, character with a choppy delivery. It's not often enough to turn me off of the show but, when he does bring the nervous stammering in, it can be annoying.",/review/rw7566640/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2022,rianraz-45770,," Unreal Bad
","That they gave it a 2nd season is beyond me. Very bad acting, B-C list actors. Once an actor becomes the producer then you must know, this is not going to float for very long. It also shows that CW is tanking and possibly is in the market. No profit for the last couple of years, definitely shows as well.",/review/rw7566640/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2022,iionaq,10," It's such a great show
","I can't stress enough just how much this show improves week after week. I genuinely can't wait to see what they have in store for the newly announced third season, if the production team can keep it up then it's sure to be the best one yet.",/review/rw7566640/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2022,galvann-52793,10," Always improving
","Now to be clear, this was never a bad show in my opinion but it definitely wasn't as strong as I had hoped it would be. Now though, it looks like the creatives behind the scenes have taken the criticisms to heart and used them to make improvements since it's a much stronger show.",/review/rw7566640/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2022,shirleyls-77613,6," TERRIBLE WRITING
","I like the seasoned actors on this show. I DON'T like the children. They don't have respect for others and they are entitled. The writing is so stupid!!! What American law enforcement agency will let a snotty nosed child come in and answer the phones??!! This snotty nosed ass hole child just happens to be the one who receives the call from crooks. A Texas Ranger has been kidnapped and his brother is out galavanting and shopping. What is he shopping for, Crudit√©s? Why the eff would he be out shopping for anything??!! Do better with the writing. I'm glad those crooks beat up Walker's kids. They deserved it! Again, do better with the writing. Are you beginners?? Seriously, do better. The good actors on the show deserve no less. Because of the stupid writing, I have to rate the show a 6. The 6 is because of the unrealistic writing, but the actors are solid. The actors do what they can with what they have.",/review/rw7566640/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2022,CharleyT63,7," Padalecki is the weakest link
","When I first saw a remake of Walker Texas Ranger happening, with one of my favorite TV actors as Walker, I was excited...now, I'm just so disappointed.",/review/rw7566640/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2022,coltsw-10803,1," What a huge disappointment, but not a surprise.
","I was hoping this would be a modernized version of the original, with Padaleki carrying on in the same manner as he did for many years on Supernatural. Unfortunately, this the CW, which means it caters to the oddball millennial and Gen Z types. The usual result is supposedly stylish, overly dramatic, inexplicably weepy and without depth. The protagonist has the unoriginal affliction PTSD, which is overused and cliche these days. The writers do not even remotely understand undercover law enforcement and use all the old standard gimmicks. I couldn't stay with this sad mess, but since I'm not a gullible teen with a short attention span who is easily amused, I wasn't meant to stick with it.",/review/rw7566640/?ref_=tt_urv

","Jared did such an amazing job.
He deserves such a better fandom backing him. I cried during tonight's episode. And to quote this wonderful show for the haters out there ""DO BETTER."" This show is not problematic and the critical reviews released earlier this week we're biased and unfair. I'm so proud to start this show from the very beginning. It tackles important issues and I'm already hooked. Please don't listen to the haters 90 percent are blindly hating.",/review/rw7566640/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2022,towe-51620,4," The best part of the show, Lindsey Morgan, left and now the show is adrift and as ridiculous as the A-Team was in the 80s!
","This show has never been great. Everyone in the show is not acting up to their abilities. It's kinda of like a parody of Yellowstone where all the characters are double digit IQs! Everything they do is the dumbest choice, everyone in every show or movie now is s black belt in martial arts! The story lines are absurd! It all is like some convoluted bad dream! I'm almost to the point where I'm going to stop watching. I'm there with Seal Team, which is a bunch of middle aged warriors acting like they're going through menopause! La Brea is worse than The 70s Land of the Lost! The Resident is going down the tubes! NCIS got better without Harmon! NCIS Hawaii won't see a 3rd season, it's just too boring! Yellowstone is a repeat every season, Manifest, Thank God is in its last season, Riverdale Jumped the Shark it's first episode! All TV is in a woke rut! Nothing compares to Northern Exposure or the X-Files! Movies are great! Maverick was better than the original! They need to put Walker to rest so the actors can all find a better show to help them improve their skills. Goodnight Gracie!",/review/rw7566640/?ref_=tt_urv
