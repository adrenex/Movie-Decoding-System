","Don't waste your time, it's garbage. Nothing fun or entertaining about this show. Acting is fine, nothing special, just the stories and dialogue are trash.",/review/rw7880148/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2022,funinjamaicadotnet,2," I Just Can't Do This!
","I mean, I'm black but does every 2 minutes I gotta hear about black this, black that. I get it, trust me, I hear it everyday on news, online and everywhere else. Can we just watch a show these days without hearing this ish?",/review/rw7880148/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2022,akira-hideyo,1," Lord have mercy!
","Just watched 20 minutes into episode 1 and felt it was already heading to trial at the courtroom. I do know something about coming from rags to riches but this ain't it. Everything seemed over reaching. Big flaunts, exaggerated opulence, masked swagger, anger issues, big egos, ATT-itude with a capital ASS, attached front and back. I usually fast forward a dud of a show to catch the jist before deciding to drop it entirely if the vibes ain't catching my brood but I stopped dead at the 20 mins pit stop for this one. Too much of nothing is nothing. All I felt from watching this precum was it felt repulsively FAKE, FAKE, Fake! Ain't no shade. Just keeping it real. ""Empire"" was different. Lucious had bite and Cookie has claws and their wealth and opulence felt sorted and relevant and EARNED! Bel-Air my toots. More like HOT-Air. Can I have an Ariande Frappuccino Grabde please... Next...!",/review/rw7880148/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2022,sateigdraleah,," This Prince is not Fresh
","I'm over it! Once upon a time entertainment was entertaining. Ya'll remember that? I think actors, writers, film makers, producers etc have gotten so caught up in trying to preach to us their political views that they entirely forgot why the audience shows up. We're not going to theatres or paying our hard earned money to join Netflix or Disney Plus or Amazon Prime, Peacock, or whatever other streaming site, to be reminded of real life and anyone's political stance. We want to be entertained.",/review/rw7880148/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2022,anitalansing-40-581915,8," Excellent Retelling of One of My Favorite Sitcoms
",Let the haters hate. This retelling of the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air was exceptional. The comedy told as a drama made the retelling that much more remarkable. I don't think Will Smith could have done a better job. And the actor chosen to be Will was the perfect choice. What more could I say except the proud producers should take a bow. Really enjoyed it.,/review/rw7880148/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2022,donancricchiasaverio,10," I think some of you are missing the point.
","If you think this is a reboot of the light hearted sitcom of a disenfranchised youth, wrong. If you think this is a realistic outlook of what the original was, you got it. Will Smith and Benny Medina are doing an excellent job of retelling the story with modern society viewpoints. I'm addicted to this show.",/review/rw7880148/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2022,inkledoodle,2," The Young & The Freshless...
","OK, Let's get the obvious out of the way... this isn't a 'reboot' or any sort of update of the original. It's an attempt at reframing the original's narrative in a more gritty and realistic drama. Sounds like an idea with a load of potential, right?",/review/rw7880148/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2022,linda-frances,10," Loved this
","Great remake of Fresh Prince, I was hooked on it from the start , I really don't understand the negative reviews.",/review/rw7880148/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2022,Quigonjay,7," Pleasantly surprised
",Reviewing after first three episodes.,/review/rw7880148/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2022,soulistic,1," Terrible.
",I can't believe this. Just a hard NO to everything.,/review/rw7880148/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2022,ramo140,3," Mediocre at best
",While the idea was nice at first. This show has now turned into a mediocre trashy soapy drama set in the world of the Fresh Prince. It is watchable but something to keep in the background.,/review/rw7880148/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2022,Harry-Anderson1967,1," Horrible Cringy Acting
",The is by far the worst show ever. Horrible acting. I want to like this show but the acting is so cringy. The kid playing Will Smith is such an angry kid. OMG chill.,/review/rw7880148/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2022,TVIsDead,1," When you don't understand your own show..
",Will became famous off this show yet for some reason rebooted it with an dhead cousin named carlton.. hes not quirky or weird hes just a douche.,/review/rw7880148/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2022,jasonsgk,2," It's a lazy version of Empire.
","We've seen this before and to make matters worse they just sort of mashed together a handful of other mediocre shows to make, you guessed it; another mediocre show. First of all it's not for Fresh Prince fans. It's not even kinda the same show. Imagine if you just took every left wing cultural trope and shook it up and let them fall out like bingo balls. That's this show. By the way, I'm pretty sure Phil would make a worse AG than Gascon.",/review/rw7880148/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2022,ac-says,1," Why not just create a brand new show?
","Everything about this show is bad. First off can they please stop using the N word especially if you expect the masses to watch but then get mad when they use it. You cant try to push something as cool, hip or down and then expect people to not copy!",/review/rw7880148/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2022,RK00,1," I wanted to like this
",I love the original Fresh price so when I heard that this remake/reboot was coming I was excited. Wanted to love it but just couldn't get into it. Don't think it's been great so far but I hope that changes.,/review/rw7880148/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2022,asterblasterth,1," Apparently....
",You can't say anything negative about this show because your comments will be taken down.,/review/rw7880148/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2022,thebricks,1," Basically the Fresh Prince of Bel Air as a Nightmare
",I loved the original show. It's a classic and it was great social commentary. Will Smith as the lead made the whole show. He was everything. You could not have gotten rid of him and made the show work.,/review/rw7880148/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2022,ravikash-09831,1," Utter Garbage:-(
","User Review Addition
Text: Thanks for trying, though. It's nothing like the original so why associate with it. I believe the objective was to bait everyone in watching it and Mr Will Smith paid to create the hype.",/review/rw7880148/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2022,wilza76,9," Much better than I expected
","I had a low bar for this show - have been let down with a lot of tv of late and this being a remake of a cult classic and entirely changing the genre (comedy to drama) I wasn't expecting much. I watched the first episode however, and I'm really looking forward to watching the next ep. It pays homage to the original in many ways. The production value and casting is very good although I'm disappointed they didn't find a big and cuddly uncle Phil. All other main characters are similar to the original counterparts other than uncle Phil. I thought the tone was perfect, the script was clever and well paced. Overall thoroughly satisfied with the output and cannot believe this is currently sitting at 5/10. It's clearly being review bombed as if you look at the individual episode ratings they are much higher.",/review/rw7880148/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2022,planetnostalgia,1," Nope
","People saying ""you're missing the point of this show"" clearly didn't watch the original Fresh Prince. Will Smith made sure the original had episodes with serious topics like police corruption towards black people, drugs, guns, bullying, etc. Bel Air is purely out to shove politics and victimize black people, it has no values like the real Fresh Prince.",/review/rw7880148/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2022,christinecandow,10," Creative perspective on a classic
","Yes yes, we all loved the original. But the creators of this version took it to another planet and it's great. The acting and writing are fire and people who just dismiss this with a one because it's not slapstick are petty and probably old.",/review/rw7880148/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2022,sja-awesome,1," Just watch the original
","Seriously... Stop remaking stuff for the newer generations.. The original is good, it's for all generations. This is just hollow bs trying to mooch off of the past. The fresh Prince claps like will Smith slaps.",/review/rw7880148/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2022,bozopauk,3," From any perpective, it is bad
",It might have been wrong from me to expect a similar approach to a tv show i used to like. But this retelling as they call it just picked up the worst parts of the original and made a terrible show.,/review/rw7880148/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2022,brianearley25,8," I grew up on the fresh prince. Honest review
","I grew up on the original. I love this version. You have to give it a chance for what it is. It's not the original and doesn't try to be. Very good acting, real life stories, and a new spin. You have to give it a chance for what it is. It's not ""the fresh prince"" it's just ""Bel Air"". I'm invested. Love the cast.",/review/rw7880148/?ref_=tt_urv
