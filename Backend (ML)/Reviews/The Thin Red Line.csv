16 October 2020,yusufpiskin,9," Thanks Aaron Sorkin for coming in to save 2020 cinema!
","You know what isn't superb?
This was splendid! Although I don't know much about what's going around in U.S cause I'm from India, I felt it. I felt emotions from all over the place. The intensity was really high, the characters were so very well written with depth. The acting was really powerful and the casting... just marvellous choices there...",/review/rw6783785/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2020,PotassiumMan,8," Fiery, relevant depiction of an infamous trial
",Legal historians and courtroom drama fans will have a field day with this Aaron Sorkin film which depicts the trial of eight radical protesters who made a name for themselves in Chicago during the 1968 Democratic National Convention. A disparate array of left-wing activists who took it upon themselves to demand an end to the Vietnam War instead became involved in the ghastly legal aftermath of the riots and thus faced criminal charges for allegedly instigating the violence. This film portrays the sham trial that took place.,/review/rw6783785/?ref_=tt_urv

14 March 2021,sjw1029,7," Solid courtroom drama that makes you mad
","This movie succeeds in what it sets out to do, which is to make you mad at how the powers that be conspired to tip the scales of justice against these protestors. I was a little concerned at first that Aaron Sorkin's script would get too cute, with the way it was introducing the protestors. But as Sorkin movies goes, it turns out pretty well. For a movie that's set almost exclusively in a courtroom, it's never boring. I especially liked Sasha Baron Cohen and Mark Rylance here. It's a solid if not spectacular movie.",/review/rw6783785/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2021,Kingslaay,7," Informative and revealing
",A nicely made historical film. Quite shocking to see how the so called liberties and freedoms are not granted when it doesn't suit the corrupt establishment. Some solid performances from a great cast. I hope to see more of these films being made and distributed widely that expose and are transparent to all kinds of corruption and falsehoods that exist in our society. It should never be one rule for the elite and a different set of rules for the rest of us. This is not what the founding fathers hoped for and you ask yourself who are the real patriots.,/review/rw6783785/?ref_=tt_urv

","I watched this with no real expectation, although the inclusion of Mark Rylance, Eddie Redmayne, Sacha Baron Cohen and Joseph Gordon-Levitt did intrigue me. That all changed when I watched the movie as I found it terrific. It is a story that shamefully I was unaware of, and which displays yet again what a dysfunctional political and justice system is alive a kicking in the US..... definitely worth a watch.",/review/rw6783785/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2021,siderite,7," While I sympathize with the message of these movies, I find it hard to emotionally attach to such one sided and partizan work
","Ah, Aaron Sorkin, the king of U.S. coast progressives, always showing intelligent articulated people standing for what they believe in, in the face of insurmountable odds. Who would not love these heroes? Only it gets harder and harder to do that when all of these films kind of blend together. It's the same formula: the great cast on both sides of the argument, but all working to making just the liberal one appear sympathetic, the arrogant powerful fearful and mindless opposition, almost cartoonish in their villainy, with at least one member who would switch sides at one moment or another, the intellectual sarcastic humor delivered at high speed, the heroic musical moment at the end which shows good prevail. It's preaching to the choir, is what this is.",/review/rw6783785/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2020,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7," Objection!
","'The Trial Of The Chicago 7 (2020)' dramatises a widely known court case concerning the organisers of a protest in late-60s Chicago, which began peacefully but quickly escalated into a skirmish with the police, who supposedly ""conspired to incite violence across state lines"" and, as such, can each be charged with up to ten years in prison. It was, essentially, a show trial meant to reduce the impact of the supposed cultural revolution, a biased affair meant to railroad the titular defendants - alongside an eighth who is consistently denied his right to counsel. The film is slick, straightforward and to-the-point, pairing its baffling and frustrating sham of a trial with flashbacks and recesses that explore the political reasoning behind its events. It's an engaging, enjoyable experience that does a great job of getting you on the same side as its anti-establishment main characters. Sorkin's smooth-as-butter dialogue is delivered by a bevy of famous faces who each turn in some of their best work. Some of them are sure to crop up in the Academy's list of nominees for best actor and best supporting actor. The only real flaw with the cast is its lack of female members; the few women who appear onscreen have very minor roles. Overall, this is a solid, consistently entertaining courtroom drama. It's rather timely, too. 7/10",/review/rw6783785/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2020,philthegreatone-786-63058,9," The Trial Of The Chicago 7
","This is a terrific film about a story that not many people know about. It is about a group of people that were protesting the Vietnam War and headed to Chicago to do that in front of the 1968 Democratic convention. The film mostly takes place in the courtroom, with some flashbacks to the rioting and precursors to the violence. For a start I found out about this story when I watched a documentary on 1968 happenings on t.v last year. As far as the film goes I think the performances all around are terrific. Sacha Baron Cohen as Abbie Hoffman was one of the leaders of protesters and he was a real standout funny, heartbreaking and fierce. The film is very dialogue heavy and includes a lot of courtroom scenes but if you love that stuff you will love this movie. I feel the film is very timely as far as division with protestors and police and I just can't say really how great this film was than just to see it as soon as you can. Either watch it in a theatre or if you can't watch it as soon as it hits Netflix I think it is the best film of the year and could win best picture.",/review/rw6783785/?ref_=tt_urv

","... or guilty until proven innocent. Nothing like a good court room caper to ratchet up the blood pressure, especially with Frank Langella presiding as the ever so slightly biased beak, and doing it to absolute perfection. Packed full, just like the court room of top drawer performances, it leaves you aghast that these scenarios could ever exist in the first instance while thankful that three British thespians can fill the voids American actors seem unable to satisfy.",/review/rw6783785/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2021,Neptune165,6," I learned more about the trial from the Wikipedia page than the movie
","The scene inside the pub in which one character asks ""hey, am I the only one who sees what's going on out there?"" as well as the overdone music and the cheap pathos at the end shows why this indeed is rather fluffy, but fairly slight Hollywood treatment of source material which was more boldly dealt with in the flawed. I found the first half of the film somewhat confusing due to the sheer number of characters involved. This movie missed every point ever made on this subject. Very, VERY poor. I appreciated the insertion of some actual news footage, although it was very hard to view. Does this movie break new ground or highlight new facts concerning this case, probably not.",/review/rw6783785/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2020,david-meldrum,7," Flawed, But Still Well Worth Your Time
","If there's one thing that Aaron Sorkin can do - though in fairness it should be noted that he can do much more than one thing - it's to make you interested in and informed about a subject about which you know little or nothing. This is no exception - the first 10 minutes or so give a typically Sorkin-paced introduction to the context, and then we're into a courtroom drama that really is almost entirely set in the courtroom. The charges the accused face, and the events themselves, are only gradually revealed, a move which keeps the novice like me intrigued, but also a little frustrated. It seems as if Sorkin doesn't quite trust himself to keep as interested in a straight-line narrative, so he's forced to mix it up. And at times this does sag a little, a little bogged down in another scene of men shouting in rooms - but then, this is Sorkin, and once again he does little to counter the often-repeated accusation that he too often relegates women to the background. Once again the women are mostly 'supporting' the heroic men, answering phones, taking notes, making arrangements. The finale of the film also falls into another classic Sorkin flaw - sentimental grandstanding, by way of Dead Poets Society; it would have far more moving if underplayed. But also because it's Sorkin, it's another of those films you come away from a little more informed, a little more provoked and a little more reflective. The performances all work well, and we're left with the unerring feeling that if Sorkin had let a director other than himself put his words on the screen, this would have been even better.",/review/rw6783785/?ref_=tt_urv

18 October 2020,EddyTheMartian007,7," A competently made historical piece with an important message, but shallowly presented.
","The Trial of The Chicago 7 oddly feels dated, like it could've released a decade ago. Coming from Aaron Sorkin, I think many expected more and better, which in some ways it's this movie's biggest downfall. Not to say that this is a badly made film at all, it's well made in every aspect, an impressive sophomore directorial debut by Sorkin, but it lacks just that touch to make it feel something more than just ""good."" All of the performances are good, but there's none I would consider to be truly great. One of the only performances that really stands out is Sacha Baron Cohen as Abbie Hoffman and even he feels like he's holding back. What truly deserves praise is the structure given to the story as it cuts from the court room to flashbacks making what's mostly a slow court trial quite engaging. However, what is left is a competently made Hollywood historical piece, with an important, but shallowly presented message. The movie barely takes any time to actually delve into these characters and show us what they're dealing with. 2 of the Chicago 7, Lee Weiner and John Froines, barely get any screen time since they're mostly pointless to the story, but it could've been interesting to see more of their perspective on essentially getting used by the court. The other performance that stands out is Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Bobby Seale. I thought that section of the movie was one of the more compelling, and should've been focused on more instead of forgetting it after he leaves the trial. The antagonists are just portrayed as dumb bad guys when they could've been far more developed to give a deeper analysis of the system and government. The message is definitely important, but all this movie ends up saying is ""Government bad, system flawed."" Ultimately, I would still consider this to be a good movie, I mean there's nothing I could really point out and call bad, but it had the potential to be a powerful examination of the government, system, court, etc. This just ends up feeling like the yearly Hollywood crowd pleasing historical piece that paints a nice picture of the events from afar, but lacks the fine details once you take a step closer to examine it.",/review/rw6783785/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2020,mrosspub,10," The Chi 7 deserves a 10
","I think Sorkin exercised more discipline than usual in putting this film together. The script was clear, literate, and gave the right tone to each role. The editing also was excellent in bringing in flashback events at the right time during the trial, which kept the pace going forward while providing key background details. He kept the drama high, even though the history and conclusion is well known, by leaving out some of the intermediate details. He trusted his audience at just the right times without compromising the story.",/review/rw6783785/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2020,kerrodnolan,10," *Sniffs* I smell an Oscar coming along.
","I find that court related films, especially those based on actual events, carry the great risk of either ending up extremely intense or excruciatingly monotonous. This however, is one of the very few that pulls it off with ease in all aspects, to which also provides some unexpected humour (yes; mainly from Sacha Baron Cohen).",/review/rw6783785/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2021,classicsoncall,8," ""I've never been on trial for my thoughts before."" - Abbie Hoffman
","I can't say this wasn't a fascinating movie depicting the trial of the Chicago 7, but I also can't say whether everything you see on screen is one hundred percent accurate representing the facts of the case and the personalities and attitudes of the defendants. Of course you never get a completely well rounded view of events as they occur either, and virtually anything that anybody remembers about the rioting at the Democratic National Convention of 1968 is blurred in the flailing batons and teargas of the police battling hundreds of protestors. The passage of time, say half a century, would have the media characterize them as peaceful demonstrators and you would probably see very little of it on your national news. I thought the casting for the film was brilliant, particularly with Eddie Redmayne in the role of Tom Hayden, Sacha Baron Cohen as Abbie Hoffman, and Jeremy Strong as Jerry Rubin. What comes through in the film that wasn't very evident back in the day, was how different both ideologically and attitudinally the defendants were from each other, with Tom Hayden seeming the voice of reason among the Seven, while Hoffman and Rubin carried off their belligerent streak throughout the trial, along with the often repeated outbursts of Black Panther leader Bobby Seale (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), included in the trial for a time until his presence was ordered a mistrial by Judge Julius Hoffman (Frank Langella), at the recommendation of prosecuting attorney Richard Schultz (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). As over the top and seemingly reckless and domineering as the judge was, the one thing you never get to see in the film is the jury actually delivering the verdict. It's made to seem like Judge Hoffman personally made good on a vendetta against the defendants when they were found guilty of incitement to riot. The idea that this was a political trial is brought up any number of times in the story, and it's probably a safe bet to accept the fact that it was, with your memories of those tumultuous days back in '68 flooding back if you were around when it all went went down.",/review/rw6783785/?ref_=tt_urv
