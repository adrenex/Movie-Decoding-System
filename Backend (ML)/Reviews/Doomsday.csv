19 March 2022,cherold,6," gave up early on
",For as much as I watched this it's a '70s movie about two unlikable people who flirt unlikeably and I suppose probably wind up having an unlikable romance. This was nominated for a Best picture Oscar but God knows why except that boring pointless movies often get nominated for awards. I actually don't know anyone who liked this movie but I suppose people did.,/review/rw7998161/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is quite a throwback this movie! Throwout all the CGI, 4k camera work, super super camera angles, stunts and so on, and we have a very back to basics movie that relies on acting, storyline, direction and character. Watching a film like this in the cinema is quite refreshening and reminds me of what we shouldn't lose about cinema.",/review/rw7998161/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2021,moonspinner55,7," Slight-seeming but intermittently captivating...
","Writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's paean to the 1970s California teenager fidgets around so much--what with stop-and-start episodes that don't really go anywhere in particular but, instead, ""build momentum"" as they say--some viewers may start wondering around the one-hour mark what the movie is going to be about. Cooper Hoffman (the son of Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a real find as a 15-year-old go-getter; rushing around on pure youthful adrenaline, he's a sweet kid who hustles himself first before delivering product, parlaying his schemes into reality. Before she knows it, Alana Haim's ""older woman"", a kids' photographer in her twenties, is meeting this kid for a soda. She's dazzled by his self-assurance but keeps her awe somewhat in check. This seems an unlikely match--what 20-year-old girl hangs around with a teenage boy?--but with Anderson guiding us through their many assorted misadventures, it's easy to buy into this relationship. ""Licorice Pizza"" is slight, but admirers of Anderson's style will likely be captivated and won't care. Initially, the dialogue between Hoffman and Haim is unreal (she's at his school for Picture Day); however, once Hoffman demonstrates to her that he's a doer--a teenage actor, an entrepreneur, a businessman--she becomes his partner, his driver...but not his girlfriend! It's an amusingly simple movie with complicated emotions running all the way through it. I don't feel Anderson brought the film to a satisfactory close (the editing seems a little lax and the staging is disappointing), but these kids are quite extraordinary to watch and the eclectic supporting cast is full of interesting oddballs. *** from ****",/review/rw7998161/?ref_=tt_urv

26 November 2021,Quinoa1984,10," Another stunning, hilarious, exhilarating film from PT Anderson with Haim and Hoffman with perfectly off-kilter chemistry
","My initial impressions, aside from making a lot of hooting and hollering notices and bowing in a Wayne and Garth type of ""we're all not worthy"" stance at a portrait of PT Anderson, who returns here to the Los Angeles of the 1970s again for a third time with a coming of age story about Alana (Haim) and Gary (Hoffman) and their misadventures and awkward but total connection to each other as friends and more, is that sometimes a film just needs to give me good characters, and this does this and then some.",/review/rw7998161/?ref_=tt_urv

19 January 2022,kosmasp,9," Different flavors/ingredients
","What is life? What are the goals one sets out to achieve? What is the overall story or goal of this? Things cannot always be summed up easily. The movie (that has characters that may or may not be based on real people) is treating its 2 plus hours like an episodic story ... it begins quite romantic ... but a love that cannot actually happen, right? The age difference being one of the issues ... and some other things - the personalities of the our two leads to name another thing.",/review/rw7998161/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2022,EUyeshima,7," Eccentric and Offbeat and Very Period Appropriate
","I'm probably the right age to appreciate the period detail and shaggy dog approach that Paul Thomas Anderson takes in this disheveled 2021 comedy set in 1973. Applying the ideal baby boomer soundtrack, he channels filmmakers like Hal Ashby (""Harold & Maude"") and Robert Altman (""Nashville"") with a series of meandering offbeat scenes inhabited by a gallery of equally offbeat characters. The focus is on the embattled love story between the characters played winningly by Alana Haim and Cooper Hoffman, but Anderson's scattershot direction takes the characters all over LA interfacing with unexpected people like a hardened Lucille Ball (Christine Ebersole), a drunken William Holden (Sean Penn), and a psychotic Jon Peters (a wild turn by Bradley Cooper). The movie does run too long, and the Japanese restaurant scenes were a bit too racially smug for me.",/review/rw7998161/?ref_=tt_urv

26 December 2021,AfricanBro,," Muted romance
","I love this movie but can't explain why, left the cinema same way I felt after watching ""Once Upon A Time In Hollywood"". Don't really know what to say apart from I enjoyed it. Was it the era it's based in, was it the chemistry the characters shared, was it the way it was filmed, the dialogues, or was it the idyll charm Alana and Gary created? I don't know. It felt like the writers just started writing with no actual plot line, let the story flow and develop on it's own, because I can tell you what happened in the movie but don't really know what the movie's about yet it was still perfect the way it was. Felt like just watching life unfold for the characters. It wasn't complicated, at no point do you feel the script was altered to make it more witty, funny or dramatic, everything was just natural. I think more movies like this should be made. I wasn't around in the 70's, but movies like this make it feel like I'm right there with them; nostalgia to a time I never knew. Come to think of it, maybe that's why I do love it.",/review/rw7998161/?ref_=tt_urv

22 December 2021,ferguson-6,9," brilliant and funny and touching
","Greetings again from the darkness. The only honest way for me to begin is to simply admit that I adore this movie. In fact, I may love it as much as writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson loved making it. The setting is 1970's San Fernando Valley, the area where the director was raised, and it's such a caring tribute and sweet story (while also being exciting and nostalgic) that's it's tempting to stop writing and just encourage everyone to watch it. My only regret is that for those who weren't around during this time period, some of the attention to detail and meticulous filmmaking won't strike the same chord as it will for the rest of us.",/review/rw7998161/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2021,Mcnabbbeasty,7," What?? This movie is so overrated.
","I love all of Paul Thomas Anderson's movies, slow burning boy meets girl stories, and alternative rom-coms but this just didn't do it for me. High quality cinematography, an aesthetic and nostalgic 70's time piece portrayal, and very good acting/chemistry carried this to a 7 rating for me but I was expecting much more. Bradley Cooper's funny cameo was the best part of the film. Movie of the year talk?? That's blasphemous. I am unfortunately very underwhelmed by ""Licorice Pizza""",/review/rw7998161/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2021,paul-allaer,8," One of the best movies of the year
","As ""Licorice Pizza"" (2021 release; 133 min.) opens, we are in Encino, CA and Gary, a 15 yr old, is about to have his HS picture taken. He notices Alana, the photographer's assistant, and on a whim asks her out. 25 yr old Alana doesn't say yes or no, but later does show up for dinner. They strike a bond, and Alana is surprised to learn he's a well known child actor and entrepreneur... At this point we are 10 min. Into the film, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.",/review/rw7998161/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2022,classicsoncall,6," ""You're not cool, and your breath smells.""
","How was this nominated for anything? In a year that offered ""Dune"", ""Power of the Dog"", ""Belfast"" and ""CODA"", this film must have snuck in sideways when no one was looking. It might have resonated with this viewer if the age difference between the principals wasn't an entire decade; because it was, that made it somewhat creepy. Alana Haim as one of the two principals could actually have been cast as a teenager since she looked it, and her family must have come along as a package deal because there are Haim's all over the place. A movie marquee for ""Live and Let Die"" places the time frame firmly in 1973, thereby offering younger viewers a look at the fashion and hair styles of the Seventies, which when you think about it, come off as kind of creepy as well. I can personally attest to that since I survived the era. Sean Penn and Bradley Cooper offer a semblance of star power to the film, but that didn't really feel necessary. Portraying hair stylist turned producer Jon Peters, Cooper looked like George Hamilton with a beard. I don't recall any stories of Peters being the kind of lunatic he was shown to be in this picture, but a quick review of his career pretty much confirms it. The story leaves the character's smashed car and sabotaged waterbed as an unresolved plot line, along with the fate of the shady number twelve guy. When it comes to quirky you can generally find me on board but this one just didn't do it for me. I'm not big on pineapple pizza either.",/review/rw7998161/?ref_=tt_urv

14 December 2021,PotassiumMan,7," Light-hearted but looks and feels too much like a watered down ""Inherent Vice""
","Paul Thomas Anderson's new teen coming-of-age romance set in the early 1970s San Fernando Valley is a rare letdown (by his standards) from the auteur director. Although it boasts two impeccable performances from up-and-comers Alana Haim and Cooper Hoffman and very strong period detail, its narrative can sometimes seem aimless and unstructured.",/review/rw7998161/?ref_=tt_urv
