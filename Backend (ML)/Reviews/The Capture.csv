2 February 2019,AristarchosTheArchivist,9," This is not a comedy (fortunately).
",Wow. What a ride. This series compelled me to reactivate my account to write a review.,/review/rw4661788/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2022,johnpmoseley,6," Season 2's difficult second album syndrome
","S1 seemed so perfect and contained that news of an S2 routinely perplexed people. I think people were right; there was nowhere really to go. Lots of back story filled out here - with the primary magic now being time travel, it's basically all about back story - but, somehow, it feels like we didn't need it terribly much. There are, I guess, good and dutiful points being made about understanding what previous generations went through and how that shaped us, especially our spiky bits, but in practice I just don't feel it all with the intensity and enjoyment that I did S1.",/review/rw4661788/?ref_=tt_urv

",It's brilliant!,/review/rw4661788/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2022,fjmsoftware,9," Watch Season 1 and Stop
","Season 1 was fresh and worth every minute of full attention, solid 9/10, might even up that to a 10 after a re-watch some time later. But Season 2... is like it's not even the same show. There's barely any hint of a story and most of what happens is uninteresting. I'm only halfway in and I struggle to find a reason to keep moving and to watch another episode.",/review/rw4661788/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2022,dierregi,5," Entertaining but disintegrating in series 2
","As most reviewers, I found series 1 watchable and entertaining enough, despite main character Nadia being a rather annoying character. Still, the re-birth after each gruesome death had an element of black humor and suspense, and the Alan character moved the plot forward, towards an end that was simplistic to the point of stupidity, but wrapped up the series nicely.",/review/rw4661788/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2022,strizbiz-99429,3," Season 1 was great, season 2 kind of a train wreck
","I thought season 1 was great, definitely had me looking forward to another season, but season 2 was basically a train wreck imo, it was just all over the place and definitely not in a good way. I know some people will disagree and can't handle people having their own opinions, but it was just too many things going on and focus was just not there, and the season finale just didn't bring this mess together. I wish I could rate it higher but season 2 is just forgettable at best.",/review/rw4661788/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2019,bob the moo,," S1: The energy, heart, and performances carry it above what it could have been
","There is a lot I could have not liked about Russian Doll. I could have taken against it for being overhyped for what it is. I certainly could have been put off by the very confident and brash Nu Yark characters and their very polished lives and homes. Probably the Groundhog Day gimmick would have struck me as uninspired too. All of these things were still there, and a few more, but yet it mostly worked for me, and charmed me into it. Pace and tone are a big part of this as the episodes are just the right length, have good timing throughout, and tend to have the right energy level so you don't feel rushed but yet it has a speed to it that works well.",/review/rw4661788/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2019,medontknowanything,9," Self-help for all depressed people out there
","Well, Russian doll is genius, because it hits the sweet spot - the thing most of Netflix binge-watchers' are suffering from: depression. Not judging, as I am definitely counting myself in.",/review/rw4661788/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2022,badcgishark,5," Season one - 9/10 - Season 2 - 1/10 - Netflix is a dumpster fire now
",This was a great show for one season and it should have only been one season. I cannot remember a drop off for a show THIS BAD for the second season.,/review/rw4661788/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2019,Sleepin_Dragon,9," A scorcher of a show.
","I must admit the premise didn't exactly fill me with anticipation, but the viewing experience really was quite something, you are drawn into the world of Nadia, who is stuck in an endless loop, you learn more about her, and another character Alana, who has the same fate. Nadia begins as a somewhat unlikable figure, but very quickly you warm to her, empathising with her.",/review/rw4661788/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2022,gibbs-18172,6," How to murder a great idea
","Can't blame the pandemic on this one 2019 one of Netflix's finest freshest shows of the year, I've watched season 1 multiple times long awaiting the much delayed season 2. The closing scene of season 1 was so tantalising as it really did leave you thinking 🤔 well where does that leave us?",/review/rw4661788/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2019,anarchyONtheSHORTbus,9," So many layers
","I just finished binging Russian Dolls, and it was awesome. While it's loaded with dark humor, this show is not a a comedy, but so much more. Its smorgasbord of topics, including loneliness, guilt, depression, fear, forgiveness, and moving forward.",/review/rw4661788/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2019,alicej-13706,10," Genius show
","Natasha Lyonne is a genius. This show is incredible and a must see. The talent from Lyonne and the rest of the cast in first class and I strongly believe this will be one of, if not the best show to air on Netflix this year!",/review/rw4661788/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2019,droideka75,9," Do not give up at the beginning! Wait and be rewarded!
","Boy I hated this show so much at the beginning! It was awful, not funny, pretensious, pseudo intelectual! For the first 3 episodes boy I was almost giving up... And then it wasn't! Those first episodes are there for a reason and it pays off. Must watch TV. You will not regret giving it a chance past the first few episodes.",/review/rw4661788/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2019,bluesinab,8," Amy Poehler and Natasha Lyonne 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
","In semi-typical fashion it started a little slow in interest for me but I watched the first episode and said,""Ok, one more...""
And then of course you get the obligatory, ""Well, I HAVE to see what happens next.."" which is followed by, ""Well, who the hell is THIS character?"" And then of course the reaction of, "" Oh Hell Naw!"" Which proceeds the ever popular, ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?"" But then you get the ""Oh I got this"" episode. Only to be smacked by the "" Whoa.... didn't see THAT coming"" show. Which all is summed up with ""More please..""",/review/rw4661788/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2022,imdb-75282,6," Season 1 excellent, season 2 not so good
","Loved season 1, excellent storyline. 10/10",/review/rw4661788/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2022,tigerpride11,3," Season 2 is just horrible
",First of all. Alan is an after thought. His story makes no sense. It's like they rushed it in to include him and then tried to tie him to Nadia at the end.,/review/rw4661788/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2019,shanayneigh,2," I don't understand the high ratings
","The basic premise (repeatedly dying and coming back, meeting fellow ""looper"" etc) is somewhat reminiscent of the fantastic book ""Replay"" by Ken Grimwood, although with a shorter time span between death and resurrection.",/review/rw4661788/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2020,gridoon2023,7," Both seasons are ambitious, intriguing, sometimes mind-bending, but somehow fall short of full satisfaction
",(updated),/review/rw4661788/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2022,imdb-11641-05503,3," Season 2 is some of the worst writing
",Season 1 was great. I had forgotten all about this show until season 2 dropped and I was excited. I made it a couple episodes in before it became clear this wasn't anywhere near the quality of season 1. The writing got so bad. I don't know how to describe this better than to say it's a MacGuffin wearing a Gundam suit of plot armor that was so unbelievable in the context of this story and the characters that I immediately began to feel disgusted with the show. It was so immensely stupid that I couldn't even move on to the next episode.,/review/rw4661788/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2022,hanhoun,6," Season 2 is an insult to the fans of this series.
","Season 2 ruined this creative , sharp, funny , cynical and very dark series for me , it was rushed and dull , ipso facto won't watch season 3 if there ever is one.",/review/rw4661788/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2019,BlockLike,8," A really enjoyable gem
",This series surprised me.,/review/rw4661788/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2019,djurrepower,4," poor attempt on the ""relive the same day"" idea
","The characters seem fine, but the whole story is all over the place. the mystery is weird, and you never really feel like they ever solved it.",/review/rw4661788/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2019,Headturner1,3," Don't get the fuss
","The plot sounded good and I came here and saw glowing reviews. So I settled in for the first episode and was extremely disappointed. I immediately disliked Natashas character. It was like she was over acting and her voice was annoying like she was trying to act like a 50' actress. Then it just became redundant and ridiculous every so many minutes something happens and she's in the bathroom again. I think I got thru half the second episode and was done. I thought it was going to be similar to a ""Happy death day"" premise but it just got annoying. So I can't recommend it.",/review/rw4661788/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2019,DunkelheitVZ,1," I can only see reviews 1 or 10, so it either works or it doesn't
","For me sadly, it does not work. It was boring, I hated the main character, I hated the 1000 cigarettes she is smoking per episode instead of making anything meaningful. I have absolutely no clue what could possible interest me in this show.",/review/rw4661788/?ref_=tt_urv
