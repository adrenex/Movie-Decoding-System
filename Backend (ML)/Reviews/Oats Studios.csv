22 December 2019,questl-18592,7," The Wall
","This is a pretty simple movie, really. One man, a wall, a voice on the radio and an unending tension. That simplicity presents a strong challenge though. Aaron Taylor-Johnson has to carry the whole thing pretty much by himself and he does a great job.",/review/rw5524066/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,6," A verbose sniper and a well-worn wall.
","What starts out as an insular, straight-forward war thriller soon becomes a somewhat sillier, 'Phonebooth (2002)'-esque affair that's really only carried by our two leads' willingness to get down and dirty in the desert sand as they scramble for cover from the chatty sniper pinning them down. The pace in 'The Wall (2017)' is usually slow but there are several genuinely suspenseful and otherwise more energetic moments peppered throughout. The general design of the piece is also relatively realistic - including some stellar sound design that has the crack of each distant shot echo out only after the splat of its impact. This means that there are tangible stakes in almost every scene, even when there isn't any real entertainment. 6/10",/review/rw5524066/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2017,trublu215,7," A Bare Bones Thriller That Works More Than It Doesn't
","The Wall is the latest thriller from director Doug Liman and features Aaron Taylor-Johnson and John Cena as a two man recon team stationed in Iraq who are pinned down by sniper fire and must take refuge behind a wall. Their calls for help are heard by no one...except the enemy sniper. As the battle of wits rages on so does the courage of the two men and their will to survive. This proves to be very beneficial for this film because, honestly, it did not feel like it would be able to sustain a feature length film. However, with the sheer intensity of the film and the perfect performances from Johnson and Cena, The Wall works even when it doesn't.",/review/rw5524066/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2017,ferguson-6,6," Juba and Ize
","Greetings again from the darkness. When a director's filmography includes ""big"" action movies like Edge of Tomorrow, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, and The Bourne Identity (the original), the last thing we expect is a stripped-down war movie whose camera focuses on a single character almost the entire run time. Director Doug Liman certainly understands how to use the camera in creating tension and stress, yet while he and writer Dwain Worrell seem so intent on proving the confusion and futility of war, they seem to forget that a thriller needs either a hero to cheer or a villain to jeer.",/review/rw5524066/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2017,Abdo0079,9," The Perfect One-Man movie .. One of the Best Thriller movies before being A War Movie of the year by far
","This is what you can call The One-Man Movie , Way way underrated movie .. Aaron Taylor-Johnson ( Isaac ) makes a tremendous effort in this movie , Perfect performance and I really give him most of the credit .. Laith Nakli ( The Sniper ) also does a great job in performing the mysterious man of the show even by only his voice !",/review/rw5524066/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2019,Phil_Chester,," A nail-biting thriller
","It's effectively a remake of Phone Booth transposed to the Iraqi desert. It works very well. Very tense, very involving and very watchable. Recommended.",/review/rw5524066/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2017,cruise01,4," Boring and the plot and characters did not go anywhere worth seeing.
","The Wall a war thriller that takes its entire place with an American soldier trapped behind a wall as a sniper has him pinned down. I felt like this war thriller was going to be better than another similar film like Mine with Armie Hammer as he was stuck in the middle of the desert after stepping on a mine. The Wall is no better, it is boring, the script did not develop the characters, and it was dull with its thrills and suspense. ",/review/rw5524066/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2020,RKeenan200,8," Ignore the negative reviews!!

3 August 2017,zalouteacher,7," The Western Wall
","The movie is a snap of what happened, happens and would happen at war with lives, hopes, and disguise at stake. There is no wonder that the American soldier is depicted as one with a heart, with hope for life, and with a brain. Yet, if you look at the movie from an alien point of view you would understand that the soldier is a foreign land whom he has no idea why he is there, who he is fighting for, or even whether this war he's fighting and involved will change his world or the worlds of other. In other words, if your house is made of glass, don't throw at people stones. The producer tries to depict the lost souls who unwillingly fought for their countries or rather for their superiors and the so-called enemies who are on a mission to get back at them being pushed by what happened to them or to their countries. What separates truth, untruth, life and death is a mere wall that can collapse at any time.",/review/rw5524066/?ref_=tt_urv

5 September 2017,kz917-1,2," Not worth viewing
","Two American soldiers are trapped by a sniper with only a wall for protection. What follows is a cat and mouse game of twenty questions. Sadly by the end you never get an answers. I am NOT A FAN of ambiguous endings! If you are going to tell a story, then tell a story. This film was half-assed. Skip it. There are much better films about servicemen and women than this.",/review/rw5524066/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2017,paul-allaer,7," The mind games between an American soldier hiding from an Iraqi sniper
","""The Wall"" (2017 release; 93 min.) brings the story of Isaac. As the movie opens, we are reminded that ""It's late 2007, and the Iraqi was is winding down"". We then meet two servicemen who are out somewhere in the desert looking for an Iraqi sniper who has killed US contractors. After 22 hrs.,, Matthews decides to go in, but when he does he is shot. In the ensuing chaos, Isaac also gets shot, and in desperation throws himself behind a wobbly wall to hide out. It's not too long before Isaac is in radio contact with the Iraqi sniper (pretending to be an ally). At this point we're not even 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.",/review/rw5524066/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2017,dintjommi,1," BrainDead
","Lets hope no war veterans or soldiers see this movie. First of all, i cannot understand why anyone, like a SNIPER, would carry binoculars they KNOW ""fogs up"" now and then. Just because good memories of his DEAD partner? And how anyone can spot anything if they just zoom across the horizon so fast that the image gets blurry, is beyond me. Now these 2 ""soldiers"" look so gritty and dirty and experienced, that it is shocking to see their panic and feeble fumbling when something actually happens. The amount of dust and dirt on their clothes, weapons and faces is just incredible. ",/review/rw5524066/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2021,kosmasp,7," Doug Limans the Wall
","Just when you thought there only is the song the Wall ... there comes the movie the wall. Ok I'm obviously stretching here. But what I was really surprised about, that Doug Liman had done this and I had not heard about it. Then again the movie is quite the slow burn .. it almost plays like a theatre play ... on a battle field. One with violence and cursing ... is that not like other plays? What do I know, right? Again, just kidding.",/review/rw5524066/?ref_=tt_urv

3 August 2017,rockman182,7," The Wall (2017)
","No this isn't The Great Wall with ponytailed Matt Damon. Its much better anyways. Doug Liman is quite solid as a filmmaker. The first Bourne film is the best out of the lot, and Edge of Tomorrow was fairly creative and engaging. Here he brings a small budget, a tiny cast, and a single locale. Yet this film brings an enormous amount to the table in terms of tension, sufficient writing, and gripping action that revives around acting for survival.",/review/rw5524066/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2018,deloudelouvain,7," Low budget but with enough suspense
","If you expect a war movie full of action then you should just skip The Wall. If you expect a war movie with a lot of different characters then you should just skip The Wall. But if you're in to watch a war movie with psychological warfare, where a sniper plays with the life of a couple American soldiers then The Wall is worth giving it a shot. Because that's what you get. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is the main character and you will almost watch him for the entire movie. His mate played by John Cena has a much smaller role. The other big role is for Laith Nakli playing the sniper but him you won't even see, he's just a voice in an earphone. So not much characters, not much action, but still enough suspense to make it an interesting war movie to watch.",/review/rw5524066/?ref_=tt_urv

5 September 2017,paridonian,1," Stupid moments ruin everything
","This movie really did have the potential to be great. The story was right, the tension needed just a hair more and it would have been on the money. I wish we could have dropped the bad accents from all parties if I'm being frank about it. but the worst was the TERRIBLE moments portrayed by the Sniper team. If you know anything about the military EVERYTHING this team did was so wrong and obviously stupid it makes my damn head hurt. I didn't really get an anti-American feel from the movie, but I did get a hint of sentimentality for middle-eastern insurgents that take up arms against the U.S. Military. Again I say this movie had potential, but the ending was DUMB as hell, the actions taken by the ""U.S. Team"" were so blatantly wrong, it was hard to watch.",/review/rw5524066/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2017,phd_travel,7," Better than expected
",I was surprised how involving this movie would be given the premise - 2 soldiers pinned down by a sniper. Sniper movies can be quite exciting as in Enemy at the Gates. But what more can they do with that? Well this movie succeeds. The injuries are quite cringe worthy. Had to look away. There are some issues raised here about presence in Iraq and who are the good guys. ,/review/rw5524066/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2021,searchanddestroy-1,10," Terrific, with the Peter Berg's trademark.
","That's precisely the kind of feature I crave for. Rather short, sharp, with no good vs bad guys scheme, few characters - though I enjoy many characters and subplots too in any picture - and above all, the ending. An ending that many audiences won't love of course, I mean AMERICAN audiences...I won't say more. In the sniper genre, I will prefer this instead ENEMY AT THE GATES crap. I really love this movie, I repeat, so surprising. A French could have done it; remember PIEGE, made in 2013, showing French troops in Afghanistan and trapped in a mine field. Same kind of story, settings and ending too. One more thing, this could have been a Peter Berg feature, instead of a Doug Liman's one. The latest is more used to science fiction movies, but huge budgets. And I also appreciated the reference to Edgar Allan Poe - The Raven - told by the mysterious native sharp shooter. And there is actually a raven seen in the film, approaching the lying body. Though, I am not sure if there is any crows in Irak.",/review/rw5524066/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2020,Muhammad_Rafeeq,10," ""A Intelligent masterwork in action filmmaking"" (American A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10
","Masterful, suspense-Filled and intelligent! I loved this film. Some people might get offended because this film might challenge their notions of the war. Others might be offended because the villain is not just some dumb Middle Eastern stereotype, but a highly intelligent cunning man. To me, that's all the more reason to watch this film. Highly recommended!",/review/rw5524066/?ref_=tt_urv
