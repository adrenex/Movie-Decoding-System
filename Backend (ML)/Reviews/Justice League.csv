2 May 2006,BlackCat725,7," Plain and simple, a NICE movie
","My family (two 40-somethings, an 8 year old and my 71 yr old mother) saw this at a sneak preview on April 29th. We all enjoyed the movie very much. The story was a good one, and knowing it was based on real-life events made it that much more enjoyable. Luke Wilson was a hoot (pun intended) to watch as was Tim Blake Nelson. And seeing Neil Flynn play something other than ""the mean janitor from Scrubs"" was nice. The kids in movie did well and I'm sure they will all appeal to a certain demographic on the heartthrob level. The visuals were just lovely and the Jimmy Buffet music added to the ""Florida feel"". OK, maybe the story was a little too neat and well packaged for some adults, but hey, who cares? I can't compare it to the book, I honestly hadn't heard of it until the movie came out.

20 May 2006,gpazan,10," a refreshing change
","what a refreshing change from the PG movies that have teen girls jumping in and out of bed, young high school boys counting how many girls they can ""hook up"" with, kids drinking, doing drugs, etc., etc., etc. Carl Hiaasen has written so many books that are enjoyable but hardly classic literature. but he has finally written something that Middle School kids WANT to read. And this movie sends a message to kids that maybe they can make a difference, that maybe their voices can be heard. Filmed in South Florida, the scenery is beautiful and natural and REAL. Who cares if its predictable, and a little corny. So was FREE WILLY and look how well that did. This is a good family movie..........a rare breed.",/review/rw1360403/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2006,marc-262,8," Hoot is a good family film
","It is great to see a film starring kids whose idea of ""acting adult"" is not engaging in sensuality. Instead, these kids see a problem in their community and take responsibility for helping to solve it. Hoot is a film aimed squarely at families looking for a fun day at the cinema. The production values are good, especially sweeping shots of Montana and Florida. The soundtrack by Jimmy Buffet is a perfect fit. The young actors are spirited and refreshing.",/review/rw1360403/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2006,the-movie-guy,6," The film has lots of humor, and a message of saving the environment
","(Synopsis) Roy Eberhardt (Logan Lerman) is a teenager who loves living in the wide open spaces and mountains of Montana. Unfortunately for him, his father's job is forcing him to move once again, this time to a small town in Florida. As the new kid in school, Roy has the usual encounter with the school bully on the bus. While riding on the bus, Roy is also intrigued by a teenage boy who was running like the wind and passed the bus in his bare feet. The next day, Roy gets off the bus and tries to catch him, but loses him at the golf course. Roy eventually meets the boy, known as Mullet Fingers (Cody Linley). Mullet Fingers is a runaway living on an abandoned boat near the golf course and a vacant lot that is about to have a pancake house built on it. All by himself, Mullet Fingers has taken up the cause of protecting the burrow owls that are nesting on the vacant lot. If a pancake house is built on the lot, it will destroy the habitat of the burrow owls. Roy joins forces with Mullet Fingers and his sister Beatrice (Brie Larson) to save the owls.",/review/rw1360403/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2006,Movieguy_blogs_com,8," For a first time producer, I thought Jimmy Buffett put together a quality piece of work
","In 'Hoot' Logan Lerman plays Roy Eberhardt, the new kid in school who has just moved from Montana. But Florida is a lot different from Montana. Despite is troubles in blending in, Roy discovers a bigger problem. A new franchise restaurant is coming to town and families of burrowing owls are in trouble. Can the new kid, a tomboy (Brie Larson) and a runaway (Cody Linley) stop big business from destroying these owls' home? ",/review/rw1360403/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2006,TxMike,," Cute, lightweight movie that is entertaining if you are in the mood.
","Poor Roy Eberhardt, teenager, his parents' jobs require them to move often, so he never gets any stability in one location. The movie begins with them in the beautiful mountainous country of Montana. What would be the exact opposite? How about Florida?? Yep, they move to Florida, the Gulf Coast area not too far from Tampa. As Roy gets to know his new environment, he meets the big bully kid on the bus, and has to break his nose to get away. Out the bus window he sees a kid about his age running very fast with no shoes. And, he somehow befriends a no-nonsense girl named Beatrice.",/review/rw1360403/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2010,TheLittleSongbird,7," Very nice family film
","I am not going to lie and say Hoot is the best family film I have seen, but I am going to say I actually rather liked it. True, the pacing is a little too slow at times, the story perhaps a little predictable and some of the characters are rather clich√©d particularly the bully. However, Hoot is beautifully photographed with lovely scenery and the cinematography was very nice. The soundtrack was a pleasant touch and had a somewhat nostalgic feel to it, while the dialogue is humorous and has some sweet parts too, the message is admirable and the direction is above-adequate. And the acting was good on the whole, Logan Lerman is an appealing lead and Brie Larson while petite is alluring and likable enough, while Tim Blake Nelson does a very good job with his role as does Luke Wilson. Overall, very nice and likable, nothing outstanding but it's not awful either. 7/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw1360403/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2010,donavanman1969,1," terrible
","Terrible, terrible movie. Not that the thought behind it was terrible, but the execution was. Yes, kids might like it, but if a grown-up subjects him or herself to this farcical, poorly written, and pitifully acted Movie then you should be looked after in a nice nursing home in years to come.I found a few things to like..um..the kids had a common goal (chasing off the greedy profit-driven corporation..teamwork--working with a hodgepodge of folks usually outside their social caste. But let's be honest, the teenage kid who is ""neglected"" or ""misunderstood"" by his parents is pretty lame material. Then pair him up with the ""bad boy"" and cute little girl and worry about plot development later. 13 year olds breaking into government buildings, vandalizing private property and being lauded as heroes is not cool to most parents. So..the movie just stunk. Watch at your own peril.",/review/rw1360403/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2006,nethoppers,10," Great family movie, strong Florida Ecology Message.
","If you read the book by Carl Hiaasen, the movie follows pretty much true to form, with a few minor changes for Hollywood. In my opinion this is a great family movie. Luke Wilson (Officer Delinko)pretty well steals the show from an all-star cast that includes Robert Wagner and Jimmy Buffet. The kids in the movie do a great job led by Logan Lerman, Brie Larson, and Cody Linley.",/review/rw1360403/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2015,anaconda-40658,3," Hardly a Hoot.
","Hoot (2006): Dir: Wil Shriner / Cast: Logan Lerman, Brie Larson, Luke Wilson, Tim Blake Nelson, Cody Linley: Misfiring family film about serving a cause. After being moved several times, the new kid now resides in Florida where he is bullied but eventually he teams with two independent teenagers in their struggle to save ground owls from a construction site. From the makers of Holes yet lacking the intelligence and wit of that wonderful film. Setup is rushed and structure contains a pointless subplot regarding a school bully. Director Wil Shriner does his best but even the ending is ridiculous with a foolish standoff that would seem laughable in within the maddest of slapstick comedies. Luke Wilson does his best as a rookie cop but the role is cardboard. He is the standard cop often seen in these films that is expected to do little but ends up solving the case. Logan Lerman and Brie Larson play two of the teenagers whose actions are far from believable. Tim Blake Nelson plays an idiot who manages the site for construction. Cody Linley plays Larson's ambitious stepbrother who also has a knack for being on the opposite end of the law when attempting a statement. Great message about endangered wildlife and other issues taken for granted. Regretfully it is reduced to stupidity with its misplaced humour and a script should have been placed in one of those owl holes and buried. Score: 3 / 10",/review/rw1360403/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2006,wrlang,9," Good clean fun for the young or young at heart
","Hoot is a nice young person's film about a group of middle school kids that try and keep a pancake house chain from bulldozing a plot of land that is home to some endangered burrowing owls. The acting is pretty good and the fresh faces are nice to see. Many well known comedians are in this film and keep the humor going almost nonstop. It is a film for the young crowd, perhaps 5 to 11 years of age. I thought it was a nice change of pace from the adult films that pervade the screen these days. There is no realism here or accuracy about life in general for adults or kids. It's just a bunch of fun with a constant message about saving the beautiful places in this country from becoming over developed. If you can remember back to the day when you weren't fight for a buck you may remember that money isn't everything. Not many people over 12 are going to enjoy it unless they really have a soft spot for the old after school special series.",/review/rw1360403/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2008,freakfire-1,2," Luke Wilson or Luke Perry?
","I will give it this: it tried. It did try to make it good and even got Luke Wilson involved. Luke Wilson is good, but he can only do so much. He can't make up for the fact that the story was very flawed and the characters were underdeveloped.",/review/rw1360403/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2006,fam143,10," Against all odds, three kids take it into their hands to make a change for the better.
","I took my younger niece to an early showing and she LOVED it (I enjoyed it myself as well). I don't need to explain the plot, since the movie remains completely true to the award-winning, top-selling book by famed author Carl Hiaasen. The movie takes the popular book and layers it with beautiful cinematography (I want to go to Florida now!), humor (thanks to funny-man, Luke Wilson and some new-comers), and Great music! I have to get to get a Jimmy Buffet CD now! I know a movie is good when I get goose-bumps in the end. Overall, it was great family film that I felt comfortable taking my younger niece to. I'd recommend it to any and everyone.",/review/rw1360403/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2006,DanaWarren,8," review of Hoot
","I took a group of young people who were the same age as the protagonists and it appealed to us all. I agree with the other post, the Wilson guy worked a thankless script into a great minor character. It is good to have a movie for a certain age demographic (too old for PG, too young for R). It also shows how they think and maneuver in junior high school. You had to love how well Jimmy Buffet did as the cool teacher. He kept us adults awake. The level of kids questioning authority was kept reasonable. Their motives were specific and not like some A.D.D. rebel. The setting and music were beautiful. Overall, if you enjoyed Holes, this is really similar.",/review/rw1360403/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2006,Carycomic,10," Good old-fashioned Disney fun for the whole family.
","Logan Lerman plays Roy Eberhart, the son and only child of a Justice Department official who's been transferred six times over the last ten years. And, for Roy, Cocoanut Cove, Florida, definitely doesn't seem like a case of ""saving the best-for-last.""",/review/rw1360403/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2010,moonspinner55,1," Execrable Disney do-gooder with inept teenagers...
","Watching Disney's ""Hoot"", based on Carl Hiaasen's young adult novel, one's mind begins to wander early in the proceedings, conjuring up images of the casting process wherein presumably thousands of juvenile actors auditioned for the leading roles. If true, how then did they come up with the utterly talentless kid-performers seen here? Casting agents in Hollywood seem to be perpetually out-of-touch with reality; they overload films like ""Hoot"" with unnatural, exasperating, self-conscious young people who act as if they were being assigned the next sequel to ""Home Alone"". Eyeball-rolling high schooler, moved from Montana to Florida (an excuse to give us a nifty travelogue credits sequence!), is immediately picked on by bullies but fights back. His success gives him the courage (I presume) to track down a Tarzan-like older kid who runs like the wind and lives in the foliage just outside the country club; together, the two boys hope to save endangered owls who are burrowing on land designated for a new pancake restaurant. The picture is a series of bad ideas, misconceived sequences, and hopeless attempts at comedy while offering us a plastic kind of youthful conviction which was already molding over as far back as the 1950s.

27 November 2014,michaelRokeefe,3," A little adventure to pacify youngsters.
","Based on a book by Carl Hiaasen, three middle-schoolers pit wits with corrupt politicians, money hungry real estate developers and some local not-too sharp cops. Roy(Logan Lerman)is the new kid in school, moving from Montana to Florida. Roy meets Beatrice(Brie Larson), kind of a tough girl, but really worth knowing. She is trying to help a boy that is going shoeless. Upon following this barefoot boy, they find he may be involved with vandalism at a construction site. When the small group, now friends, discover a burrow of hoot owls being threatened by the new construction crew, it is time to declare war against the people who should know better.",/review/rw1360403/?ref_=tt_urv

5 April 2007,lastliberal,7," Those damn developers are ruining Florida
",The message was plain and simple; Florida is flat and they will bulldoze it until they have cleared it coast to coast and there is no room left for the wildlife. They have bought all the politicians and they are tearing the state up little by little.,/review/rw1360403/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2006,lakewoodoh2002,7," A new kid is school becomes friends with two kids who are trying to stop construction of a pancake house that will destroy the homes of 18 owls.
","It's a kids movie. I saw it a week early. If you're over 15, you will think it's a dumb movie. It's sort of like the thinking in 1971 when ""Billy Jack"" came out. I saw it again in 1975, and thought, ""What a piece of crap."" Anyway, it's a nice thought -- protecting the owls -- but the problem I have with the movie is that too much of it is illogical. While he is getting bullied, the main character sees another kid running barefoot. So he immediately thinks the barefoot kid is somehow connected to the vandalism that's taking place at the construction site. He immediately becomes friends with the girl, who had threatened him. She then tells her life story to him. Jimmy Buffett, as a teacher on the first day of school, is teaching a college course to a bunch of seventh-graders. A hospital begins treatment of the barefoot kid without bothering to contact his parents. A policeman just walks into a classroom without bother to contact the office. My son liked it. I didn't hate it. But I've seen better.",/review/rw1360403/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2008,g-bodyl,9," A Good Movie with a Good Message!
","Hoot is a nice plain movie with a simple message. It seemed like that this film was for young children, but I know that adults will like this film. The storyline is pretty simple. A kid who moved to Florida must help a soccer jock and an outcast save burrowing owls from construction of a pancake house. The message in this film is big especially for animal activists and lovers. The message is about doing all you can to save endangered animals. The acting in this film is decent. All the three kids looked like they had good chemistry. The music is not too shabby. I liked Jimmy Buffet's songs in this film. Overall this is a good family film. I rate this film a 9/10.",/review/rw1360403/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2006,DarkVulcan29,9," Lets give an enjoyable Hoot
","The story is incredible, it begins with a new kid in town named Roy, while on the bus to school, he notices a kid running with no shoes, and on that same day he breaks the big bullies nose who is trying to fight with him. Roy soon discovers that kid is a runaway, and he and his step sister are trying to mess a construction sight, that could kill all the beautiful owls that live there. Roy decides to help them him there fight, Can they win this fight before the smart but bumbling cop Dave Delinko(Luke Wilson) Stumbles on to them. An enjoyable film, funny and adventurous. I do admire Luke Wilson for taking this role. I don't think his brother Owen would even take this role.",/review/rw1360403/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2006,Andy-296,8," Solid family film, more radical than it seems
","In ""Hoot"", a new kid arrives to Florida from Montana. He first faces the usual problems of blending in and dealing with the local bully. Soon, though, he becomes aware of a bigger problem: a franchise restaurant chain is trying to build a site in the town, right where a number of burrowing owls live. This movie has the look of a family film, but it is pretty more radical than it seems, as it shows sympathetically how Roy and a couple of friends do not shy away from lawbreaking (including vandalism of private property and briefly kidnapping the manager of the chain of restaurants) in the name of environmentalism (to save owls, no less). Now, one might agree or not with those actions, but at least the movie has the courage from not shying away from its convictions. A good, solid film, all in all.",/review/rw1360403/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2006,oclivingiseasy,9," Excellent film that our whole family enjoyed.
","Hoot was terrific. The owls are adorable and the movie highlights an interesting environmental issue I didn't know existed. Florida is full of so many fun characters and the film does a great job of bringing that to the screen. My kids particularly loved all the different animals, from snakes, to owls to alligators. It's really a simple story, but also one that they need to hear at this age. When kids are young that's when they really develop their sense of values, and yes one of those must be caring for our environment and all the creatures that live in it. I think it was great that the film even sparked a conversation with them on the ride home about animals and how to help them. It was just truly sweet and enduring to hear my little girl talk about how she wanted to save the baby birds. Anyway, overall it was really a great time and I'd recommend the movie to anyone looking for something entertaining AND meaningful.",/review/rw1360403/?ref_=tt_urv
