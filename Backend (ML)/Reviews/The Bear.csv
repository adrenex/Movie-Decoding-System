11 June 2017,Top_Dawg_Critic,8," OK, I admit I was wrong about this movie.
","**SPOILER? I checked yes as it's borderline, but if you've seen the trailer, then this review should be OK.",/review/rw5332876/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2017,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,7," Funny dark comedy.
",I'm not sure why this film is considered a crime-drama. It is really a dark comedy and mystery told in reverse chronological order. It's certainly not a serious crime-drama at all. Unlike most comedies of this sort that make local police look like the buffoons and the FBI agents the serious crime fighters. This film spins things around by making the FBI the buffoons. The exception is the sheriff's sidekick who doesn't seem to get a chance to sit shotgun with his partner in the squad car. Almost always relegated to the back seat. ,/review/rw5332876/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2017,ejr-4,7," Tight little thriller worth a view
","I read the plot summary, ""OK, structured like Memento, let's see if it's original."" Started out fair with nothing very compelling. Seemed like a standard small town crime story with nothing new beyond the backwards- in-time format. But definitely picks up along the way. Got more interested as I watched and it ultimately paid off very well! The structure truly served the plot and was not just applied to make it seem creative. It was inventive, tautly paced, well cut and an appropriate length. Give it a shot. You might even want to watch it again. I plan to.",/review/rw5332876/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2020,jeff-2051,8," Ignore the low ratings.
","I see it more and more as the infantilization of film viewers worsens; bad ratings on damn good films by people only moved by characters in capes. This is a damn good story, with a solid script, and great noir acting. Ignore the naysayers.",/review/rw5332876/?ref_=tt_urv

","In conclusion, I highly recommend this movie. The End.",/review/rw5332876/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2017,jtindahouse,5," Could have been a lot better
","There are two reasons you might make a film with a non-linear time line. The first is that you have a twist in your film, however the twist doesn't come at the end of your story so you need to make it happen at the end of your story (much like 'Memento' did). The second, and inferior, reason is that your film simply isn't unique enough on its own. 'Shimmer Lake' is a combination of both of these reasons I suspect. There's a twist of sorts which would have come at the beginning of the film and now comes at the end. But what they won't tell you is that by doing this it is also hiding the fact that this is a very run-of-the-mill story line told a thousand times over. I'm sorry, but it really is. There is nothing fresh here in that regard. ",/review/rw5332876/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2018,kosmasp,7," Memento style
","Although you don't have a character with short time memory loss, the story is told in pieces and starts in ""current time"", to move backwards, day by day. An obvious choice, since this makes the movie a little bit more interesting and gives it an edge, it would not have otherwise. After I finished it, I did rewind and check some scenes. There were subtle hints for things to come or rather things that happened.",/review/rw5332876/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2017,AgallochNZ,8," Gripping Movie
","This movie shows us the events which unfold after a bank robbery, in reverse. It is a very gripping film that has you wondering right until the last scene. Great characters and dialogue, with a good mix of suspense and action. If you enjoy the movie, no doubt you will want to watch it again, since the movie is played in reverse chronological order. I think the decision to show the movie in this order was risky, but well executed. Great length, no filler... awesome movie!",/review/rw5332876/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2020,sbweightman,7," Funny and dark, but needed more to it.
","A crime caper which is told in reverse which seems like a bad choice until the end (beginning) of the story where it all comes together nicely. It has a quirky style, some humorous moments and good acting, but mostly, it just rolls along without much of a fuss.",/review/rw5332876/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2017,CANpatbuck3664,7," Shimmer Lake Relies Heavily on Their Twisted Narrative Structure but There's Enough Here to Keep Viewers Occupied
","*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Our story begins during a grey Friday morning in an unnamed mid-west town. Andy Sikes (Rainn Wilson) is hiding in the basement with a big bag. His daughter comes into the laundry room and he's able to convince her to go back upstairs without giving him away. She goes upstairs to have breakfast with her uncle Zeke Sikes (Benjamin Walker) who just happens to be the sheriff and her mom. Andy is able to sneak out and steals his neighbours' car. Zeke has no choice but to continue to work and he picks up his deputy Reed Ethington (Adam Pally). The day continues to unfold, we see the aftermath of this violent bank robbery. But instead of moving to Saturday, we actually rewind to Friday and the story continues to unfold in reverse so we deal with the aftermath first and the movie progresses back to the heist.",/review/rw5332876/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2017,cyjk32310,9," One of the most enjoyable dark humour since Fargo
","Many lines were brilliant, with satisfying performance the movie caught my attention till the end and got me well there. Seriously though, this is a drama/crime but definitely not a thriller. They were probably just having too much fun with those lines without even trying. Cinematography could be better if some more hand-held and close-up are used. Overall, it is an excellent black humour, and I will certainly watch it for a second time.",/review/rw5332876/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2019,rob2018,8," Better than its rating for sure!
","It's smart, funny, dark and succinct. Makes you use your brain a bit as you rethink the previous scenes with each newfound bit of information. I was pleasantly entertained and actually laughed out loud several times. A hidden gem of a movie that deserves much better than the 6.2 rating it currently has. I'm starting to lose faith in the IMDb rating system.",/review/rw5332876/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2017,reb-warrior,8," Pretty Good Crime Thriller with Dark Humor and a Twist
","A bank robbery has taken place in a small town. The story is told backwards. So the beginning of the movie starts the next day after the robbery, Friday. By the time you get to the last day, which is Tuesday, it explains what is really going on. It's way more than just a bank robbery.",/review/rw5332876/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2021,UniqueParticle,8," Pretty solid
",I've seen years ago now rewatching for a review and needed something to watch. Great tagline right place wrong crime and I love the dialogue it's very well written! Some great cast in Shimmer Lake for a not so known movie. Kinda jumps into story without much introduction that's probably the biggest downside. Nice for a short crime/drama for sure definitely would recommend!,/review/rw5332876/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2017,glenalbyn,9," Dark, clever, engaging back-stepping mystery
","If you loved Fargo, either the movie or the brilliant TV series, you will really like this movie. The writing is sly, clever, and funny in the midst of a tale of a small town bank heist by the gang who couldn't think straight. If the story had played out in time order, it might have been ordinary. But because the tale is told in reverse, stepping back one day at a time, the mystery builds in a way that I bet you won't see coming.",/review/rw5332876/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2017,Samiam3,5," campy, uneventful, and bland, with the odd laugh or two.
","This comedic crime picture chronicles the aftermath of a foiled bank robbery, but in reverse, one day at a time.",/review/rw5332876/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2020,ops-52535,9," this one i liked
","Its just as easy as that. perfect playtime, great acting, very opportunistic, dark humour, and quite a few surprising twists in the back of the hand., its a small town story, it is so small that every redneck are somehow involved in the crime played out in this movie.",/review/rw5332876/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2018,educallejero,7," Its gimmicky, and its great!
","This movie works because it uses a particular style to tell the story ala ""Memento"". While its not as awesome as that one, it does everything well. The acting is superb. Its so good, that you get surprises by the day (the movie is told backwards day by day), more than anything because of the subtle acting from everybody.
Its short, well edited, well writen and performed.",/review/rw5332876/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2022,thejdrage,8," FINALLY! A great dark comedy. WHAT FUN!
","A rare find, indeed.",/review/rw5332876/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2018,aquascape,5," Interesting storytelling device of an uninteresting story
","Once in a while a film jumps out that doesn't follow the conventional ways of storytelling and that certainly leads to a peak of interest. ""Shimmer Lake"" tells a murder mystery in reverse, in the ways Nolan brilliantly told his ""Memento"" decades ago, however nowhere near as gripping as that.",/review/rw5332876/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2021,johnsmithjanuary-20081,10," fun little small town crime drama
","Quirky slow moving, yet entertaining small town crime thriller. A well written creative movie for for fans of crime drama flicks. Worth giving it a watch.",/review/rw5332876/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2019,phd_travel,4," The reverse time frame doesn't work
",The movie should just have been shown in a linear manner. The reverse format just made the earlier part confusing and takes the tension out of the story. I understand it's part of the twist that it's told that way but it just isn't worth the confusion.,/review/rw5332876/?ref_=tt_urv
