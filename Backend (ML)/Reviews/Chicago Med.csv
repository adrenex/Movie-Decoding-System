31 August 2020,Rectangular_businessman,8," The best Devilman anime
","While not entirely faithful to the source material, I think Masaaki Yuasa captured perfectly well its themes and essence, particularly its blatant anti-war themes, as well its overall disturbing bleakness.",/review/rw6932306/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2020,Prashast_Singh,9," I can't stop thinking about it, now that it's over.
","I have recently starting getting into anime, thanks to Netflix. As I came across Devilman Crybaby, I watched the trailer and it seemed like an entertaining series. But I had no idea it would be so great. Each and every episode was very well written and animated, but what left me deeply intrigued was how it made me root for the characters. Especially episode 9, that gave me chills and not just because it was violent or gory, but because the emotional undercurrents were something I had never experienced before. I am still unable to stop thinking about it as I type this review.",/review/rw6932306/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2020,DeBBss,7," Not for the Faintest of Hearts
","Devilman: Crybaby is the darkest and most nihilistic anime I have ever seen. I usually like nihilistic films and shows, but Devilman: Crybaby is on another level. All of you're favorite character will either become a demon and die or die in the most disturbing ways possible. Miki Makimura's death and aftermath is one of the most disturbing scenes I have ever seen. It's a truly horrifying mini-series that doesn't hold anything back.",/review/rw6932306/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2018,lordsangone,9," wow! im still not sure what i just saw and i just finished all 10 episodes in one sitting.
","Growing up in usa i was excited to see ninja scroll, akira, ghost in the shell back in the 80's. there werent too many anime series available, now a days we have the anime universe in the palm of our hands cause of the net. there are thousands of anime series and movies, yet devilman still stands out in many different ways. im surprised netflix featured devilman cause of the mature themes. it is down right gore and raw in every way possible. it basically does not give two cents about any of that cause its a big part of the concept. the duality of man, good and evil. do we have demons within us, are we more good than bad, how is the balance maintained, who is winning if anybody, what is the endgame, etc. this anime is targeted to the 21 and over group. its very psychological, philosophical, religious, spiritual, funny, sexy, slice of life but most of all, demonic. there will be lots of viewers who will turn away before the 1st ep even ends. the art is very good and unique. the storyline is quite unique as well and its pace is pretty steady. it keeps rockin it steady and knows how to have fun. 2018 anime is starting off guns blazing! its almost like a continuous party with lots of great music, mostly rock and hiphop. so even if your not into all the spiritual stuff, its still one hell of a ride. overall its a deep and dark concept but enjoys itself along the way. hopefully there will be light at the end of the tunnel for the viewers experiencing the trials and tribulations of the devilman.",/review/rw6932306/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2022,TheGreatGreenBadger,9," Objectively one of the most wack stuff of all time!
","The Devilman series reminds us how anime can feel like anime, and Devilman: Crybaby is one of the reminders of how great anime can be! The characters have such a lasting impact, and the stories told leaves an imprint on the mind and soul.",/review/rw6932306/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2018,death9000,10," A reimagined masterpiece.
","Devilman embodied everything anime was about when I was younger. Fantastic animation, brutal, shocking blood gore, and simple disdain for taboo.",/review/rw6932306/?ref_=tt_urv

11 January 2020,reddice26,8," Great anime
","Even though I am not familiar with the source material, I decided to watch this anime. The first couple of episodes, I felt were ok-ish. What I did not realize is that this was setting up the story for the second half of the series, which is where the show really shines. It is then that it becomes immensely brutal and uses the background of the first episodes to build on. Blood and gore go hand in hand with the drama that unfolds in front of your eyes. I was shocked to see just how brutal it becomes and had to fight against the tears on some moments. If you're looking for a feel-good anime, this is not for you.",/review/rw6932306/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2020,dilagawani,10," Some deluxe experience
","I'm not even anime guy, but this is truly a masterpiece. From the scoring, story and animation it just beautifully perfect. Really worth to watch.",/review/rw6932306/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2018,franco-km8,10," Devilman is back!
","As I long time fan of devilman i was highly surprised that Netflix was making a total new anime of the master piece created by Go Nagai decades ago. I tought that maybe we would see a censored version of this horror and adult anime, but God, i was wrong. This is one the best anime that i´ve seen in my life. The gore, the sex, the violence is all there. But this anime goes even further. Explores subjects as drugs, the good and bad side of every single human, fate, religion, friendship and love. The animation and the music is also superb. The Ost is so good that you´ll found yourself listening the songs again and again. Maasaki Yuasa, thanks for Making Akira Fudo fights evil once more!",/review/rw6932306/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2018,lanycera,9," This is a strange...masterpiece.
","This anime is actually true to the manga, not like the 1972 TV version. It is cruel, bloody and in the end, it really touched me.",/review/rw6932306/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2018,fuderiki,9," Not for everyone, but a masterpiece nonetheless.
","So basically, this is an adaptation of the darkest manga of Go Nagai: DevilMan.
Go Nagai was also creating TV Shows for kids (like Gurendaizer - Goldorak -, BomberX and Mazinger Z), so a manga as dark, crude and violent as DevilMan from the same author can be quite unsettling. However, the anti-war theme that we find in most works of Nagai is present here nonetheless, yet the exposition of this discourse involves a lot of disturbing violence. Graphically, this adaptation may look quite different from the original work of Nagai, it is narratively very faithful to the source material. The storyline follows the manga, but modernizes a lot of things in the storytelling. Smartphones, internet, social networks, among other things are included seamlessly in the plot without denaturing it, on the contrary, it adds a lot to the message of the original work. The unique animation and direction style of Yuasa adds a lot to the freshness of the overall experience. ",/review/rw6932306/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2019,tonymars-63087,10," Amazing piece of work
","Don't usually gush over anime anymore but Netflix has been bringing it lately. Great story, amazing art work, and a little cerebral to boot.",/review/rw6932306/?ref_=tt_urv

","Devilman crybaby is a really sad anime and should have more episodes, but still I love it",/review/rw6932306/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2018,the_donnie,10," Don't try to find reason within this epic anime, just enjoy the endless power of imagination that comes from animes
","After watching all the 10 episodes, it took me 5 days to realize how good this tv show is when I just ignored the rationale that my brain was seeking. We are so used to these amazing twisted plot in other tv shows that we often forget to appreciate the simple imaginary and creative things, that's what the Devilman: Crybaby brought to me. As an adult (28), I just let myself go back to my imaginary child self, where I'd create stories and don't give a ""duck"" if that make sense or not.
And yet, this tv show let me be taken away by a hopeless sentiment towards humanity. Then, now I just look at it and appreciate this kind of art. Animes are my child imagination coming to life, if I let it be.",/review/rw6932306/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2018,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,7," Good; just not great like everyone's making it out to be.
","Devilman Crybaby is an interesting show to say the least; it's a modernised adaptation of Go Nagai's classic manga, Devilman, from the 70s; and boy what a change from the source material's aesthetic this went through. Devilman: Crybaby is an interesting slice of animation from Netflix; it's not an American import but rather a Japanese anime that was exclusively licensed for the Netflix service. It starts off strongly with its edgy and fast-paced premiere episode, but for me it fizzled out around episodes 2 & 3, and then started picking up the pace and focus again by episode 6. It's tonally uneven at times and doesn't seem to focus on any one given thing in the story, but it's still an ambitious effort nonetheless.",/review/rw6932306/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2018,cognitivelapse,10," Pretty amazing from many different standpoints
","I have not watched any of the previous Devilman movies/series/read the manga. Actually, I randomly stumbled upon this and decided to watch the first episode. And all I have to say is WOW. 
The art is awesome. 
The story is awesome. 
The psychological aspect of the anime is awesome (Black Mirror-esque). ",/review/rw6932306/?ref_=tt_urv

13 January 2018,TheDonaldofDoom,3," Tits and gore
","Devilman Crybaby is like a 12-year-old's understanding of what a mature show would be like. There are no mature themes, it's just generic demon battles with added tits and blood and gore. If you take that away you have nothing. The characters are flat and generic. The demons are generic. The plot is no more than demon battles.",/review/rw6932306/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2021,spainahmad,10," Masterpiece in only 10 episodes!
","10 episodes of greatness, not a single boring episode. I still can't believe it was only 10 episodes, the story and characters were top notch. This anime sticks with you, which is very rare for a short anime. Plus, the soundtracks are AMAZING! This is literally a must watch for EVERYONE *not for minors*",/review/rw6932306/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2021,AviB4087,8," Almost perfect
","Devilman: Crybaby is a really good anime that I would recommend watching if you are an adult (there are really mature themes in this show, so I would recommend children to stay away).",/review/rw6932306/?ref_=tt_urv

17 May 2021,Patrillion,10," A extremely beautify, extremely painful journey
","I loved every single episode. The show is like a moving painting, and all of its themes really stuck a cord with me. Some of it is hard to understand and downright painful to watch, but this is a show that will stick with me for a long time.",/review/rw6932306/?ref_=tt_urv
