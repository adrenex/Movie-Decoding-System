22 March 2022,Xavier_Stone,1," God awful camera work. Ok acting, trash story riddled with errors.
","Once you get through the entry setup it quickly jumps right into the bank heist. The are portrayed as clueless, yet the Boss Jake has loads of expensive toys from his successful robbing career.",/review/rw8102076/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2022,aramsdale,1," I NEEDED AN AMBULANCE AFTER THIS
","Michael Bay has made more rubbish films than good. The studios should stop giving him ridiculous budgets because he's just gonna spend it on smashing up as many vehicles as the budget will allow, regardless of trying to entertain the audience with anything resembling a decent film.",/review/rw8102076/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2022,gareth-75442,1," Michael Bay-master of crapola
","The only director that can have a thousand insane things happening on screen at the same time and still the movie is boring and dull, story is stupid and plot is nonsensical and probably the worst melodramatic music ever.",/review/rw8102076/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2022,cdcrb,1," stoopid!
","This is the dumbest film i have ever seen. If you don't believe me, plunk down your money and see for yourself. The fascinating thing is that you stick around just to see what stupid thing happens next. The real problem is jake. He's just not the bad guy type. How many cop cars does it take to stop an ambulance? A lot more than you think.",/review/rw8102076/?ref_=tt_urv

3 May 2022,CinemaClown,," More Exhausting Than Exhilarating
","Stylishly directed, jam-packed with chases and keeping the fun aspect alive for the most part if not all the way, Ambulance moves into top gear relatively quick and never takes the foot off the pedal once it gets going but the road it takes to reach its destination ends up being longer than what the gas in the tank can handle, thus resulting in a ride that's running on fumes way before the end is in sight.",/review/rw8102076/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2022,mm-39,3," Dumb, dumber, and even more dumber!
","Dumb, dumber, and even more dumber! Ambulance is one those thrill rides you watch for the thrill for the first time. Years latter or the second time you watch Ambulance and says this is so stupid. Ambulance is a mix of the movie Heat and Speed all in one. There is the Woke characters, and the brothers from different mothers theme which is shows Hollywood is dying from running out of ideas. There is a bank robbery turned into a Ambulance jack. With chases with Ambulance surgery done online by an E M T. After that a drug cartel workout with a plan of several Ambulance as an escape plan. This over top attempts tires to over come flat characters from the usual Hollywood stereotypes. Drug cartels guys, tough E M T women, the army vet black guy trying help his family, which has the same old just done over and over in so many different ways. In spite of this a thrill ride which is fun to watch for first time, Ambulance is a desperate attempt to re do another Lethal Weapon, Taken, and Die Hard type movie. So over the top it's different, but the usual flat characters mixed with little story makes this a B movie. 3 stars.",/review/rw8102076/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2022,Birminghamukengland,1," Should come with a warning, horrendous camera work.
",I lasted for 60 minutes.,/review/rw8102076/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2022,3xHCCH,4," Crazy Action Flick with Uneven Pacing
","Lately, Jake Gyllenhaal had been tackling very high-strung excitable characters, like supervillain Mysterio in ""Spider-Man: Far from Home"" (2019) and the troubled 911 operator in ""The Guilty"" (2021). His character Danny Sharp here was really a scary, crazy guy who simply snapped as things did not go his way on this particular day, when his perfectly-laid plans miscarried and was unraveling in the worst possible way.",/review/rw8102076/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2022,deloudelouvain,3," Bad is an understatement.
","You can see they had a budget for this movie, with big action scenes that must have cost a lot, but that's not a guarantee for success. Quite the opposite I would say, as Ambulance started okay to quickly lose every credibility it might have had. The story is full of holes or scenes that just don't make much sense. Whomever wrote this plot, these dialogues, should just stop immediately with that and find himself another job. I heard McDonalds is hiring so maybe that's an option for him. Michael Bay should just quit movie making, it's just awful what he does with that much money. I normally do like Jake Gyllenhaal but this must be the worst movie he ever appeared in. The cast wasn't bad but with a script like that it's just impossible to do something good. The more the story went on the lesser stars I was going to rate it. Three stars is actually still too much, but considering the cast I'll leave it at that. In short, Ambulance looks like a high budget movie but feels like a very low budget movie. The only really good thing about this movie is when the end credits appeared. Finally I could start forgetting everything about this monstrosity.",/review/rw8102076/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2022,NosCustodimus,2," Unsure Which is Shakier, the Cam or the Script
",What should be a fun action flick becomes literally unwatchable as the overuse of shaky cam causes even more headaches and eye rolls than a plot with holes big enough to drive an ambulance through.,/review/rw8102076/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2022,TruthbeTold2626,3," More garbage from Bay
",I made it 20 minutes and turned this hunk of crap off. This director needs to go away and retire. His movies have been garbage since like 2000. Do yourself a favor and skip this.,/review/rw8102076/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2022,sos_poseidon,1," Lame.
","No idea why the talented Jake Gyllenhaal would want to be in this mess of a movie. Cardboard cutout characters who utter painfully stupid dialogue in an underdeveloped plot. Its attempt to pay homage to paramedics, police officers, and surgeons is obvious and eye roll worthy. The most laughable scene is an operation being performed in the back of the ambulance while FaceTiming with a surgeon who is on a golf course and he's walking them through it. No wait - maybe its the paramedic using her hair clip to clamp a squirting artery. Not kidding. It's THAT bad!",/review/rw8102076/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2022,sbweightman,8," A very enjoyable and entertaining action thriller.
","A very enjoyable and entertaining film with lots of Michael Bay's signature style and an outlandish plot. It effectively builds up the tension and manages it keep it high for a long time, punctuated with light hearted moments during the stress and very little down time. It does get quite silly in the second half, but it seems to embrace the absurdity which makes the film even more entertaining. There's plenty of action, police procedural moments and cars being smashed up, but also the physical and emotional conflict between the characters within the ambulance itself. Their backstories are rather clich√©, but the acting performances are strong and overall, the production is very well done.",/review/rw8102076/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2022,kosmasp,7," Am-Bay-lance
","So another Jake Gyllenhaal remake of a Scandinavian movie. This one a lot older than the phone only movie that was released last year. Therefor I couldn't remember much of the original, but it didn't actually matter ... because this is completely different from the original movie ... this is as out there as it can be. It has been turned into a Bay movie ... the premise more or less is the same. Even there have been tweaks (the brothers, the dynamic, why they do ... what they do ... where they go and so much more) ... so much that you can't really recognize the original movie anymore.",/review/rw8102076/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2022,john-lancia-1,1," So bad its...
","...just bad. I was laughing my ass off at the movie for roughly the first half. It was just so ridiculous. Then it started taking itself too seriously, characters got killed off or forgotten about. It was just a mess.",/review/rw8102076/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2022,FeastMode,7," This is the definition of a nonstop thrill ride
","Michael Bay is back to his old ways. This is an extremely enjoyable popcorn movie. It can be characterized as a mindless action flick. But as I always say, I don't mind mindless if it entertains me. And I was fully entertained. I found myself smiling for most of the movie, constantly at the edge of my seat.",/review/rw8102076/?ref_=tt_urv

24 April 2022,akira-hideyo,1," Speed 3
",Massive waste of resources both mechanical and human. Absurd and unbelievable concept. Interactive insanity between the main characters. The real shocker is that it's more than 2 hours of madness and a Michael Bay movie.,/review/rw8102076/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2022,thesar-2,2," Don't Chase It
","I don't think this was the worst Michael Bay movie. I think it's a Michael Bay Parody of a Michael Bay movie. Bay's Lady in the Water, if you will.",/review/rw8102076/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2022,eliaemil,1," MIcheal Bay transforms to Micheal Bye
","I can not believe the one who made Armageddon rock Pearl Harbor twenty-five to fifteen years ago, made such a .... movie. For God's sake, do not make a film when there is no script. The whole story is absurd. A big orchestra for a small childish script.",/review/rw8102076/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2022,brionesb,1," Michael Bay at his worst
","I had a really hard time convincing myself to stay and finish this movie when I saw it. The story & plot itself is silly, which I expected based on the trailers and how paper thin the setup is but visually this was headache inducing.",/review/rw8102076/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2022,namie-98193,3," Worst camera works in history!

29 April 2022,Fredolow,2," Bay tries to do 'Heat' - fails miserably
","'Ambulance' is a terrible montage of vomit inducing camerawork. It's pretty much unwatchable because of that alone. If the camera isn't too close in, it's either waving around erratically in a poor attempt to make scenes look like they have action, at some absurd angle that makes no sense (i.e. On the floor looking up people's noses), or a sickening FPV drone view flying down the side of buildings just because it can. It's bad, and I mean really bad. It's like watching a 2+hr pop video on steroids. The end result is a jumbled mess with zero viewer engagement. Bay should be ashamed of this mess. His cinematographer more so.",/review/rw8102076/?ref_=tt_urv
