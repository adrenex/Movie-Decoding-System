22 April 2020,howboutthisone_huh,9," eerily funny
","Once when I was starting out as a software engineer, I worked for an aerospace company. They paid a lot of money to relocate me to another city but the first day I started, the contract I was supposed to work on was canceled and so they told me to sit at a table outside the software development manager's office until they found another project for me. This was before cellphones, and tablets and laptops and mostly desktop computers. I had nothing to do for a month and when my table was overrun by other engineers in the same predicament I was usually down at the corporate library because that was the only place with a chair and desk I could sit at. I didn't want to make it appear as if I was useless. I mean, I just moved 2000 miles, so instead of bringing in books to read, I sat there for about a month reading the same corporate engineering manual, over and over and over. After about a month I was assigned to a project but things didn't get much better. I found out there was a pecking order to the programmers according to what their workspace looked like. On budget scraping projects, engineers were typically forced to work in a room without enough chairs or desks. I say desks loosely because sometimes they just had tables, sometimes card tables. Every day it was first come, first served. Anyway, the point is that we used to refer to a room full of engineers as a bullpen and the work the engineers produced under those conditions, well, bs. When I finally got a cubicle to work in, it was heaven. Fast forward 10 years and thanks to silicon valley, cubicles became bad and bullpens became good. Some genius figured out how to convince developers to work in a bullpen in order to save money on office furniture. And they figured out that they could pay these people less money if they provided them with free processed food and drinks. Pay them less, and take part of the savings to buy cheap junk food to give them so you can take away any reason they should be away from their desk or work a normal 8 hour day like everyone else and go home. That's the software development world for you, particularly silicon valley. Or, at least the image of silicon valley that everyone tries to reproduce.",/review/rw5218599/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2014,cadillac20,9," Hilarious and Scathing
","Silicon Valley is a TV show that was much talked about even before it's debut on HBO. With the Silicon Valley now finding a Hollywood-like atmosphere in the way it's viewed, the entertainment industry's focus on Silicon Valley and it's unique lifestyle and culture is somewhat new and has yet to find it's equilibrium of representation between the reality of the innovation happening there and the bizarre, comedy ammunition that lies in some of the more eccentric aspects. Mike Judge's Silicon Valley is a damn good start. It's witty and scathing, and takes an sarcastic approach to it with an outsider's eye. Of course, Mike Judge is no outsider, having worked in Palo Alto during the late 80's, and his disdain for it's people and culture shows.",/review/rw5218599/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2020,djanimartinov,8," Easy watch , addictive and actually wholesome and funny
","Deserves about a 8.7 . Really flows well , creates a good sense of accomplishment as the story progresses . Likeable characters , unpredictable funny jokes and moments (which is hard to find now a days ) . I also like that the episodes are 30 minutes , they keep it short enough to not make it too focussed on story yet long enough to not make it feel rushed and over filled with 1 liners. Overall a really easy watch as it doesn't require a lot of focus like other hbo shows , and it flows so easy that it becomes addictive as others have mentioned and has a certain likeablity that brings it together without force .",/review/rw5218599/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2020,kjproulx,9," One of the Best Television Comedies
","When it comes to Comedy on television, people seem to flock back to classics like Friends or Seinfeld. Before Netflix took over the industry, HBO held the standard for one of the greatest ways to watch new shows. They have proven time and time again that their content is of the highest value. For the most part, every time I start a new show distributed by HBO, I find myself hooked and eager to see more. Recently concluded, I discovered the show Silicon Valley about a year ago and it rapidly became one of my favourite shows. Here's why, if you haven't had the chance to watch it, you absolutely should.",/review/rw5218599/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2021,Supermanfan-13,9," So much funnier than I thought it would be!
",Silicon Valley was so much funnier that I originally thought it would be! I never watched it when it was originally on but recently I thought I'd give it a chance after hearing about how good it was for years. I'm glad I did! It had a perfect cast that made this one of the funnier and more underrated tv shows HBO has ever created. Every episode will keep you laughing as much as the previous ones!,/review/rw5218599/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2020,peter-laganis,8," Considering all the 6 seasons it's a solid 8/10
","It could have been a 9 or even a 10, but it lacks of character development and tends to repeat itself.
Don't get me wrong. The characters (especially the duo Gilfoyle-Dinesh) are extraordinary and well depicted, but they don't grow along the episodes. They are somehow glued to a repetitive story format.
Richard is a magnet for problems and akward situations, Gilfoyle is the clever and cynical genius, Dinesh is Gilfoyle's perfect counterweight, Erlich has some rare lucid moments and becomes annoying by smoking from his pot, Jared is the good samaritan ""having sex"" ...
Despite those two negative points, this is an intelligent warm tv-show with a gorgeous and humorous venture of an IT company
In conclusion: If you have ever worked for an IT company you will definitely enyoj watching it.",/review/rw5218599/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2019,bootsyjam,8," Fantastic but gets repetitive in Seasons 4 and 5

14 May 2014,OmarHartwellWhite,8," Best Comedy CURRENTLY Airing on TV
","I was a little skeptical about this show at first and went into with the impression that I would try it but it would lose my interest after an episode or two. This show so far has been a wonderful surprise. Unlike some comedies that create forced, awkward situations that are only funny to the recorded laugh track that plays, I have burst out laughing from a number of scenes that have aired in the few episodes so far. It is very original, smart, has a believable story and characters and has many funny moments with quite a few scenes that will catch you off guard and you will die laughing. At first this was just a show I was DVR'ing then watching at some point during the week maybe a few days later. However the last few episodes have been great and I have been watching live while it airs because it isn't a stupid comedy, it keeps you interested with a pretty good story.",/review/rw5218599/?ref_=tt_urv

",Silicon Valley was so much funnier that I originally thought it would be. I never watched it when it was originally on tv but recently I thought I'd finally give it a chance after hearing about how good it was for years. I'm so glad that I did! I just finished season 4 and can't wait for the final 2 seasons. I have to admit I didn't care for it that much after the first few episodes but stuck with it and it just continued to get better and better and before you know it you're invested in these characters and care what happens to them. It had a perfect cast that made this one of the funnier and more underrated tv shows HBO has ever created. Every episode will keep you laughing as much as the previous ones.,/review/rw5218599/?ref_=tt_urv

9 January 2021,grantss,8," Great comedy that works as a drama too
","Working out of a shared house in San Francisco, Richard Hendricks and his team are working on creating revolutionary technology. But first he and his company, Pied Piper, need to navigate the maze of hurdles, back-stabbings and setbacks systemic to technology start-ups, some of which come from competitors but many come from trusted sources.",/review/rw5218599/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2019,SnoopyStyle,9," fun with heart
","Richard Hendricks (Thomas Middleditch), Nelson 'Big Head' Bighetti (Josh Brener), Bertram Gilfoyle (Martin Starr), and Dinesh Chugtai (Kumail Nanjiani) are poor working programmers struggling to build the next big thing, Piped Pipper. Erlich Bachman (T.J. Miller) is the arrogant homeowner who sees himself as incubator for new programmers with 10% interest. Richard and Big Head's day job is working for Hooli under self-important CEO Gavin Belson (Matt Ross). Monica Hall (Amanda Crew) works for VC Peter Gregory and later awkwardly cold Laurie Bream (Suzanne Cryer).

30 November 2020,chintu-10596,9," Excellent tv show
",One of the tv show which showcases exact scenes from the tech world. Greatly written story about the real life tech world. All the storylines are perfect on how the techies face problems in real life and the issues the tech entrepreneurs would face in the real life. Fine performances by the actors mainly Middleditch. Along with the knowledge content in the story it also equally has nice comedy timing and humour.,/review/rw5218599/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2017,reidkenj,6," Potential for so much better
","I just LOVE most of the characters. There is so much good stuff going on, but every episode ends the same. Here we go. EPISODE #? - EVERYTHING IS GOING GREAT WITH PIED PIPER. - EPISODE#?, 'after 40 minutes, the company is worth ????? million, and nothing could be better. - Until - 43 minutes, by some strange twist, everything has fallen apart, and the company has gone to the dogs. - AGAIN! How long can this story go on? It is just far to predictable. There are only ever two different scenarios for every episode. - Either the company and everyone is multi, multi millionaires, or they have not got a pot to piddle in.",/review/rw5218599/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2019,fciocca,6," First 1/2 seasons are good and funny, but ends up to be a show with too many episodes
","The show starts really good: is funny, refreshing, it jokes about the Silicon Valley reality, by mocking really big personalities in the tech world like Steve Jobs (you can clearly see it on the season 1 poster), or big tech corporate companies such as Google and Amazon. I even liked all the nerdy and absurd situations that happen to this group of guys that are trying to rise in a very competitive market, some moments are hilarious.",/review/rw5218599/?ref_=tt_urv

20 January 2020,perica-43151,7," Initially great, but quickly becoming repetitive and ending uninspired
","This series had great promise and fresh taste initially, but after only a few seasons, lost its inspiration and became repetitive and ultimately quite underwhelming. Still, it is often intelligent and respects its audience, but also becomes routine and often nonsensical. Could not survive the abandonment by T.J. Miller for more that one season, but he abandoned the show because already by the 3rd season, the series started to lose its considerable initial charm. In the end, the series served as an increasingly starving cash cow, and imploded by losing its point, but at least it was relatively quick if ugly death.",/review/rw5218599/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2018,drm2642,5," Even When They Win They Lose
","I watched the first 2 seasons of this show and made it a couple episodes into season 3 before I had to stop. I want to start by saying that at times this show is absolutely hilarious. I especially like T.J. Miller, Martin Starr, and Zach Woods. Woods in particular shows his range as he plays such a different character than Gabe (The Office). Gabe was creepy. His character on this show is funny and at times even lovable. ""Did you know you speak German in your sleep?""",/review/rw5218599/?ref_=tt_urv

11 May 2022,greenjackle,9," Great show worth watching multiple times.
","I watched this as it came out. Then watched it twice more over a span of 6 years. I got bone cancer in 2016 and became permanently disabled. So I do nothing but watch TV and Movies. This show is great except one thing. I use to be a IT Manager, Project Manager, System Admin, Server Engineer Admin, AD Forest Architect, Security Engineer and Security Design Architect. No one will hire a disabled person after applying to over 1,000 jobs come to find out. However I know technology and Richard is the worse. Richard constantly screws up simply things and should only be a CTO or CIO but never a CEO. A Guy like that should never be a CEO. He is super childish and has no life skills. I honestly can't believe that the other people even stay with him. However this show is super funny and worth watching.",/review/rw5218599/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2014,byanoski,9," Great!
","Great pilot episode. I love entrepreneurship, silicon valley and that whole tech culture so I was really excited about this show. I was very impressed with it. Lots of laughs, really accurate to the geek world of programmers and the characters are normal. They aren't glorified in any way which I really like.",/review/rw5218599/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2020,leftbanker-1,10," Dark, Intelligent Humor and Fantastic Characters
","I turned this down when it first came out, like a venture capitalist passing on a promising start-up. I didn't give it much of a chance because I think that I probably watched five whole minutes before turning it off, for whatever reason I had way back then. My brother recently binged the entire series and told me that I needed to give it another try.",/review/rw5218599/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2019,UniqueParticle,10," Love this Nerdtastic show!
","Sophisticated dialogue and great cast! Crazy how the final season started now I am gonna miss it, I miss T. J. Miler. I really like Martin Starr and everyone else. Mike Judge is one of my favorite famous people, I'm glad he's one of the writers/creators/directors. Quite a lot of brilliant business related stuff, hilarious scenes, and delightful soundtrack! Also love the horsing around through out!",/review/rw5218599/?ref_=tt_urv
