7 July 2011,planktonrules,9," The folks from South Park bite the hand that fed them....cool.
","I wonder if anyone was offended by this film?! Well, like any production by the South Park team of Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the answer is yup... After all, ""Team America"" is loaded with tons of expletives, really dirty puppet sex (funny puppet sex, actually) and it attacks Hollywood's self-appointed elite in a way no other film has. Yes, it will offend...and make folks laugh as long as they don't take it all very seriously.",/review/rw2365469/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2019,andrewjdavis-home,10," Stupid, purile, offensive, I loved it
","I genuinely have no idea how someone could give this movie less than 10. I have watched it once every couple of years since it came out and I am still in awe of so many of the scenes after all this time. You just need to say ""Jean pierre"", ""terrorise this"",""Hans Brix"", ""the signal"",""suck my..."",""three types of people"" and I am mentally replaying each scene crying with laughter.
A true masterpiece, python for the 21st century",/review/rw2365469/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2004,dee.reid,10," Puppet Politics
","""Team America: World Police"" is a great sendoff to one of the most turbulent times in American history, and ""South Park"" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, both equal opportunity offenders, pull no strings (no pun intended) with this hilarious and blazingly satiric model of the United States and its supposed role in world affairs.",/review/rw2365469/?ref_=tt_urv

15 June 2019,conmech,9," Thank You For Making This Film
","I was wondering why this movie never had a sequel because it looks like a no-brainer. Unfortunately I realized the makers of the movie hated making it because the puppets were hard to work with, the movie didn't make bring too much money, and there was a lot of critical backlash, even the liberal actors hated it.
I feel like the movie was made just for me. First of all, I never laughed at a movie this hard for years. Everything is great about this movie. How they worked on the animatronics, the references, easter eggs, THE SONGS. Trey Parker is just a natural talent. Plus, I appreciate it as a person living in the middle east, because it's still the best movie which pokes fun at USA claiming to bring peace to the middle east while invading it for its own benefit, and actually bringing more misery.
So once again, thank you guys for everything.",/review/rw2365469/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2007,claudio_carvalho,8," Hilarious Satire to the Contemporary World
","The North American anti-terrorist force Team America attacks a group of terrorist in Paris. Later, the leader of the organization, Spottswoode, invites the famous Broadway actor Gary Johnston to join his world police and work undercover in Cairo in a terrorist organization and disclose their plan of destroying the world. The Team America destroys the cell of terrorists, but then the Panama Canal is attacked by the criminals as a payback. Gary feels responsible for the death of many innocents and leaves the counter-terrorism organization. When the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong II, joins a group of pacifist actors and actresses with the intention of using weapons of massive destruction, the Team America tries to avoid the destruction of the world.",/review/rw2365469/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2004,the_insainiak,," Funny!
","As much as I hate to admit it, Trey Parker and Matt Stone are actually quite talented in a sick twisted, strange, little way. After laughing my butt off during South Park Bigger, Longer & Uncut, I couldn't wait to see this movie. I was not disappointed.",/review/rw2365469/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2004,caspian1978,7," Kim Jong Il on a string
","It's not Gone With the Wind, but it is a great movie! Parker & Stone push the envelope again and again in this off the wall comedy that would make Jim Henson stand up and cheer. Any comedy that portrays Kim Jong Il as a lonely, confused and mad dictator deserves an audience. The creators of South Park pock fun at politics, celebrities, terrorism, James Bond, and puppets, while also creating a funny and well done musical soundtrack that is better than the South Park Musical / Comedy. Off the wall for most of the movie, the puppets having sex only is worth accepting this movie into the cinematic hall of fame. The vomit scene, the death of Kim Jong Il, the musical score, the montage parody and the production value are all worth it. A movie for all South Park fans, this blows (literally) Base-ket Ball out of the theater.",/review/rw2365469/?ref_=tt_urv

","Fans of Parker and Stone's prior efforts will both love this, and know what to expect from this. Politically, no group is left unsatirized: from the idiotic faux-country patriotic music, to know-it-all leftie actors being portrayed as goon puppets (the more self-important members of the Tim Robbins and Sean Penn fan clubs may want to skip this), no group escapes without being ridiculed.",/review/rw2365469/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2012,lesleyharris30,9," Shows Trey Parker and Matt Stone can and should Do More,
","Team America World Police is a hilarious movie from the same genius minds that brought us South Park, Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Since this film, the two haven't done anything outside of South Park because of the box office results of this film, but that shouldn't matter to them because Team America was well received. If they made a second one it would probably be successful. They should do more outside of the South Park series, such as another South Park movie, another Team America, or a completely different new series or movie, because they are hilarious and as much as I love South Park, I think they should do some more outside of the show.",/review/rw2365469/?ref_=tt_urv

6 February 2010,TheLittleSongbird,7," Extremely rude but often hilarious satire
","Team America:World Police does have its flaws but it is a hilarious and exceptionally crafted satire. It is very easy to be offended by this sort of film, as this film pokes fun at everybody and everything and is not kind about it. And I do admit the plot is a little obvious, some scenes like the vomit sequence are drawn out a bit too much and some(heavy emphasis on this word) of the writing goes overboard. But it is very funny, with some genuinely hysterical moments especially the lampooning of Hollywood stars and works surprisingly well as a satire with clear sardonic wit in places. Technically and visually, this film is exceptional, the backgrounds, puppetry and lighting are all superb and award worthy. The music is also excellent, and there is some great vocal work. Overall, Team America:World Police isn't for everyone, I for one had to see it a few times to completely get what was going on. It is flawed, but it is very well done as a satire. 7/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2365469/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2004,Quinoa1984,7," an instant cult comedy hit (emphasis on 'cult', won't be for everyone)
","Trey Parker and Matt Stone, at least for what they know as comedians and filmmakers, do their jobs well for their intended audience. The people who will want to see this are likely already fans via South Park, or perhaps by way of Cannibal: the Musical! or BASEketball. And like their past projects, they incorporate everything they can work with (i.e. the most extreme exaggerations imaginable by way of influences of Monty Python, Broadway musicals, Troma, and the presence of celebrities in the media) and take it a step further. By looking at just the idea of having a film where every single speaking or non-speaking role are made by puppets on strings (first parody being Thunderbirds, which luckily doesn't wear off as a novelty but stays fresh through numerous visual gags) brings to question if they're trying to make a big social point about the state of the world, or if they just want to try something new, challenging, and wacky. The latter might be the more rightful argument.",/review/rw2365469/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2004,froboz,10," Brilliant puppet movie
","I love South Park and the straight-faced satire of Matt Parker and Trey Stone. They always have a humanist and old-fashioned naturalist approach to show the weaknesses in the limited and fashionable ideas in modern USA. They do their satire not by exposure, but by explosion: the ideas blow up in your face. Like when Matt Stone himself, interviewed in ""Making Of South Park"", says: ""you know, we expect a lot of our people, but when they show up at the office, we're already there, and when they leave, we're still there, you know what I mean, and they can see how hard we work, and that, I think that inspires them, to work all the harder, for us"". He delivers this line with such a straight face that you are lured into a semiautomatic approval of Calvinist work ethics, even if you know he's just joking. You might at times even feel insecure about where the satire ends: is it a joke about a joke? What does Matt and Trey *actually* think? *Do* they come first to the office every morning? You can't even save yourself by rolling the eyes and saying ""of course not, you fool"".",/review/rw2365469/?ref_=tt_urv

31 December 2004,ablobofbrowngoo,8," Oh you guys are bad
","I'm sure plenty of parochial critics will berate this film for anti-American values during the current ""war on terror""....BUT...the great thing about this film is that no one is spared being mocked. This bears the standard of a great film by expressing the ironies innate in every argument in this quasi-political tale; from socialist Michael Moore, fashionably charitable celebrities to the terrorists and the, ahem ""world police."" This couldn't be more accurately summed up than in one of the funniest ever analogies that is employed in this film; the ""Dic*s, P*ssies, and a*s*holes, argument."" This film also wonderfully parodies the standard conventions and cliché's of the action film genre to create an entertaining, and gleefully controversial film.",/review/rw2365469/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2011,johnnyboyz,7," Unrelenting in its ability to play up to contemporary politics, Parker and Stone's spoof on all things that make America ""great"" is as damning as it is funny.
","Team America: World Police opens in a similar vein to that of the South Park film from five years earlier; those crafty, playful, devilish little animators turned surprisingly apt film-makers Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker beginning with a puppet show within a puppet show; a badly done, poorly executed display of characters on strings attempting to walk across the simplest of sets but doing so crassly. We pull back, the film then revealing a functioning and workable enough little set complete with puppets on strings. The opening recalls that of the establishing shot of the mountain peak in the South Park film of 1999; a composition which, in any other film, animated or otherwise, would have looked majestic in all its natural beauty; there, seemingly pasted together with little more than some blue, green and white card. The opening set the shameless, but reigned in, tone for the film; a real disregard on behalf of Stone and Parker linked to any sort of issues or problems you might have with levels of competence in the piece. Team America: World Police is no different; an up-front and stark tackling of the contemporary politics which dominate our global climate; a brutally effective, blackly comic film which is unashamed and forthright in its study but wonderful anyhow.",/review/rw2365469/?ref_=tt_urv
