","I had a feeling that the title was propaganda to get me into the seats. After all, Wonder Woman was one of 2017's best pictures, so I figure the title of this movie (as well as the well done poster) was a way to get butts into the seats. Not that I want my money back, cause it was an excellent movie. It was lots of fun and it made me chuckle a lot of times, but if your here because you want to learn more about Wonder Woman, the movie is not designed like that specifically.

24 April 2018,justin-fencsak,8," If you liked wonder woman you'll love this...
","When Wonder Woman made her live action big screen debut on opening weekend, a teaser for a movie based on the life of the creator and his relationship with his wife and her friends made the rounds causing lots of buzz. The thing is, the movie was better than the teaser. It's very accurate based on the time period and the casting is great. Unlike the wonder woman movie, this one is not for kids. It's rated R for sex and nudity and it shows. Luke Evans plays the lead role as Prof. Marston, who created the lie detector test and is on his way to create a game changing female super hero who would become the most famous of them all: Wonder Woman. I'm surprised that this movie didn't get any Oscar love (same for Wonder Woman 2017). Give this one a rental and see for yourself how wonderful this movie is.",/review/rw4071599/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2019,siderite,8," A beautiful film, but a flawed interpretation of reality
","The Marston in the movie says truth is important and that is why that's Wonder Woman's greatest weapon. Yet, in the film, the actors are amazingly beautiful compared to the real life counterparts, their histories are altered and the story focuses only on some more exotic aspects of what happened. All that said, it is the truth that the writer and director Angela Robinson wanted to express and she did it very well. The love scenes are inspiring and the actors do a wonder-ful job.",/review/rw4071599/?ref_=tt_urv

The first kind are the ones that almost seem obligatory – your Gandhi's (1982), your Lincoln's (2012) and the upcoming Darkest Hour (2017); movies about historical giants who did truly incredible things with their lives, incredible things that should be projected (and even embellished) on the silver screen for the world to see.

","I wasn't aware that the comic book heroine Wonder Woman arose from such controversial beginnings. Sticking around to the very end of the movie you get a glimpse of the real Dr. William Moulton Marston, and one has to wonder how he wound up with two women attracted to him, though to be fair, those women didn't look like Rebecca Hall and Bella Heathcote either. Ostensibly cast for their appeal to modern day viewers, I tried to picture less favorable looking players in the story and it just didn't work. I won't say I was shocked by the depiction of Marston's life style with his wife and lover, but the first time I heard the f-word out of Elizabeth Marston's (Hall) mouth, I had a pretty good idea that it was used for shock value and not really an accurate representation of dialog in the 1920's and 30's. Such language, particularly it's frequent repetition, didn't ring true as the story played out. ",/review/rw4071599/?ref_=tt_urv

4 February 2018,kjproulx,8," An Untold Story Worth Knowing
","Wonder Woman was a hit as a comic book in the past and recently a hit at cinemas around the world, so if this story was going to hit the mainstream, it only makes sense that now's the time. It seems as though more and more true stories are being made into films, and this may just be for me personally, but unique and original films seem to be dwindling down and more sequels and remakes taking their place. I believe that filmmakers choose to make true stories nowadays because the lack of original or interesting content is hard to come by, so things that have happened out in the real world seems like a safe bet that people will find enjoyable, for the most part. Quite frankly, I just thought Wonder Woman was made by a man who liked superheroes, but there's much more to it than that. If you wish to be intrigued by a story that's consistently surprising, then Professor Marston and the Wonder Women may just be the film for you.",/review/rw4071599/?ref_=tt_urv

","To all the people saying that this movie is inaccurate - DUH!! It's a feature film, NOT a documentary!! Do you know what a feature film is? It means it has a script writer - someone who writes the story... who comes up with the lines... based on their own imagination. Of course 90% of the stuff in that movie didn't happen. None of us were there at that time!! They have to make that stuff up. Otherwise, how else are they supposed to make an interesting movie?? If they don't come up with an interesting story you'll complain about how boring it was. If they come up with something interesting that's even slightly fictional the history police goes nuts with their crazy ""the movie is inaccurate!!!"" comments.

31 July 2018,harry_tk_yung,," The original
","When I compared today's Wonder Woman (made globally-famous by the incredible Gal Gadot) with the one I knew back in the early 1960's and noted the vast difference, I didn't know that there was an ""original"" that was even more different. That is, not until I saw ""Professor Marston and the Wonder Woman"", a bio-pic that records an interesting piece of pop culture history.
The narrative structure is all too familiar: an interview and/or interrogation in 1945 during which the protagonist's responses become catalysts to flashbacks. Here, specifically, is Professor William Moulton Marston (Luke Evans) facing children's book expert Josette Frank's (Connie Britton), defending ""Wonder Woman"", his creation for DC Comics. The original version of Wonder Woman was condemned for its proliferation of BDSM, hence outrageously inappropriate for its target audience, children and young adults.
Embedded in the flashback, the movie is in two distinct halves. The first half traces the trajectory of the initial encounter and subsequent development of the polyamory threesome. The second half takes up the title story of the creation of Wonder Woman. 
The flashback starts with 1928 at Harvard where the psychology profession is teaching and conducting researches, assisted by his brilliant wife Elizabeth (Rebecca Hall), whose only obstacle against becoming his equal (or even superior) is that her being a woman. They notice a very attractive student Olive Byrne (Bella Heathcote). ""Her beauty is her albatross"" Elizabeth nonchalantly comments. Before they decide to hire Olive as an assistant, Elizabeth declares to her husband she bears no ""sexual jealousy"", only ""professional jealousy"". Yet, upon meeting Olive, she loses no time in uttering ""If you f*** my husband I'll kill you!"" In explanation to Olive, William describes his wife as ""neurotic, compulsive, grade A bitch"".
The somewhat eccentric couple soon realize that despite her mild manners and easy disposition, Olive is descended from ""two most famous woman radicals"" (mother and aunt). As well, Olive's quiet determination soon wins them over, to treat her more like an equal, temperamentally if not intellectually. Olive on the other hand finds out more about the Marston couple, that they had been childhood sweethearts. When he finally proposed to her, in was in the middle of a heated debate they were having on Carl Jung's theory. 
Gradually, climaxing at the mid-point of the moving, culminating in a series of stylishly erotic montages with the too-obviously titled song ""Feeling good"" as background, the three of them cement their relationship. There is a lesser subplot, about Marston's invention of the lie-detector. Purportedly, the facts are essentially correct. The device, however, is overused in the movie as a vehicle that triggers the protagonists' recognition of their true feelings towards one another.
The second half has two main themes. The first is the expected hostility from whatever neighborhood they try to settle in, against their somewhat unorthodox ""family"" (they now have three offspring, two from Olive and one from Elizabeth). The other is the creation of Wonder Woman, inspired by the beauty of Olive and the very different psychological strengths of both women. 
The controversy of BDSM (both evolving through the comic character and their real life), as depicted in the movie, is essentially BD and very little SM except for the mild ceremonial spanking very early on in Olive's sorority pledging. The well-hidden spectators, the Marston couple, are obviously aroused (particularly Elizabeth). 
As the movie is based on true events, there is a limit to how far dramatization (at time melodramatization) can go: vicissitudes, conflicts, illness, reconciliation. At the end, details of the lives of the three protagonists was disseminated in written captions prior to the ending credit. 
Hall and Heathcote both give good performances, particularly when watched together, in the contrast between the persona of these two women. There is one scene however they have difficulty with - the reconciliation scene at the end, which come across as a little awkward. But the problem is probably more with the script than with anything else. Evans, while not displaying any glaring flaw, is generally out-shined by his two co-stars.",/review/rw4071599/?ref_=tt_urv

23 February 2018,deloudelouvain,7," A love triangle
","Professor Marston and the Wonder Women is a nice biography, a story worth to be told about the inventor of the lie detector and the creator of the superhero Wonder Woman. I never heared of it before so that was a bonus for me. But there is more to it than just the story about his invention and his creation. It's also a love story, about a love triangle, and about dominance and submission. Nobody would take offence by that now but at that time it was something scandalous and unheared of. I can't see why someone couldn't love more than one person at once and that's what this story is about. Luke Evans, Rebecca Hall and Bella Heathcote are the actors playing the characters of the love triangle. Good-looking people and that's the funny thing about it. It's obviously a Hollywood production so the actors have to be good-looking. Because in the end credits you get to see some pictures of the real people from that time and the least you could say is that they were not as good-looking. I guess beauty sells better. Nevertheless Professor Marston and the Wonder Women is certainly worth watching.",/review/rw4071599/?ref_=tt_urv
