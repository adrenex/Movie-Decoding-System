15 January 2015,williampsamuel,9," A Delightfully Offbeat Comic Book Comedy
","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is probably as close as we'll come to having an experimental film released in theaters nationwide. This is one of the most innovative, original movies to come out in years. It's unlike anything I'd seen before. And yes, it is good, very good. I could not stop laughing the whole time.",/review/rw4976197/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2010,planktonrules,9," Wildly creative and fun...but probably NOT for all tastes...
","""Scott Pilgrim"" is one of the most creative, fresh and original films I have seen in ages, and because of that I was in absolute awe of the film. However, despite being a terrific film, I also understand that this is NOT a film that will appeal to everyone--in fact, it's probably one of the more polarizing films I have ever seen--you'll probably either love it or hate it. While I am NOT in the target demographic group (aged 15-30 and predisposed to loving graphic novels AND video games), I did enjoy it--and am probably the rare 40-something person who loved the film. What was different about me is that I am a geek (a definite plus), enjoy video games and have a rabid comic book fan for a daughter--so I understood many of the pop culture references throughout the film. But, if you are NOT a geek, hate video games and see graphic novels more as comic books, then the movie might be a chore to watch. Plus you might just feel ooky hanging out with geeks. Don't worry, they are almost all very nice people! ",/review/rw4976197/?ref_=tt_urv

","Scott Pilgrim versus the World is a Canadian romantic comedy and musical based on the comic books by Bryan Lee O'Malley. Scott Pilgrim is a 22y.o teen-age-looking insecure guy and guitarist who plays in a rock band called Sex Bom-omb and is going out with a minor high-school Chinese girl, Knives. He seems content until he has a dream about a girl. She happens to appear in his real world in the form of Ramona, the ever-changing-hair-colour American recently moved to Toronto. Scott is over the moon, but he has to face his own personal demons, break up with sweet Knives and fight for Ramona's love against her seven exes.",/review/rw4976197/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2010,Quinoa1984,10," 7,000,000 points for this movie: comic KO!
","Edgar Wright just keeps getting better as a director, and his latest offering after the good Shaun of the Dead and better Hot Fuzz is a kind of super-speed-surrealist take on young love and imagined video-game battles. It's a geek-storm of comedy, the kind of effort that we don't get too often in movies that are dictated down by committee and tested so much for laugh ratios. There are so many things that go on in a scene in this film that some of it will pass by your head. Or maybe not; maybe it's just the right tone for a combo platter of comic-book/anime/manga/8-bit-to-PS3-video-game movie that knows itself and knows its intended audience so well that it can be so POP in its sensibility. This is a super-comedy, suffused in melodramatic romance and fiery action, for people who still wonder what it's like to be surprised at the movies.",/review/rw4976197/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2010,freemantle_uk,9," An Epic of Epic Epicness
","After success in Britain making Spaced, Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, Edgar Wright has been given the chance to direct a Hollywood film, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. And Wright was does not disappoint with this action, comedy comic book adaptation.",/review/rw4976197/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2010,DonFishies,8," Edgar Wright's precious little movie
","Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is a twenty-something slacker living in Toronto, who basically leeches off his friends. Despite being in a ""relationship"" with Knives Chau (Ellen Wong), he keeps dreaming about another girl. He quickly finds out this dream girl, Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), is actually quite real, and decides to pursue her. But before they can truly become the couple Scott hopes for, he has to defeat her seven evil exes.",/review/rw4976197/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2010,Crys383-3,10," Epic indeed
","The tagline for this film is ""An Epic of Epic Epicness"" and I couldn't agree more. After waiting in line for 3 hours after last night's Comic-Con and finally being sat in the gorgeous Balboa Theater, I didn't know what to expect. I loved the comics and the previews looked faithful. The moment the movie starts (literally; the Universal logo and theme are 8-bit) you are thrown into a comic book atmosphere with video game references aplenty.",/review/rw4976197/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2010,wilderblue2005,8," Something unusually great
","I came to this films with no preconceptions of it as a movie and I have to say I am glad. I guess I was expecting another Michael Cera movie about some dopey kid in love. And thats what it is ... but done in a unusually great way. For anyone under 25 brought up on gaming (I am 30 and not) this will be just brilliant. The style of the movie with its ""end of level baddies"", game-play set-up and visuals are a welcome and refreshing twist on what could have been a hum-drum movie. The music rocked, the comedy was fast, slick and laugh out loud ... I'd definitely recommend this to my friends looking for something that little bit special.",/review/rw4976197/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2010,bennyhagen,8," Fantastic!
","Teenager problems (find yourself, get real, etc.) might not give anything to people considering themselves mayor adults, but consider this is a movie built on arcade video gaming motifs, I don't think it concerns mayor adults at all in the first place. I for one did not necessarily long for dark moral drama in this particular movie at all, I think the story was just about right for this movie, but you decide, if this is childish watch Haneke.",/review/rw4976197/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2011,TheLittleSongbird,9," One of my favourites of 2010
","I really enjoyed Scott Pilgrim vs.The World, and consider it one of my favourites of the year if not the best. The film is shot in a unique way and looks wonderful and the music is cool with lots of energy. Edgar Wright does a superb job directing the film, the film is filled with humour and good humour at that, it goes at a cracking pace and is compelling throughout and the characters are appealing. The acting is great, Michael Cera gives one of his better performances(only his performance on the brilliant sit-com Arrested Development is better in my opinion) and he is well supported by some very talented co-stars.",/review/rw4976197/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2010,DarkVulcan29,8," One entertaining ride
","Scott Pilgrim(Michael Cera) is a 22 year old slacker, who is in a band and lives with his gay roommate (Kieran Culkin),and life seems to be pretty predicable. Until he meets Ramona Flowers( Mary Elizabet Winstead from Sky High, Final Destination 3, and Live Free or Die Hard). Scott feels they could have something, but Ramona is unsure, but gives in and starts going out with Scott. But remember the saying your past comes back to haunt you, in Ramonas case comes in the form of seven evil exes with superhuman powers. In order to win Ramonas love Scott must defeat them, but the question is will he? ",/review/rw4976197/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2012,Wizard-8,," Visually impressive, though lacking in its script
","I have a feeling that many young people would go ape for ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"". It involves both young people, and its video game elements will be greatly appealing to youths. However, I think older people (like myself) will be somewhat let down by the movie.",/review/rw4976197/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2010,ajs-10,8," Most enjoyable film I've seen (so far) this year!
","I heard many good things about this movie before I went to see it. Even so, I didn't go in with too many expectationsÂ… I wasn't disappointed. This was probably the most enjoyable movie I've seen so far this year. I walked out of the cinema with a smile on my face and there was even a spring in my step as I went over the preceding 112 minutes in my mind.",/review/rw4976197/?ref_=tt_urv

15 August 2010,chelano,10," Beautiful from start to finish
","It has been along time since I enjoyed a movie from start to finish. This was that movie. This film was jam packed with action, laughs and just lovable characters you want to see more and more of. Michael Cera was a pretty good choice for Scott. I mean usually Cera only has one type of way to act and somehow it really did fit for Pilgrim. It will take me forever to explain how much I liked the cast, so I will only pick a choice few. Mary Elizabeth Winstead was great as Ramona. She had the look you could picture from the comic itself. Then you have Ellen Wong as Knives. The way Ellen acted in this film really brought out have Knives really was in the comic. Out of the evil Ex's, I really enjoyed Jason Schwartzman. He just had an overall cool yet kept feeling and at a point you really wanted him to fight more against Pilgrim. The other Ex would have to be Brandon Routh. I really cannot stand him as Superman, but this role he got to act more like his personality. I mean every actor has a dream to act as a crazy character, because then they can be more comfortable. I think Brandon was very comfortable in the role. The movie had a beautiful look to it with great nerdy CG throughout. The movie did have two problems though. The fight scenes were not long enough. This is because the movie was almost two hours and it is hard to fit seven fight scenes in to seven Ex's. But even though they were short, the look, feel and graphics to them still really made them exciting. The other problem is that I know this film will never has a perfect rating overall because it really only fits to a certain type of people. Luckily there is a lot of people who will love this movie like I did, but in the world today, this film will probably not win an academy award; and that is sad.",/review/rw4976197/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2010,tedg,," Sparkles after Hitting
","This is the most fun I've had at the movies for a while. I believe is it because it is inventive in several ways and the inventiveness is coherent through the thing and across the narrative pathways (cinematic effects, narrative rhythm, character reactions). It is not difficult to push the envelope in any one of these, in fact I see it done even accidentally because film conventions form such narrow roads.",/review/rw4976197/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2010,sme_no_densetsu,8," Arguably Edgar Wright's best film to date
","""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" is Edgar Wright's third film, following the well-received British comedies ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"". This film is a comedy as well but, rather than a genre parody, it's an adaptation of a series of graphic novels.",/review/rw4976197/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2021,viggio_morgenstein,9," One of Edgar Wright's best
","Fun, wacky, offbeat (and often upbeat), hilarious, well-casted, absurd and an overall joy to watch, Scott Pilgrim vs the World is a movie that will make you laugh, smile and begin to admire Edgar Wright's brilliant film-making style (well it did for me anyway). I'll avoid writing an essay about this masterpiece as I'm sure you'll find much better and in-depth reviews, so I'll keep it short and to the point: watch Scott Pilgrim vs the World if you are in need of something to cheer you up, and if your not, just watch it anyway, its a brilliantly crafted film with sharp, weird edits and transitions, hilarious characters, a brilliant story line executed to perfection and much, much more.",/review/rw4976197/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2010,Likes_Ninjas90,4," It's so intent on being hipster cool that it forgets about keeping it real
","Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is in his early twenties and has started dating a girl named Knives Chau (Ellen Wong) who is still in high school. The news circulates around all of his friends including his gay roommate Wallace (Kieran Culkin) and his nosey sister Stacey (Anna Kendrick). At first Scott enjoys the company of Knives. She watches his band play during their practice sessions. At a party though Scott meets who he believes is the girl of his dreams in Ramona (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). He opts to go out with Ramona instead and decides to breakup with Knives. Yet when his band is performing at a gig, Scott is confronted by one of Ramona's seven ex-boyfriends. This leads to a series of video game style fight sequences where Scott must take on each of Ramona's exes, many of which have superhuman powers of their own and defeat them so he can date her properly.",/review/rw4976197/?ref_=tt_urv

25 August 2010,tavm,9," Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is one of the most uniquely enjoyable movies from this summer season
","Since opening opposite Sylvester Stallone's The Expendables and Julia Roberts' Eat Pray Love, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World hasn't had a chance to hit it big at the box office. I guess that's because the two pictures I just mentioned have something of a pre-sold audience while this one only has an appeal to those that have read the graphic novels this movie is based on. I'm here to say that despite not having read the source material, I very much enjoyed this movie! Oh sure, it took a while before I got into it but once I did, I never allowed myself to question why things happened the way they did, I just let myself-as one character said-""be in the moment"". Director Edgar Wright put all his creative stops here both visually and dialogue-wise that there were times I wish I could've rewinded some passages just so I could hear and see certain scenes again. So on that note, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World comes highly recommended.",/review/rw4976197/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2010,pyrocitor,10," Audiences: No Clue (what they're missing) â†’ Edgar Wright: Gets It
","It is always truly delightful to see a major motion picture take a real chance, blending a daringly new angle into a familiar template and culminating in a doubly enjoyable final product. Director Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is such a triumph, undertaking a cocktail of manic energy and charm, dazzling visuals, unassumingly quirky humour, while still boasting an unmistakable (albeit pixilated) heart. Nonetheless, the film's poor box office suggests that many audiences and/or distributors are finding the idea of the film alienating (too nerdy? Too stylized? Too young and hip? Too Canadian?). However, at the risk of being excessively blunt, such concerns are largely unwarranted and, for the most part, missing the point. For while Scott Pilgrim may seemingly the tailor made film for those old enough to remember classic Zelda yet young enough to still have played it, the film's true genius lies in its fundamental accessibility, hitting all the right notes to delight fans of Brian Lee O'Malley's graphic novels without alienating those unfamiliar with any variety of geekdom.

2 September 2010,TheUnseenMovieLover,10," Everything I wanted it to be - Heartfelt, Original and Cool As Hell!
","As proved by Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead, Edgar Wright is a great filmmaker. His techniques may not have the polished precision that Christopher Nolan normally brings to his films, but Wright's energy and love for the material that he is directing and the way his enthusiasm floods the screen, in my opinion, makes him a great filmmaker. Never has this been more evident than in Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World, his best film to date. It won't be for everyone (my dad hated it), but I loved it. It's what (500) Days of Summer would have been if it was filtered through the eyes of Quentin Tarantino.",/review/rw4976197/?ref_=tt_urv
