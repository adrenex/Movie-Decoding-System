31 March 2016,classicsoncall,8," ""If this war is ever ending, I cannot be going back to doing child things"".
","Definitely not a film for the timid or sensitive. College campuses airing the film will require safe zones. The film would have had more poignancy I believe, if it were actually based on a true story, though I have no doubt the atrocities shown in the film are representative of warring factions in opposition to each other in various places on the planet. The inhumanity and barbarism that one group of people can inflict on another convinces me that there is no possibility for the cherished 'peace on earth' that many of us dream and pray for.",/review/rw3371334/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2016,evanston_dad,8," I Feel Almost Obligated to Watch Films Like This
","I've heard more than one person say that they can't watch a movie like ""Beasts of No Nation."" It's a sentiment I understand. After all, who really wants to watch a movie about child soldiers recruited to become killers in savage African civil wars? But these things are happening, and the bare minimum I can if I want to respect myself as a citizen of the world is to watch movies about it, and fictional ones at that. This isn't even a documentary.",/review/rw3371334/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2015,ferguson-6,8," Not like a baby, like an old man
","Greetings again from the darkness. Cary Joji Fukunaga has quickly established himself as an expert storyteller with his previous writing and directing of SIN NOMBRE (2009), JANE EYRE (2011) and the fascinating and conversation-sparking first season of ""True Detective"" (he did not direct the much-maligned Season Two). He goes even deeper and darker this time by adapting Uzodinma Iweala's novel about a child soldier.",/review/rw3371334/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2015,Sergeant_Tibbs,8," To be remembered as one of the better war films of the decade.
","Originally known for his first two films Sin Nombre and Jane Eyre, Cary Fukunaga was put on the map for most by his audacious work on the first season of HBO's True Detective last year, unconventionally directing every episode. He got all-time worthy performances from Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey and boasted a palpable bleak mood from his photography, earning an Emmy for the episode ""Who Goes There"" with that captivating long take. He could do whatever he wanted after that, and so, tip toeing past comfortable studio gigs that may or may not have landed on his desk, he ventured out to the African jungles with Idris Elba for the most stressful shoot since Apocalypse Now. Catching malaria, filling in for an injured camera operator, and constantly rewriting the script due to the actors dropping out, the haphazard conditions shows on the film for better and for worse.",/review/rw3371334/?ref_=tt_urv

","I was sceptical of watching this film at first. It looked like a low budget, and amateur attempt for Netflix to get bigger in their original film business. I went to IMDb to see what people had to say, noticed it got decent reviews and decided to give it a shot. Let me say, this is one of the best films I have ever seen within this genre.",/review/rw3371334/?ref_=tt_urv

",This is quite simply one of the best war films of the 21st Century. Netflix's first outing on the big screen is a huge success thanks to an absolutely harrowing tale of conflict that makes for one of the most fascinating and thought-provoking movie experiences you've had in a long time.,/review/rw3371334/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2015,joey-ziemniak,," 'Beasts of No Nation' has the best performance by a child actor that I've ever seen.
","Child actors are a dime a dozen, yet Abraham Attah is something else. He transcends the category and remains such a demanding presence throughout the entire film, matching even Idris Elba's poise. His character's transformation is just one of the remarkable feats of storytelling that Beasts of No Nation graces us. A gripping account of modern day war seen through a child's eyes, Beasts of No Nation is easily one of the best of the year.",/review/rw3371334/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2015,toby-brace,10," Rare event
","It's not often that a film induces a genuine change of heart in me, but this one did. I used to simply hate and despise the raggedy rebel armies of West Africa with their child soldiers, their cruel atrocities and apparent primitive mindless violence towards civilians in general. But this film showed me a side to them that I had never considered. I found myself feeling sorry for them, and the cynical way in which they were used. I realized that they must also have courage, and discipline, and belief in the cause. Like any fighters, they must advance into deadly danger. The lead actor is a child, yet more than holds his own with Idris Elba, a great actor by any measure. By the end I was shaken. I will not forget this film. And I will never think the same way again about the tragic and pointless wars of Africa.",/review/rw3371334/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2018,nogodnomasters,10," It was the worst of times. It was the worst of times.
","Agu (Abraham Attah) is a young lad growing up in impoverished western Africa. He lives a somewhat idyllic life under the circumstances. The film builds his family life in the background involving a war zone between the army and rebels. Through a series of circumstances, the army kills his kinsmen and Agu manages to escape and reluctantly joins forces with the rebels and vows revenge. ",/review/rw3371334/?ref_=tt_urv

","Agu is a young boy in a war-torn African country. The war eventually reaches his town, resulting in his mother and younger siblings fleeing for the capital and his father and older brother being killed by government forces. Agu flees into the jungle where he meets a battalion of rebel soldiers, lead by their charismatic commander, known simply as Commandant.

9 April 2016,kevjfarrell,9," Give this movie some credit!!
","I was in two minds about watching this movie - I wasn't sure that the subject matter and location really appealed to me. Boy was I wrong!!! This is a very powerful drama which is totally realistic. Superb acting - especially by the lead young boy Agu. The movie contains some very harrowing scenes - it's not an easy watch, but it is worthwhile.",/review/rw3371334/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2015,deloudelouvain,8," Child soldiers in a mad world
","I thought Beasts of No Nation was an excellent movie. It's certainly hard to watch but even though it's hard it is a very good movie. What makes it special is that it's a movie about real life events. Shameful events yes but real events. The fact that we live in such an horrible world where in some countries kids can not be kids anymore, but brainwashed killing machines is maybe incomprehensive for some people that have no clue what's happening outside their cozy neighborhood, but it's the hard reality. Child soldiers used by power hungry fools to do their dirty job is not an illusion anymore. The actors, especially the young ones were sublime. Very powerful acting. They made me think about all the misery that goes around in Africa. Very good filming as well. Like I said before the story might be hard to watch but it's certainly a must see to understand the problematics of some African countries.",/review/rw3371334/?ref_=tt_urv

","You know when you hear other people whining about not being nominated for an Academy Award and you watch this movie, you kind of should be able to see through those other people.

20 March 2016,mpolans,10," Call the Cops, This Movie Was Robbed...
","The fact that Beasts of No Nation, Abraham Attah, and Idris Elba weren't even *nominated* for Oscars is criminal. This was a moving story that shines a light on the sort of things going on with child soldiers in Africa. While set in an unnamed fictional African country with fictional characters, it clearly draws inspiration from the fighting in Liberia and Sierra Leone. In fact, at one point, Commandant call a soldier ""SBU,"" possibly a reference to the ""Small Boys Unit,"" a child soldier unit of the Revolutionary United Front militants who fought in Sierra Leone. Commandant also has similarities to Joseph Kony of the Lord's Resistance Army.",/review/rw3371334/?ref_=tt_urv

","i loved the movie not because its shot in my country but the content of the story and cast was done spot on. I just pray that all political leaders take a cue from this movie and past ones in this format not to plunge the world into this form of darkness.Best Indie Movie for sure @ the Oscars Idris you rocked it. This is a must watch for every household doesn't matter if you black,white,Asian,hispanic etc it can happen to any of us,some children are really suffering to PTSD due to political injustices that has led to war in many countries,lets be tolerant of each other and wish for a better brighter future for us all.",/review/rw3371334/?ref_=tt_urv

16 October 2015,KobeCryant,8," Overall Good
","From the beginning I had high hopes for this movie and it lived up to my expectations. From beginning to end The Child goes through his stages as he is more exposed to violence. He was at first a very innocent kid scared to be apart of the fight but when circumstances force him to join the violence he has only one choice. The children acting in this movie are amazing, it is one of the best movies where a child grabs your attention. The director did a great job on here. And can't Forget Idris Elba, not an outstanding performance but still great. Idris's character also goes through his stages on this one too just like the kid. The Scenery was beautiful and it wasn't really nothing special but it's hard for me these days to come across a movie that I can rate over a 7 and this one is a 8 in my book. With this one Netflix proves that their originals are one of the best nowadays.",/review/rw3371334/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2015,valleyjohn,9," Brutily stunning
","This is the story of a young boy, Agu, who is forced to join a group of soldiers in an unnamed West African country after he is forced out of his village when government forces slaughter friends and family. This time two years ago there was lots of talk about Idris Elba winning big awards for his portrayal of Nelson Mandela but although a good performance the film itself disappointed. If this film doesn't win top awards , including Oscars , I will be astounded. This is without doubt one of the best films of the year. It's not only Idris Elba's best screen performance to date there is also another amazing display and this time from Abraham Attah , a 14 year old. This is brutal film . Director ,Cary Joji Fukunaga doesn't hold back and that's what makes this film feel so real. Despite this being nearly two and a half hours long , it flew by and ever since I saw it a couple of days ago I can't seem to get it out of my head. Highly Recommended.",/review/rw3371334/?ref_=tt_urv
