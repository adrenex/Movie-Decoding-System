30 April 2001,kergillian,7," Could've been an absolute bomb, but somehow magically works perfectly!
","this film is ridiculously unbelievable, thin on plot, shamefully predictable, historically inaccurate in so many ways...yet it all works! The combination of modern music to medieval setting should be awful, but no, it works! The costumes are totally wrong for the period (on purpose I'd hazard to guess - at one point Angelina Jolie lookalike Shannyn Sossamon is wearing a hat & dress outfit that looks startlingly similar to a costume Julia Roberts wore in Pretty Woman...) but it works! Heath Ledger is an Aussie (what happened to the black hair he had in 10 Things I Hate About You! I didn't recognize him!) and Alan Tudyk is a Texan, so their accents should have tanked! But they didn't, just a few slippages a la Mel Gibson in Braveheart or Jonny Lee Miller in Hackers...",/review/rw7130359/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2008,Angelus2,9," I was a fan of Heath Ledgers before the Joker role....And this was the film!
","Heath Ledger is Will, a peasant who dreams of being a glorious and great Knight. After the death of his master Will takes on the identity of Sir Ulrich Von Lichtenstein and enters a tournament were he finds love, friendship and a sense of identity.",/review/rw7130359/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2006,ccthemovieman-1,7," Jousting With A Modern Take
","A story about jousting but this old knight's tale is anything but old because it mixes in satire of today's modern sports-audience age with some funny bits. Those include the overly dramatic public address announcer (boy, that's even more so since this film came out), rock music blaring out as the contestants do battle, etc.",/review/rw7130359/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2013,HelenMary,8," This film was weighed measured and not found wanting at all
","This film shows without any quibbling just how bright the star of Heath Ledger was. He is luminous in this; beautiful, funny, physical and engaging. He plays excellently against the stunning Shannyn Sossamon, who fits perfectly into the modern medieval setting of this film. Set in the C14th a man of poor birth but sharp intellect rises through the ranks of page-dom with the desire to become a nobleman for food, fame, glory and love.",/review/rw7130359/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2005,mstomaso,8," Absolutely unexpected pleasure. Light-hearted but satisfying on many levels
","This wonderfully uplifting little film has a great big heart, good humor, and a classic message about love and honor, and the rarity and preciousness of those who practice both with style. I went to see this with my spouse and a good friend of ours because THEY (the spouse and the friend) wanted to see it. I am a non-fan of comedies, and had been annoyed by the stream of trashy Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court films that had been coming out since the 1980s. My spouse had also informed me that I would be seeing Jousting performed to Bachman Turner Overdrive. My reaction was to reach for the nearest bottle of hard liquor. I didn't need it.",/review/rw7130359/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2002,Iok,9," Makes Braveheart Look Historically Accurate
","I first saw ""A Knight's Tale"" by chance.  A few of us had decided on an ad hoc visit to the local cinema and selected ""A Knight's Tale"" simply because it sounded the least ""teen"" movie on the bill.  We slapped down our cash and took our seats.",/review/rw7130359/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2017,Kirpianuscus,," if you...
","if you looking for historical accuracy, for solid Medieval drama, for dramatic scenes and for old fashion historical movies, this is the worst choice. if you like an eccentric cocktail of modern music and Medieval pretext, easy story and Heath Lodger in a good role, this is a must see. because it is real seductive against it. predictable but nice. hilarious , unrealistic and chaotic. a sort of teenager game. but great in a way who has not exactly definition. because it is the sort of film for fun who could be reasonable kick to discover the truth about a period who, in this film, remains only a generous sketch.",/review/rw7130359/?ref_=tt_urv

7 March 2006,lee_eisenberg,10," I say: knight Heath Ledger!
","A few years before Heath Ledger starred in ""Brokeback Mountain"", he played a man pretending to be a knight in ""A Knight's Tale"", chock full of deliberate anachronisms (namely the soundtrack). I swear that it was one of the funniest movies that year. I just gotta wonder: who comes up with these things? This movie is also interesting for an early appearance of Paul Bettany, who went on to play Russell Crowe's friends in ""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"", and married Jennifer Connelly. All in all, this is one cool movie. It would be hard to imagine anyone not liking it. Hilarious. So I bid ye all to watch this film...'twill not make ye bored one bit.",/review/rw7130359/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2013,SnoopyStyle,8," Fun with Heath Ledger
","William Thatcher (Heath Ledger) is a young squire with skills for jousting. When the old knight dies, he sets off with Roland (Mark Addy) and Wat (Alan Tudyk). On the road, they encounter a naked Geoffrey Chaucer (Paul Bettany) who would eventually write ""The Canterbury Tales"". With no actually title, Thatcher fakes his way into tournaments eventually facing the dreaded Count Adhemar (Rufus Sewell), and woos the maiden Jocelyn (Shannyn Sossamon).",/review/rw7130359/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2001,TxMike,," A very good, entertaining movie that many critics just ""didn't get"". But Ebert got it right!
","""A Knight's Tale"" reminded me a lot of ""Shakespeare in Love"", not by storyline, but by mood and whimsy. Here one of the characters is Geoff Chaucer, just in the dawn of his literary career. The story in this film could very well be one of his ""Canterbury Tales"" which somehow he had never gotten into print, as were about 80% of his tales. In fact he mentions using some of his road encounters for future stories. This is a fun, entertaining film, set in the 1370s, but with modern music and, in some cases, dialog.",/review/rw7130359/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2002,helpless_dancer,7," Rags to riches, love conquers all, never say quit, go for your dreams....
","Fun little tale of a dirt poor lad willing to go all out for his lady love, his honor, and to prove he is as good as any other warrior. Plenty of laughs from a zany character or two and a grand adventure with plenty of old world jousting, pageantry, and costumes. Loved the way the producers wove hard rock tunes and today's lingo into the show's fabric and made it seem, usually anyway, as thought it fit that time span. Cool flic.",/review/rw7130359/?ref_=tt_urv

2 July 2004,jlskutt,10," Has been, and will be, one of my favorite movies of all time
","I actually did not see this movie until a year after it came out. I remember it coming to theaters, and the entire idea of modern music supporting a medieval story sounded stupid. I expected it to be another stupid teen movie, half expecting to see Rachelle Leigh Cook or Freddie Prinze Jr. in the cast.",/review/rw7130359/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2001,Sam4226,10," A surprisingly, wonderful hit!
","As soon as I saw the fans singing and clapping to ""We Will Rock You"" I thought ""this is not very realistic"".  Of course, that was when I had gone in expecting a film like Braveheart or The Patriot, with real historical lessons.  A Knight's Tale was nothing like either of those. After you get past the first one or two scenes, everything really grows on you.  The humor is, yes, cheesy at times, (the Nike armor) but I still laughed.  Chaucer was great, the villain was definitely evil, and the jousting/action scenes were very well done.  Put all that together with some other funny sidekicks and a little romance and you've got a pretty good flick.  Definitely a must see more than once, and a must buy video/DVD when it's out!",/review/rw7130359/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2003,bhirschi42,9," More accurate than you might think

29 August 2003,lowercasegods,," The most heart and fun of 2001
","I'd read that Brian Helgeland had been soured by the movie industry due to his mistreatment on his film, ""Payback."" I use ""his film"" in the most liberal sense here, as star Mel Gibson wrestled control of the film from Helgeland and imposed his own view on the final editing process. With this situation in mind, I fully expected ""A Knight's Tale"" to be a creative response to that negative filmmaking experience, a fun and free film that thumbed its nose at tradition and set style and which allowed the director's true vision to shine through with no outside interference. And my friends, that's exactly what I got when I first sat down to watch in back in 2001. ""A Knight's Tale"" celebrates the classic and vastly misused/underused genre of medieval movies, while at the same time knocking the genre on its ear by instilling the film with modern themes, attitudes and a classic rock score. Sadly, it was these elements which repelled most viewers and led to ""A Knight's Tale's"" lackluster performance at the box office. Were these people just a little more open minded, they would have allowed themselves a wonderful movie-going experience that celebrates individuality, love, and above all else, friendship. Though the music is crucial to the uniqueness of this film (and a brilliant addition, I might add), it's the relationships amongst the characters that gives this film its heart. William and Jocelyn are the perfect couple: bickering, floundering, and absolutely in love with one another. Wat, Roland, Kate and Geoff, wonderful characters unwilling to be fopped off as simple comic reliefs, show genuine love and loyalty to William, and do as much to contribute and carry the story along as William and the other two leads accomplish. Count Adamar, the film's villain, is a wonderful foil for William. He is cunning and cruel, and even in his moments of defeat, a character to respect. In many cases, such a villain would be made to seem wimpy or, at his moment of defeat, clumsy. Not so here, as Adamar is, throughout the film, a force to be reckoned with. I suppose part of why I love ""A Knight's Tale"" is my ability to relate to it so personally. I've certainly had my share of challenges, and aspired to be more than what I currently was. And I've also known friendships so loyal and loving that fiction could never invent. Most significantly, I've lived the pursuit of true love and, like William, have obtained it with no small amount of satisfaction. Everyone to some degree or another has also had these experiences in their lives, and its these experiences that built the foundation of ""A Knight's Tale,"" which is exactly what makes it such a wonderful film, more than worthy of a second chance by those who previously doubted it, and much more than worthy of a spot in any fan's movie collection.",/review/rw7130359/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2017,kz917-1,9," Heath's Tale
","A Knight's Tale features Heath Ledger as a young man trying to change his stars. When the knight he is a squire for literally drops dead, he stands in for him at a tournament. The ball only rolls faster from there. Heath and his merry men become famous at excelling at tournaments, hopefully they won't be infamous!",/review/rw7130359/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2005,Danny_kahn,9," Entertaining
","This comment is to counter those who have issue with modern rock and other time problems being in this movie. This movie was designed to entertain. It was NOT a historical piece and nowhere does it claim to be one. This is the story of a boy who aspires to be more than what society set out for him. The movie uses odd references to history's great figures and humor to bring its story across to the viewer. So I say that, for those of you who cannot enjoy a piece of entertainment due to its well placed use of anachronisms, I strongly suggest you stay away from any of Shakespeare's works. (Not to say that this movie was on level with Shakespeare...) The makers of ""A Knight's Tale"" set out to entertain, and did so dutifully.",/review/rw7130359/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2015,PWNYCNY,9," The knight as sports hero.
","This is a wonderful movie. The mixing of 1970s music with a story set in the middle ages works. It is also a clever cinematic device. The story is excellent. The characters are interesting and their interactions interesting and dramatic. Heath Ledger is excellent as the peasant who wants to be a knight. Paul Bethany is the show stealer however. His rendition of Chaucer is the best performance in the movie. The rest of the cast is engaging as well. There are heroes and villains. The movie also dramatizes a martial art that in its day was one of the major sources of public entertainment. The movie suggests that the concept of the sports hero is neither new or unique to present times. In this respect the story has plausibility. For there was a time that games like baseball, football, etc. did not exist. So the concept of sports competition took other forms, in contests that today would be condemned as cruel, but then were considered acceptable. Then again, is two men charging at each other at full speed with lances any different then two groups of men going into each other to gain control of a ball?",/review/rw7130359/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2010,brando647,8," Rockin' Out in the Middle Ages
","Brian Helgeland finds room for all of the usual clichés of your average sports film in his medieval adventure, but yet it still feels fresh, entertaining, and most of all fun. A combination of the perfect cast with an awesome soundtrack keep Helgeland's film from ever feeling too familiar. The film follows William Thatcher, a peasant squire who dreams of one day being able to compete in the jousting tournaments with the knights he's admired all his life. He soon finds an opportunity when he decides to pass himself off as a knight to compete and pursue the woman of his dreams, though he risks penalty of death if his truth is discovered.",/review/rw7130359/?ref_=tt_urv

25 September 2015,mike48128,8," Too Much fun to dislike. The film to remember Heath Ledger by.
","Poor Heath. Gone too soon. I would much rather remember him as the high spirited ""William Thatcher"" who impersonates Sir Ector, than as the sick ""Joker"" in Batman. A swashbuckling comedy-drama with jousting being the popular ""sport in fashion"" of the 14th century. I hadn't seen this film in years, and it almost made it into the ""reject pile"" as I am thinning out my Disc Collection. This film should be a ""bomb"" but it is just too much fun. Beautifully photographed in Prague, but with everything wrong: modern songs, inaccurate dress, mannerisms, and dialogue. Tons of very intentional anachronisms. Note both The London Eye and The Eiffel Tower! It's like they are ""daring you"" to find all the ""goofs"" in the movie! Worst-fitting modern song is ""Taking Care of Business"" by BTO, but both ""Queen"" songs (""Rock You"" and ""Champions"") fit nicely, as does David Bowie's ""Golden Years"". ""Chaucer wears only a smile"" and does a ""Rear Monty"" twice. He champions Will's fame and writes his ""Knight's Tale"". Some rough slapstick, but very little gore for a film of this type. (Like Richard Lester's ""Musketeer"" movies). Even the villain (Rufus Sevell as Count Adhemar) is almost likable, until he strips William of his fake Royalty parentage, puts him in stocks, and beats the daylights out of him. Then, Prince Edward ""princes by"" and proclaims him to be ""Sir William"". An impossible ending, as William wins his ""fatal"" jousting match against The Count without his armor and with the heavy lance strapped to his badly damaged arm! Of course he wins ""the Beautiful Princess"", and it all ""goes down"" like a fairy tale. A great Saturday Afternoon popcorn movie, just don't take it too seriously. Slight nudity (men and women) so a bit too ""bawdy"" for little kids.",/review/rw7130359/?ref_=tt_urv

","I loved A Knight's Tale! The subtle wit, brilliant dialogue and captivating performances make this film incredibly enjoyable. A Knight's Tale provides the purest form of escapism. Watching the film, I was not concerned about historical inconsistencies or implausibility, instead, I was transported to a land where the pride of a knight is the joust. While the love interest relationship is underdeveloped, the other relationships in the film soar. I could watch this film over and over without getting bored. It is clever, hilarious, emotional and a joy to watch!",/review/rw7130359/?ref_=tt_urv
