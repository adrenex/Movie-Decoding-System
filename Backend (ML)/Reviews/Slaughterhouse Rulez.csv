4 January 2015,LiamCullen6,8," Elegant, genuinely comical, and utterly fresh
",When I first saw this pop up on Amazon Instant Video I was skeptical as I had never watched an Amazon exclusive television series before. And I was well aware of the popularity of rival-Netflix's exclusives and found it hard to believe it would be a worthy competitor.,/review/rw3151207/?ref_=tt_urv

",Reading about the 19-year old cellist who played at Harry & Meghan's royal wedding then you realize there's another great storyline we can never see on The untimely cancellation of Mozart in the Jungle. ,/review/rw3151207/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2018,Michael Fargo,10," A glittering game of composers
","I came late to this series and have just finished binge-watching 4 seasons. The cast is one of the attractions here, but New York is the other. A lot of the grit behind the scenes of the world of classical music has been scrubbed. Show me an oboist that resides in an apartment like the superb Debra Monk's. A lot of the eccentricity of classical musicians is also tamed, but there's Malcolm McDowell delightfully representing that contingency as well as Gael Garcia Bernal who both make the madness of musicians more attractive than it actually is. The camaraderie is also put forward, and the jealousies and back-biting shoved in the wings. What's left is a series full of Romanticism, mysticism and the thrill that classical music can bring. A brief segment showing the children's orchestra sawing out Beethoven's 5th is the more familiar experience we have in concert halls. This is a show that puts classic music on the altar it deserves, omitting the sacrifice and hard work that produces it. It makes us believe that all of us could raise a baton transport ourselves and an audience to Nirvana, and that's okay with me. 
As well, the production itself is superb. When we leave New York for Venice, Mexico and Japan, nothing is lost. But there's nothing better than watching Bernadette Peters strutting through the Guggenheim like she owns the place (she owns just about any space she inhabits). And spending time in Venice with Ana Maria Martinez is all too brief but the farewell episode with her floating on a barge down the canals of Venice to collide with Placido Domingo was epic.
I was smitten by Lola Kirke's awkward portrayal of Hailey Rutledge. But compared to Bernal's extravagant performance, as well as the rest of the cast (peppered with New York's glitterati), she gets a little lost in the swirling magic that producers Coppola, Schwartzman, et al., have bravely assembled. They deserve our thanks. This was a long shot that has a grand pay off for viewers..",/review/rw3151207/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2016,sofia_llantada,10," Bravo!!! Fresh, daring, excellent performance!!!
","Let me say first of all that I enjoy classical music, and I enjoy the bohemian lifestyle associated with musicians and artists. This show is fresh, sarcastic, real and completely lacks the common areas that of sex and violence so over used on TV and movies. It is beautiful because the acting, the music and the geniality of ""Rodrigo"", the Maestro who is played by Gael Garcia Bernal.",/review/rw3151207/?ref_=tt_urv

20 March 2018,shelley-bourdon,10," A Creative Inspiration
","I have enjoyed each season of Mozart in the Jungle; but Season 4 touched me in an unexpectedly deep way. I think it's because this season captures what it's like to completely surrender to the Spirit of Creativity (""the blood""). To create real art, the kind of art that makes your heart feel as if it's standing at attention, one must not care at all about what others think. One must be willing to sacrifice one's ego--allowing others to laugh at you, to label you as a failure, or as crazy or stupid, or even to socially ostracize you--knowing that, in the end, it's totally worth it because something beautiful and new has come into being though you. To create something totally unique is the closest we come, I believe, to knowing the Source of our Being (""God""). Season 4 of Mozart in the Jungle has helped me to remember this. From the bottom of my heart, I thank the producers, writers, and actors of this program for the beautifully unique work of art you have created. You have given me the courage to keep forging ahead in surrendering myself to the Spirit of Creativity.",/review/rw3151207/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2015,johnklem,8," Pitch perfect
","This review is based on the first six episodes of the first season. I like this series so much that it's hard to see it objectively. I like it so much that I'm not bingeing but rather rationing myself to a meagre 25 or so minutes each day. So, what makes it quite so enjoyable? Firstly, it's genuinely good - a perfect cast delivering tonally perfect performances with a script that delivers reality plus a few extra percentage points. Occasionally, it's laugh out loud funny but mostly it's genuinely affecting. This is no guilty pleasure in which you know you're being manipulated but you're going along for the (very fun) ride. This always feels real, grounded. There are a few stereotypes amongst the smaller roles but the big ones, the roles that anchor this series, are well written and perfectly cast. Lola Kirke is a wonderful lightning rod, if gaining weight by the episode; Saffron Burrows is fine, if somewhat less interesting than in her pre plastic surgery roles; Bernadette Peters is terrific; Malcolm McDowell is the perfect exiting Maestro. And then there's Gael Garcia Bernal. As an outsider, I have no idea how much of his character was on the page and how much was his own invention but the results are spectacular. He makes this series. His portrayal of Rodrigo, the infant terrible of the conducting world, is nothing short of brilliant and creates, most appropriately, the bright star around which everything revolves. Mozart in the Jungle is not highbrow entertainment. It doesn't challenge or confront. It works its magic more subtly, and sometimes more effectively. It's a feel good show in the best possible way. Real, not fake. It likes its characters, for all their flaws. You could do worse.",/review/rw3151207/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2018,boolovesbi,10," a great reminder about the essence of art
","No season ever failed me before but season 4 is my favorite. they bring a great reminder that the essence of art is a pure joy from doing something just for the sake of it, not for money or anyone else.i love many details especially the beautiful pond with Hans Andersen statue where Rodrigo finally found back ""Mozart"" in himself. Highly appreciated Hai Lai for her efforts to make break through and the courage to break up to find her own way. i think they'll find the way back to each other somehow in next season :""> 
a million thanks sent to everyone involved in production.i'm deeply grateful for your work!",/review/rw3151207/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2018,jlmpeace,10," Season 5 PLEASE!!

25 December 2014,rmatuse,9," Thoroughly Enjoyable
","I blew through this show in two days, and no just because of the quick, witty writing and 30-minute episodes. Seriously, though, a show that can be captivating and under an hour scores it at least 8/10 points. ",/review/rw3151207/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2020,sistolina,10," Delightful, a musical balm for the soul
","I would watch anything with Gael Garc√≠a Vernal in it, but I think he found his place with Rodrigo, eclectic, passionate and gifted conductor. The soundtrack is great and the honesty of the show is admirable: talent is not enough to succeed, but no talent is ever enough if you don't play with 'the blood'. And yet to survive thanks to one's art is one of the most difficult goals to achieve, even at the highest levels. The show is funny, honest, eclectic and dynamic. Original and deep, but it doesn't take itself too seriously.",/review/rw3151207/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2017,wwiiboomer,10," Visceral ...
","Sometimes a good story reminds you of who you want to be. If your into music as I am (mostly all genre) ... but cannot keep a beat, nor hold a note ... watching is the best and closes thing. It's disconcerting when you're in the shower singing and your wife shouts why are you crying?! This show is funny bordering crazy, perhaps zany. Yet, the anecdotal musical pieces lend to its fundamental basis for a wonderful entertainment. ",/review/rw3151207/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2016,ivankalukasko,6," Mozart in the jungle
","*** This review may contain spoilers *** I loved the first season. It was funny, full of music and heart-warming. I started watching it without high expectations, but really enjoyed it. I'd even go as far to say I had loved it. After seeing the first season I couldn't wait to watch the next one. ",/review/rw3151207/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2019,shoeb_ayubi,10," The word ""hai lai"" was the highlight of the whole series for me
","Mozart in the jungle belonged to Gael Garcia. He literally owned the series completely. I have become a huge fan of Gael after watching Mozart in the jungle. At first, I was skeptical to give this show a try. But it was so worth it to watch a show which has a very unique concept with excellent storyline and excellent cast. I haven't read the book. I wonder whether there is more to the abrupt ending to the story in season four. I am mad that they cancelled the show with that cliffhanger. Also the character ""hai lai"" deserved a better actor but I have no complaints with Lola Kirke. And I always cackled when Rodrigo calls Hailey ""hai lai"". That was the life of the show. Anyway, one word for both Mozart in the jungle and Gael Garcia ""MAGNIFICENT"".",/review/rw3151207/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2014,apaz005,10," Excellent surprise
","Like many of us, I had recently finished a series on Netflix/Prime a couple of days before and couldn't find another series to start. After losing hope, and about to re-watch an older series just to have something to watch, i stumbled across ""Mozart in the Jungle"" on Prime. Not the typical type of series i look for, but bored and out of options, I gave it a shot. After the first few minutes I was sold. A show i had never heard of, and had zero expectations of, surprised me. The episodes are only twenty some minutes so I ended up binge watching the entire season that night. I now want to grab the book the show is based off. And I am highly anticipating the next season.",/review/rw3151207/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2015,Bev-7,9," Really Enjoying This
","What an enjoyable series! I'm looking forward to more. I happened to encounter an image for it as I was researching a project. Malcolm McDowell, Bernadette Peters, and the premise captured my attention. I'm so particular about what I watch that I often leave the TV off because of the degraded quality of programming on broadcast. Even cable has saturated itself with unscripted fare that clones other unscripted fare. Where's the creativity? Where's that something different? I found it on Amazon. The characters are important here, and I'm truly liking them because they are allowed to have shortcomings as much as they are allowed to soar with their strengths. They are not predictable; they are multidimensional.",/review/rw3151207/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2015,Deana91,8," This Show Must Continue!!!!
","Fresh, unique and wickedly eccentric!!! I am guilty of ""Binge-Watching"" all 10 episodes and now find myself going through withdrawals! To let this series end here would be more tragic than the Italian opera Otello! Which coincidently one of the main character's name Roderigo closely resembles the same name of Maestro Rodrigo in Mozart in the Jungle! Not only is the writing superb, but all of the actors as well, regardless of the size of their parts. I've always been a fan of Gael Garcia Bernal and Malcolm McDowell, and Bernadette Peters is just as stunning and wonderful as she was many decades ago! But I'm really surprised by Lola Kirke! For a second I thought it was her sister Jemima from HBO's Girls because I was not familiar with Lola. And although she is the younger sister and not as well known, she certainly has just as much talent and it won't be long before everyone has heard of her too! Please Amazon give us more of this fantastic show and don't let it be canceled!!!",/review/rw3151207/?ref_=tt_urv

",This was a fantastically insightful show with brilliant performances and witty writing. It was hilarious and showed a positive use of classical music in modern social settings.

28 September 2020,AngelusAgendi,10," Refreshing gem!
","I absolutely love it. The way Mozart in the Jungle is written, directed and performed. Brilliant! I haven't watched anything so unique, refreshing, energizing, thought-provoking, beautiful, fun and great in a long time. The cast is outstanding. My favorite character was Rodrigo - so natural and captivating. I appreciated that this show let the lead character be who he was, a Mexican person with his beautiful accent and the way he speaks. Thank you for not choosing someone who has a perfect American accent. This world needs more diversity, more nationalities, accents, cultures, ages, races and genders. I also loved watching scenes filmed in Mexico and Japan. These series are unique because it is fun to watch, it is so refreshing and doesn't look like most Americanized cliche shows we have.
It is sad that they ended these series abruptly (season 4) without a proper ending. I don't know if this evokes a longing in me to watch the continuation or it evokes irritation. I think nobody wanted to see that love story ending like that and the genius becoming lunatic. Strange. However, it is never later... never late to film the season 5 and give us, the audience, the pleasure to continue watching it.",/review/rw3151207/?ref_=tt_urv

",A show dedicated to classical music.,/review/rw3151207/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2015,loradimitrova,10," Finally: a very close representation of the life of a classical musician!
","I started watching Mozart in the Jungle with a little trepidation. I love Mozart's music, and was a bit worried that his name has been used in the title in vain. My expectations were very low, the kind a true classical musician has when listening to someone non-musician analyzing their performance. My thoughts were: oh , here we go, someone again is going to humiliate the classical music and it's followers, and mix it up with shallow observations and cheap talk. I expected pop, rap, rock, house, bebop, and even disco, glorifications and total dismissal of all classical. How luckily wrong I was!! These series are probably one of the best and closest presentations of classical musicians' struggles to make it, to get known, to survive, to bare their soul for food, to do anything and everything and to forgo any pain and any doubt for the privilege to play music, to agree to any music job so they can live, and to serve and worship at the alter of music without any commercialism. It is a true presentation of the big egos of those who have made it, and the incredible beauty of the great big musicians' art. It is a true presentation of the little minds and the little talents whose only care is the union rules. It is a true presentation of how anything and everything in life can become music, how one can hear music even in the noise of a tire crossing bridge rims. And it is a very enjoyable, very funny, very well observed and cry well acted piece of TV! Congratulations to all the thinkers behind the scenes, all the makers of the series, all who acted brilliantly, all who performed the music brilliantly, and produced and brought this marvellous, surprising, unique series's to the general public! Can't wait for series 2!!",/review/rw3151207/?ref_=tt_urv
