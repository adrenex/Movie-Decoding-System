1 January 2003,=G=,7," All around enjoyable murder mystery and human interest drama
","In ""Blood Work"" Eastwood plays an FBI agent, recovering from a heart transplant, who is asked by the sister of the murdered  woman whose heart he received to find her killer. The result is  surprisingly even and interesting murder mystery in which we see Eastwood piece together the evidence pointing to the killer while dealing with heart transplant issues and making nice with his pro bono client. The film has fewer plot holes than most murder mysteries; leans more toward human interest than derring-dos; and is another example of Eastwood successfully pushing out the age envelope in a self-directed film product. Recommended for more mature couch potatoes into murder mysteries. (B)",/review/rw0857029/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2002,Quinoa1984,8," Still grand to see Eastwood be his old cool self, albeit with a bad ticker
","Clint Eastwood's 20th feature directed and starring himself, Blood Work, is a good sign in times of recent thriller drek. Here is Clint, 72 years old, and actually doing the right thing; being the old sort of Dirty Harry-esquire type of cop while still being realistic with himself. Truth be told, he won't do movies forever, much less be a cop with almost all the right moves, and here we see him as FBI Agent Terry McCaleb in the beginning try and climb a fence to catch a code killer (which resonates from past Eastwood projects) and he collapses from a heart attack (sad but oddly accurate). He retires, and two years later a woman comes forth to him asking for help in finding a killer. ",/review/rw0857029/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2008,lost-in-limbo,7," My heart is yours.
","'Blood Work' sees actor/director Clint Eastwood ease into a more traditional, mature and work-heavy detective story based upon Michael Connelly's novel. We follow that of FBI profiler Terry McCaleb on the trail of a serial killer who likes to play games with him, before his heart eventually gives up on him during a chase. He's a cardiac patient that receives a heart from a murder victim, and the donor's sister asks him to come out of retirement (which is two years after the heart-attack) to use that second chance to help find her killer.",/review/rw0857029/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2008,Chrysanthepop,," The cast make it work but the ending is just so disappointing
","Clintwood's 'Blood Work' may not be the best nor most stylish of its genre but it remains enjoyable for the most part mainly because of the cast. It's quite a simple film but I found the end revelation disappointing and the last half hour is a little too dramatic. During the entire first hour, Eastwood cleverly avoids excessive violence and gore and smoothly lets the tension build. Clintwood is supported by a brilliant cast that includes the fabulous Anjelica Huston, the elegant Wanda de Jesus, the charming Tina Lifford and the funny Jeff Daniels. The cast does well but Daniels's performance is ruined by the overdone last half hour. The film rests on Eastwood and it's great to see him play such a role at 71 and pull it off so well. The jazzy background score gives 'Blood Work' a classy touch. Thus, to sum it up, one can expect a simple but engaging whodunnit thriller which is ruined a bit by the ending but Eastwood and his cast prevent it from being a waste of time.",/review/rw0857029/?ref_=tt_urv

27 April 2003,tfrizzell,," Blood Runs Dry by the Latter Acts.
","Clint Eastwood's direction sadly loses its way late in this otherwise suspenseful drama from the co-writer of ""L.A. Confidential"" (Brian Helgeland). Eastwood is a famous detective, but a massive heart attack just as he is about to catch a crazed serial killer forces him to an early retirement. Fast-forward a bit and Eastwood has received a new heart from a woman who has recently passed away. Slowly, but surely Eastwood's body is accepting the new organ and it appears that a healthy recovery is imminent. Things change though as a Hispanic woman (Wanda De Jesus) pays Eastwood a visit one day and explains that his new heart come from her younger sister, a woman who was killed in a convenient store. Quickly it becomes crystal clear that the killer in the store is in fact the same man who eluded Eastwood earlier. Now Eastwood is back one last time with a score to settle. Through Eastwood's journey he has to indulge a pesky neighbor (Jeff Daniels) who  wants to assist in the case, dodge cops Paul Rodriguez and Dylan Walsh and convince doctor Anjelica Huston that he owes De Jesus his time and help. ""Blood Work"" does do well for the majority of its running time, but the punchline comes way too fast and the finale is unsatisfying to say the least. Eastwood is pretty good as usual and Daniels is excellent in a comical supporting turn. Everyone else though ends up struggling to keep their intensity up as the production progresses. The ""Hardy Boys"" routine and the unnecessary blossoming romance between Eastwood and De Jesus make ""Blood Work"" play more like a television movie of the week than a theatrical release. With all this said, ""Blood Work"" does do enough good things to keep the audience watching and intrigued---most of the time anyway. 4 stars out of 5.",/review/rw0857029/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2005,moonspinner55,6," Satisfying, non-think thriller; not a blockbuster for Eastwood
","Retired FBI detective helps a young woman solve the murder of her sister--but he's got a personal motive: he himself received a heart transplant from the victim! Not a bad vehicle for Eastwood, convincingly raspy and worn, and still imposing when he has to be. Brian Helgeland's screenplay via Michael Connelly's novel is full of police clich√©s, and the denouement isn't terribly surprising, but Clint has become a reassuring presence on the screen: his shortcomings and realistic aches and pains make him wonderfully human. Supporting cast including Jeff Daniels and Angelica Huston is also good, making the best out of a routine, unmemorable script. **1/2 from ****",/review/rw0857029/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7," A silly third-act reveal almost derails this decently dark detective drama.
","One of Eastwood's best and most underrated directorial efforts sees him as an ageing detective fitted with a new heart and haunted by his past. 'Blood Work (2002)' is sort of Eastwood's reflection on the genre that 'Dirty Harry (1972)' helped solidify, in the same way 'Unforgiven (1992)' was an interesting counterbalance to the 'Man With No Name' trilogy so seminal to the western. The picture is generally unglamorously gritty but occasionally slips into silliness and convention. The obvious yet nonsensical villainous reveal is ham-fisted and forced at best, being a wholly unnecessary addition to the book that comes across quite cheap. The flick withstands its few flaws thanks to how entertaining it is, with the fact that its hero feels as though he could keel over from a simple heart-attack any minute making it all the more exciting. 7/10",/review/rw0857029/?ref_=tt_urv

8 August 2002,giancarlorocks,," Eastwood is the Anti-Dirty Harry in this elegant and classy thriller...
","While it might not be the most stylish or fast paced manhunt thriller, Clint Eastwood's 'Blood Work' is still a very enjoyable piece of film. Stylish in its' own manner, this drama returns to the yesteryears of filmmaking and displays Eastwood's talent as an accomplished Director. Today's cinema heavily relies on nifty editing effects and fast paced dialogue to retain the interest of the impatient audience, yet Eastwood gives us a refreshing and simplistic tale revolving around the resolution of various dastardly murders.",/review/rw0857029/?ref_=tt_urv

18 August 2018,Hey_Sweden,7," Not bad, but ultimately conventional.
","Producer / director / star Clint Eastwood is in fine form here, in this Brian Helgeland-scripted adaptation of the novel by Michael Connelly. Eastwood plays Terry McCaleb, a former FBI agent who suffered a bad heart attack while pursuing a suspect from a murder scene. Two years later, he's alive and doing well thanks to a heart transplant. He learns that the woman whose heart he inherited was a victim of that killer from two years ago, and is implored by the woman's sister (Wanda De Jesus) to get justice for her sibling. Enlisting the services of a neighbour (Jeff Daniels, supplying all the comedy relief), Terry agrees to do his own investigating into the matter.",/review/rw0857029/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2005,pepsimoron,4," The Book Really was good. I hope they don't do this to Bosch
","Hollywood screenwriters probably object to putting a scene where a witness is hypnotized to get details of the crime. Unfortunately the entire novel pivots on this scene. Instead Clint (who's supposed to be not only a 2 month post op heart transplant patient, but also 42 or so) is dodging speeding cars, wielding shotguns, punching people out etc... Now I agree that much of the investigation in the novel involves Terry sitting at his desk looking over notes and watching videotapes, but if they had kept to the original story they would have had the really suspenseful action sequence and the killer that makes more sense. The only good thing about this movie is that in 2 or 3 novels that Connelly wrote after (with the same characters) they make jokes about how Terry's friend was made to be the murderer in the Clint Eastwood adaptation of their lives. Hopefully when the Harry Bosch series start coming out as films, they will come out more like the dark noir that they are meant to be and less brainless shoot em ups. There's plenty of action in his novels, and he even admits that there is a lot of Dirty Harry in his cop. Anyhow, I highly recommend the books, its sad that this one was represented in such a shallow light.",/review/rw0857029/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2020,Tweekums,7," A solid murder mystery
","As this film opens we see elderly FBI profiler Terry McCaleb giving chase to a man he believes to be a serial killer known as the 'Code Murderer'. He collapses with a heart attack but still manages to put a bullet in the fleeing man. Two years later and he is retired and recovering from a heart transplant. He is approached by a woman who tells him that his heart came from her murdered sister... she wants him to find the man who killed her. McCaleb agrees to make some inquiries. The police believe she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time when a convenience store was robbed; after looking at the evidence he isn't so sure and thinks her murder may be linked to another murder. As his condition means he can't drive he gets his neighbour, Buddy, to drive him to the various people he needs to question. His inquiry soon irritates the officers who'd investigated the case for the LAPD, a friend who works for LA County Police, is more helpful.",/review/rw0857029/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2003,Bry-2,5," See it before
","There's really nothing new in this cop drama.  Eastwood plays his patented Tough Cop, mellowed by age and a brand new heart, and does everything you expect him to, including (but not limited to) defying his doctor's advice; chasing a suspect then shooting him while suffering a heart attack, but without once shouting, ""Stop in the name of the law,"" or whatever is required, even by the LAPD; having the female lead fall for him, despite an age difference Anna Nicole Smith could relate to; solving the case despite all the obstacles the authorities can throw at him.

12 July 2018,muons,6," An ordinary work
","The basic storyline is about a murderer who likes to play cat and mouse with an FBI agent. McCaleb is an aged agent retired after having a heart transplant but still dragged into action. Though scenario has almost no rationality the movie is entertaining enough for Dirty Harry fans (although McCaleb character doesn't have much common with Harry). McCaleb and Graciella characters are well developed but the two policemen who hate McCaleb (a worn-out cliche) are almost caricatured. Wanda De Jesus looks like a miscast for a woman who'd be interested in an old ailing man. The plot for solving the mystery about the identity of the murderer is laughable. The incentives of the murderer are even less clear except maybe that he's a nutcase. With the way things develop, the twist could sort of be guessed towards the end of story. The movie is a reminiscent of 70's police series on TV. An unambitious and ordinary work with no brainy edge but good for a couple of hours of diversion.",/review/rw0857029/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2019,CubsandCulture,8," Rote screenplay filmed, acted with great care. Good thriller.
",This is one of Eastwood's weakest films. It is very much a police procedural and the whodunit is relatively easy to figure out. To be fair the script is more interested in the whydoit aspects and does not try to hide the killer all that much. The clockwork plot mostly fits together nicely-through the added love story is off putting given the context-and the Buddy character is a nice bit of characterization. The story is very much like a high end Law and Order episode . One thing through is I am not sure where all the hostility from Arrango came from. A lot of the early personality clashes among the detectives feels forced in this movie.,/review/rw0857029/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2019,dworldeater,7," Good detective thriller from Clint Eastwood
","Blood Work is a pretty well performed detective thriller starring Clint Eastwood as a retired FBI agent that gets a heart transplant that leads him back into action in pursuit of a serial killer. The pace is brisk and moves the story along quickly in Clint's no nonsense style. Blood Work is not a high point in Clint's long career in making films, but it is a good film that can hold an audience's interest for the duration of the film. Clint is great as an aging detective, very convincing and playing up the challenges of a man in his 60's. Jeff Daniels is also impressive opposite of Clint with a very versatile, and natural performance with a lot of range. The rest of the support cast is good as well with Anjelica Huston and Wanda De Jesus, as well as the occasional comic relief from Paul Rodriguez as a dufus cop that sometimes opposes our leading man Clint. Blood Work is a good thriller from Clint with a jazzy score that gives it a nice noirish ambiance.",/review/rw0857029/?ref_=tt_urv
