","I have to applaud both the real Patch Adams and the late Robin Williams for
bringing his story to the screen for us. I really identified with the character, but
that kind of approach to your job has its pitfalls.",/review/rw1026489/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2019,UniqueParticle,8," Devastating and joyful all at the same time
","Robin Williams had so much joy in this, its so wonderful and heartwarming! Quite a few bleak characters and things that could have been avoided, otherwise I'd give it a 10. Excessive happiness should be fine, I don't understand why there's a boss that is a Debbie Downer, yeah ok he's serious about his job, but lacking sense of humor that is important for patients to enjoy. This is a powerful film and makes me bummed that Robin Williams is gone!",/review/rw1026489/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2005,SmileysWorld,7," Robin Williams:The Best Medicine
","In my opinion,Robin Williams is at his best when playing characters much like himself.This film is based on the life of the real Hunter ""Patch"" Adams,a man that Williams himself says that he closely relates to.In the medical profession,it is easy to become hard nosed and so wrapped up in treating the sickness that it is all too easy to forget that there are actual people behind the sickness.We are taught by Patch to treat the person first,because when you do so,treating the illness becomes somewhat easier.Sometimes people don't get better,but treating the soul to a laugh or two can lessen the pain and suffering.Sometimes people die,and while the people that loved them suffer and grieve,the suffering and grief are eased somewhat by the knowledge that their departed loved ones no longer suffer.This role was tailor made for Williams,and he is supported well,including another overlooked performance by the late Michael Jeter as a squirrel fearing mental patient.Thumbs up!",/review/rw1026489/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 1999,Lindy-24,10," Very wonderful film!!
","My husband and I loved this film.  We laughed, cried and felt warm and fuzzy all over!  Very well made film.  Robin, as always did a great job with his part.  His co-actor/actress were very good too.  The movie made us a part of what was going on.  I want a doctor just like Patch.  To bad there aren't more doctors like that.",/review/rw1026489/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2021,kosmasp,9," Laughing and crying
","Robin Williams is gone ... and sometimes we forget how great someone was but are reminded when we see their work again. Like this movie (or the silly yet entertaining RV the other week) for example! Yes Williams was an amazing comedian ... but he was also a great dramatic actor! And this movie is a testament to that. I dare you not to cry ... there are so many moments that are touching the heart ... it's just incredible! The first one for me came with the question: ""What its her name?"" ... so simple yet so effective.",/review/rw1026489/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2001,famousgir1,," Laughter Is The Best Medicine.
","Patch Adams is the remarkable true story about a man determined to become a medical doctor because he enjoys helping people. The medical community though do not like his methods of healing the sick patients, even though everyone else appreciates and enjoys what he does as he is the only one who can do so. Robin Williams stars as Patch 'Hunter' Adams and he does a brilliant job as always. He's an amazing actor and *really* funny too. Other good performances, come from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Monica Potter. Patch Adams is a must-see and I give the movie a 10/10.",/review/rw1026489/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2018,sddavis63,9," Among Robin Williams' Best Performances
","This is the first time I've watched ""Patch Adams"" in a lot of years. Watching this film in the light of Robin Williams' suicide just a couple of years ago gives a different feel to it. In fact, knowing what would ultimately happen to Williams creates a couple of scenes that are literally gut-wrenching. The very opening of the movie when Hunter (not yet ""Patch"") Adams - played by Williams - checks himself into a mental hospital because he's suicidal, and a scene toward the end of the movie when - with both his professional and personal lives having seemingly fallen apart - he stands at the edge of a cliff, venting to God and obviously thinking about ... Well, it's a powerful and unsettling scene even without knowing Williams' fate; even more unsettling with that knowledge. ",/review/rw1026489/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2006,ccthemovieman-1,9," Not-That-Sugary Look At A Good-Hearted Man
","There are a lot of sugary clichés I use - in a nice way - to describe this story about a doctor with a good heart who truly believes in the healing power of laughter. Based on a real-life person (who looks a lot wackier than Robin Williams, who plays him in this movie), the story has its usual rebel fights-the- straight-laced-establishment cliché but is a warm, sentimental film that can't help but make you feel really good when it's all over. It's hardly all sugar, either, as there are not only frustrations but an immensely-shocking tragedy in here.",/review/rw1026489/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2009,thinker1691,8," "" Why is a doctor treated with such reverence, we often forget he is Human ""
","Robin Williams has so many films in his resume, it is very difficult to choose which one he believes is his best work. Like a true artist, he gives his talent to every role and each plays a part in his greatness. This movie for instance, I believe will become his crowning achievement. The film is called "" Patch Adams. "" It is based on the real doctor who offers to share a real love of medicine with anyone who chooses to become a doctor. His seeming ambivalence towards established rules and protocols and his unorthodox manner in treating patients is irritating to Dean Walcott (Bob Gunton) who tolerates Adams until he can summon enough evidence to expel the ""Excessively Happy"" medical student from the school. Although the role is a direct shadow of Williams's career as a comic, it is also a mirror image of his soul when he displays his sorrow and despair. It is during those touching moments we can see how much the master comic suffers for his character. When viewing this fine film, be prepared to journey with Williams through the happiness and tragedies his character experiences. An excellent example of an artist at work. Easilly recommended for all. ****",/review/rw1026489/?ref_=tt_urv

4 February 2010,hitchcockthelegend,8," Laugh away your ills.
","Patch Adams is based around the true life story of Hunter Adams, a very interesting man, who, after becoming suicidal and committing himself to a mental hospital, found a new lease of life and wanted to help people. Enrolling at medical school to become a doctor, Hunter became a flag waver for the ""laughter is the best form of medicine"" train of thought. Something that simultaneously irked his superiors and garnered a lot of patient support. A fascinating tale is given the Hollywood treatment with Robin Williams slotting into the role of Hunter Adams.",/review/rw1026489/?ref_=tt_urv

","Perhaps Williams finest effort to date. I laughed till my sides ached, and maybe even shed a tear or 2, but I won't admit to actually doing so. Liked that big shock the film produced a little over half way through - totally unexpected. If I had a problem at all with this picture, it would be that it is a tad pat, but I still thought it was excellent. Highly recommended.",/review/rw1026489/?ref_=tt_urv

2 July 1999,Spebsqsa,8," Drama that tried to be funny?
","I think that the critics missed an important aspect of this movie, as did many viewers who have commented before me.  Too many have claimed that this movie was a drama full of comedy, or a drama that was trying to be funny.  Whether the critics think it achieved that goal or not, they missed an important point.  The point is that Drama and Comedy are not two seperate things to be combined.  A movie shouldn't have to combine the two.  The two things are already combined.  This movie attempted to show that there is comedy and laughter inherent in the drama of our everyday life.  If we can find it, it can help us through the drama.  This is the reason we cry when we are happy and we cry when we are sad.  All emotions are part of something bigger and they are more similar than we think.  I think that's part of what Patch Adams is trying to say.",/review/rw1026489/?ref_=tt_urv

","During a family day at the movies over Christmas weekend, most of my family picked ""You've Got Mail"".  But I pretty much detest romantic comedies, so I picked ""Patch Adams"" instead.

17 March 2005,Vampera66,10," Touched my heart
","The first time I watched this movie, it was truly wonderful and has been every time I've watched it since. ""Patch Adams"" delivers a powerful message of how to just be silly and break the rules when it's in the best interest of everyone around. He knew in his heart that all the patients needed to laugh. Laughter is after all the best medicine anyone could ask for. But Patch knew how to be serious and when to be. How he treated all the other students, faculty, nurses, and patients truly inspired more than just me, but many people I know. His way of life is one that I recommend for anyone.",/review/rw1026489/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2021,rudicantfail,10," A big ten
","Not often I would give 10 stars, but this is a beautiful movie, I don't know how much Hollywood has altered facts, but if all this is true, them Patch Adams is a truly amazing person. Robin Williams is superb playing the lead role, and he was such an amazing person himself; such a shame he died so tragically tortured. But this was ""his"" movie in a way, how he battled with himself, but always made others feel happy. Such a brilliant human being. The movie itself is a ""must watch"", happiness, sadness, thoughtfulness and a degree of weirdness. The cast is great, but Mr Robin Williams makes this a truly great movie. I can not believe I have waited all these years to watch it. A wonderful wonderful movie.",/review/rw1026489/?ref_=tt_urv

19 December 2015,anaconda-40658,4," Screenplay Needs Patched.
","Patch Adams (1998): Dir: Tom Shadyac / Cast: Robin Williams, Monica Potter, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Bob Gunton, Peter Coyote: Based on the true story of Hunter Adams who is self admitted into an institution due to suicide attempts. He is overjoyed when he helps a patient and aims to become a doctor himself. He is given the name Patch after he fixes a leak in a coffee cup. Too bad that he couldn't fix the leak in the screenplay. Familiar plot with an unnecessary scene involving a meat party that serves no other purpose than for Adams to don the white overcoat. The film seems as a take on One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest with an ending that is contrived. Directed by Tom Shadyac who deals with characters of odd behavior who struggle in their place in society. He previously made The Nutty Professor and Liar Liar. Robin Williams is carrying the film as someone who goes from depressed state to reaching a purpose. Monica Potter serves only as a love interest who will meet tragedy. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is flat as Patch's roommate. Bob Gunston plays the stereotypical dean who dislikes Patch's practice and basically has a stick up his ass. Peter Coyote plays a patient whom Patch attempts to cheer up but only succeeds in pissing off. We are given much insight into this individual that deserves better writing. Laughter can be a solution but not when your story is full of clichés. Score: 4 ½ / 10",/review/rw1026489/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 1999,Yonhap S,7," biased but enjoyable
","Patch Adams is a feel-good movie with nice intentions but somehow the message got muddled.  Robin Williams really plays well as an outrageous character and as a person who cares a lot.  The film uses every sappy and cliched moments for the audience to like it. However, I'm not sure which message the movie wants to point out: laughter is the best medicine or doctors must care for their patients.  Robin Williams displays the former message pretty well.  But doctors aren't all that cold and as in the case of Patch's roommate, we do know he cares for his patients.  In a scene where gynecologists are visiting the hospital, we see Patch has setup a mock of legs where the middle area is the door and watching the doctors enter the hospital is like that famous scene in Look Who's Talking.  It was funny, but I realize also that I wouldn't want that joke played on me. In the generally panned ""courtroom"" scene, we see Patch making a speech where he is being tried for operating a clinic without a license.  He talked his way about improving the quality of life for the patients while skirting the issue that he was illegally operating a clinic. From some of the comments here in IMDB, I think the problem with Patch's character was that his way (supposedly laughter is best medicine) is put too much like a gospel.  What we mostly want is that there are people who care for us (much like what William Hurt's character in The Doctor wanted) and treat us well.  We don't really care about any dumb jokes, we just want to be happy and cared for.  The less fortunate ones like the kids in chemotherapy would benefit more from Patch's clownish ways of entertainment. There's nothing in this movie relating to Make a Wish Foundation, so I wonder why the hell the old woman in the movie must wallow in noodles just so she will eat. Although you could fault the movie for its overly constructed plot, you'll still end up enjoying it.  You just wish for less bias in the story. The verdict: 3.5 of 5 stars.",/review/rw1026489/?ref_=tt_urv
