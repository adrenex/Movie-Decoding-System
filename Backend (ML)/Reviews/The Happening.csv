27 November 2021,TxMike,," After it gets going, a nicely interesting and entertaining movie about a different kind of relationship.
","The story (written and directed by a woman) is not often (if ever) told in movies, a single man wants to start a family and hires a young woman to be a surrogate. The man is intelligent and successful and 45. The young woman had a speed bump as a teenager and now at 26 she works in a coffee shop in San Francisco. But she is lovely and intelligent and has aspirations to finish her degree.",/review/rw7428426/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2021,arungeorge13,7," The screenplay and the leads keep it engaging! [+68%]
","An honest and thoroughly fresh portrayal of surrogacy, Together Together is an occasionally funny and progressive film. Ed Helms (as Matt) and Patti Harrison (as Anna) play the mid-40s and mid-20s loners respectively, their connection slowly evolving into something platonic. While the core plot revolves around the pregnancy aspect, the little details we get to know about the duo and their unlikely chemistry make the film engaging. Their relationship is never explored from a sexual angle, which most clich√©d rom-coms would (I wouldn't classify this as one!) - Together Together remains a dramedy. Both the leads are wonderful, with the supporting cast ably pitching in. There's a sense of predictable aimlessness in the plot, especially in the final 20 minutes and an ending that feels a bit abrupt. It's still worth a viewing for its funny exchanges, however.",/review/rw7428426/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2021,AfricanBro,6," It's an adorable, awkward film
","It's not necessarily a romcom to begin with. It's clear Anna and Matt have a connection but it doesn't transpire into something romantic, though the bond is there. Two awkward, lonely people who share an unfamiliar connection as a surrogate mother and a single father. The actors made the best out of it, I feel. Many great moments that give you hints of a good movie; each moment feels like it's leading to ""that scene"" that's going to make you fall in love with the movie but the scene never comes.",/review/rw7428426/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2021,leandrobfonseca,5," I really was enjoying it!
","I really was enjoying this movie. Really was. But it has no ending. Nope. None. No ending. The lights are just turned off and that's it, get out, go home, go read a book or something...",/review/rw7428426/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2021,papreppergal,5," Comedy? Ok.. at times...
","Yes, I did laugh/chuckle a couple times, but what stands out the most was the awful ending! There's no ""for sure"" ending either way.",/review/rw7428426/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2021,Genti25,9," Stories transcend everything
","It's hard to put emotion into words sometimes, and this movie made it even harder for me. Just brilliant all throughout. It's fascinating how stories can make us feel like we're going through scenarios that we may have never been or might never go through personally. I hard tears by the end.",/review/rw7428426/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2021,peterscarpinato,5," Sweet but significantly underwritten.
",Middle aged man wanting to raise a child alone hires a surrogate. The film is about the platonic bond that they develop over 9 months. It's a dialogue heavy film but the writing is sharp and there are several sweet and humorous moments between the two leads.,/review/rw7428426/?ref_=tt_urv

14 May 2021,Aktham_Tashtush,5," A line somewhere goes like ""I love you in a boring way"", well, it was a bit boring

",I feel like this movie is getting a lot of unwanted hate with regards to its execution and ending and I feel the criticism is somewhat harsh.,/review/rw7428426/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2022,davepetri,6," Could've been a 8 or 9 except....
",A very interesting and heart-warming plot device to explore a friendship and relationship that develops over a year. Matt and Anna are two loners separated by a generation who discover they have much in common as Anna carries Matt's baby. They develop a warm and beautiful friendship but Anna starts to worry it has an expiration date after she delivers the baby. Matt meanwhile focuses on the joys of becoming a new parent not truly understanding Anna's concerns.,/review/rw7428426/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2021,donmccandless-86320,5," Another Shaggy Dog story
","There's a lot of good, here, the leads are well-cast, the acting good, and there's obvious chemistry between them, something you won't find in most TV movies, but you can't cheat the movie goer by not providing an ending. In this case, they changed something that could have been joyous, or at least positive, into yet another sad, disheartening morass. Why do that?",/review/rw7428426/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2021,Erik-Movie-Reviews,5," A Very Mediocre Production Without an Ending
","In spite of attempting to poorly imitate the lettering and typeface of Woody Allen cinematography, found the negative references to Woody Allen and his Oscar winning productions - Annie Hall and Manhattan to be both unnecessary and in poor taste. Unlike the creators of Together, Together , Woody Allen clearly knows how to make a movie.",/review/rw7428426/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2021,benson-rudnick,9," A Charming Surprise
","Nikole Beckwith created a wonderful and charming film. Together Together is filled with so much emotion, laughter, and awkwardness. Beckwith's script is great. It's hilarious and never afraid to show the awkwardness in her characters and the situation they are in. You can imagine how awkward this situation would be.",/review/rw7428426/?ref_=tt_urv

24 April 2021,sme3,6," Many Great Parts That Do Not Quite Add Up To A Great Whole
","Every performance in TOGETHER TOGETHER is outstanding, and amidst such an excellent cast, Patti Harrison's performance still manages to outshine the others. The film is filled with many delightful scenes and moments. It has enough scenes that go nowhere or are presented too unconventionally to really work well that the film does not consistently engage. This thoughtful film is never dull, but it does have brief moments of disinterest. At least on the big screen, the make up on the actors is distractingly obvious.",/review/rw7428426/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2022,pauldeucher,5," The end messed up the whole thing.
","Ok, the end messed up the entire movie. I got so mad!!! The movie was so sweet, but then the last 10 seconds messed up everything. It would be an 8 out of 10. Now it's a 4.",/review/rw7428426/?ref_=tt_urv

22 November 2021,evanston_dad,6," Pretty Blah
","A pretty blah romcom about the complicated relationship that builds between a forty something single man and the much younger woman he has hired to be his surrogate. I guess it's pleasant enough and I wasn't ever exactly bored. But when not being bored is the bar you're measuring a movie against, it's a sign that it could have have been much better.",/review/rw7428426/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2021,huyzer,10," A beautiful story that is a great study on human nature
","All I really want to say without spoiling too much is that human nature is, or can be, messy and complicated. The issues that the two confront seems real to me. This made me appreciate the character very much as I could relate to them and empathize. The setting/plot is something I could easily imagine involving myself personally.",/review/rw7428426/?ref_=tt_urv
