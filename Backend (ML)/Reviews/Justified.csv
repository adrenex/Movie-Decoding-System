29 October 2022,DiCaprioFan13,10," Love This Show!!
","I don't even know how to describe how much I loved this show. Justified is easily one of my favorite shows of all-time! The show is about a wild-west like U. S. Marshall Deputy named Raylan Givens (Timothy Olyphant) who will go to any lengths to bring justice to the criminals he's hunting. This all takes place in his hometown in Kentucky. Olyphant was absolutely perfect in this as Raylan Givens. The rest of the cast is great too, especially the incredibly underrated Walton Goggins as outlaw Boyd Crowder. I literally loved every episodes of every season. I heard they're bringing it back after in 2023 for another season so I can't wait!",/review/rw2587937/?ref_=tt_urv

17 May 2020,Supermanfan-13,10," One of the most underrated and best shows ever created!
","Justified is one of the most underrated and best tv shows I've ever seen and absolutely deserves all the great reviews and high ratings it gets! It's one of the rare shows where every season is as good as the others. Timothy Olyphant was perfect in this as Raylan Givens. I can't say enough about this phenomenal show except to go watch it, you will not be disappointed! Absolutely loved it!",/review/rw2587937/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2022,info-90701,8," I'm on Season Four and . . .
","The show is great, though the people are horrible human beings, almost all of them. It is a frightening statement about good and evil, and all the blurry, indistinct, self-involved lines in between. It is a vivid, dismal view of the darkness in human beings and the ugliness of always making money king. It is depressing, brilliant, devastating, uplifting and everything in between. A roller coaster of the horrors of human beings in the US, as shown through a distinct group of people who apparently, are a bit off the grid in their thinking and actions, and yet are a reflection of the rest of the madness in this country.",/review/rw2587937/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2022,brooksrob1,10," Because we dug coal together. ~a tear~
","After a third binge, I had to check IMDB out to see how others viewed it...I have loved this show since it first came on... Raylen *Olyphant has the most endearing mannerisms throughout...Never a stupid line... His self assured nature gets him in trouble a few times but; He'll deliver and ""Aww shucks"" statement that just makes his character amazing...",/review/rw2587937/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2022,redx1708,10," Top rating is ""Justified"".
","Very few shows running over several seasons would qualify for a 10 rating. Sooner or later there's gotta be a decline in quality. Could be plot holes, ideas getting thin or simply that they are losing pace. Even shows that I enjoyed would, when I eyed them objectively, only be getting a 7 or 8 rating.",/review/rw2587937/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2015,deloudelouvain,8," Once upon a time in Kentucky...
","I just finished the whole series and I enjoyed every single one of the episodes from all seasons. This is an underrated series that deserves much more people to know about it. I'm normally not a big fan of Kentucky accent but in this show it's just great. The conversations between the actors are also excellent. I just love the way they talk in Justified. The actors are all top notch, can't really fail anybody on this show. Walton Goggins (as Boyd Crowder) and Timothy Olyphant (as Raylan Givens)are definitely the two actors that carry this series to a higher level. Their eternal battle against each other is a pleasure for the eye and ear. The story is well written, you never get bored for a second. I certainly will watch Justified again in the future.",/review/rw2587937/?ref_=tt_urv

13 July 2022,revrobertv,10," Masterpiece
","I know I can tend to be pretty critical about television shows. I have to say this show is a masterpiece. The acting is impeccable. The character choice, one of the best I've ever seen in watching television for 55 years. I'm not going to leave spoilers here for the show. If you want to sit down and thoroughly enjoy a television series, Justified will not disappoint.",/review/rw2587937/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2022,beso-langa,9," The funniest crime series I've ever watched!!!
","Walton Goggins (Boyd Crowder) steals the show. Timothy Olyphant runs it but it is the anecdotes of the offbeat criminal characters such as Arlo, Dewey, Dickie Bennet & family, Limehouse and Wyn that just makes this ensemble tick. I doubt reading the short story could justify, no puns intended, the right measure of action, comedy and drama. This show kicks ass and I feel I caught it late for the right time. There aren't as many brilliant shows nowadays. Yeah Breaking Bad was the $#! T but I don't even think Saul Goodman/ Jimmy McGill is as hilarious or superb like Boyd Crowder. I can't wait for the anthology...",/review/rw2587937/?ref_=tt_urv

",Just watched it for the third time all the way through. It is so good. Tim and Walton did so good...their growing rivalry mixed with their respect for each other is amazing. Walton just delivers an unparalleled witty performance. Probably watch it again sooner than later,/review/rw2587937/?ref_=tt_urv

","Timothy Olyphant and Walton Goggins worked well together all the seasons are great and worthy of rewatches, most of the villains are fantasic , Raylan is a great lawman and a total badass, Boyd is one of the best anti hero characters ever written, you wont be disappointed with Justified it had a fitting finale",/review/rw2587937/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2022,baltdis,10," Kentucky mafia meets Detroit mafia meets the law. The law wins.
",Raylan Givens always gets his man. Modern day western and fantastic character development. The twisting story between Boyd Crowder and Raylan Givens is incredible start to finish. Do not pass up this series.,/review/rw2587937/?ref_=tt_urv

","Cindy and I went to college at Eastern Kentucky University in Richmond, Ky. We had many acquaintances from Harlan County - where Justified takes place.

","Justified is another fine entry into FX's stable of shows. As a fan of both crime fiction & serialized television, this has been on my radar for some time. First, the story is wonderfully structured & grounded in reality (It helps when you shoot on location & cast actors that actually feel like they belong there) The U.S. Marshalls & their multiple duties have always been a great source for story-telling, and this is no different. Second, the cast is perfect for this type of slow-burn law enforcement story. Timothy Olyphant once again nails the 'cowboy' role we've seen him in before(Deadwood, The Crazies). He runs the risk of being type-cast; but if he's always this good in these types of roles, who cares? The rest of the cast is rounded-out by some familiar & not-so-familiar faces, and the whole of them seem to bring their A-game to this project. The third reason this show is quality is the production value. Everything from the costumes(I love the cowboy hat) to the locations & the music have all been perfectly fitting with the story & the characters. This show also sneaks up on you a little bit, once you think Justified isn't 'edgy' enough for FX, something happens to change your mind. It's only similar to the other FX crime shows in that it centers around a really angry guy. I hope Justified & FX continue to pleasantly surprise me.",/review/rw2587937/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2020,MNKim1967,9," ""Justified"", a show I loved to hate.
","In a nutshell, I loved to hate ""Justified"". The only reason it came to my attention after multiple years of being a completed series is because it kept showing up in my Hulu queue as something I might be interested in, so, eventually, I tuned in and kept tuning in because of the excellent casting and acting, dialogue, and overall production; in other words, it really is a great series. Why did I love to hate it?; because the ""bad guys"" won a lot more than the ""good guys"". ""Justified"" is essentially a ""Wild, Wild West"" drama relocated to the hills of Kentucky where gold and black gold have been replaced by the illicit drug trade and greed and abject poverty keep the wheels constantly greased; bodies drop like matchsticks and life is basically worthless to those around you who's only moral code is ""don't get caught"", and most don't because many of the ""powers that be"" are either in on it, or, just don't care. Sounds depressing, I know, and, sometimes, I could only watch an episode at a time, however, I continued to watch it until the end (there were also times I could swear the banjo from ""Deliverance"" was going to play which gives credence to the quality of production). I'd recommend at least tuning in once - you might like it.",/review/rw2587937/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2020,ibibrov,9," Superb performances, great writing, with a superb final scene
","I have to admit, when it comes to watching shows, it's very hard for me to watch for longer than about 4 seasons at once, so I automatically get a little prejudiced. However, some of the characters just annoyed me, such as Ava Crowder, especially in the later seasons, she just pissed me off. But the writing, and especially the performances of Timothy Oluphant and Walton Goggins as the ultra cool Raglan Givens and the Incredibly charismatic Boyd Crowder, and their entire relationship and dynamic were bar-none masterful, and one of the most complex, and riveting duos I've ever seen. The final scene sums up pretty much the entire show and their relationship and it was incredible. The cinematography and music were also all very great, and I also really appreciate that they didn't insert sjw politics etc, for the most part, so in summary, I'm very happy with this show, and rate it 8.5/10.",/review/rw2587937/?ref_=tt_urv

8 September 2018,bhester0806,10," One of the special ones
",Just finished rewatching Justified for the 3rd time and it's better every time. It's one of the if not the best show ever made. All the actors go above and beyond. Timothy O completely embodies Raylan Givens down to the walk. Walton G's Boyd is probably the best and most articulate bad guy of all times. A lot of people won't make it through the first season but the ones that do will be so glad they did.,/review/rw2587937/?ref_=tt_urv

8 May 2015,f_nastase,10," Definitely worth every second I've spent in front of the screen
","Positively one of the best TV shows I've seen in years. I, for one, didn't cared as much about gun action( which by they way is abundant) as I did for the excellent dialogue and the acting. Acting in particular is extremely good, not one single character is out of his role, to be truthful even a dog if you see in a scene in this series, you get the feeling that it's exactly where that dog belongs to. As for the dialogue, it is so good, that it's actually the only flaw this show has. It seems very unlikely that all that crowd of cunning rednecks have such a large arsenal of polite irony, well placed quotes, to the border of well educated people and yet fall over and over to next man's scheme or simply go down by the hand of their own stupidity. Anyways I cannot up-vote this show enough and I can only suggest to make yourselves comfortable in any greasy sofa you have, and prepare to get ported to Harlan, Kentucky.",/review/rw2587937/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2022,Bobby1331,10," Just about perfect
",What can you say about this incredible show that hasn't already been said? It's one of the best tv shows ever. This show will grab you and pull you in until the next thing you know you binged the entire series. Every episode is so incredibly written and the entire cast is perfect. Every season had such high expectations but it not only continued to meet those expectations but exceeded them season after season. There's really nothing I can say about this show that hasn't already been said. If you haven't seen this yet then do yourself a favor and go watch it as soon as possible. It's the perfect show.,/review/rw2587937/?ref_=tt_urv
