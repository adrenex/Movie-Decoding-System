29 October 2019,3xHCCH,8," Account of Crucial Naval Battle in Emmerich Style
","This film is a straightforward retelling of the events in the first months of the War in the Pacific beginning with Pearl Harbor and culminating in the Battle of Midway (June 1942). In between, it also touched on Doolittle's Raid on Tokyo (April 1942) and the Battle of Coral Sea (May 1942). The story was told mainly from the point of view of two American soldiers, namely pilot Lt. Dick Best (Ed Skrein) who led his dive bomber squadron at Midway, and intelligence officer Lt. Comm. Edwin Layton (Patrick Wilson) who with his code-breaker team predicted the Midway attack.",/review/rw5247591/?ref_=tt_urv

27 November 2019,sme3,5," Unbelievable
","Abundant, not-quite-realistic computer-generated images make Midway look more like a video game than a depiction of real-life events. The overuse of subpar effects is the most dominant - but hardly the only - problem dogging this film. Epic war stories are difficult to tell without focusing on a few characters. This film unsuccessfully juggles too many plot threads and too many characters to keep an emotional anchor to the simulated events unfolding. Woody Harrelson is outstanding, but other cast members cannot overcome the limitations of the material and the challenges of acting on computer-generated sets.",/review/rw5247591/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2019,rbstern,5," Can't get on board with the positive reviews
","First, I'll agree that the filmmakers got a lot of details right: The timing of the U.S. attacks when the Japanese were caught in the rearming process. The poor performance of the Devastator TBD. Faulty torpedoes. The politics of the Japanese military. The fast turn-around getting Yorktown out to sea again. And lots more.",/review/rw5247591/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2020,Prismark10,5," Midway
",Roland Emmerich's Midway is a loud brash World War 2 action film with plenty of CGI. The inspiration might had been Star Wars rather than actual events.,/review/rw5247591/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2020,grantss,4," Amateurish
","In May 1942 the Imperial Japanese Navy launches an attack on the island of Midway in the Pacific Ocean. Securing it will provide a base for operations against Pearl Harbour and ultimately allow them to attack the US west coast. However, US Navy Intelligence has worked out their plan. Admiral Chester Nimitz sends two US Task Groups with three aircraft carriers to set a trap for the Japanese fleet. What follows is one of the most important battles in history.",/review/rw5247591/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2020,westsideschl,4," Gum
","When the opening scenes show a gum chomping, high risk cowboy pilot putting his & other's lives at risk by showboating a dangerous stunt onto a carrier I knew what type of factuality was in store for the rest of the movie. Lots of, we never do anything wrong, nationalistic fervor which added to questioning where the movie was going. Movie is filled with scenes of animated fighters being shot at, and shooting back. The usual family, romance scenes to capture more paying viewers. Japanese, of course, mostly portrayed as ruthless such as tying an anchor to a captured pilot who upon refusing to divulge info on his unit is tossed into the sea (we see him sink slowly down of course). Odd that the end credits said dedicated to the American & Japanese sailers at Midway.",/review/rw5247591/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2020,planktonrules,7," Better than the 1976 version.
","While I know a lot of reviewers liked the 1976 version of ""Midway"", for someone who knows about aircraft, it's a frustrating film. Again and again and again, the film uses old footage...much of which show planes which never fought at this famous sea battle! And, in a few cases, you'd see fighter planes turn into dive bombers and the like....all due to sloppy editing and a 'it's good enough' attitude. Because of this, I strongly recommend you see the 2019 version, which gets around this issue by using CGI...and modern CGI is incredible and looks real. Well made, but not perfect, but a very good film for folks who are interested in war films and history.",/review/rw5247591/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2020,cricketbat,6," Feels like a made-for-TV movie
","Midway feels like a made-for-TV movie. It's full of cliched dialogue, acting, and plot points. When most of your movie hinges on the lead actor's performance, and that performance turns out to be melodramatic and cheesy, you've got a problem. Also, the visual effects were inconsistent, swinging from impressive to corny. This isn't a bad movie, but it's going to be easy for me to forget about it.",/review/rw5247591/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2019,RMS1949,4," Rather watch a good documentary on Midway
","While impressed with some of the CGI visuals, the overall storytelling of this event in history just felt too Hollywood. The scope of what laid before them and the true bravery of the men who fought that day seemed lost in all the visuals.
The importance of how the intelligence gathering before the fighting was handled initially, then eventually was also poorly presented. They are some excellent documentaries on Midway, suggest you track them down..",/review/rw5247591/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2020,TheOneThatYouWanted,3," The CGI is trash
",And the movie isn't much better. Such a shame how bad CGI can kill a movie. But this is an action war flick and CGI needs to be watchable at the very least.,/review/rw5247591/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2019,BA_Harrison,6," You sunk my battleship!
","Midway is not just the name of the place where a historic WWII sea battle took place between the Americans and the Japanese, it's also the point in this film where I realised I didn't know what was going on. Director Roland Emmerich (Godzilla, Independence Day, 2012) is obviously no slouch when it comes to action scenes, bringing us some truly astonishing battle sequences that provide much bang for your buck, but he struggles to tell his complex historical story with any coherence.",/review/rw5247591/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2020,Leofwine_draca,6," As good as you can expect
","MIDWAY is a WW2 epic that's about as good as it has any right to be given that the director is Roland Emmerich. It's one of those ""does what it says on the tin"" type movies in that it gets straight to the heart of the matter, beginning with the attack on Pearl Harbor and moving through the epic naval battle centred around the titular Pacific island. Emmerich's characters are cardboard cut-outs, but at least they're cut-outs occupied by an ensemble cast of familiar Hollywood stars, who have some talent to bring. The plot is lightweight but the action comes thick and fast and the CGI effects are certainly of a superior quality, generally convincing even when watched in high definition on a large television set. Expect plenty of drama, heroics and spectacle to keep the brain occupied, and if it's a little shallow for some tastes, you can rest assured that Emmerich has done much, much worse and that we're lucky to get this kind of standard from him.",/review/rw5247591/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2019,keikoyoshikawa,1," Appallingly Bad

8 November 2019,azanti0029,8," A commendable effort but needs a longer directors cut - RELEASE IT PLEASE
","Midway is well made thrown back to the historical war movie epics of the 1960s and 1970s, covering a wide spectrum of elements that made up a key moment in history. It's not a perfect film, but its one of the best of its type to be made in a good long while.",/review/rw5247591/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2021,pmtelefon,6," E for effort
","There is a lot of good stuff in ""Midway"". But for some reason, it doesn't work as well as it should have. One problem is the look of the movie. It took me quite a while to get used to it. A lot of the movie doesn't look real. A little actual location photography would have gone a long way. The characters were another problem. In real life these men were great heroes but in the movie they weren't that interesting. ""Midway"" does have its fair share of excitement. There's no denying that. It's just that, overall, this movie misses the mark.",/review/rw5247591/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2019,phd_travel,10," Best WW2 movie in decades
",Finally there is a WW2 movie with the right balance of modern effects and good storytelling. I've always preferred the straightforward stories in Tora Tora Tora and A Bridge Too Far over the newer gory angst filled war movies and those which deal with obscure insignificant incidents. Unlike Bay's Pearl Harbor or the older Midway movie there is no wasted time on silly romances. Also the dragginess of Eastwood and the gore of Spielberg are not present here.,/review/rw5247591/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2019,mhorg2018,8," Good movie with a few glaring errors.
","First, the cast was great, especially Woody Harrelson as Chester Nimitz. The Battle scenes and the movie itself, were far superior to the 76 version, and they left out the lame love story. The two biggest errors were: Wade McCluskey loses his bomb due to an electrical arming error in his dauntless (he was also a dauntless pilot, but they did Hollywood it up a bit), and they never once showed an American fighter, which is a glaring omission. The F4F Wildcat was the fleet fighter at the time. Both it and the horrible Brewster Buffalo (flying from Midway) should have been present. The torpedo hitting a Japanese ship and failing was totally true, in fact, one broke up and floated, enabling Japanese sailors to use it to be rescued. This was thanks to the penny pinching of the US government before the war. Some authors I'll suggest are, Prange, Lord and Symonds if anyone wants to know more.",/review/rw5247591/?ref_=tt_urv

23 September 2020,antimatter33,1," Astoundingly bad
","It is impossible to fail more than this film does. It fails on every single level. It is above all, absolutely boring. There is no coherent story, there is nothing of interest, the special effects are so unbelievable than suspension of disbelief, an option usually reserved for science fiction, is not even possible. Indeed, this is an attempt to turn WW-2 into Star Wars, only with unlikable assholes behind the controls instead of righteous rebels. There is no way to list in a short review all the ways in which this film fails, but the most essential one is that is is just filled with the most insufferable pouting, smirking jerks imaginable. You actually root for the Japanese to win. It is not even worth going into all the ways the actual battle was not even touched. Forget history. Forget flying. Forget naval strategy. All that is missing is Darth Vader-San, looming over the Japanese flagship and barking Japanese commands, with portentous music throbbing in the background. The movie would have been more interesting that way, maybe with say a Japanese-American flyer who has some telepathic connection with Admiral Vader-San. Ruke - I am your father! Astounding how such trash gets financed and made.",/review/rw5247591/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is probably the first time in over 50 years Hollywood made a solid war movie without inserting a sappy, contrived romantic sub-plot, pushing some radical political agenda, or re-writing history.
