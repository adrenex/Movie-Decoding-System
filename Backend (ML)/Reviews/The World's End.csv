16 March 2020,gradyharp,8," 'He's about as flirty as the grizzly from The Revenant'
","It takes courage to place this true story before the public at this time of the political climate during debates by presidential candidates and retorts from the sitting president who is famous for his association with Fox News. Charles Randolph (The Big Short, and The Life of David Gale) has written a penetrating screenplay about the 2016 explosion when Fox News persona Roger Ailes was finally exposed for sexual harassment by some courageous women. Director Jay Roach (Trumbo, Blown Away, Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery, etc) makes this story come vividly to life, unafraid to insert film clips of Donald Trump's appearances as the case unfolds, as well as including the lesbian relationships that give the story a new grounding.",/review/rw5345046/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2020,andrewchristianjr,7," ACTING AND MAKEUP ON POINT.
",Excellent acting and makeup transformed actors to real life people they portrayed. Interesting take on the fox news scandal. Mix of movie made news with real news was awesome.,/review/rw5345046/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2020,olivewahh,8," A powerful and enjoyable film
","I didn't know much on this story when it all happened, possibly cause I'm based in Australia and it was an American scandal, but the whole story is so powerful and should be shared across the globe.",/review/rw5345046/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2021,Sleepin_Dragon,7," An interesting story.
","We have been in a.period of change for some time, and it has taken some very brave women to stand up, make a stand and say enough is enough.",/review/rw5345046/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2020,blanche-2,7," story of the takedown of Roger Ailes
","I won't write too much because it doesn't seem to me that anyone is reviewing this film. If you're right wing, you don't like it and will condemn any review that compliments it, and vice versa.",/review/rw5345046/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2019,UniqueParticle,8," Incredibly well filmed, definitely deserves better
","Riveting acting throughout, great cinematography and well written! I'm not fully sure what the hate is about but I surely loved the bulk of the movie. I appreciate the tearjerker aspect and the points it was making known; maybe the masses is fed up I am not I think Bombshell is very important! I am glad I was able to see on opening day and before the golden globes. More enjoy my review than expected so thanks so much!",/review/rw5345046/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2019,rockman182,7," Bombshell (2019)
","I was extremely interested in watching this film. Fox News is a circus at times but I really wanted to see a portrayal of the incidents surrounding sexual harassment and Roger Ailes. I also thought the three leads involved are really great castings and wanted to see how two of them portrayed Gretchen Carlson and Megyn Kelly. The film touches on important matters that has recently come to the light in droves, however the film doesn't always reach its potential although I did enjoy the film for the most part.",/review/rw5345046/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2020,evanston_dad,7," Surprisingly Entertaining
","Despite a couple of Oscar nominations for acting, ""Bombshell"" was greeted pretty indifferently by audiences and critics alike when it came out last year. Perhaps it was due to my low expectations, then, but I was surprised by how much I liked this movie. It's slick and glib and fairly superficial, but it's extremely watchable and very entertaining, and the acting is indeed exceptional. Charlize Theron and Margot Robbie were singled out for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress nominations, respectively. But I was as impressed with Nicole Kidman and John Lithgow.",/review/rw5345046/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2020,proud_luddite,7," Good and timely
","Based on a true story: Roger Ailes (John Lithgow) was the head of Fox News beginning in 1996. In 2016, he faced accusations of sexual assault from Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron), Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) and Kayla Pospisil (a composite character played by Margot Robbie).",/review/rw5345046/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2020,CriticalOfEverything,4," Means well, but gradually devolves into uninteresting slop.
","This film would've been a great one if they actually went full on with what it was doing, but sadly we just get a shallow film that feels like it was only made for people in Hollywood and literally no one else on Earth. There's a lot about the actual real life subject matter that would've been great to explore in film, and while the performances are great, it just doesn't do the subject justice.",/review/rw5345046/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2020,kjproulx,6," Great Information in a Mediocre Film
","While I wasn't all that familiar with this story that went on behind the scenes at Fox News, I was very intrigued to see a film tackling one of the very first stories of women taking a stand against a powerful man, abusing that power. While this was a great story overall, there are a lot of elements missing here that could've made it a fantastic film. This film feels more like a tool to showcase how corporations have been run in the past, but there wasn't enough depth to really dive in. Filled with great performances and a true story worth exploring, here's why I believe Bombshell is one big missed opportunity.",/review/rw5345046/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2020,ewanfortune,9," Quality
","This was a risky film to make. It's taking a sensitive topic and basing the story around true events that happened within the last 5 years, including stuff around Donald Trump. As well as this, the movie isn't strictly drama with a 'Vice' type vibe around it. However, at least in my opinion, they pulled it off. It balances the almost comic feel it has with serious moments and intentionally uncomfortable ones. It's a scathing look inside mega corporations and how sex is sold.",/review/rw5345046/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2019,TigerHeron,10," Bitter Truths
","This is a very good movie about the dynamics of sexual harassment. The fear, the betrayals, the shame, the conflicting feelings--it's all here. Extraordinary performance by Charlize Theron. Margot Robbie is also excellent and although Nicole Kidman hams it up a bit, she's fun to watch.",/review/rw5345046/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2020,grantss,7," Good, and surprisingly so
","July 2016. Gretchen Carlson was once one of the most popular presenters on Fox News but now has been relegated to minor timeslot. She is considering suing Fox News CEO Roger Ailes for sexual harassment and when she is let go by Fox, she does so. She tries to get other women to come forward but gains little traction. Megyn Kelly, another Fox reporter, has her own secrets regarding Ailes but is not sure whether she should come forward. Kayla, a junior reporter, has more recent experiences of the matter.",/review/rw5345046/?ref_=tt_urv

29 November 2020,lee_eisenberg,10," in a world of MeToo, this becomes all the more important
","In 2016, Fox News commentator Gretchen Carlson accused CEO Roger Ailes of sexually harassing her. Anchorwoman Megyn Kelly soon followed suit, and Ailes resigned. Jay Roach's ""Bombshell"" looks at this story, and what goes on behind the scenes at Fox News. Anyone who cares about serious journalism already viewed the channel as an insult to journalism. As the movie makes clear, Ailes cared only about showing off young blonde women in skimpy dresses.",/review/rw5345046/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2020,Pairic,8," Great Drama
","Bombshell: The story of the women who brought down Roger Alies, head of Fox News. John Lithgow is virtually unrecognisable as the obese Alies but portrays him with creepy gusto. Sadly Malcolm McDowell only has a cameo as Rupert Murdoch but makes those minutes count, Alies was dispensable if the Fox News money generator was to survive. The real star is Nicole Kidman as Gretchen Carlson who fed up with humiliation decides to sue Alies for sexual harassment, she knew what she was getting into and the travails she suffered during the fight are vividly portrayed. Charlzie Theron plays Megyn Kelly who has a run in with Trump and suffers a year of abuse from him and his supporters, the effect it has on her and her family will scorch your heart. But that heart will gladden when she joins in with Carlson. Margot Robbie and Kate McKinnon are both great in supporting roles. Jay Roach directs from a script by Charles Randolph and delivers a gripping drama. 8/10.",/review/rw5345046/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2020,philthegreatone-786-63058,8," Bombshell
","This was an interesting film about the fox news boss Roger Ailes and him being accussed of sexual harrasment. Megyn Kelly played by Charlize Theron who is the lead anchor along with Gretchen Carlson played by Nicole Kidman team up to try and take him down. Margot Robbie also plays a young employee who will do anything to get ahead, she puts in a great performance. The film is really well acted and the story was interesting if you are interested in fox news and toxic work environments that need to stop. The politics include Donald Trumps 2016 presidential election campaign. I do recommend this film. The acting was strong and the story was compelling",/review/rw5345046/?ref_=tt_urv

",It's 2015 at Fox News headed by Roger Ailes (John Lithgow). Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron) is the star prime time anchor. Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) feels that she's being pushed aside. Kayla Pospisil (Margot Robbie) is her ambitious corporate climbing producer.,/review/rw5345046/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2019,nogodnomasters,10," There's not an audience for that side of the story
","Roger Ailes (John Lithgow) made women rich and famous at Fox News. He didn't see the harm in ""demanding loyalty."" Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) was terminated for not submitting to Roger and filed a personal lawsuit against him and not against Fox. She stood alone. No one would come to her aid and say ""Me Too."" Meanwhile, Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron) had to make a career and monetary decision. Roger did not stand by her when Trump attacked her. The loyalty didn't work both ways. Payback is a b*tch. She decided that you can't be wrong to stand on the side of truth. And we know what happened to her career.",/review/rw5345046/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2019,dianavart,5," I watched ""the loudest voice"" just recently and TV show was so mich better than a movie
","I found the story very interesting, but I think it was absolutely impossible to fit all the interesting details that actually help you to comprehend the story in 1,5 hours movie.
In TV Show ""The loudest Voice"" you get to live the story through. You actually see what kind of person RA was, especially towards women.
For me it was TV show of a year.
So, the movie for me felt way too short and way too fast. It's hard to follow and understand what was actually going on.
It was like watching on rewind.
The acting was fantastic, I think everyone did a great job, but the story was too superficial. Not deep enough for my taste.",/review/rw5345046/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2020,rdoubleoc,8," Very digestible
","If you're a fan of any or all of the three main cast members, or were wondering what really happened in this story and didn't read it in the news before, you'll like this movie.",/review/rw5345046/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2020,BA_Harrison,1," You were bored stiff? #MeToo
","It goes without saying that it is disgusting when men in power abuse their position by taking advantage of women in a sexual manner, but who the hell thought that the Fox News scandal would make for a compelling movie? Never has 109 minutes seemed so long. Director Jay Roach, so good at goofball comedy, bored my socks off with this dreary feminist drama that moves slowly and uneventfully towards its inevitable damp squib of a climax (when sex-pest Roger Ailes gets what's coming to him -- a $40 million settlement from Rupert Murdoch).",/review/rw5345046/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2020,Turfseer,6," Lack of suspense and sanitized depiction of female Fox broadcasters diminish otherwise solid re-telling of Fox News head honcho's downfall
","Bombshell chronicles the end of an era at Fox News, with the abrupt departure of Roger Ailes, head of the conservative network, one year before his death in 2017. It's a story I was only slightly familiar with, having read a few headlines and articles about it, at the time it all took place. Director Jay Roach and screenwriter Charles Randolph attempt to flesh out the particulars with modest success.",/review/rw5345046/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2019,donaldnwolfe,9," Great Acting
","The message delivery is quite heavy-handed and pedantic at the end, but the first 90% of the film does an excellent job of illustrating the difficulties women face when harassed in the workplace. The acting is superior - especially Theron's portrayal of Megyn Kelly, for which an Oscar should be awarded. I highly recommend this movie and if Fox lovers can't handle the truth, that's hardly a surprise.",/review/rw5345046/?ref_=tt_urv
