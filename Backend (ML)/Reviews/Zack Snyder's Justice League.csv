23 June 2016,kevin_newdirections,7," The hit-to-miss ratio is surprisingly higher than you expect.
","When a film has a tagline as witty and sharp as Central Intelligence's – ""Saving the world takes a little Hart and a big Johnson"" — something tells me that the producers came up with that pun first and decided to commission a script around it after. True enough, this film is an excuse to have Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Kevin Hart play delightfully silly characters amidst a fairly disposable plot. It really doesn't matter because you won't see this film for a complex plot, you'll see this film for some good laughs. The hit-to-miss ratio is surprisingly higher than you expect.",/review/rw3487167/?ref_=tt_urv

21 July 2016,charliesonnyray,5," Surprisingly Fun
","Recently a lot of Kevin Hart's movies have been pretty lack luster. The Ride Along movies and Get Hard were shredded by critics. When I saw the trailer for Central Intelligence, I thought this would be just another one of those flicks. Thankfully, I was very wrong! The page here lists the film as an ""action, comedy, crime"" movie but really it is more of a ""action, comedy, drama"" flick. Dwayne Johnson plays the gentle giant Bob Stone/Robby Weirdicht (haha pun) who works for the CIA while Kevin Hart plays the everyday joe Calvin Joyner (a nice change of pace in my opinion). These two are the reason this film works as pure entertainment. They have great chemistry together and they play rather interesting characters. Robby is on the same level as Jason Bourne when it comes to hand to hand combat and other spy stuff like that but he has the sensitivity and the tastes of a fourteen year old girl. I don't care who you are, you have to admit that's hilarious. Calvin was the favorite student of his high school but now he is just a washed up accountant upset with where his life has gone. Hart and Johnson bring some real comedy to their roles as well as true conviction. You can believe that these two are dealing with some real emotional problems. I never thought of either of them as good actors but they do a splendid job here. The stunts they pull also look so very realistic. They are very thrilling and pretty creative too. Now the movie isn't without problems-what movie is? The spy portion of the plot is pretty straight forward and shallow. It's obviously just an excuse to get these two together but is that really such a bad thing when what they are offering is so good? Central Intelligence is kind of like that movie Twins with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny Devito. Two popular actors play as comic foils to one another as well as provide great drama with some cool stunts thrown in. What more could you want?",/review/rw3487167/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2016,lesleyharris30,8," Mega Fun with Great Chemistry Between its Two Leads,
","Central Intelligence is a great movie with a well developed plot and a terrific comedic cast. It's a fun, mindless comedy action that you can switch off from reality while watching and have a good time, there are many side splitting moments and even parts that had me at the edge of my seat. The writers did a great job of making us care for these characters before they set off on their journey, which helped out in the long run. However, the pacing was certainly slow, it was not as action packed and intense as the trailers made it out to be, there's a lot of slower moments, even times where I was begging for some plot development instead of mindless comedy. The cast are terrific, Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson shine in the lead roles and their chemistry is the film's highlight, they are joined by a stellar supporting cast that includes Amy Ryan and Aaron Paul, as well as a few brilliant cameos. It also deserves credit for switching roles and getting the lead actors to do something unexpected of them, putting the well known comedian, Hart, in a straight role and putting an action star, Johnson, as the flamboyant, over the top character, this differentiated the movie, making it more interesting. Though it may not be as exciting as the trailers made it seem, Central Intelligence is simple fun, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or comedy.

17 June 2016,captainmike-michael,8," Great Chemistry between Johnson and Hart
","Forget about the formulaic spies plot and its flaws, the film does not look silly for the wise decision of making it into a comedy and it sparks thanks to the strong rapport between Johnson and Hart. The thriller may seems to be dumb and lack of inventiveness in all the right ways but it is also a bit smarter than what audiences could have expected. The hilarious but not nonsense actions, sweet high- school buddies friendships, comedy about bullies and inspiration to transform a better oneself however are all blended well into this lack-of-originality thriller; though insufficient to generate big humors, it is still able to keep your smile till the end. The film centralises on the delightful chemistry between the two actors, both Hart and Johnson deliver a cheerful bromantic, especially the latter who takes his character and silliness seriously other than just knowing to flex muscles. It might lack in depth to explain about the quest of the mission but it is overall entertaining due to the commitment of the cast to bring us laughter.",/review/rw3487167/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2016,quincytheodore,7," The polarizing duo might not have the best chemistry, but each has their own quirky way to entertain
","It's quite possible that they cast Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson just to make ""Little Hart, Big Johnson"" pun. As far as buddy cop goes, this contrasting nature can provide some chuckles, however the espionage them might not hit all the marks. Still, there are significant amount of scenes where laughter is secured by sheer timely body language and jokes alone.",/review/rw3487167/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2016,The-Sarkologist,5," Entertaining - but that's it
","Well, here's the deal – we have the film beginning on the last day of high school where Calvin Joyner is voted to the student most likely to succeed, while Bob Stone (not his real name) is in the shower dancing. Stone is then grabbed by some bullies, naked, and thrown into the middle of the gym, where all the school is watching. Everybody, but Joyner, is laughing at Stone, however Joyner gives Stone his jacket, and that is basically the last anybody hears of him.",/review/rw3487167/?ref_=tt_urv

","Calvin Joyner ( Kevin Hart) had it all at Central High School...athletic, drama club, and he married Maggie (Danielle Nicolet). Life as an accountant has been anti-climatic for him.

2 July 2016,choatelodge,3," Missed opportunities
","Saw this last night on the big screen, not expecting much but hoping to be entertained. Sadly that didn't happen. Why? I has to have been the movie's writing and the way it was directed. It just never got started, and while the actors' delivery in the various scenes had to have been what the director wanted, it just never rang true. I'll leave off any explanation of the plot and story line, others have done a great job at that. I'll just stick to what I feel are the failings of the directing and writing.",/review/rw3487167/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2018,monkeysgalore,10," It All Depends On What You Like
","As with so many other films like this, I went in expecting to like it, but also prepared myself for the fact that it may be disappointing, as The Rock and Kevin Hart both often put out hit-or-miss films, but this one greatly surpassed my expectations, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",/review/rw3487167/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2016,moviexclusive,7," You won't find a more dynamic pair than Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart this summer, and thanks to their chemistry, this odd-couple buddy action comedy genuinely pops
","As convenient as it may be to pigeonhole 'Central Intelligence' into the label of a buddy cop movie, the always-amusing, often-hilarious and surprisingly-affecting action comedy really is much more. For starters, Kevin Hart's Calvin Joyner isn't a cop at all; in fact, he's a put- upon mild-mannered accountant who is disillusioned with his job and where he is at in life, despite being married to his high-school sweetheart (Danielle Nicolet). For another, Calvin and Dwayne Johnson's Bob Stone can't quite be called buddies, especially since they have been out of touch with each other for the past twenty years and are only reconnecting upon Bob's initiation on the eve of their high school homecoming reunion party.",/review/rw3487167/?ref_=tt_urv

16 June 2016,anish-25809,7," Watch this while it's still playing.(Spoiler-free)
","Here comes another buddy cop film,this time with Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart in the lead roles.I thought this movie would fail miserably.I thought it was ripping off Ride Along(which is not a good film to rip off) but it surprisingly stands on its own and makes for a fun time at the movies.Bob Stone asks his old classmate,Calvin Joyner to help him with his computer skills.I don't really like Kevin Hart all that much,because he plays the same character in every film and even though he does have acting skills,he goes OTT in every performance.But his character is a bit more serious in this one and Dwayne Johnson is awesome as ever in his role.The main strength of this movie is the chemistry between the 2 leads.They are so much fun to watch.One is a fearless agent and the other a normal guy who can't even hold a gun.There are some nice jokes and gags as well.",/review/rw3487167/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2016,oscaralbert,8," Warner Bros. warns American Youth that it really does NOT get better . . .
",". . . after high school--it simply gets a lot worse! That is the main message of CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE: No matter how many school counselors make big paychecks prattling pleasant platitudes that Real Life's going to be all Rainbows and Unicorns post-High School, kids need to know that these Feel-Gooders are only in it for the money, Warner warns. Though the National Teen Suicide Hotline made Warner tack on some gratuitous Happy Ending Plot Points, the CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE offered here is that the Fat Lady has finished singing by the time she pops you out. On the brighter side, Kevin Hart leads a trio of sure 2017 Oscar Winners among the CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE key urban cast members. Only the lack of a lead minority actress will prevent the Citizens of Color in this flick from duplicating IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT by sweeping ALL of the acting statuettes. But now that most if not all of last year's despicable Oscar Voters have been replaced by Millennial Minority People, the only thing that can prevent #Oscarsoblack is a Trump Presidency!",/review/rw3487167/?ref_=tt_urv

Kevin Hart plays Calvin ""Golden Jet"" Joyner who peaked in high school, and now is an accountant who can't seem to win. Enter the Rock (Dwayne Johnson) as Bob Stone aka Robbie Weirdicht who acts like a man-child with hero worship for Calvin. They were never really friends, but Calvin was the only one who didn't laugh when Robbie Weirdicht was humiliated in front of the whole senior class, and actually helped him out.",/review/rw3487167/?ref_=tt_urv

",Central Intelligence stars Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart and is about them teaming up to save the world. I'd like to say that I had zero expectations going into this but was still looking forward to it. This movie is HILARIOUS! The Rock and Kevin Hart are fantastic together and have some of the funniest jokes I've heard all year.

4 July 2016,sie_francis82,4," Lacks Intelligence
","One of the most appealing things about Kevin Hart has to be his marketing team. That's not to say he isn't a great comedian; his stand up is currently second to none. Yet, for his new movie, Central Intelligence, he has taken to Facebook and Twitter with his co-star Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and presented some outright hilarious and completely irrelevant videos, such as; Hart and Johnson conducting a one-on-one interview while doing an impression of each other. It's ludicrous but their belly laughing is very contagious. It only seems a disappointment how they don't quite manage to portray the same on screen chemistry for the movie.",/review/rw3487167/?ref_=tt_urv
