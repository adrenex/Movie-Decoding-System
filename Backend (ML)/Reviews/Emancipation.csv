","""He knows us. He's one of us. He comes from the same place as Bond, a place you say doesn't exist, the shadows."" The world's greatest secret agent is back, but is the need for an agent outdated in today's modern world? After MI-6 is attacked and M (Dench) is brought under scrutiny by the government Bond (Craig) alone is left to find out who is behind the attack while M is trying to both help Bond and defend the need for an agency that has been compromised. I know that a review is really not needed here, being the 23rd Bond movie either you will watch it or not. I am a huge fan of the series and was really looking forward to this after hearing this is the best Bond movie yet. I have really loved the Craig movies but for some reason they never had the feel of a Bond movie to me, I wasn't sure what was missing but they didn't have the same feel. Knowing that they were re-booting the series I was lenient and with this one the re-boot is complete. This had much more of a feel of a classic Bond movie and by the end I was excited to see the next one. I got chills watching a few times and especially at the end. This had possibly the best opening and ending to a Bond movie ever. I could go on and on about this but I will just say if you love Bond you will love this, if you have never seen one then this one will make you a fan. Overall, From Russia With Love is my favorite Bond movie but this a very close second, and I think may be more re-watchable. I wanted to watch this one again as soon as the movie was over. I give this a very high A.",/review/rw2699111/?ref_=tt_urv

6 January 2013,tomgillespie2002,5," Competently directed but full of plot holes and strange narrative decisions
","After a botched MI6 operation in Istanbul, a lone mercenary, Patrice  (Ola Rapace), escapes with a computer file containing details about  undercover agents working within terrorist organisations. James Bond is  accidentally shot by his partner Eve (Naomie Harris) and believed to be  dead. Back in London, M (Judi Dench) finds her position threatened by  Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), who urges her to retire in the  aftermath of Istanbul. When the MI6 headquarters are bombed following a  threatening cyber-message to M, Bond returns, facing questions about  his mental state and his physical ability. But when Patrice is tracked  down, an assassination leads Bond to a casino in Macao, owned by cyber-  terrorist Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem), a former colleague of M's.  If I can say off the bat, I've always been in favour of this re-  invention of Bond. As the 'old' Bond films were progressing, they were  becoming gradually more ridiculous and fantasy-laden, leading to the  inexplicable invisible car in Pierce Brosnan's last film as Bond, Die  Another Day (2002). The films seemed to be losing sight of Ian  Fleming's source novels, and although they remained commercial hits,  Brosnan's outings (with the exception of GoldenEye (1995) were becoming  increasingly dire. Casino Royale set the tone early with a moody black-  and-white sequence that gave birth to Daniel Craig's colder, brutal  Bond, less concerned with how his Martini's were made than going to  extreme (and illegal) lengths to bring down his target(s). Royale's  reinvention showed a darker side to the beloved character, yet staying  with tradition, still kept him at an emotional distance.  Director Sam Mendes made the bold decision to reveal more about Bond's  past and childhood, risking fanboy wrath and damaging Bond's almost  mythical characterisations. The main crux of the film focuses on his  relationship with M, a stern authoritarian that risks career and her  own soul in putting national safety and the success of a mission above  the lives of her agents. Bond, being a willing soldier, follows M  blindly, and when Silva announces his intention to enact revenge on M  for a former betrayal, Bond takes M to his childhood home, Skyfall.  Bond facing his childhood allows time to develop on Bond's tormented  psyche, but it all seems quite out of place. One of the most intriguing  things about Bond is his almost suicidal willingness to risk all for  his job due to his almost complete lack of emotion, but Skyfall is  unable to make any grand revelations so it all comes to nothing more  than a distraction. (Saying that, the only previous Bond film to try  and engage Bond emotionally led to one of the most devastatingly cold  climaxes in the series' history in the underrated On Her Majesty's  Secret Service (1969)).  As well as the Bourne series, it seems that Christopher Nolan's Dark  Knight trilogy (2005-2012) is a major influence on this film in  particular. Mendes delves deeper into the workings and hierarchy of  MI6, rather than just a boss sat behind a desk, and adds a modern, more  'real' bad guy in Silva to the mix (even stealing the Joker's voluntary  arrest in The Dark Knight (2008)). Silva is a technical genius, able to  hack MI6's database with relative ease, and also proving himself more  resourceful and intelligent than Bond and M realise. Bardem is  wonderful in the role (as you would expect), but sadly his character is  not. Labelling him simply as a cyber virtuoso seems like a very lazy  way to allow Silva to repeatedly outwit MI6 and their own technical  marvel Q (Ben Whishaw) to the point where you wonder if Britain's  finest could really be so stupid. The film is therefore full of  plot-holes and distracting MacGuffin's that stretches out the running  time to more than it really needs to be.  Skyfall also asks a lot of the audience, especially when it comes to  suspending their belief. Before the frankly bizarre opening sequence  appears and we are treated to Adele's drab title song, we witness an  already wounded Bond get shot with a rifle and fall over 300 feet from  the Varda Viaduct into water, only to emerge alive and romancing a  mystery woman. No explanation is given as to how he manages to survive  the ordeal, and given the revelations about Bond's diminishing physical  prowess, it seems rather insulting. As questions are raised by his  superiors over Bond's ability to his job given his age (it must be the  grey in his stubble), Bond is put through various tests in which he  struggles with, yet half way through the film, this seems to be simply  put aside as he competently shoots and fights his way through various  bad guys. Again, no real explanation given.  Like I stated before, the most suitable word to describe this film  would be underwhelming, especially with the critical adoration that the  film was lavished with. The action scenes are dull, with nothing  matching the free-jumping opening of Royale. They are also quite  strange - was anyone expecting a henchman to be eaten by a CGI Komodo  dragon? How about death by underwater funky chicken? It all leads to a  very unsatisfying climax at Skyfall, where a simple shoot-out and foot  chase fail to justify a 2 hour-plus build-up. It feels like the entire  film is building up to an explosive climax that never comes. I found  the whole experiencing really quite baffling, with the attempts to mix  the old with the new Bond never really convincing or flowing. The film  is competently directed by Mendes however, and everything looks  suitably crisp and clean. What direction all of this means for Bond, I  don't know, but given the film is currently the 14th highest-grossing  film of all time, and the film somehow being lauded by critics and  audiences alike, it won't be too long until Craig dons the suit once  again.",/review/rw2699111/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2017,ironhorse_iv,8," The name is Bond. James Bond. & this movie is awesome, because of him! Skyfall is worth watching.
","This was a great new gift for the 50th anniversary of Eon Productions series. Directed by Sam Mendes, ""Skyfall' tells the story of exile secret agent, 007 AKA James Bond (Daniel Craig) having to come back to her majesty's secret service, when MI6 comes under attack by a mysterious and sadistic cyberterrorist villain Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem) who wants vengeance against Bond's supervisor, M (Judi Dench). Without spoiling the movie, too much, while, this spy film is not as gritty as the previous Daniel Craig's versions of James Bond movies, 2005's 'Casino Royale' & 2008's 'Quantum of Solace'. 'Skyfall' does have all the gadgets and tools that longtime fans have come to see, such as intense well-paced action pieces, sexy suggestive long making & great memorable supporting characters like Q (Ben Whishaw) and Eve (Naomi Harris) paying homage to the series' iconic status. However, if some of the criticism of the last two films, is how much similar, Daniel Craig's bond is to the Jason Bourne's series, both in lack of quip and exceptional martial-arts department. Then, this movie will get criticize for how familiar, beat points of the plot is to the comic book movie 2008's 'the Dark Knight', with a tiresome and beaten down hero, going after a superior, intelligent, villain with large explosion and double-trickery. Despite that, I have to say, the movie is thrilling from start to finished, even if they abandoned some well-worn formula plot threads like opening gun barrel. Still, I thought, the movie could had explain, some parts of the film, a lot better, like how in the hell, did James Bond able to survive the opening action sequence in Turkey!? His out of the blue unexplained presence, later in the film was a bit jarring. I get that it's supposed to represent the rebirth of Bond, but it felt like a cheap hook that something that an older Sean Connery film would do. Not a modern day movie, like this. Another thing, I didn't like about the film is the idea of him, having heavy petting time with a woman who just reveal that she was an ex-child sex slave in China. It was a bit disturbing and dirty. At least, he could had wait for a better time to do that, when it isn't awkward. However, that never happens, as the woman named Sévérine (Bérénice Marlohe) barely gets any screen time. Because of this, I found the love-interest in this film to be, one of the weakest parts of the film. I thought, they could had established, a lot more with her character rather than a disposable plot device/sex object. One other thing, I was deeply surprised that they abandoned, was the complexity of the subplot of the breaches list of security, in favor for a simpler plot of man wanting to kill his ex-boss. I found the detour to be, great. The unique 'Home Alone' booby traps ending was a barn-burning finale. I also like how, it finally debunked the James Bond code name theory. In the end, this movie was worthy as the last hurrah for Judi Dench as M, whom played the role, over 17 years old, since 1995's 'GoldenEye'. She was amazing. Javier Bardem as the antagonist was also great. He had the right amount of charm, and creep to pull this Oedipus complex role, off. Raoul Silva will indeed immediately rank, very high as one of Bond's greatest villains. As for James Bond, Daniel Craig pull off, another defining performance. I love that they show, that the agent does have some flaws and sense of vulnerability. Skyfall really provides him with the opportunity to showcase his ability as a great actor. He's brutal when he needs to be, and charming and suave when the situation arises. He also has the comedy chops, when the film, ask for it, like jumping out of an helicopter with Queen Elizabeth II, during the 2012's Summer Olympics opening ceremony, during marketing. It's a lot better than the straight-case brooding over serious, hero, we got in the previous movie. About the controversial homosexuality/bi tendencies of Bond. He's clearly doing that, just for show. Nothing to get work up, about. He's still, pretty straight-forward, at least, as the recent films goes on. Anyways, 'Skyfall' isn't a Bond movie, without a good, supporting cast. Like, I said before, the rest of the cast was OK, with Ralph Fiennes's Gareth Mallory and Naomi Harris's Eve, standing out. As for Albert Finney's short role as Kincad. He was alright in the ending, but how cool, would it, be, if the director's original choice, Sean Connery was given that part. Anyways, as far, as the movie looks, the cinematography was alright. It was gorgeous, but I seem, better from cinematographer, Roger Deakins. Some of the locations used in the film like Hashima Island, kinda does stand out. Still, I could do, without all that CGI added for the Scotland landscapes. As for the opening title sequence. It was very well done. Visually, it was nice to look at, but the opening theme music by British singer, Adele titled 'Skyfall', really took the cake. It was so beautifully sung. It was an excellent song, that it is worthy of the many awards that it took; including Best Original Song at the Oscar. Not be undone, but composer, Thomas Newman's soundtrack wasn't half bad, as well. Overall: 'Skyfall' is one of the best action movies I've ever seen. I thoroughly enjoy it. This 23rd film in the series is worth the title of 007. Author, Ian Fleming would be, so proud. Highly recommended.",/review/rw2699111/?ref_=tt_urv

","Skyfall is a special James Bond Movie. Suddenly there was a 964 Astin Martin and Bond said ""we're going back in time"" to M, thats very neat. The story line has a car chase near the beginning, Bonds obituary shown in the trailer so no spoiler intended. There is Bonds road to recovery and testing. Bond thinks he passed by the skin of his teeth. The Villain brags that bond failed all of the tests, range, psychological, medical other. The bottom line is that the head of British Intelligence saw Bond as fit for the field. The screenplay is very good.

11 September 2013,A_Different_Drummer,7," Not a Bond film, this is the Anti-Bond film
","It is one thing to deconstruct a film genre, a genre that has reached the level of dynasty, to make it better. It is an entirely different matter to do so merely because you can, to show off your own power, and to leave the genre in tatters. Sam Mendes is incapable of making a film that is not dazzling to the eye. He is a visual artist of the highest calibre and possibly one of the greatest directors living today. Similarly the lead actors are incapable of delivering a performance that is less than stellar given the scripts they are handed. But the praise ends there. This is not a Bond film. This is an anti-Bond film. Notice kind reader that every task Bond is handed in the script ends in failure. Don't shoot the messenger, just watch the film. Notice that at some point Mendes became momentarily self-aware of what he was doing by bringing, out of nowhere, using the magic of film, the Aston Martin DB7 from a half-century ago, fully fuelled and ready to go, with the old Bond theme for accompaniment. But he just couldn't go through with it. The moment (the self-aware moment) passed and he went back to Plan A, the Anti-Bond film, and, in one of the most gratuitous but Freudian moments ever seen, blew the car to bits. Just like he blew the Bond formula to bits. I know what you are thinking. You thinking that an artist has license to do all this if the end result is entertaining and satisfying. True. But this film is as satisfying to the viewer as a car wreck. Visuals aside, it is hollow and leave a strange taste in the palate. Shame.",/review/rw2699111/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2014,Hitchcoc,6," These Films Could Use Some Tightening Up!
","I began watching Bond films with ""Dr. No."" I have been thrilled, disappointed, exhilarated, bored, and challenged. The best Bond movies are the ones that have a cohesion, despite the action sequences. There were times when I wondered if the producers packaged these by the pound. How many ridiculous chase scenes can you cram into a space. That's OK sometimes because these films have a sense of humor and an in-your-face craziness that is a hallmark. However, it's the space that may be a problem. The later films are just too long. When a confrontation takes twenty minutes to resolve, you need a program to try to remember the big picture. This one suffers from the same affliction. While things do eventually resolve themselves, we are led all over the place where distraction is the result. I must say that I stayed pretty interest throughout, but at times I began to look at my watch, wanting to cut to the chase. I like Daniel Craig. He seems to be a more complex Bond than some of the others, but the screenplays need editing and the action sequences more under control.",/review/rw2699111/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2012,anders-rock,9," Wow!
","This is one of the best Bond movies I have ever seen. The story is superbly put together and has some interesting twists, the action is well done and contains none of the shaky cam which plagued the last film. The actors all do a great job. Some might still be put off by Daniel Craig's rough version of Bond, but I like it and he even has a few good old fashioned one-liners here. I wasn't sure about Javier Bardem as the villain at first. I thought he was a tad too flamboyant but eventually he grew on me, plus he had a very interesting backstory and as you might have guessed already, Judi Dench is fantastic as usual as M and she even has more to do in the story this time arround. This is not a completely formulaic Bond movie. Craig's bond is still more emotional than Connery or Moore ever were and for the first time we get some relatively detailed descriptions of his childhood. And something happens to Bond in the start of the movie that affects him for the rest of the film. But despite all that there are tons of James Bond trademarks like the martini, the introduction and even Q. Some might not like this new very young version of Q but I found him to be funny and very likable. They will never top Desmond Llewelyn's original performance, and instead of making a cheap Llewelyn clone, they make a completely different character which I think is the only right thing to do.
