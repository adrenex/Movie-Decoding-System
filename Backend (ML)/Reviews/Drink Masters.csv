30 November 2018,Silent_Rocco,3," Was hoping for much more
","CLIMAX or how long can you stand watching boring dancers and average at best actors pretend to be on drugs? Zero story, lots of screaming, no surprises. I'd even say this film is pretty tame (for Noé). And it's neither radical nor inventive anymore to simply turn the camera upside down or to show the end credits first. Apart from big respect for some well done one-shot moments, I'm quite disappointed.",/review/rw5661436/?ref_=tt_urv

","Love it or hate it, this film is technically astonishing and whatever it's trying to do, it's doing it very well. It's almost like they've trapped the true essence of French Extremism, set it on fire, and followed it with a steady cam.",/review/rw5661436/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2019,Fella_shibby,1," In an attempt to be different, arty or jus to shock audiences, film makers resort to cheap stuff like repugnant n erotic gossips.....
","70 mins of erotic n repugnant gossips, unnecessary dance movements, loud music n the last 20 mins of headache inducing flickering lights, upside down shots of bizarre stuff n weird camera angles makes it a boring n abysmal film.
Pls don't call this cinema or film.
It is jus another lame excuse to pretend to be different n arty.",/review/rw5661436/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2021,shannonlong636,3," I give it 3 stars for the dancing
","The only good thing about this movie was the dancing. Literally, everything else about it is annoying. It's actually really boring. It has no plot and no point. The dialogue is puerile, at best, and you can't possibly empathize with the characters. If this is your first introduction to Noe, you'll likely never feel the need to watch any of his other films.",/review/rw5661436/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2018,baba-jo,9," This is not a movie to watch, this is an experience to have
","Well, if you are going to watch a gaspar noe movie you should know what you are going to experience; search Gaspar Noe. But this movie will probably be the most popular Noe movie among popular culture or social media or whatever. So, this is a warning for those who haven't watched a noe flm before. This is not a familiar movie for you, do not expect to see a convenient work of art.",/review/rw5661436/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2021,SnoopyStyle,6," experimental French dance party
",A group of dancers has a party in an empty school. Things turn bad when their punch gets spiked. I love the energy of the dancers. There is great exuberance and they dance with abandon. It took about fifteen minutes before I realized that the movie isn't cutting. I assumed it for the rest of the movie and then it changed again. I wish they go for broke and do the movie in one take.,/review/rw5661436/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2019,kosmasp,8," Influenced by ...
","This is not an easy watch. And while Climax may suggest this to be very sexual or at least sensual, you might be dissapointed if you're looking for that kind of ""satisfaction"". The choreography of the dancing is really good, the cinematography is something to behold too. If you don't mind long uninterrupted shots that is of course.",/review/rw5661436/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2019,amgee-89551,2," Very bizarre!!
",Climax is one of the most weirdest film I have ever seen. The plot was terrible. The acting was all over the place. The cinematography was beautiful but that didn't make the film any good. I definitely wouldn't watch it again. One time watch most definitely. Very strange Film. 2/10,/review/rw5661436/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2019,christopher-underwood,6," I am not part of the intended audience
","I find that the brutal and garish style of Gasper Noe has little appeal and I have thus far only watched some excerpts and a couple of early shorts. Understanding that this might have a greater appeal, I gave it a watch. The confrontational beginning with unappealing youths was not a promising start and though the subsequent dance routines were impressive I couldn't help feeling that combined with the thunderous 90s dance music accompaniment this was my idea of hell. An hour later into this plotless extravaganza, those same 'dance' routines are replayed as death throes in an, admittedly very well filmed, modern version of Dante's Inferno. There is considerable directorial skill here but clearly I am not part of the intended audience. My only pleasurable moment, ironically, was when the police arrive to poke about the dead bodies and we have an instrumental version of the Rolling Stones, Angie. A moment of bliss amidst a mass of agonised death wish.",/review/rw5661436/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2020,redrobin62-321-207311,1," Stupid Dumb People Making the Same Stupid Dumb People Mistakes.
","Leave it to Gaspar Noe for always illuminating the darker, seedier, ugly side of human life. Pushing film boundaries like Marian Dora, Jorg Buttgerheit, Yorgos Lanthimos, Alejandro Jodorowsky, and others, he manages to sculpt movies Hollywood would never touch with a ten foot pole. ""Climax"", one of his tamer offerings, is still far from Hollywood, or Bollywood, fare, but it can get under some people's skins if they're unprepared for the weirdness. I'd give this film a higher rating but, in the end, it was really a flick full of pretentious pap that answers this question: What would happen if you give a roomful of stupid, non-thinking, non-intellectual young people a spiked drink that loosened all their inhibitions? Not recommended to anyone with half a brain.",/review/rw5661436/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2019,ccamp89,7," Weak 3.5 // Mostly succeeds as viscera
","As an exercise in pure viscera, Argentine provocateur Gaspar Noé mostly pleases with Climax. A group of dancers unknowingly drink spiked sangria which slowly warps their afterparty into an LSD-soaked nightmare. With a premise like that, it may be evident that this is a film meant to be experienced rather than thought about. The pleasures of Climax come nearly entirely from its sheer audiovisual power: the ceaselessly pulsating score, the fluid one-shot takes, the lurid colors. It's closer to performance art than what most people would characterize as a ""movie"" and should be approached with that mindset if you're to enjoy it. However, as enjoyable as its best sequences are, the lack of nearly any thematic depth imbues much of the film with a subtly nagging tediousness. And even when viewed purely from an experiential perspective, it is far from watertight in its pacing and flow. Still, there is a cumulative power in its sound, visuals, and theatrics that's hard to deny.",/review/rw5661436/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2019,etmachina,2," Drug-shaming conservative garbage.
",This movie is ridiculously stupid and pretentious. The good reviews are baffling.,/review/rw5661436/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2019,finn308,1," This is people on acid?

7 March 2019,torrascotia,1," More French Arty Garbage.
","This is an extraordinarily bad movie experience.
This is from same director who made Irreversible, the movie which prompted mass walk outs and for good reason. He seems to enjoy disgusting people with violence most would not class as entertainment. We yet again are subjected to extended discussions about anal sex which seems to be a theme in this directors work, to what purpose? It seems its all about intentionally trying to provoke disgust ""in the name of art"". In Climax we see pregnant women being kicked in the stomach, small children drugged and electrocuted and incest between siblings.
That is the tone of the movie and it beggars belief that this has any high ratings on here at all, or it says alot about the moral compass of those who enjoyed this trash. Its basically aimed at a pretentious audience who believe they have superior taste to others because they think ""enjoy"" things the majority rightly ignore or that because the movie is in French its somehow above critique. If this had come from Hollywood or if more people knew about its content it would have been slated.
The film itself doesn't amount to much. Its based around a group of dancers, we initially see them being interviewed then it moves to the dancefloor. An extended stylised dance sequence takes place before a party where most the dancers drink a sangria spiked with LSD. The remainder of the film is basically each dancer having a bad LSD trip and the final act is just plain nonsense with everyone writhing around on the floor while a red strobe flashes and camera is shot upside down. Oooh arty.
The odd thing is that none of the dancers seem to have any clue as to how LSD affects individuals, they all have the same reaction which is negative. This rings hollow. Anyone who has attended a rave or music festival where hundreds if not thousands of people may be on drugs do not all decide to try and kill each other. Its not a realistic premise. Nor is the premise that despite bad things happening they would all decide to hang around in the same room. Its difficult to make a movie about being trapped with others when the doors are all unlocked. Fail.
There really isn't anything about this which is positive, its odd that quite a few well know electronic musicians agreed to have their music attached to such a bad movie. That being said the musical choices of each artists don't exactly fit well with the scenes they are used in. Although the soundtrack is probably what attracts some of the audience.
Oh yeah the closing credits of the movie are at the start and some of them are written upside down or backwards. If you think thats ""edgy"" then you may like but if you just find it tedious trying to read upside down or backwards then head for the exit because it just gets worse,way worse after the credits roll.",/review/rw5661436/?ref_=tt_urv

","At last I have to review this film. Let me start by saying that it is the most engrossing film I have ever seen. I saw Noe's ""Enter the Void"" and I've seen plenty of disturbing films, but none quite as raw as this. I thought I could never watch this again, after the first viewing, but I love the opening dance scene so much (I've watched it at least a dozen times and it never gets old) that recently again I was compelled to watch to the end with my jaw on the floor. It was as insanely gripping as the first time.",/review/rw5661436/?ref_=tt_urv
