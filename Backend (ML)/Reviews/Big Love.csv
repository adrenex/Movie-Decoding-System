21 November 2022,AvionPrince16,8," The Castle of Murders
","Damn! Is this the same guys who were behind Man of Medan, House of Ashes, little Hope? Damn i really cant believe that is the same people. This game really have a terrific ambience, a great atmosphere. Im pretty shocked: i was not really convinced by the other games like really: i found the characters too much clich√©, the story not really engaging, the scares can be resumed by the cheapest jumpscares that i had saw in my entire life.",/review/rw8737018/?ref_=tt_urv

",The Devil In Me does a great job with creating atmosphere and jumpscares it's also looks photo realistic even though its on unreal engine 4 the characters were pretty good the story was interesting the performances were amazing the gameplay I loved and I hope they expand it with directive 8020 this is also the season one finale of the dark pictures anthology and this is so far the best game in the anthology this game also has one of the best set of the characters in the series and some of the most intense moments in supermassives work that had me on the edge of my seat they closed season 1 with a banger.,/review/rw8737018/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2022,wendystamps,10," A great end for season 1
",The Devil In Me is the season one finale of The Dark Pictures Anthology and is so far the best game in the anthology the characters are likeable and funny the Gameplay has improved a lot over the previous 3 games the story behind Grantham du met is very interesting the visuals are still absolutely stunning this game has some of the most intense scenes out of all of the supermassive games that I have played especially the scene with Charlie in the incinerator and the furnace some of the jumpscares were actually affecting and the actors did a really great job at the performances this truly was a very fun game.,/review/rw8737018/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2022,phullipsmaxwell,9," The best DP game in the series so far
",Even though the characters aren't as good as some of the other supermassive games casts it more than makes up for it with the improved gameplay great story and gruesome kills. I feel as if the next game could make or break the series with how outstanding this entry was. With house of ashes they had a more action this one focused on more horror elements and was definitely the scariest in so far in the dark pictures anthology. I hope that the next game will keep up this quality because this is nothing short of a great time. I would highly recommend if you have played the other games in the series. 9/10.,/review/rw8737018/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2022,jasmarks,10," Return to form
","If you loved Until Dawn and have been disappointed by the titles released since, you're not alone. Thankfully, Devil in Me is the strongest game in the Dark Pictures anthology series to date and lives up to Until Dawn's standards. I am only writing this review because I feel that this game deserves a much higher score. I saw Steam's ""Mixed"" reviews and was afraid this one would be another Man of Medan, but kept finding myself pleasantly surprised. I have played all of Supermassive Games' titles except for Rush of Blood and The Quarry and personally feel that this one is a comfortable second to Until Dawn. It's the return to form that we've been missing.",/review/rw8737018/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2022,violababe4,5," A promising foundation, but a lackluster delivery at best
","I have played many Supermassive Games from Until Dawn, to each of the Dark Pictures Anthology installments.",/review/rw8737018/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2022,StugLeven,9," The best one so far!
","Finally the best anthology story so far in the franchise. After too many monsters (Until Dawn, House of Ashes, The Quarry) and just some hallucinations (Man of Medan, Little Hope) finally a pure classic maniac killer horror story.",/review/rw8737018/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2022,cdbitesky,3," A glitchy mess
","I wanted to love this game so much. H. H. Holmes is such a fantastic serial killer to incorporate into a immesive game. Unfortunately, it's not 5 minutes before that immersion is broken by horribly written dialogue attempting to be ""old timey"". If it was just the dialogue in the intro piece, I could forgive it, but then we're introduced to a group of some of the most unlikable people to exist. That's fine in a horror movie since it lets you enjoy the killer more, but playing a game of ""pick the line that makes you cringe the least"" or having the group split up over and over giving you no agency is not enjoyable.a
Of course, maybe the main story could redeam it and have an amazing killer, right? Wrong. This game was constantly glitching out. From cutscenes just stopping, QuickTime events working for one person but not my co-op partner, clipping objects, camera randomly zooming in so far you can't see, characters just turning invisible (even during their death scenes). It's just too much.",/review/rw8737018/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2022,Nob0dy,2," More proof Supermassive Games can't tell stories
","Every game in the dark pictures anthology are crap, let's get that out of the way, that is not opinion, that is objective fact, buggy, horribly written games, with worse plot writing than an episode of the teletubbies, which are sold under the pretense of the player having agency in the story and your choices having consequences when they do not. That being said it is quite impressive how they have managed to make each subsequent game even worse than the previous.",/review/rw8737018/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2023,nikkiinwanderlust,3," Blech
","I was able to play every other game by these creators within a day, most within 5-6 hours. But this one took me about three weeks to shove through.",/review/rw8737018/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2022,sja-awesome,3," Ugh
","The graphics and the animations look like they are from 2007.. the sync kept going off and the mouths didn't match what they were saying at all lol. What?? The car turned the corner and it was all messed up and not smooth. Did they make this in a week? It's 2022 nearly 2023 and this is acceptable somehow lmao what. The story of hh holmes is pretty cool and different then the other ones which is cool and was a bit jump scary freaky, plus he was so messed up and creepy. But the dialogue from the characters most of the time was really cringe and annoying. It also froze several times when i was selecting quick time events. Yikes.",/review/rw8737018/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2022,savvie-81688,6," Rushed
","I couldn't wait for this having played the games before but I couldn't fully enjoy it. I felt the overall game was rushed so things were missed such as unrendered backgrounds, clothing popping in and out, the dodgy way the characters look and talk to each other, nobody talks to others with their heads down but still eyeballing you or they'd look everywhere but at the other person. I couldn't enjoy the exploring as much as I wanted with all the jumpscares and interruptions so I missed out on a lot. I wanted so much more story but I felt it was missing. I will say I enjoyed it as much as I could and I loved being able to scene select before completing the game.",/review/rw8737018/?ref_=tt_urv
