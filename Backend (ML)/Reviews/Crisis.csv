27 December 2022,gbarrett-39941,8," One Of The Best New Star Trek Shows
","I don't know what it is, but animation writers just seem better these days. The stories are better. The characters are more well developed and the stakes seem realistic. There is no heavy handed politics or overt agendas. They craft a world that is accessible for everyone. I wish the live action Star Trek shows would follow this blueprint. Also the episodic nature of the show is much better format and gives the Star Trek Original Series vibe. Even though the show is more geared towards younger audiences, unlike ST: Lower Decks, the story is very much engaging and the world building is nice. I am pleased that audiences seem to like it, as it is done very well.",/review/rw7489162/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2022,tom992,9," After a few episodes it's GOOD!
","I see some comparing it to star wars... They probably haven't seen a single episode. After episode 3 I was hooked, it's star trek all the way. It's more star trek then any other recent live action series. Having Janeway there and having so many other star trek cameo's makes it awesome to watch. It's also fast paced and some Great adventures. And yes it's made for kids but its enjoyable for adults too! Give it a go! Also why does it have as 6.7 rating while the episodes all have an average of 8/10???",/review/rw7489162/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2022,mindlessmoviemaster,10," These last 2 episodes have felt like Star Trek.
","From episode 6 where they meet old Star Trek Legends on the holodeck. Episode 7 was also very good bringing in the Ferengi which are my favorite Star Trek characters. RIP Aron Eisenberg. I was one of those veterans he helped out during his deep space nine run, and what Nog went through. Thank you.",/review/rw7489162/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2023,owen-watts,8," Strange New Murfs...
","I wasn't immediately convinced with Prodigy smashed onto our screens in late 2021 and feeling like a tonal mash between Clone Wars and Trollhunters. It was felt a bit bombastic and heavy-handed, but honestly it really began to grow on me and by the time of the wildly canonical ""Kobayashi Maru"" episode I was fully on board. With some beautiful backgrounds, dynamic set pieces, respectful references and a strong focus on character Prodigy ends up as one of the strongest entries in the recent Trek canon and easily my favourite set in the post-Voyager era. Hopefully it will do what it was built to do and give whole new generations of Trekkies a strong grounding on which to boldly go.",/review/rw7489162/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2022,sarakuralexx,10," An absolute delight.
","Fast, smart, genuine, innovative, creative, surprising and wholesome. THIS is the show I always dreamed of for Trek. I love Picard but this has been constantly improving since Episode 1. Lower Decks is too hokey and manic for me, and let's not get started on Discovery. SNW, Picard and Prodigy are the absolute best. Since I prefer stories set in the 24th/25th century, Picard and Prodigy are my go to Treks right now. And what a ride it has been. Congratulations to the writing team for not talking down to their audience. I can't wait to see what else is in store for the Protostar crew. We need a live action episode!",/review/rw7489162/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2021,RainerJohns,," An entertaining quality made show even if directed more towards a younger viewer
","Though it is difficult to judge with one episode out. But I love the essential ""exploring with a ship"" foundation and looking forward to what happens. The characters seem interesting and the animation very nice. The storyline so far seems pretty basic but we'll see.",/review/rw7489162/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2022,syncopatedrhythm,10," Finding it's Trek legs finally
","Laughing at all the early reviews that complain that it's not Trek. It seemed far off for the first few episodes to set it up, but then we get the Kobyashi Maru, Time distortions, Ferengis, now finally uniforms, and Trek like moral decisions. So Trek like now that maybe the other current series writers should take note. Holo Janeway is amazing, but Kate Mulgrew is an awesome actor. If you got turned off by the first few episodes you should give it a second chance. Hey we still get to look forward to Chokatay making an appearance in the second half of the season, after all it is his ship.",/review/rw7489162/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2022,PaxD75,8," Great stories, adventures, Sci-fi, exploration. This is Star Trek.

30 April 2022,elonmusk-is_a_moron,8," Different, but not bad
",I must confess I have very little familiarity with the Star Trek franchise.,/review/rw7489162/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2022,chris-j-chuba,9," The best Trek on Discovery plus
","I almost didn't watch it but I'm glad I did. The first episode had the obligatory chase scene as I rolled my eyes but the idea of escapees learning to work together on a mostly automated ship, worked out well. It is a novel approach.",/review/rw7489162/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2021,no_spirite,8," From a 70s trekkie...
","... it got me. Thought I would hate this and watched out of pure curiosity (I really wanted to hate this) and after watching the first episode, I now can't wait for the next. Love the plot, characters are good, even got me jigging about on the final ""death star"" sequence when the phasers kicked in. Good showing guys. Worth a go. Don't get the initial bad ratings. People just don't have enough joy in there hearts nowadays.",/review/rw7489162/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2021,neil_schaler,7," Kids will love it.
","I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the shows animation and story, especially with all the bad reviews that came out even before the show did.",/review/rw7489162/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2022,jonathanmarklund,7," The best star trek since the 90s

9 March 2022,hmb-51778,10," Starts slowly, but builds - Gene Roddenberry's son is a producer
",Nearly gave up on this after the first half of the second episode. The male lead's childishness nearly derailed my disire to go forward.,/review/rw7489162/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2022,jamesjustice-92,8," 20 episodes of good but not old Star Trek
","After the disappointments of Discovery, Picard and Lower Decks I didn't expect much from this new Star Trek TV show that was even targeting the younger audiences but in the end my fears were in vain.",/review/rw7489162/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2021,Killerb44,8," Not sure it deserves the bad reviews
","While I get that it doesn't have a true Star Trek storyline, I like the fresh take. I have a feeling the crew will continue to grow and who knows who or what they will encounter from the Star Trek universe. The animation and voice acting are top notch and it has an element of action that I feel sometimes Star Trek lacks. I am on board to see where this takes us.",/review/rw7489162/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2022,jamesgsgsg,10," I can't believe it absolutely amazing
","I'm in shock I am a die hard star trek fan and this series is something else. Brilliant, amazing to see captain Janeway again! And Jokete. The characters are brilliant, the story line is thrilling and the graphics are absolutely ridiculous. 10 out 10. Has all the mystery of any star Trek Series and more! Lower decks was really good but this is on a different level. I'm so impressed. Highly recommend this for all ages over 12.",/review/rw7489162/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2022,anabel-neri,10," 9yo boy & mom both love it
","Hey y'all. My 9yo son and I have watched Prodigy since it came out, and we've both enjoyed it immensely. There are times when the references go over his head but I catch them, and there are times that he spots them (to my surprise).",/review/rw7489162/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2022,aniketdhar,9," Best Show of the '20s Decade Right Now in the Post-COVID Era, Next ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" is this!!
","After watching every Animated series up until now, Star Trek: Prodigy is, undoubtedly, (I know it's too early to say but Still) THE BEST SHOW OF THE '20s DECADE RIGHT NOW!!! I'm Not even LYING!! It should be the next deserving ATLA in my opinion!! After the first Episode (Or Joint 2-in-1 Episode Rather), some of the viewers are complaining that, it is or will be a Rip-off of ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"". I doubt they haven't seen near after the first episode. For them, who are saying like this, you're missing the best show or Star Trek show. It is Awesome. You don't have to go every single nooks and details to criticize like that!! It is Stupid for you if you are thinking like that!! DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY IT'S COVER!! After Episode 3, it got an elevation to the story to hook on. It has Great Character and Story Development that most of the Popular Kids' Shows Right now lack a lot. It's also have some great Adventures to make your Kids and Adults deeply interested in the show. I Highly Recommend this show to watch out for. Don't let Nickelodeon Brand Dissuade You to watch this show. It should deserve to get more popularity than MLB or PAW Patrol!! Again, I'm saying this unbiased and truthfully. So give this show a chance!! Also waiting for Second Part of Season 1.",/review/rw7489162/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2022,daviderichow,8," Great Show - A Gatekeepers Nightmare
","Excellent exciting fun. This is a show disguised as a children show, don't underestimate it. It has all the scale and adventure of a motion picture paced over 10 episodes.",/review/rw7489162/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2022,dklecan,9," It took a couple episodes
","Took a couple of episodes to understand what was going on, in fact, watch 1st episode and didn't continue until a few months later. After first couple of episodes, it becomes a regular Star Trek episodes with encounters in new worlds and new civilizations, but with goofy teens. I found it charming, fun, and much better than some of the life action Star Treks available.",/review/rw7489162/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2021,thecrafts-66710,9," Finally something that wouldn't shock Gene Roddenberry
","Yes- this is a show on a kids channel and geared towards them. And it's animated. But I still think it will be the best new Star Trek series since Enterprise ended. Why? Because it has something that all the technology in Discovery and Picard don't possess: A MORAL COMPASS. This show is more true to Gene's ideals and sense of decency. In all honesty, I've only seen the 1st episode but I'm believing that because it is for a younger audience, they aren't going to take a plunge into the black hole of depravity that pulled in the other, aforementioned series. Here's hoping. Live long and prosper, Prodigy.",/review/rw7489162/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2021,Rastifan,5," To boldly go where and so forth
","The show is a little tame for older Trekkies like myself. It is ""very"" family friendly. But the younger audience which this is aimed at might find it worth while. Let's hope future episodes justify it's existence.",/review/rw7489162/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2022,ritokessah,8," Like a lot
","Reminded me Voyager and Enterprise, so for me Prodigy is so much startrek as it possible: space trip, teamwork, exploring and light of bright future where wiseness and kindness wins over violence and intolerance.",/review/rw7489162/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2021,asterblasterth,8," It looks great but...
",The animation is great. The story is entertaining. The only thing is the vibe. It has more of a Star Wars vibe than Star Trek. That's the only thing I have against it but it's not a big deal.,/review/rw7489162/?ref_=tt_urv
