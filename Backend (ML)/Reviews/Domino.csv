13 August 2012,bkoganbing,7," Captain Raydor takes over
","I've got to admit I will miss Kyra Sedgwick, but for the past couple of years Mary McDonnell has been honing and refining her character of Captain Sharon Raydor so that we are familiar with her. As Sedgwick left the LAPD, McDonnell was poised to take over.",/review/rw2659133/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2017,jdonalds-5,6," Please Please dump the Rusty character
","My wife and I were big fans of The Closer so when it went off the air we gave Major Crimes a chance. I'm still not a huge fan of Mary MCDonnell but she's alright. The rest of the old cast that made it through to Major Crimes is just great, and the few additions are fine as well. But we just can't stand the Rusty character.",/review/rw2659133/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2018,Ed-Shullivan,10," This is one of the very best TV series and cast ever assembled! Great in-depth and intriguing story lines.
",It is not very often where you have one crime TV series cancelled only to be replaced with many of the original cast members but excluding the major star (Kyra Sedgwick) of the original crime series and to have such an enduring presence for years to come.,/review/rw2659133/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2018,nramsay-17368,3," Rusty must go!!!!!!!
","This Rusty character totally ruins the show. First of all, he contributes NOTHING to the show, plus he sticks his nose in every investigation, running off and doing things that he wants to do. He has free roam because he's the captain's son, uses the police department's computers to do an illegal background search, runs and talks to the judge, and on and on. He's a SPOILED BRAT that has no business on this show. Get rid of him!!!!!!",/review/rw2659133/?ref_=tt_urv

29 September 2016,favman,7," Good, but one vital change must be made
","It's a great show, and though I regretted Ms Sedgwick's departure, Mary McDonnell does just as well - a thoughtful and individual portrayal that keeps you watching her. She gives a master class in how to play drama quietly and still grip. I like all the other characters, too, especially F. W. Bailey and Michael Paul Chan, who grow as the series progresses. Also - and this is essential - the stories and their solutions are of the highest quality. It is that rare combination of police procedural and humour, which gives the distinct impression that there people are real human beings, who not only work together but like one another. So I am a devoted fan - with just one problem. I would give it 8 or 9 if one vital change were made. That is:",/review/rw2659133/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2015,e_j_powers,7," Rusty needs to go!
","The Closer was one of the best shows ever on TV. For the first few seasons, every episode was riveting and most episodes had an unexpected twist or surprise ending. The final episodes of the series gradually and flawlessly morphed Captain Raydor, who had always been a thorn in Brenda Leigh's side, into a hero and set her up to be the lead of the Major Crimes squad. The best of the cast from The Closer was carried over as well, and it looked as if the spin off might turn out to be nearly as good, if not quite as good, as the original show. Unfortunately, while Major Crimes is pretty good, even very good at times, it falls short of its early promise, mostly because of the storyline involving Rusty, Capt. Raydor's teenage ward. Rusty comes across as unpleasant, rude, annoying, and petulant, and the writers have given him way too much screen time. In addition, his constant presence at the police station is not credible, as detectives do not have time to coddle a whiny teenager as the Major Crimes squad does, going so far as to help Rusty with his schoolwork and offer him advice at every turn. Without Rusty the series would undoubtedly be far better. But as another reviewer mentioned, he is designed to attract young viewers, and so we're probably stuck with him for the run of the series. Too bad.",/review/rw2659133/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2017,barrytookas,1," How the great have fallen
",My wife and I have watched every episode of the Closer at least 6 times now in succession and still love the way the writers and actors deliver an engaging story while having some genuine comic relief in serious and believable plot lines. Major Crimes on the other hand have stooped to the level of completely unbelievable story lines and scenarios due to what would seem just pure laziness from the writing team. The last episode I watched was pretty much the last straw for me.,/review/rw2659133/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2017,nwdean-862-186903,," Good except for two
","The ensemble is terrific except for Rusty and Sharon. Sharon was such a horrible replacement for Brenda, but keeping wimpy Rusty around for seasons beyond when that soap-opera story line should have ended makes her unbearable. Let them both go! All the rest of the ensemble are great. Let Rayder marry Flynn and move away and let Rusty marry his boyfriend and go with them. Provenza can handle it!!! Leave us with him, Tao, and the rest, and it will be a much much better show.",/review/rw2659133/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2018,dlh-48964,9," Awful seasons 5-6
","Last two seasons, season 5 & 6 were horrible, I loved the show because they used to have different story/ different crimes every episode. But the last two seasons one crime case would take up 4 episode & be too long, & boring. Also the new character ""camilla"" was so annoying, & unbelievable that she would work at major crimes.. her character is in charge of missing teenagers, & she became a major character in major crimes, this didn't seem to make any sense, & she had the most air time & lines once she became a main character. The show became incredibly annoying, w/ her new character & the writers making one boring crime case last 3-4 episodes, instead of a new case every episode, I think this truly ruined the show..",/review/rw2659133/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2018,SnoopyStyle,7," solid police procedural
","After the departure of Brenda Leigh Johnson, Sharon Raydor (Mary McDonnell) takes over the Major Crimes unit in the LAPD. It's the TNT spin-off of the TV show, The Closer. She takes an interest in street kid Rusty Beck who witnessed a crime committed by serial killer Phillip Stroh. The group from The Closer is maintained. It's essentially the same show with a different lead. The addition of Rusty brings a different tone to the chemistry. Often, the serial killer overlay is disruptive to these types of police procedurals. The difference is that Billy Burke is a really compelling actor and he's not the common masked unknown killer. Mary McDonnell is solid as a replacement. It's simply a very functional police drama. The last season is more binge-worthy as it consists of three multi-episode stories. Provenza continues to be the fun comedic side although Flynn's domestication has tamed his character. I wonder if there will be a third incarnation of the franchise. That would be nice.",/review/rw2659133/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2018,sposeido6,," Series Finale
","I thought I'd be sad to see the series end much like with The Closer. But, if I had to endure one more scene with that character, Rusty Beck, I'd seriously consider picking up the mantle from Philip Stroh.",/review/rw2659133/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2012,Paularoc,9," This show is a winner!
","This spin-off is getting off to a great start. Most of Brenda's crew remains in Major Crimes and as to be expected doesn't warm up to Captain ""by the book"" Raydor, to say the least. I like the Raydor character and McDonnell's deadpan delivery style which often results in pithy and/or humorous observations. Like when she says to Provenza, in the second episode, something like ""Why don't you stay with the department until you find a job where everything is always fair."" This was not said sarcastically but ruefully for she has just been cheated out of a promotion - so no, life in the workplace is not always fair. McDonnell's character is so different from Sedgwick's - and this is good because they're both interesting. It's great that so many of the cast from The Closer moved over to the new show (Corey Reynolds' character didn't but Gabriel was my least favorite character so that's okay with me; besides given the attitude of a couple of the team members towards him, it would have made no sense to keep Gabriel in the Major Crimes department). I'm not too taken with the material witness kid yet but maybe he'll get a little less annoying. I liked the first episode of Major Crimes as much as I liked the first episode of The Closer. Here's hoping it will last as long.",/review/rw2659133/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2018,samara-gale,1," Should be titled The Rusty Show
",Why is the spin off built around this little punk? The Closer was built around Brenda and it was always entertaining. Kyra Sedgwick is a great actress. Mary McDonnell speaks like she is singing a song in slow motion and has absolutely no facial expression. Is this what botox does to your face or is she just a rotten actress? I keep waiting for her fake hair to fall off. ps Hairdressers for this show please note: Extensions are not meant for 65 year old women. The Closer was great; I loved it. The spin off stinks.,/review/rw2659133/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2017,dboufant,3," Used to be good
","I like the show and many of the characters, but this Rusty thread has Taken over much of the program now and not just a good show. Go back to solving crimes instead of the mushy drama. Not entertaining at all. This show had some funny, light heart ed quips, but now this Rusty, who never smiles and life is just too much of a depressing drama has taken over.",/review/rw2659133/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2022,disisdkat,5," I could love this show
",But I don't and it comes down to one thing. Rusty. I never understood why Star Trek fans passionately hated Wesley Crusher and felt he ruined every episode he was in. I thought he was a minor distraction. I now understand the feeling. Rusty sours the milk. Actually I think the writers of this show hated kids. Every show where they have a 'kid' the kid is absolutely detestable. It is hearing chalk being screeched across a black board.,/review/rw2659133/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2019,gary-64659,6," Ultra-Lame compared to The Closer
","""The Closer"" had the insuperable advantage of being centred on an unforgettable character played brilliantly. But Major Crimes falls down not only in this but in so many departments -- slow pacing, exceptionally weak jokes with bad comic timing, unimaginative camera set-ups, generally poor writing and directing. Until now I have only caught snippets of the show and it could never hold my attention longer than 10 minutes at the outside. This evening I stumbled on a Christmas episode about a Santa killed in a bank robbery, and I gave it around 20 minutes in hopes. I don't know if the commander's family of teenagers are a regular feature but they made the whole thing far worse, as just a diversion from the crime story, and a specially uninteresting one at that. ""Criminal Minds"" used to strike me as ludicrous when they often had a group scene and everyone has to have a line to say -- like ""Scooby Doo"" but without the supposed cuteness. This episode of ""Major Crimes"" was worse because there were scenes with up to 10 people, all having their turn to say something (which usually amounted to nothing).",/review/rw2659133/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2012,gradyharp,10," A season of only 10 episodes proves a rousing follow-up for The Closer
",Continuing a popular television series such as The Closer with a powerful headliner like Kyra Sedgwick is a tricky risk. But in the case of MAJOR CRIMES that risk was most assuredly worth taking. Even in the final episodes of The Closer the new leader of the police group was introduced and the adjustment by the staff was shared with the viewers - a smart factor in adjusting to a new start.,/review/rw2659133/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2018,TommyRob,10," If I ever see this Rusty character again, I will slit my wrists.
","I have read elsewhere that the real LAPD served as consultants on the show. If that is the case, how on earth did this whiny Rusty character make it to the screen? What department on the planet would allow some kid free access to squad rooms, computers, interviews, etc. I don't care that he was the Commander's adopted kid or that he had a miserable biological mother -- if anything, Raydor should have been extra cautious about him being around because it could have also meant the end of her career.",/review/rw2659133/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2012,donaldedwardbatt,10," Character development and plot movement
",Major Crimes has taken the already rich and developed characters of The Closer and endowed them with more back story and more emotional depth. I particularly like that every character is now up front and am thoroughly enjoying the interplay among the characters. The new teen character is helping to expose a tender side of Lt. Raydor. Kudos to all the actors for developing such dynamic and sympathetic portraits.,/review/rw2659133/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2012,alameli,9," Good start
","I was thinking whether to watch or not MAJOR CRIMES, and yes, I am gonna watch! Traditionally, quite a lot of humor. And, as in first episodes of THE CLOSER - conflict between the department and the new boss. This time conflict is deeper, I believe, and the scene between Provenza and Raydor was very intense. I was always fond of cap. Raydor both because she is played by Mary McDonnell and because she is such a pain in the ass. She is so cold-blooded and determined sometimes, and than next moment you can see her confusion and doubts - as with Rusty storyline here, which I liked very much, and I'm looking forward to see, what happens next with the boy.
