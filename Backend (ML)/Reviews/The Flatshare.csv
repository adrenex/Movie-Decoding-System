14 December 2022,polyxenivlachou,8," Natural characters and interesting story!
","I really liked the acting and the story, the music not so much. Jessica and Anthony were quite natural and very good together. I couldnt stop watching cause I wanted to see when Leon would have got rid of his terrible girlfriend and Tiffany her abnoxious boyfriend. I really liked the Brighton scenery, reminded me of old times. Since I havent read the book I can be no expert but It was more like a romantic dramedy than a comedy, I think. With a different soundrack it would have been great! Ok, maybe 6 episodes were too many but then again 4 episodes wouldnt be enough! Dont miss it! You should definitely give it a go!",/review/rw8851322/?ref_=tt_urv

21 December 2022,louiseviolet,9," Surprisingly good
","Usually book to tv series conversions are pretty poorly done but I thoroughly enjoyed this one! I read the book about 6 months ago so it's been a while but the series seemed to incorporate all of the best elements that I did remember and kept the characters feeling 'real'. The relationships in the series were good, although I feel like it could have been a little longer (developed the brother storyline a bit more) as some parts were way more important in the book, but what they did choose to keep was really well done. All in all I would certainly recommend and will probably watch again in the future!",/review/rw8851322/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2022,AfricanBro,5," Could still recommend it.
","Interesting premise, want to call it avant-garde, it's not the amazing but it's definitely original which is why I thought it'd be interesting enough for a watch. Thought it'd be more of a comedy as well. I had a senior roommate in my freshman year and with our different schedules we literally almost never met so that's what caught my attention for this. It's nothing mind blowing, but it's no where near as bad as it could be or I expected it to be. If you're looking for a groundbreaking new show this might not be it, but it makes for a pretty decent pass time.",/review/rw8851322/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2022,bjarias,6," ... it surely did not require six-episodes
","... premise is rom-com-fluff... being little more than your lighthearted-routine-romantic-comedy... you-know, one without any-real-comedy as such... the two leads are the sole reason why the production has charm, most especially her... when she's not onscreen, all anyone can do who's watching is to wait for her return... it was six-episodes that really could-should have-been a-ninety-minute-movie",/review/rw8851322/?ref_=tt_urv

",Since I've read a book just a month ago I was very excited to watch its tv adaptation.,/review/rw8851322/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2023,indrajitadvani,7," Entertaining, fluffy but likeable
","A very predictable storyline in terms of trajectory and ending but my wife and I both enjoyed it (especially my wife) and made for good viewing on a very rainy gloomy day (which we've had an awful lot of for so many weeks now)
The lead characters were very likeable: the hero throughout and the heroine more and more as the series progressed. Some of the villains were very good too, especially Leon's girlfriend, who put in a deft performance. On the other hand, the heroine's ex-boyfriend was a bit hammy at times and close to over-acting although I get that they wanted to portray him as psychotic. His 'entrance' at the awards ceremony was hilarious.",/review/rw8851322/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2023,MovieBuff02,7," Quite a sweet story!
",I liked the acting. Jessica Brown Findlay plays a cute albeit a hassled woman looking for a budget apartment. Anthony Welsh is also in financial doldrums and leases out his flat at nights when he's at work.,/review/rw8851322/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2023,Matthew-WH,5," Wanted to like it.
","The two main characters are cast perfectly and also Richie's brother however the deviation away from the plot of the book ruined it for me. The book has a flow with the side characters, Tiff's friends & the patients at the hospital which made you more invested in them and gave them more of a purpose. The timeline in the books is so much better and i don't think the edits made enhanced it at all but rather was its downfall. Agree with the comments made about a shorter episode run as ep 1 and 2 was strong but from there, it all fell a bit flat and i couldn't make it to episode 5 which is unfortunate. Big promise but under delivered for me.",/review/rw8851322/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2022,RonnieCrown,7," Pleasantly Surprised
","I haven't read the book, as many others have so I didn't have anything to compare it to. I also didn't go into it having any expectations. I watched out of sheer boredom. I was pleasantly surprised, and ended up binge-watching it in one sitting.",/review/rw8851322/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2022,jessicagirdler,6," Fell a bit flat
","Was a good start, good chemistry, fun story but it just kept going and dragged our way too long and with nothing new happening and the friends, girlfriend and ex boyfriend's roles were done to death and repetitive. The brother was the most entertaining side character and could have been utilised more. Plus a whole side episode dedicated to the war romance seemed pointless and dragged out: Could have been half the episodes and had the same point but missed the boring nothing Jess of episode 3-5 and most of 6. Plus the awkward kiss at the end was awful, how did that make it in it was truly one of the worst I have ever seen.",/review/rw8851322/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2023,isahinrichs,1," shockingly simple
","One of the worst and most predicable shows with ridiculous characters (Justin). I can't believe this was even produced. While the premise seems interesting, the show completely de-evolves after episode one. The trailer consists of literally the 2 minutes of the show that it is actually interesting and has something to say. If this was what our cultural productions have come to, it is a sad statement of human thought and engagement. There is absolutely no critical thought contained in this show and even the visuals (which have elevated other works to at least aesthetically pleasing cinematic journeys) are mediocre at best.",/review/rw8851322/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2023,csclaire-46683,10," Absolutely brilliant
","Absolutely loved this series, not too cheesy , you know what's going to happen from the start but , it's such a programme with really sad moments in it , happy moments, funny moments and 100% brilliant watch.",/review/rw8851322/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2023,misterberland,8," The light and colorful one
",I stumbled across this series by accident and never regretted watching it for a second.,/review/rw8851322/?ref_=tt_urv
