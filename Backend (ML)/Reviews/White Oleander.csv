20 July 2008,ru486,9," Perps are people too.
","Wow, a cop show without perps. A TV drama with guns and not 'necessary' evil. Moral, caring cops with emotional consequences. Explosions, when all else fails.",/review/rw3396720/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2008,GorobeiOgataSan,9," Great show, hopefully more of the same!
","Excellent show, with movie quality cinematography that shows the behind the scenes of the snipers. It takes from some of those SWAT reality TV shows and throws in the personal issues and struggles that no one gets to see. Only one episode has been aired so far, so I don't have a lot to base this on, but I give it a 9 as this is something fresh although how long it can keep it up remains to be seen. My other complaint is the late airing time, but a very high quality show none the less (as their huge budget indicates).",/review/rw3396720/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2009,mr-bond-1,10," Brilliant series!
","I just love it. It is so different from the typical gung-ho super-commando, CSIs, Lost or Prison Breaks lasting forever. These guys have emotions, feelings. We see what led to the situation and that very often there isn't a simple solution to the situation. The negotiations are the very strong point and the will to solve it without guns. It shows what it is to shoot somebody - even for a highly trained and tough elite unit member. It takes its toll on every one. There is no going home in glory after a shooting - there is the procedure, debriefing and very strong emotions that not all are able to cope with. It is a unique series and I hope it stays for another couple of seasons. I'd miss it if it was gone.",/review/rw3396720/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2008,Seradan,10," A refreshing change from the cop shows out there
","The basic premise is that they show the 'flashpoint' of a situation, a brief glimpse at a volatile situation. This teaser provides a context for the story telling that comes afterward as a depiction of the various events that led to the situation, and then goes to resolve the issue.",/review/rw3396720/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2010,adelaidetaylor,10," Glad to see Flashpoint is back on. . .missed it
","A breath of fresh air. I love action/police dramas, but most are so predictable you can guess what the characters are about to do or say. Flashpoint is an exception. I find it more original, very suspenseful, and occasionally quite moving. The consistently impressive teamwork and professional attitude of the characters may be a bit unrealistic, but it makes for tight drama and people you can really feel connected to. The ensemble acting is seamless and effective. I am also a fan of Canadian shows such as Da Vinci's Inquest and Cold Squad. It seems our neighbors to the north are quite adept at creating excellent dramas with well-developed, appealing characters, and original plot lines.",/review/rw3396720/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2009,melskee,10," Great Show
","This show is in it's first season in Australia (glad to see we have a 2nd to look forward to!) Only a half dozen episodes in, but so far I'm really enjoying it. Love the way it gives you the 'teaser' at the start, then you get the full story leading into the situation. Although it would help if the network airing it here could show the episodes in order for a little continuity... Yeah, yeah, we all know it's not totally realistic - that's why it's called 'entertainment'. I work in police communications here in Melbourne Aus., and I can assure you we NEVER have anything this exciting happen, but that's probably not a bad thing. I find the at the end of each episode I'm wondering where the hour went!?!",/review/rw3396720/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2008,letterblush,," A sleek drama with a few wrinkles to start

6 October 2008,Terryfan,9," Flashpoint about to light it up
","I first hear of Flashpoint by watching a ad for it on CBS and seeing one of my favorites Amy Jo Johnson was enough for me but in serious The TV show has it pros and cons. But still as a fan of cops shows like this, I will be as fair as I can be Pros We get introduce to the SWAT members each with their profiles and hidden past and we see them as everyday people with a dangerous job and will do what it takes to do the job and protect the innocents CONS Well I save the cons for last because sometime the show has a habit of getting too intense and too hard for fans to watch so and some of the writing is kind of weak but not all the time Overall I can't wait for more Flashpoint and I may buy the first season on DVD If you get the chance to watch Flashpoint give it a chance and you're in for a wild ride",/review/rw3396720/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2010,gkpedersen,10," Intense Canadian Police Drama.

17 August 2016,tedphx,10," There's never been a better cop show.
","Flashpoint is a drama, not a mindless action series, and being set in Toronto, American viewers may be surprised that average people are refined there... and intelligent... and you can reason with them. So the SRU team has a motto: ""Connect, Respect, Protect,"" and it applies to the bad guys as well, so the team does things a lot of Americans might not be able to fathom, such as treating even very bad people as if they were human, and not firing unless there is absolutely no other choice. This is not to disparage American cops who have to deal with many more depraved criminals who have no respect for life.",/review/rw3396720/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2009,adrian.chell,8," Some refreshing changes but it's still a cop show
","Flashpoint is one of the few cop shows I've seen where every action has consequences, and the protagonists have to live with those consequences, not just forget them in time for next week's episode. While each week gives us a different superficial scenario, they all contribute something to the ongoing sub-plots. Hugh Dillon is excellent as the enormously experienced but tightly-wound Ed Lane and he is admirably supported by Enrico Colantoni as the team's leader Sgt. Greg Parker. To be fair, some of the minor characters have suffered from a lack of air time, and so development so far, so we get left with the stereotypes. There is the token woman (Jules), the new hot shot (Sam), the techie (Spike) and the all-round utility player (Wordy). Over time, and notwithstanding Amy Jo Johnson's pregnancy, I hope these characters will become as fleshed out as those of the leads. I'm certainly ready to give the show its chance.",/review/rw3396720/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2009,LPurch6636,9," GREAT Show!
","I love this show! It's probably my favorite show on TV right now. The acting is great, especially the characterizations by Enrico C. as the boss and Hugh Dillon as the master sniper. The two characters they play are strong and complicated, with Enrico playing the more sympathetic role.",/review/rw3396720/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2019,kosmasp,8," Technically flawless
",Now I've never been to a SWAT training nor have I any background knowledge about proceedings. Well other than having watched quite a few shows and/or movies about it. This being one of them. And it could not be farther away from something like The Shield. Even though some may argue that the main guy (also head of the group) in both shows has some physical resemblance.,/review/rw3396720/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2013,willsons-2,10," Five seasons of Great TV
","I have just finished watching the series finale and then had the misfortune to read some disgusting reviews of this fine show. The finale was the best finale of any TV show that I have ever watched. Most shows do not know how to end, let alone well, but Flashpoint had no such problems. Most finales make me cringe and when I re-watch the show on DVD or BD I never bother with the finale, but I will definitely make an exception with Flashpoint.",/review/rw3396720/?ref_=tt_urv

13 April 2009,sabrinaleccese,10," good show
","I would have to say since the very first episode I have been hooked, I also got a glimpse of it on a talk show, who showed the audience a clip, then they talked about it. they talked about how the actors dealt with real cops to get an idea of the realism to the episodes they were about to act. The show is a DRAMA not and ACTION so that is why you wont see explosions and gun fights and not all situations come to that they are trying to give the view all the sides that cops would have to deal with on a regular basis. and to see it from my home town is even more exciting cause i have a lot of friends from high school who are metro cops. not tactical as far as i know but still to see what they have to deal with it makes you realize how dangerous their job is. I think anyone who likes a realistic drama that shows the highs and lows of tactical teams day drama with a little action this is the show for you. I watch all the C.S.I's and 24 and dexter, i pretty much enjoy a show that has a good story line unless it becomes unbelievably repetitive like 24. like how many times do we need to see Jack Bauer get captured and fall in love with anew woman and loose the respect of his team for the sake of saving the world! I am sure everyone can agree that not every time a cop gets a call its all about explosions and blood and guts come one now that isn't real life! not in Canada at least maybe in LA l.o.l where all lousy shows take place! the unit sucked i haven't heard one good thing about it he was better as the president on 24 than on that show! flash point all the way.",/review/rw3396720/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2021,danikagver,10," so underrated
","I really wish more people knew about this show: it is so incredibly brilliant, even the acting is top of the line, and not just for canadian tv. this show has heart and portrays a much more accurate version of the trauma cops go through rather then just ""boom boom bang bang""! each character has a purpose, and their connection built through the moments of vulnerability are evident.",/review/rw3396720/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2011,audrulyte,10," An awesome action packed TV show
","Flashpoint is an engaging show, which is so much more than your usual cop show. I have just recently discovered this little gem and already watched every single episode of all 3 seasons, which were aired so far, and am looking forward for more episodes to come. Originally upon discovering the show, I thought Flashpoint was going to be just another generic cop show only focused on special unit's operations (think SWAT), but soon I was proved to be oh-so wrong. And good thing I was wrong, or I might have missed this great Canadian show. Flashpoint is a highly engaging TV show, which provides a fresh insight into every day operations of Toronto police SRU's (Strategic Response Unit) Team One's operations, such as hostage situations negotiation, bombs, etc. The show is based on and keeps close to the real Toronto police Emergency Task Force (ETF) operations and thus feels rather real - not your usual heroic cop + real bad villain premises here, thank gods. No just black and white colored stories, but rather that of many colors and layers where cops have to deal with the aftermath of their own actions, and some villains are not so villainous at all, and where thinking comes before opening fire. Centring on the hows and whys of one or another situation SRU's Team One is being called to deal with, the series also looks deep into very souls of Team One's members and how they deal with all the stress of their work. Looking for an awesome cop themed action show with a brain to it and really well written stories? Look no more and tune in for Flashpoint.",/review/rw3396720/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is an amazing show! From the production point of view, it's very well done, made with a lot of effort and attention to details.

","I'm currently rewatching the entire series for probably the 10th time, it's literally in the top 3 best ""cop shows"" ever. In my opinion! Chicago PD and 911 are up there too, these 3 are the only TV shows that have me in tears by the end of some episodes and as a guy that just doesn't happen. Incredible action but it's all about the people. Human behavior and why people do what they do. Truly an incredible series!!",/review/rw3396720/?ref_=tt_urv

","I only just started watching it again, I realise why I stopped watching it.
How sam a guy from the military that accidentally killed his best friend and is kicked out of the military & allowed to join sru without going through selection. He even gets to be temporary team leader from being a rookie on the team.
And donna went through selection and scrapped through the psych avail gets to be team leader on team 3.
After all the sru rules about team members being in a relationship, jules & sam get married in the final episodes. (sorry for the spoiler).
This tv show just gets more & more anoying.",/review/rw3396720/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2012,Board,5," Canadian, but still cheesy American
","In my job I have subtitled 24 episodes of this show, and I can say that this series is really not much different than so many other shows: Cops chase criminals. Cops catch criminals – every time! Here it's a S.W.A.T. team/S.R.U. team (it's Canadian), but they have just replaced the usual detectives with a different division. The acting is decent, and the scripts are decent, but that's really all it is. This is really not much different than crime films/series from the last 80 years - except that the pace is faster. It's all glorification of the police and what they can do (and all their new high tech gadgets). Crime never pays is still the lesson. While we are on the subject of lessons, the show always want to draw out a lesson at the end. I'm perfectly fine with that – I mean, entertainment is nice, but what's the point in watching something if it doesn't stir something in us and makes us think about certain things? The way ""Flashpoint"" does it is simply too cheesy. Right after the cops rush in and catch the criminal, save the hostage or whatever (and they practically always talk the perpetrator out of killing anybody), the images switch to slow-motion, and ""Dawson Creek"" music comes in with acoustic guitars, piano, and very, very, very meaningful lyrics. If I'm not mistaken, the segment with songs and slow-motion pictures has featured in every single one of the 24 episodes I have subtitled (fans of the show even have a name for it, ""the montage""), so it's simply becoming cheesy and predictable. It's almost like watching a soap opera. The main characters, of course, also always learn something from their cases about their own lives. If you want to watch predictable crime shows, there are many others much better than this one (for instance ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" or ""The closer"").",/review/rw3396720/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2016,bkoganbing,7," Try and take them alive
","In America we call it SWAT, Special Weapons And Tactics. But in Canada it's Strategic Response Unit. These are the guys called in when in Toronto where the series takes place. They're not just go in and blast the hell out of the perpetrator. They do hostage negotiation among other things and the weapons at times are designed to try and take the victim alive. As often as not that's what happens in Flashpoint.",/review/rw3396720/?ref_=tt_urv
