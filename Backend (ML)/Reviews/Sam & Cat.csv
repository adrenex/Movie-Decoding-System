13 December 2006,planktonrules,10," One of the greatest Sci-Fi series ever
","I nominate this and BABYLON 5 as the best television sci-fi series made. Both stand out in my mind because unlike early STAR TREK series, there is a consistent evolution of plots and characters. If you look at the original STAR TREK and STAR TREK:TNG, they were fine shows, but there was no overall theme or plot that connected all the episodes. In many ways, you could usually watch the shows totally out of sequence with no difficulty understanding what is occurring. This was less the case with DEEP SPACE 9 (with its giant battles that took up all of the final season) and the other TREK shows, as there was more of a larger story that unified them. This coherence seems to have developed as a concept with BABYLON 5 and saw this to an even greater extent with SG-1. The bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long novel slowly take form. Sure, there were a few ""throwaway"" episodes that were not connected to the rest, but these were very few and far between and were also usually pretty funny.",/review/rw0401552/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2004,whizkids,10," The adventure of a lifetime has begun.
","This series is set a year after the mission to Abydos in the movie Stargate. It explains a lot of the stuff that the movie neglected to mention. Such as, how was the Stargate activated without a human computer? Where did the Goa'uld (Ra's race) come from? How many are there? ",/review/rw0401552/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2020,AngelHonesty,9," Give It A Chance
","I'm a little bias since I grew up watching this show; I have literally seen the entire series more times then I can count, since it is one of my favorites, but maybe that's why I am also qualified to review it.",/review/rw0401552/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 1999,C.S.Wood,," I'm surprised there aren't more posts...
","I think this show is great. A great strength is that it doesn't go into special effects a lot (except for the gate, of course, and the staff weapons/guns). Some compare it to Star Trek (which is unfair, seeing  that they are very different) but where a lot of Star Trek plots fail this succeeds.",/review/rw0401552/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 1999,Dante Hicks,," If it wasn't for The X-Files it would be unparalleled in Sci-Fi
","A magnificent program which shows just how imaginative and professional TV can be when the director, cast, crew and screenwriters all work to the best of their considerable ability. The simple fact that it doesn't play like the film over and over again (Something which has plagued many film-cum-TV-shows of late) shows how original it really is and though yes, I admit, the first series was very 'Star Trek' in its recycling of the same story types it always remained somehow different.",/review/rw0401552/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2019,ghanima_atrieadies,10," Favorite of all time
","Still my favorite of all time. Battlestar came close but no cigar. This is fun, smart, and I can watch it everyday and not tire of it. I know that some are probably better but for me this is the favorite.",/review/rw0401552/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2002,Big Movie Fan,," Awesome Sci-Fi Series
",The 1990's was a mediocre time for sci-fi series in my opinion. Stargate SG-1 was one of the few good series.,/review/rw0401552/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2004,evilcritic,," The franchise to fear
","Ten years after Emmerich & Devlin showed the world how it SHOULD be done, the TV spin off of their (still) greatest achievement has finally proven itself to be the best franchise in existence today.",/review/rw0401552/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2018,tautangata,10," Guilty of uncountable veiwings of all 10 seasons
","Its getting old, but remains my most favourite tv show.",/review/rw0401552/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2005,saralou,," It just keeps going
","Perhaps to the chagrin of some but the joy of others Stargate refuses to die, with yet another season being signed on for.",/review/rw0401552/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2020,ParanoidPenguin,10," One of the best Science Fiction series ever made
","This series is one of the best science fiction series ever made. All the characters are very likeable. The story never grows dull through all 200 sum episodes. They always find a new way to keep the series going without abandoning the old plot to start a new one. The old arcs always continue to have presence throughout the series. Worth a watch, then a re-watch, and maybe one more.",/review/rw0401552/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2000,Merlin-88,," This show continues to impress me.
","Very few TV shows based on films are ever good, this one is. Very few TV shows can maintain their pace and originality over the years, this one has. I've just watched the first 6 episodes of season 4 and each and every one of them has been a cracker.",/review/rw0401552/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2019,ocnu-87277,10," Shows don't get much better
",Ten seasons wasn't enough and it was when they were brave enough to do 22-episode seasons. Evelyn with the last two seasons people leaving and the cast changing Claudia Black and Ben Browder stepped up and they could have went on and kept it interesting wish they would have a show like this again,/review/rw0401552/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2019,zidangus,9," One of the best.
","I am watching this for a second time, because the sci-fi on now is terrible TBH. Too much gore, sex and stupidity in most sci-fi series now, Star-Trek Discovery a case in point. SG-1 has good strong likeable characters, good actors, good plots and overall a great series to watch and enjoy. There is no need to see blood and guts, and have f-bombs dropped every other scene and sex scenes when the story line of your show and your characters are strong. Ok some of the science is way off, but I can forgive that if the story-line is strong and it fits in with the SG-1 universe. Overall as good if not better than Battle Star Galactica and miles better than tripe like ST Discovery.",/review/rw0401552/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2019,limbikanidambuleni,10," Best Tv Sci-fi Action Series to Date....well kinda
","I grew up watching Stargate SG1, the idea of increasing on the Movie was well made, incorporating the ancient Egyptians/Norse history and archaeology into the sci-fi is done well also.",/review/rw0401552/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2004,johndec,10," Well Done!
","The movie was groundbreaking, and its ideas had great potential for further development. Usually, sequels are made to continue the story on the big screen. Creating this excellent series was a much better decision than producing lousy sequels for the masses. ",/review/rw0401552/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2020,jsalzman-99905,10," Best Series Ever.
","Hands down the best Sci Fi series ever, and it has aged well.",/review/rw0401552/?ref_=tt_urv

",One amazing series it had all the emotions with credible characters I am still watching the repeats to this day . Window of opportunity legend !!!!,/review/rw0401552/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2020,dieheinis,10," My all time favorite
","If you haven´t already watched Stargate SG-1 you will probably have a hard time to dig into this show, but if you give it a try you might just fall in love with it.
I grew up with this show, so I am really affected by the nostalgia lens.
None the less I still think that there is more to this show then many probably think,
I often here people say that the show is just too goofy and they can´t take it seriously, thus they never really watched it or only remember it as a silly sci-fy show. And even though the show is in fact more on the light hearted side, it still provides extremely enjoyable stories and characters, some episodes really manage to effect you, not just comedically but also emotionally. The show really has some poignant moments. And some episodes are just hilarious and will bring a big smile to your face. It´s and great story with lovable characters and has this adventures vibes to it.",/review/rw0401552/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2017,bluesquirrel2004,9," 20 years since release, still has not dated
","10 years since the final episode, and 20 years since the first episode, and I finally watched the series in it's entirety. Although I had previously seen upto Season 7 from previous viewings (TV or DVD purchase) I never did see Seasons 8-10 and the two TV Movies.",/review/rw0401552/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2000,imdb-242,," Takes off where the Stargate movie left you...
",Most believe Stargate SG-1 to be better than the movie it spawned from. Perhaps that is so.  But I believe being a series it can also expand on a lot of things the movie didn't have time for.,/review/rw0401552/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2006,jmbwithcats,8," SG-1 Blows Away SG-A
","It's almost impossible to believe the show has been going strong for 10 years and isn't showing signs of slowing down, in fact I'd say bringing Ben Browder and Claudia Black over from Farscape was an ingenious idea. yes, Ben often comes across as a weak actor by his line delivery, I have no doubt he will deliver, and is a terrific addition to the show, and Claudia is as adorable as ever, and twice as lovely.",/review/rw0401552/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2020,tonywebster-96090,7," Stargate sg-1
","This tv show, along with Babylon 5, star trek deep space nine are the best science fiction series.",/review/rw0401552/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2004,kudos4kkms,," I'm in the gate!
","My mom was the first in our family to watch Stargate and I'd make fun of her. I'd call her a Sci-Fi freak or a Stargate loser! Then, I watched it and now I'm hooked. As some other people say the show is predictable...this is not completely true and when it is you know how it'll end up it's just how they get there that's interesting! This show is well written and preformed amazingly, plus they have extraordinarily talented actors. If you don't like Sci-Fi you won't like this show, but if you do you'll love it(plus there are hot guys in it too). Richard Dean Anderson is brilliant and extremely funny, since his character O'Neill is so cynical, sarcastic, and kickbutt (Amanda Tapping is also kickbutt)-which he says is a lot like himself. Even though this is just a Sci-Fi show the special effects look amazingly real and all of the costumes are amazing. This is a top of the line show...I totally recommend getting in the gate!",/review/rw0401552/?ref_=tt_urv
