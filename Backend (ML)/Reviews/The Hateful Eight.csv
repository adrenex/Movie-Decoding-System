1 December 2022,star_hazard,6," Should've just focused on the Troll, the humans were a letdown
",Watching this I thought it's just going to be your average monster action movie... and you know what? It is. So yeah it delivered that big monster itch.,/review/rw8759383/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2022,svenlauke,5," Average film with a lot of logic flaws
",So first of all: the CGI is quite good. I can't comment on the acting because a lot gets lost in the dub.,/review/rw8759383/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2022,darapjohnson,4," Big disappoint, doesn't hold a candle to ""Troll Hunters""
","I went into ""Troll"" expecting it to be as good and catching as ""Troll Hunters"" which was also a norwegian film but instead... and I hate to say this, but I found myself quite bored. This was not at all as mysterious and catching as ""Troll Hunters"" was which I didn't want to end but ""Troll"" I just wanted to end quicker.",/review/rw8759383/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2022,Mili_Cja,1," Who writes this stuff?
","The Troll, the mighty Norwegian Army fightingt it, the researcher, the father, the captain - yeah, I can get all the cliches and live with them. What I cannot tolerate is lousy writing and cringe worthy dialogue. Which is sadly aplenty. Norse people know their way around interesting movies which begs the question: WHO THE F wrote this trite? Moronic exchanges, nonsense drivel, ridiculous reactions (they can see the Troll figure on their screens, yet they still say it cannot be the Troll their grandma told them about). Paper thin characters you don't give a s** about, this I cannot tolerate. Making me watch this manure and waste my precious time - this I cannot accept either. So if you appreciate your time, pick your viewings and don't take stuff at their face value - skip this unless Trolls are your absolute thing.",/review/rw8759383/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2022,PedroPires90,7," Fun, entertaining
","How can I be taken seriously when on a day when wannabe movie critics are crazy trying to see the new Sight & Sound's #1 (probably boring stuff), I'm here with my Nachos and my Gin & Tonic watching a giant troll destroying a country? I won't and I don't care.",/review/rw8759383/?ref_=tt_urv

1 December 2022,LaMigraCartel,4," Laughably Stupid
","So in movies like this, I don't expect the Godfather.... but I do expect something. I can accept the premise that trolls have been sleeping underground etc etc. But it is so dumb. You literally have people staring at the troll, you have a person say hey that looks like a troll, then 8 people in the movie go you're crazy, that's not a troll. So what is it? Let's discuss what the troll in front of us is? Does anyone know what kinda troll that troll thing might be. But don't call it a troll. It's like how in every zombie movies the people in the movie live in an alternate reality where they've never heard of zombies before.",/review/rw8759383/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2022,SoumikBanerjee25,5," Heavily inspired from Hollywood Blockbusters
","Okay hold on a sec, so you're telling me, there is a monster invasion that is neither happening in the United States nor does it involve soldiers serving the American Military? Well, that's new.",/review/rw8759383/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2022,A_Different_Drummer,6," More monster fun from Northern Europe
","This reviewer is always delighted to check the film output from Northern Europe, because you never know what to expect, and the surprise factor is always to the upside -- check out, for example, the Finnish X-mas film from 2010, RARE EXPORTS, affectionately known as the ""anti-Santa"" movie. TROLL 2022 follows a proven and reliable arc remarkably similar to Roland Emmerich's 1998 production of Godzilla which, in turn, is itself faithful to the standard ""monster"" formula from the 1950's -- monster appears, monster creates havoc, hero has to destroy monster. Tried and true. Competently done. Empathetic leads you can relate to. What makes this story especially interesting (and this is not in TROLL's PR package) is that there are a number of respected archeologists (including for example Michael Tellinger, who has single-handedly rewritten the history of southern Africa) who believe there is some degree of truth in the ""petrification"" myth, and have extensive documentation to back up their claims. Recommended. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

11 December 2022,Xstal,7," Fee Fi Fo Fum...
","There's a being hidden deep within the rocks, imprisoned in a craggy granite box, but progress has awakened, now the land is quaked and shaken, leaving everyone who sees a bit flummoxed. Not to worry, just keep calm and carry on, where there's danger we have guns and tanks and bombs, blow this unknown thing to bits, with some well aimed direct hits, then in no time, this fiend will be all gone. Alas persistence seems to be one of his keys, as the missiles fail to bring him to his knees, we shall strike a stronger blow, against this ogre of a foe, dispatch the nukes, and he'll be cast into the breeze.",/review/rw8759383/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2022,drummerboy-42635,4," Strong 1st act but weak 2nd and 3rd
",The start of the film started out great. The plot was solid and mostly original. Unfortunately things started going downhill when it turned into your typical monster movie with a lack of plot and idiotic characters.,/review/rw8759383/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,7," An impressive Norwegian adventure film.
","This film was very beautifully shot with excellent cinematography and stunning visual effects. It's a cross between Jack and the Beanstalk meets King Kong/Godzilla - with a Norwegian fable coming to life as a result of these stories mended together. The casting and performances were spot-on, with some funny dialogue thrown in for comic relief. Although cliched with every huge-monster Hollywood blockbuster film, it still offers an effective and family-friendly monster movie in a Nordic backdrop. The 101 min runtime flew by with great pacing, and the score complimented the film perfectly. It's a fun and entertaining one-time watch.",/review/rw8759383/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2022,ingmarbeldman-753-927212,3," Misusing a valuable folktale for B-movie dump.
",This movie is a shameful sign of the times. Use a valuable folktale - the heart of a nations soul if you will - and misuse it for an unbalanced script full of self-contradictory nonsense. Produce with a minimal of costs a B-movie with no message at all and dump it on the market.,/review/rw8759383/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2022,barrywomb,6," Why So Much Hate?
","Not sure why people are dumping on this film with such vitriol, especially when so many American movies are guilty of similar transgressions. It's a fun monster movie in the Godzilla tradition. People fall all over themselves about the Jurassic Park movies and some others but dump on this? Hmm, I don't get the super-hate.",/review/rw8759383/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2022,Craig_McPherson,1," Total Trash
","The only takeaway from Troll is that Norwegians are as capable of churning out utter garbage as the rest of the world. The story is nonsense (even for monster movies) and choc-a-bloc with every genre trope in existence. The writers don't even attempt to explain anything beyond ""that's the way it was done in the fairytales. Special effects are top shelf, but that's it. Characters are wooden, unlikable and the dialog is horridly bad. Don't waste your time on this as the studio teases a sequel in the closing credits, something for which it is completely unworthy. I've seen my share of giant monster run amok time wasters, this one doesn't even make that very low bar.",/review/rw8759383/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2022,ops-52535,9," if you...
","Are interested in norwegian folklore, fairytails and the average supertroll that lives there, right under yours snotty nose, yes, just there at dovrefjell and the moutainous trollheimen, with the trollveggen and all the rocky avelanches and other troll like patterns made by and from ...trolls...then have a look at this one.",/review/rw8759383/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2022,t-d-t-m82,8," A Fun Troll Movie With Norse Mythology
",Firstly it's refreshing to see a movie without a huge bucketload of dull CGI. The plot is solid. The acting is good. Not over-acted. Limited sets are used well. The military is just about convincing with a limited budget which this movie would have had.,/review/rw8759383/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2022,Foutainoflife,7," This Is The Norwegian Godzilla Or King Kong!!
","The story is about a paleontologist, who happens to be the daughter of a folklorist, that is called in as a scientific consultant when a large ""unknown"" creature emerges from recent quarry rock blasting site inside a mountain. With a strange groaning being heard and earth shaking footsteps, it is leaving a trail of devastation in it's wake. Is it foolish to believe this could be a monster from childhood fairy tales? Could the fairy tales have been based on truths? How will they handle such an overwhelming threat?",/review/rw8759383/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2023,Rebellion_H,2," Waste of time
","Totally waste of time. Plot is full of cliches...
It is so bad that I just stop watching it after half of hour (I can't remember last movie that I was stopped watching on my own like this one), although there was bunch of horrible movies that I kept watching just to finish them, because when I start to watch something I Want to end it, no matter how bad that movie is, but this one I couldn't kept watching... missing something, except cliches.",/review/rw8759383/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2022,Coventry,7," Norwegian native folklore!
","Warning: you will not - repeat, WILL NOT - read a very honest and objective review here. For as long as I can remember I've been obsessed with tales originating from Scandinavian folklore, fairy-tales, and historic sagas, and it's literally since decades that I've been waiting for a film like ""Troll"". Well, I've been waiting for slightly more than just one decade, more specifically since the release of that other massively entertaining (and even better) ""Troll Hunter"".",/review/rw8759383/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2022,isaacmizrahii,6," RockZILLA!
","The reviewers here are funny...
the 'top review'er apologizing because he's norwegian and is ashamed that this film is from Norway...
then there's the 'average film with a lot of LOGIC flaws'...i am, seriously, laughing as i type this...but it's great that the reviewers can be as entertaining as the film, right? Why stop the entertainment with the end credits...
but anyone approaching this expecting shakespeare, weeeelllllllll...okay, but we already know the answer to the 'to be or not to be', as far as this being 'realistic'...
it's a paint by numbers, substitute a troll for Godzilla type of story. I was amazed at the similarities...beginning with the myth...the way to handle the situation...the 'humanizing' of the creature...
pop some corn and have some fun, if it seems like you're in the mood for what you think this movie will be like...it's not badly done...it's just, somewhat, trite if you've seen the movies this was modeled after...",/review/rw8759383/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2022,varun-25071997,8," Monster Movie With A Touch of Nativity
",The Troll should have been a theatrical release first and foremost. It is the best monster movie since Godzilla (2014) and a movie like this deserves more than a straight streaming release.,/review/rw8759383/?ref_=tt_urv

26 December 2022,Johnny_West,7," Enjoyable
","This is a basic Godzilla movie with a Norwegian Troll instead of Godzilla. I am guessing they took a few Godzilla screenplays and hijacked what they liked out of those stories, and then converted it to Norway traditions and a Troll monster. It worked good enough for me.",/review/rw8759383/?ref_=tt_urv
