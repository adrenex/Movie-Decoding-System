26 January 2019,Top_Dawg_Critic,8," I wanted to hate this B-grade film, but ended up loving it!
","Novice (mainly music videos and short film - only a handful of full length feature films) director Jonas Åkerlund, and novice screenwriter Jayson Rothwell, did an outstanding job creating a crazy action noir film adaptation from the graphic novel by Víctor Santos.",/review/rw4605051/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2019,ahmetkozan,7," Action & Brutality
","First of all, the film shouldn't be a movie you'll definitely take seriously. Please leave your brain if you decide to watch this movie. Because this film is a crunchy film that focuses entirely on the action and the charm of ferocity. So there is no deeper meaning nor a deep scenario.",/review/rw4605051/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2019,joker-4,7," Crazy film perfect for a Tuesday night
","A good action movie is like a classic meat-and-potatoes meal; standard fare that although might be seasoned differently is both filling and unsurprising. Occasionally a genre-breaking film will surprise everyone and pop open a bottle of Malbec to serve with a little filet mignon. Usually? The plot, situation, even the action itself, is as recycled as a hot dog washed down with a Coors Light. Forgettable. Ordinary. Monotonous. Then there is Polar.",/review/rw4605051/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2020,Muhammad_Rafeeq,8," Madd was solid. Terrific factory shootout. Exactly what I expected. ( German C+Movie ) My Ratings 8/10
","Fun Fun Fun put your brain in a jar and sit back and enjoy a well directed well photographed great locations and a bunch of actors having fun hamming it up with their roles . If you want Shakespeare watch Shakespeare but if you want some fun here's the right movie. Remember other similar movies that received rave reviews John Wick, Red well this is in the same vein a retired assassin being hunted down . So sit a enjoy the fun and action and stop being so WOKE",/review/rw4605051/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2019,Fella_shibby,8," This film has nothing new to offer but has a lot for fans of the action genre. Loved it.
",What we have here is the typical hitman who wants to retire at a peaceful place but unlike the usual stuff where our hitman's wife/girlfriend gets killed or where he is pulled into the ugly job to save a kid or some redemption...,/review/rw4605051/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2019,p-jonsson,8," Strange mix of thriller and comedy
","This is a bit of a strange movie. Part of it feels like a pretty good, dark and gritty thriller, part of it feels like a wannabe Tarantino movie and part of it feels like a comedy. Overall I would classify it as a B-movie but a pretty good B-movie. As strange as the movie is I have to say that I liked it.",/review/rw4605051/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2021,pdmaynooth,9," Ridiculous, hilarious and violent
","Watched five minutes thought no not for me. Went back a few months later and watched it again , Mads is brilliant and Matt Lucas is kinda Matt Lucas so that's hilarious. Is it Jason Bourne or the terminator? Is it little Britain or the passion of Christ ? What type of movie is it ? It's certainly original. Really entertaining , completely over the top. I hope there is a sequel.",/review/rw4605051/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2021,TdSmth5,7," Surprisingly entertaining
","A bunch of goofs are about to kill some rich guy somewhere in his mansion. Why it takes 5 people to kill some completely unprotected guy who knows. Then we meet Vizla, another killer part of this outfit called Damocles. He's taking care of some business with his accountant. Vivian who sort of manages the killers gives Vizla his...yes...his ""One Last Job"" (TM) before retirement. He ""reluctantly"" agrees of course, travels to Belarus and nearly gets himself killed because the whole thing was actually a setup. Back in the US, Vizla goes home to his Montana cabin where does...basically nothing. He has nightmarish flashbacks of killing some people in a car. There's a girl living conveniently by herself next door who is beyond traumatized. Eventually...finally...they start talking and he helps her out with stuff.",/review/rw4605051/?ref_=tt_urv

","Polar is a graphic novel adaptation that provides a little bit of everything. Action set pieces, gun fights, graphic torture, sex, over the top characters, interesting casting and some hilarious moments.",/review/rw4605051/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2019,DarkVulcan29,8," John Wick , Smokin Aces, and Kill Bill all in a blender
","This movie is based on a series of graphic novel, and at times it shows, but quite like Sin City(2005). Violence here is quite intense to the point where you would just grit your teeth. The film is not subtle when it comes to anything here, If you are easily offended then you should probably avoid this.",/review/rw4605051/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2020,ozwillb,8," Unexpected pleasure!!
","What a great film! Sharp, tacky, cool, a bit of unecesscary violence and funny. In the midst of lockdown ennui, I have thoroughly enjoyed the last two hours! What more can I say, but give this film a go. Even Vanessa Hudgens was good, and normally if I saw her in the cast, I would run a mile!!",/review/rw4605051/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2019,claudio_carvalho,6," Near Retirement
","The efficient hitman Duncan Vizla (Mads Mikkelsen) will retire in a couple of days and will receive an eight-million dollars pension from the organization where he works as retirement plan. However his employer Blut (Matt Lucas) decides to double-cross Duncan to save the amount despite the advice of his assistant Vivian (Katheryn Winnick) to pay the pension to him. Duncan moves to an isolated cabin in Montana and befriends his only neighbor Camille (Vanessa Hudgens), a shy young woman. Meanwhile Vivian hires Duncan for one last job to kill the assassins of the retired hitman Michael Green, but with the intention of killing Duncan. However he kills the gang and returns to his house. Blut decides to send a team of assassins to kill Duncan at home. Will they succeed?",/review/rw4605051/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2021,ridi-arahan,8," They say "" don't play with the fire, especially if you cannot handle it.""
","What worked:
It's a stylish movie, with the aura of sophisticated action thriller and a larger than life character, blended beautifully to give us a very enjoyable experience. Of course, Mads as one of the finest actors, portraying a layered character. The movie came as a surprise and I had a pleasant experience watching the movie . It's well written, executed and acted piece of cinema. The action sequences are well executed. Overall a very pleasant watch.",/review/rw4605051/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Polar
","The only exceptional thing about this film is Mads Mikkelsen, who is always worth watching. Otherwise, the film is mediocre, predictable, schmaltzy in parts, your typical beat-em-up shoot-em-up extravaganza, complete w/closeups of wounds and dead people. Too much money was spent for a mediocre movie. Surely Mikkelsen doesn't need the money this much, does he? He can afford to be more discriminating.",/review/rw4605051/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2019,torroutedipz,8," Will be waiting for Polar Vol. 2
","Was it realistic...no, most action movies aren't. Was it entertaining...absolutely! For all the 1&2 star reviews all I can ask is ""what did you think you were about to watch?"". Clearly if you're posting reviews I would assume you read them as well, and look at cast line ups. When I sat down to decide which, usually mediocre at best, Netflix or Amazon movie I would watch, this popped up as new. I read the Netflix synopsis and thought it would be ok, but wasn't sure if I was in the mood for an action flick that was too dramatic. Then I looked on IMDb and saw how the cast was laid out, and it was obviously going not going to be that type of movie when I saw the assassins would be a group of hot females. It had very high violence and sexual ratings so I figured ""sure, I can do this."". The movie immediately gave me a Kill Bill type vibe, and that is pretty much the type of movie it is. For those who didn't pick up on this before the movie from the ratings or within the first few minutes, your lack of perception is on you. The quality and acting alone is worth a 5, but I found it nicely paced and entertaining, with an unexpected twist (I thought for sure Camille would be his daughter) so I give it a solid 7/8. There's nothing I can point out as being ""wrong"" with the movie. It is as advertised; an over the top action movie with violence and sex, and it makes for a great watch. If this isn't the type of movie you want to watch, then don't watch it. Don't watch it and rate it 1 star while complaining of the action and violence, you've been forewarned.",/review/rw4605051/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2019,kjjames81,8," An over the top shoot em up.
","What an awesome movie. mads Mikkelson is astounding as the assassin, Vanessa Judge's was good in her role. In fact let's be honest, EVERYONE played their role really well.
Yes the film is over the top. Yes it has lots of T and A. Yes it has loads of violence
In fact it's all of the above and it's done brilliantly.
This little note, so everyone pay attention, please. When I first saw the trailer, I thought it was going to another John Wick, which I love by the way, but it's not. There was a film out in 2003 there was a film called Shoot Em Up with Clive Owen. A fantastic film by the way, Polar is in that vein. So if you like those films then you will love this film, I did.
See this film it's one of the best I have seen for a long time. It does what it says on the tin.
Right I am off to watch this film AGAIN.",/review/rw4605051/?ref_=tt_urv

22 April 2020,alexdragonsnake,10," A comic successfully made movie
","This bloody action-packed Netflix action movie is based on Victor Sanchez's web comic of the same style and spirit. The comic is speechless, there are only pictures. So in the film, the focus is on the visual - wild and outrageous violence. The ways in which Black Kaiser deals with numerous enemies are very diverse - fans of films such as ""John Wick"" will not be disappointed.
Polar ""is not just an action movie about assassins, it is a comic book with all its conventions, practically fantasy - I recall the absolute indestructibility of the main character.
The European 'style of the picture is remarkable - although the American film is officially shot in Canada, the German company Constantin Film is involved in the production,The director and cameraman are Swedes, and a Danish actor plays the leading role.
Would love to see Mads Mikkelsen in the role of Takeshi Kovac in Altered Carbon (my fantasy).",/review/rw4605051/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2019,gaamst,6," Two great performances, one horrible movie
","Somehow Mikkelsen and Hudgens are brilliant in this. I would've liked it if the movie focused more on their characters relationship. Because the script, and in particular the dialogue, is just awful. I understand that this movie is based on a webcomic, which I haven't seen, and it's painfully obvious. The characters, except for Mikkelsen and Hudgens, are cartoonish and completely over the top, and not in a good way like Kick-Ass.",/review/rw4605051/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2019,siderite,4," A bunch of cliches bundled together
","Imagine John Wick part 26 and you get this. It's lame, boring, doesn't add up and seems to serve no purpose than to serve gore and violence. And truthfully, that's boring, too. Hard R? I've seen French kids movies that are more brutal. And the cast... what were they doing there? Mads Mikkelsen? The annoying robot from Doctor Who? Lagertha? The Master from The Strain (no makeup, though), Richard freaking Dreyfuss looking so old you believe him when he says he is dying? It felt like one of those Russian movies that buy a few American actors to front something done with lots of money and no talent or passion and expected only to make e profit. No soul, just a eurogangster Hollywood clone.",/review/rw4605051/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2019,blundell-54222,8," Not perfect, but far better than the critical reviews..
","Quite a poor critical reception, but having just watched it myself I can't help that many of the reviews have missed the point of this violent slice of entertainment. While for the most part what they say IS true (clunky dialogue, silly, poorly paced), they could also add slick, humourous and stylish to that list. The corridor scene - a highlight in the trailer misses the mark and would have benefitted with better choreography but was enjoyable all the same. The Female characters, empowered one minute, gratuitously undressed the next, don't make sense other than to advance the plot and pleasure the men. It did feel a lot like the graphic novel in parts though and contrary to what I've read elsewhere Mads Mikkelsen's understated, world weary portrayal is brilliant, even if Hudgens is underused (as are are most of the supporting cast). Style over substance? Maybe. But as a ultra violent comic book popcorn flick I think it works pretty well, and whether it happens or not I'd love to see the sequel it sets up in the closing scenes. I'd say watch it yourself and form your own opinion.",/review/rw4605051/?ref_=tt_urv
