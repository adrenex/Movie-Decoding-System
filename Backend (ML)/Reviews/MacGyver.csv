13 March 2003,dbdumonteil,," car emptiness...
","Through his career, Ridley Scott was an eclectic film-maker because he broached (with success) several cinema styles: science-fiction with ""Alien"", historical film with ""1492: Christopher Colombus"". Here, he succeeded very well his way to the road-movie and this one is listed among the best road-movies ever made. At first look, the story looks simple and without too many claims: two young women, Thelma and Louise are going out for the week-end with the firm intention of having a ball. But what they don't know is that this drive will soon become a descent into hell... The movie is worth seeing for its two main actresses: Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis, both outstanding and what interests Ridley Scott, is their temperament and their evolution during the movie. At the beginning, a sensitive and fragile Thelma is next to a energetic and realistic Louise but in the second part of the movie, more precisely, after Thelma burglarized a shop (probably the best sequence in the whole movie) in order to grab money, roles are reversed. This is an occasion to make out Louise's wounds and weaknesses. So, don't rely too much on appearances... ""Thelma and Louise"" is also a movie where Scott takes a lucid look on the hidden side of the American society and especially on men. Scott introduces them to us with their worst faults: either they're macho (Darryl), obscene (the truck driver), perverse (the rapist) or coward (the cop). The only one saved is Harvey Keitel who never falls into the caricature of the American cop usually described to us as merciless or obsequious. Here, he shows understanding and even compassion towards the two runaways, notably Louise because he knows that she hides a terrible secret. A dynamic and panting movie where laugh and sorrow are skillfully married.",/review/rw2987833/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2002,DennisLittrell,8," More than an exercise in male-bashing
","This is an important commercial film aimed at blue collar women who feel victimized by both society and the men in their lives. Directed by Ridley Scott, who directed the science fiction classics, Alien (1979) and Blade Runner (1982), Thelma and Louise is an on-the-lam chick flick (with chase scenes), a kind of femme Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), somewhat akin to Wild at Heart (1990) and Natural Born Killers (1994) but without the gratuitous violence of those films. Ridley Scott walks the razor edge between femme-exploitation and serious social commentary. Incidentally, the script is by Callie Khouri who wrote Something to Talk About (1995) and Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood (2002) which should give you an idea of how men are depicted here.",/review/rw2987833/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2020,kristiezurvas,10," Empowering yet tragically sad
",I feel sad that this movie received claims of being anti male. The reality is that there are a lot of challenges women face just for being female and this movie shows that. The shock factor that this movie portrays is that Thelma and Louise feel that they must take drastic measures to empower and free themselves from the challenges they face as women. It was an incredible movie and definitely a must see.,/review/rw2987833/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2004,sparklecat,," A Must-See
","""Thelma and Louise"" made a huge splash when it was released and has since become a part of the pop culture lexicon. In it, a mistreated housewife and harried waitress stumble into an out-of-control - but totally liberating - crime spree. As bold and relevant as ever, it remains a vastly entertaining must-see.",/review/rw2987833/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2019,skepticskeptical,8," Liberation or Suicide?
","Having just watched Thelma & Louise for the first time, nearly thirty years after its release, I feel compelled to jot down a few observations. First, the shooting of the rapist was not self-defense, because the two women were secure when the shooting took place. It was an act of execution, apparently for the guy´s provocation (¨Suck my c**k!¨), but more likely it was a projection of what Louise´s rapist from Texas deserved, at least in her mind. Viewed that way, it was a revenge execution for the harm that she suffered at the hands of an equally despicable man.",/review/rw2987833/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2003,Old Joe,," Somebody said get a life. so they did!
","For many years now, women have taken power into their own hands. So I am sure the women that campaigned for freedom and liberty, would have loved the movie, 'Thelma and Louise'. The tradition of the American road trip is shown in such a refreshing way in this movie, with its two lead characters people who are fed up with life, and no longer take any crap from the men that they live with or that they meet. Thelma and Louise is a film that will make you feel warm, but also leave a some what 'bitter-sweet' taste in your mouth.",/review/rw2987833/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2006,freaky_dave,9," Almost perfect road movie about two women on the run
","Thelma and Louise is a rarity. It is a buddy movie about two women, and it is one of the best road movies to ever grace the screen.",/review/rw2987833/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2003,tragiclaura5,10," We'll be drinking margaritas by the sea, mamasita!
","Boy oh boy, where to start with this one?  This movie affected me so deeply when it first came out.  I saw it many times in the theater and was blown away every single time.  Deep and powerful, yet hilarious and fun in many parts.  This one is flawless.  My girlfriends and I still quote lines from this.  This movie is NOT man bashing.  It has some very powerful things to say about choices, friendship and the life that you make for yourself. Truly memorable and the kind of movie that really stays with you.",/review/rw2987833/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2008,Nazi_Fighter_David,7," A rare moment in cinema of the total rejection of the rule of law and patriarchy
","The road movie is traditionally a male genre, relying on the sense of freedom and independence that having one's own transport provides and which has usually been the privilege of men What is innovatory about ""Thelma & Louise"" is the way it reequips the genre for women ",/review/rw2987833/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2011,Steffi_P,9," ""At least now I'm having some fun""
","Back in the 30s and 40s, there was a kind of movie known as the women's picture. These were typically romantic dramas told from a female perspective, and while they often featured headstrong intelligent women (at least by the standards of typical portrayals), they would often have some kind of moral at the end about being a loyal and obedient wife as a kind of final goal in a woman's life. It was a long time, even years after the era of women's lib that patriarchy in the movies began to be completely deconstructed. The subject of women driven to murder by the actions of men was not a new one when Thelma & Louise was made in 1991. But if you look at a picture like Play Misty for Me from two decades earlier, where a used woman becomes the antagonist in a Psycho-type thriller, or I Spit on your Grave (1978) in which a woman's revenge for being raped could only be shown in a lurid exploitation movie, we can see how far the perspective has had to shift.",/review/rw2987833/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2000,ruth.boaz,10," A terrific movie about friendship.
","I loved this movie from the first time I saw it, but it wasn't until I sat through it the third time that I figured out why.  It is clever, exciting, and funny and is shot in the middle of the breathtaking scenery of the American Southwest.  However, the thing that makes it special is its illustration of pure friendship.  It may be difficult for some men to cross the gender boundary and connect with Thelma and Louise, yet doing so is critical to appreciating the film.  If you can make the connection then you can get its message -- we all need a friendship like the one Thelma and Louise had.  This movie will strike a deep emotional chord.....if you aren't afraid to let it.  And if you happen to be too emotionally closed off to appreciate what I think the movie says about friendship I think that you will still enjoy the characters, acting, action, and humor.  It is a ten out of ten.",/review/rw2987833/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2006,Spuzzlightyear,9," Still great
","You have to give it up for a movie that casts Michael Madsen as pretty much the only sane guy in existence. Thelma (Geena Davis) and Louise (Susan Sarandon) go off from their banal existences to a trip that heads up poop creek really REALLY fast. After shooting dead a would-be rapist, they both head for the hills where the law, personal freedom and, yes, Brad Pitt await! I hadn't seen this in quite a number of years, and it was great to come back to. I remembered a lot of it, but I noticed particularly this time the strong performances of not only of Davis and Sarandon, but of Harvey Keitel, Madsen (who is actually amazing), Pitt, and quite underplayingly, Christopher Mcdonald. Ridley Scott puts these elements all together in one explosive package.",/review/rw2987833/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2019,masonsaul,9," Incredible adventure
","Thelma and Louise is an incredible, if familiar, adventure that's funny, well paced and emotional. Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis give incredible performances and have fantastic chemistry. Harvey Keitel, Brad Pitt and Michael Madsen all give really good supporting performances. Ridley Scott's direction is amazing and the music by Hans Zimmer is great as well as the soundtrack.",/review/rw2987833/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 1999,emm,8," Feminist road classic carries a full tank of gas.
","THELMA & LOUISE has to be regarded as a pure 90s classic that brought up a considerable amount of risk in creating a first-person feminist formula into a mainstream movie, which is often missing. It pulls off fantastically true in form, with the exceptional Southern character talents of the two lady fugitives on the run, Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon, who may stand out as memorable on the silver screen. Let's not forget that silly truck driver they pass quite often, and of course, cowboy Brad Pitt as a young student. While not needed to be fully reliant on action substances like gunshooting, there is good chemistry within its grasp. Every single minute should not be wasteful, as plenty of refreshing outbursts of enjoyment outweighs the familiar old plot of evading the police. The ending is a definite eye catcher, and also the riskiest ever filmed! Beware of this rip-off called GOOD GIRLS DON'T, another poor B-movie with no redeeming quality. Satisfyingly original, and highly recommended!",/review/rw2987833/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2004,s3019653,9," Is it anti-male?
","A lot of people have dubbed this as a ""chick flick"" but I do not really like that term as it implies that men cannot enjoy watching it. Alien had a female lead and had parts that were sad but nobody would call that a chick flick. Also is every movie about male characters a guy flick? I thought this was a great drama and the acting was superb. No one can deny that this movie is a classic and has influenced the English language. I would also like to mention that I am a man. In response to people who bash the movie saying that it is anti-male; I would like to say that Thelma and Louise is simply a movie about situations that happen to women all too often. Women are raped everyday and women are abused everyday; this movie brings that into the light and says that it is not good enough. I do not believe that shooting the rapist was justified but at least he did not get away with it. The movie shows that by running away from your problems things only get worse. People have also commented that there are no men that are not portrayed negatively. Both the sympathetic police officer and Jimmy are likable characters. The purpose of this film was not to celebrate masculinity but to show two women breaking free from oppression. Not all women are raped or abused but it is something that is very common and it is relevant enough to be a theme of a movie.",/review/rw2987833/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2006,moonspinner55,7," Despite some fundamental weaknesses, it has really held up over time...
","Two accidental female fugitives elude the police while attempting to drive across the Southwest to Mexico. Filmmaker Ridley Scott shows a terrific talent for directing women here, and the performances by Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis are almost uncanny. One can hardly believe that these two haven't been friends for years, their give and take seems so lived in. Salty waitress Sarandon, initially the savvier of the two, is loose and girlie with Arkansas housewife Davis in the beginning; however, their character shadings soon change, with both ladies eventually taking turns playing 'the brains' (I didn't really believe it when, having been pulled over by a cop in the desert, Sarandon's Louise becomes kind of a dingbat, but you accept it for the moment and the movie quickly rolls on). The men in the cast obviously don't get much of a chance to shine, but Harvey Keitel does the understanding detective bit very well (it's almost the same man he portrayed in ""Mortal Thoughts""); Brad Pitt has a scene-stealing, star-making role as a cowboy hustler, yet this film took a long time to gain a fully appreciative audience. It did modest business and garnered Oscar nominations for the ladies, but only afterward did it take on some resonance (it's now viewed as a feminist statement and has a loyal following among lesbian audiences). It creaks a little, and the twangy main theme gives way to a ridiculously melodramatic score, but the narrative is so tight and the women are so good that it keeps you watching--and returning. *** from ****",/review/rw2987833/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is one of the rare times that I went to see this movie more than once. When I first saw it ""I had no idea what to expect"" and neither did the audience. Everybody thought we were ""Seeing a Comedy"". So the events in this film shook me (and the rest of the audience) to my core. What I saw was a film that did not follow the predictableness of a Hollywood film. What I got was an eye opener. I loved the film regardless of the events that happen in the film.",/review/rw2987833/?ref_=tt_urv

",Wow that guy Ridley Scott can make really great movies. This is maybe the most iconic women duo on film ever. Cast is just amazing and soundtrack is unbelievably awesome. Very important movie for that time and today because it shows how are women treated in this world.

5 April 2019,SafReviews,8," Really interesting movie
","Good movie with an intriguing plot with some twists which makes the movie better. It's not one of those drama movies were certain parts of the plot just drag along; all of the scenes are good, well except for the sex scenes which I found unnecessary. It has some really funny and also some serious moments which is a good mix. The characters of Thelma and Louise where well portrayed which makes you root for them. To be honest, if this movie was released today it would receive more controversy as people might think it offends men, but for me as a man I wasn't offended by it much.",/review/rw2987833/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Thelma & Louise"" is not only a classic road movie but also one of the most entertaining journeys to ever hit the big screen. Its delicious combination of drama, action and comedy is brilliantly balanced to create a story that delivers sufficient humour, warmth and exhilaration to ensure that its commentary about sexual oppression never gets so heavy-handed that it detracts from the enjoyment of watching this special film. Oscar-winning screenwriter Callie Khouri deserves great credit for achieving this balance and also for the quality of her script which is intelligent and witty and contains numerous quotable remarks.",/review/rw2987833/?ref_=tt_urv
