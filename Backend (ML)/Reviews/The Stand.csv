19 July 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10," Wonderful show, such a shame it was cancelled
","When My Name is Earl first aired, it very quickly became one of my favourites. For a long time, it was to me one of the better and funnier shows airing on television, and I was really disappointed when it was cancelled. Jason Lee for starters is perfect as Earl, he is very funny and endearing all at once. All the other actors are engaging and have their chance to shine, but Lee was always the one to watch. My Name is Earl also had crisp production values, likable characters, interesting story lines and hilarious jokes and writing.",/review/rw2865797/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2005,knifeintheeye,10," pilot was fantastic, can it continue...
","OK, it was only one episode, but it was very funny. Jason Lee, best known to me, from Mumford and most Kevin Smith movies, was perfect. His dumb brother, Randy, played by Kevin Smith alum, Ethan Suplee was fun as well. Jaime Pressly oddly was the best cast. ALthough I believed the brothers were redneck bums, down on there luck, house breaking into losers...Jaime was the best suited to her character. She was picture perfect as the just a little too old, old time beauty queen tramp. She was a blast. In fact all the characters had features of them that stood out. I'm marking Tuesday night at 8 pm on my calender. This show (if one show is any indication...) is a keeper.",/review/rw2865797/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2005,pwargo,," Finally, funny TV!
","I'm not much of a TV watcher anymore, as most stuff these days doesn't appeal to me, especially the whole ""reality TV"" trend. It's not often that a show comes along that is original in concept (or, at least in presentation!), and that makes me laugh all the way through.",/review/rw2865797/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2005,ClassicAndCampFilmReviews,," Great new show! If you like the Coen brothers films, you might love this
","I saw the first episode of ""My Name Is Earl"" last night, (9 p.m. on NBC) and I just had to plug it. I thought it was brilliant - wonderfully cast, written, and directed. I hope the show is a hit and keeps it up.",/review/rw2865797/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2005,jdunham3,," Jason Lee is perfect in this show and it was great!
","My husband and I are great fans of Jason Lee's movie roles. We were really looking forward to this show and it totally delivered. You know a show is good if the funniest jokes aren't wasted in the trailer. Funny, well-written with great timing and direction. I instantly set my DVR to record all episodes to make sure I don't miss a single one. I thought the premise was very unique and while Earl appears to be a stereotype, there are unplumbed depths. The peripheral characters are a hoot, the choice of music also elicited quite a few laughs.",/review/rw2865797/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2005,SonicStuart,," Looks like this show is going to have a good run!
","""My Name Is Earl"" is one of the funniest new shows of 2005! ""My Name Is Earl"" is about this guy named Earl (Jason Lee) who is a redneck and one day he wins $100,000 off a lottery ticket and then decides to make a list of things that he did wrong from his past with his new realization about how much his life sucks. So I think this show will probably be a hit and go for a few seasons since I'm sure that every episode is going to be where he is checking off his list and making sure that his life gets better. This show premiered on NBC, September 2005.",/review/rw2865797/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2005,rootleafdinner,," FINALLY! Been hungering for something fresh and new like this!
","I haven't gotten into anything new as far as a live action series since Seinfeld went off the air. Most comedy series are lame, not funny and predictable with laugh tracks.. Its like, ""Oh, I was supposed to laugh at that?"". Finally with ""Earl"" there is something new to get into watching again with an original idea. This show is very funny, has great characters, scenes, directing and doesn't prompt you to laugh with a laugh track. Jason Lee was on Leno a week or so ago pluggin his show and is really funny, and talks much the same as his character. Guess thats how he delves into it so easy. I hope this show sticks around for a while. After years of Reality TV and a bunch of played out stupid comedy series this is a welcome treat!",/review/rw2865797/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2005,jhanratty,," One of this seasons Best new shows
","I am a Jason Lee fan and when I saw the advertisements for his show, I was a little skeptical. I thought it was going to be all hype and not funny. But,I watched the premiere last night and I couldn't stop laughing. You have to understand the humor to get the jokes, but it is so worth it. I think this is going to be a huge hit for NBC and Lee. The cast was awesome and a great combination. It is nice to see Jason Lee and Ethan Suplee on the screen together again.If you get the chance watch this show. You won't be sorry. It is also followed by another great show The Office. I think they work well together. Tuesday nights are better than they used to be.I hope that NBC keeps this show around for several seasons.",/review/rw2865797/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2006,bob the moo,," Series 1: A bit sentimental at times but mostly carried by imaginative writing, great dialogue and great performances
","Earl Hickey is a goddamn, no-good piece of white trash who would steal your teeth if they were false. When he wins the lottery he is so happy that he doesn't see the car driving towards him until it has already laid him out. Recovering in the hospital he sees a Carson Daly piece on TV that is looking at the concept of karma and he realises why his life is so rubbish  because he has spent it doing bad things. He resolves to write down a list of all the bad things he has done and work though them to make amends, thus balancing his life out. His first good deed sees him reunited with his winning lottery ticket  thus setting him up with the resources to tackle the rest.",/review/rw2865797/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2009,VetteRanger,9," Trailer trash at its best
","And yes, My Name is Earl is literally about trailer trash, and hilariously so.",/review/rw2865797/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2009,jcaraway3,9," Boo Networks!
","I'd give this hilarious and original show a 10 if it wasn't for stupid ol' NBC canceling it on a cliffhanger. Now we'll never know who Earl Jr's real dad is! I will admit that the show got more and more gross every season(like in the episode ""Nature's Game Show"", Randy devours undelivered human organs), but that's no reason to cancel such a great show. I guess they canceled it because the ratings were terrible. Typically, people have no taste in television; they'd rather watch all the reality TV crap. In my opinion almost all of the really good shows are canceled before their time, but, then again, if I think it's really good, I don't think it should ever end. I know I sound like a complete nerd whining about frivolous crap such as TV shows, but I really hate it when shows are canceled on cliffhangers.",/review/rw2865797/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2019,jigp-72200,10," Simply Underrated
",One of the funniest shows in recent years!! This show is severely underrated! Every episode had me laughing so much. Earl & Randy are the perfect duo. Have rewatched the entire series 2 times now and about to start my 3rd run through. A true & good tv comedy. Definitely worth a watch,/review/rw2865797/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2012,Maniac-9,10," Awesome show
",I watched the pilot episode of MNIE when it debuted and was hooked on the show ever since it. I was already a big Jason Lee fan since we was in movies like Mallrats and Chasing Amy.,/review/rw2865797/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2005,wellscats,," Finally something original
","I loved the show........but what I loved most was finally seeing something that showed some semblance of an original thought. Time will tell how good or bad this show is but I think it is off to a great start..Almost every show that debuts today is simply the repackaging of a previous idea or concept.My name is Earl is an obvious attempt to provide something different and hopefully far better than todays traditional boiler-plate sitcom model.Expect that this show will break new ground in television and someday will be mentioned with other shows like ""Married with Children "" or"" All in the Family"" that stretched the limits while showcasing the dysfunctional direction of family life in todays America.",/review/rw2865797/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2007,phonenumberofthebeast,9," The oddest, most unexpected, and flat out best of a once-tired subgenre
","""My Name is Earl"" has some unlikely ancestors. It belongs to a genre of television comedy/drama best described as ""Good works shows"". Popular in the eighties, when ""Highway to Heaven"" and ""Quantum Leap"" topped the charts, these shows concerned a normal, everyday guy or gal who, usually at the inspiration of some amorphous Higher Power, travelled from place to place attempting to make things Right. These shows drew their audiences in with their optimism, their conviction and their reminder that, however bad the world may seem, we have it in us all to make it better. Naturally, once the 90s dawned, they withered on the vine.",/review/rw2865797/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2005,johnpenning51,," This Show is So Good That I Expect It To Be Cancelled
","I rarely watch sitcoms any more because they are normally both inane and indistinguishable from one another. This show may actually induce me to watch it on a regular basis. If you liked ""Raising Arizona"", you just might like ""My Name Is Earl"". After I watched the first episode I did an online search to find out who the creative forces were behind it. In doing so I stumbled into a review that described Earl as the illegitimate son of Nicholas Cage in ""Raising Arizona"". That just about nails the character. In In fact, while recounting the season opener to a friend who had missed it, I nearly called Earl, Hi. Catch it before it's gone. If you didn't think the first episode was brilliant, then this show is just not for you.",/review/rw2865797/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2008,fightthecrowd,10," Wonderful show
","I began watching this show mostly for Jason Lee, who is a very talented and funny actor. I really thought that the plot would would only allow for maybe 20 episodes before the premise became used up. It is now on the third season and seems to be keeping strong. For the most part, the show sticks with its main premise. It is nice to see a comedy that doesn't all take place within 4 rooms like many shows on the air today. I think the constant introduction of new and clever characters really keeps it interesting. These are brought in order for there problems to be solve so that Earl can cross them off his list and move on to helping the next guy. It is unclear if the plot was originally thought up to allow a new character almost every episode, but it is really to its benefit, and the viewers.",/review/rw2865797/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2022,Alb33,8," My Name is Earl
","A very solid show, much better than what is on today. A little edgy with good laughs in every episode for me. It is really a shame that the show never got the finish the right way.",/review/rw2865797/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2020,weareone1111,10," Great comedy!
","This, of all shows, deserves a renewal. I know time has passed, weight's been gained and age has set in, but it can be done. We would forgive what time does and enjoy the story for what it is. It ends on a cliffhanger, but the journey itself is well worth the karmic trip.",/review/rw2865797/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2005,cdb33,," good stuff
","This show was really funny. Jason Lee kills me any time anything comes out of his mouth in this show. His character is like Brodie from Mallrats all grown up. Ethan Slupe looks like he's shed a few pounds, but he's also GREAT in his role. These small town rednecks that everyone in town probably crosses the street when they see these 2 brothers walking their way on the same sidewalk. Wise cracks in true Lee style, with his goofy smile-almost as funny as the punchline to most of the jokes on the show. It's almost as good as if Kevin Smith himself directed & produced the show himself I hope this show continues to be as funny as the pilot & stays on the air for years and years to come.",/review/rw2865797/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2015,taylorkingston,8," A pretty enjoyable show...
","This show is pretty great. It's funny, it's got good characters and an awesome cast. And it just has a really great storyline. I do hate how they left us hanging after it got cancelled. It was a cliffhanger ending. I hate cliffhanger endings so much! I think all of the seasons are as enjoyable as each other, I don't really have a favorite.",/review/rw2865797/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2021,doriangray-34752,10," Greatly underrated awesome show. Definitely worth it
","This show is imho the best comedy ever made. The cast is absolutely brilliant. Every role is played to perfection. U can hardly tell they're not like that in real life. Sadly around the writers strikes the show was canceled. But I still watch it all again every now n then. Even tho the show is supposed to portray ignorance and stupidity, the punchlines are very sophisticated. I keep wondering how creative the writers were to be able to imagine how a stupid person would think and act. It's hilarious. S4 is a bit weaker but still enjoyable. Comparing the characters to the actors in real life would amaze you. They did very well. I always hoped they'd relaunch the show again but I think it was underrated and didn't get the attention it clearly deserved. I would definitely recommend watching this show. I promise you won't be disappointed. Some people tell me how they never rate anything 10/10. I disagree. It's like taking an exam. If you check every box correctly you get ur full mark. N this show did that n then some. The plot the cast the acting the writing the production it's all there to perfection. This is a must see. I never recommended this show to any of my friends and got a negative feedback. They all end up loving the show. As with every tv series I recommend watching a few episodes before judging it, this way you get to understand the complexity of the characters and start relating to them n understanding their methods and motivations.",/review/rw2865797/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2007,Rectangular_businessman,10," Hilarious and good spirited .
","It's very strange to find a show that isn't only hilarious but at the same time with lots of heart ,without being corny or cheesy . Well ,the show follows Eral ,a man that after a car accident realizes that he have to change his way to see life and he decide to repair all the bad things that he have done . That won't be easy ,because Earl used to be a thief and his little crimes affected the life of many people ,so will have to proof the world that he is now a better person . There was many moments of the show that made laugh a lot .The characters were original (like they were from a movie of the Coen Brothers ) and very likable and funny . This show was fantastic and it have many surprising moments .",/review/rw2865797/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2021,jsucie,10," Gone too soon
","With all these limited revivals of past tv shows, I truly wish someone would give this excellent show the same treatment. Even a wrap up movie would do and let us that followed this show get the closer that was deserved. Now I know that won't happen given that there was only 4 seasons and didn't last as long as other shows that have gotten revivals but that is the studio's fault. This was one of many shows that got axed during the 2008 financial crisis as a way to save money.",/review/rw2865797/?ref_=tt_urv
