6 October 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," Terrific!!
","I absolutely loved The Terminal List! It's hard to even describe how much better this show was than I was expecting. First of all, Chris Pratt was terrific as the lead. He proved that he can do more than comedy and action with this dramatic performance and how he continues to grow as an actor. Pratt shows once again why he's one of the biggest actors on the planet right now. I know this is a mini-series but there is plenty of ways they can make this into a few seasons worth of great television. This action packed thriller will keep your heart pounding and wanting to binge this as fast as you can. If you haven't seen this amazing show yet then do yourself a favor and go watch it as soon as possible!",/review/rw8310205/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,Supermanfan-13,9," Loved It!
","The Terminal List is an action packed thriller that will keep you at the edge of your seat throughout the entire series. It's absolutely loaded with star power led by Chris Pratt and also has incredible performances by the rest of this great cast including Taylor Kitsch, Riley Keough, Jai Courtney, Constance Wu, JD Pardo and Jeanine Tripplehorn just name a few. You don't get that kind of star power (especially Pratt) for a tv show unless you have a good show on your hands. This show is full of action but it's not a mindless action show, it has a good story that keeps you entertained throughout the show.",/review/rw8310205/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2022,loco_73,9," Un-Apologetically entertaining!
","This is the type of entertainment that used to get made on a fairly regular basis yesteryear. Not anymore. Shows like this one are far and few between these days. A show which doesn't preach, insult or attack it's audiences or tries to force-feed a specific message of anykind. It is a series that is unabashedly entertaining, interesting and a pleasure to watch start to finish. The themes and ideas of this show are woven into the storyline and plot points as well as the journey of the characters. No empty virtue signalling or moral grand-standing here.",/review/rw8310205/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2022,Nemesis42,9," Amazon outdoing Netflix.
","Prime isn't mucking around when it comes to hiring coherent creative ensembles for their projects. This is a terrifically well made story, expertly executed in all departments. The final twist was the only failure for me but you decide.",/review/rw8310205/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2022,deacon_blues-88632,9," WOW! We need more series like this!
","Awesome production value, cinematography, acting, writing, dialogue, and action sequences. I can't see any weak aspects, but I gave it a 9 just to be restrained. Could very easily been a 10! Maybe an actual specops person would be more critical, but that's not me. Loved every second of it! Sad it ever had to end!",/review/rw8310205/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2022,jon-22643,10," One of the best action-thrillers series I've seen in years
","It's almost perfect, and deserves a 10 thanks to the huge cast (lots of great actors), and amazing scenes, almost impossible to stop watching once you start it's that good. Great job by a pro production, tight story, the director and his team made a very good job and well as as the camera and technical team, reliable characters, and all actors as well as stunts are putting a lot of efforts, so the results is very powerful. It is very surprising to see Chris plays a serious role, no comedy no jokes, nothing is cheesy here, just painful, serious, cold character, and it's suits him so well that I wonder how it affect some of his next action roles, he can play a deep and dramatic character in thrillers. Must see, satisfaction guaranteed!",/review/rw8310205/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2022,DeadMansTrousers,9," Revenge is a dish best served by Chris Pratt
",Ignore the critics they have no idea what they are talking about. This is probably the best show I have streamed all year. I couldn't wait to watch the next episode and I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. I enjoyed seeing Chris Pratt in a serious role where he isn't constantly used as the comedic relief and he did a great job as such. This is a great entry in the revenge genre and I seriously recommend it if you are considering watching it.,/review/rw8310205/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2022,umrebel,9," Really Good Show! (Critics are predictably ignorable)
","This show is genuinely intriguing. For the first few episodes you are wondering what is real versus what is imagined by Reese because of his head trauma. But, this show is a good solid production. Exciting, dramatic, and even touching at times. It's despicable how much critics hate Chris Pratt IRL because he is vocal about traditional family values, and equally wrong that they bring that obvious animous into their reviews, rather than just giving an honest take on the quality of the show. When users en masse dislike a 'woke hot mess' of a show, critics are quick to call it review-bombing, but if they do the same thing to a great show because they don't like an actor IRL... perfectly fine? I highly recommend you watch this show, not only because it is genuinely good, but as a middle finger to critics who are incapable of keeping their political biases out of entertainment reviews. 93% user rating. Enough said. Enjoy!",/review/rw8310205/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2022,MoistMovies,8," Revenge and standard motives
","Seen some of this before, but the execution was very well done.",/review/rw8310205/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2022,jaimemedina-36288,9," It's goooood
","I'm usually not a Chris Pratt fan. I hated the idiotically named ""Tomorrow War"". But The Terminal List absolutely delivers. It's gritty and tense, violent and engaging. It rings ever so slightly like a Jack Ryan movie with threads of the Manchurian Candidate. It keeps you thinking and keeps you watching. Perfect weekend binge.",/review/rw8310205/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2022,ztigr,8," Really good. Not understanding critics.
","Don't worry, there are no politics here left or right. You'll definitely feel a bit conflicted about the protaganist at times, and wonder if he is going too far. There is particularly one scene on a beach that gives you pause. Its an engrossing thriller about a man that has nothing left to lose.",/review/rw8310205/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2022,bmiller59,10," Ohhhhh yea, I'm in
","If it's got Chris Pratt, it won't take much to get me to watch it. Not knowing anything about The Terminal List, written by Jack Carr I had to watch the first episode and now I'm moving on to episode #2. This is a great genre for Chris Pratt. He seems to alway embody a light hearted guy, but in this he's got an edge, and it works.",/review/rw8310205/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2022,ssvfolder-1,8," Some excellent action
","The only thing that had bothered me was the dark tone of the visuals. I get it that not every movie/show should look like unicorn had puked on it, but still it felt a bit too dark. Visually not storywise.",/review/rw8310205/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2022,sk-mckenzie,10," Powerful great thriller series
",Wow this beat my expectations as I a am a fan of the books and was not sure how this was going to be. It is really good - Pratt does an excellent job with the PTS and showing by his features and face the internal turmoil of loss and trauma. Production values are solid and the story is well paced and each episode makes me want more. Plus I buy into the whole premise of people needing to pay a price. This thriller is not for the faint of heart I highly recommend it. And for the book series the audible version is also excellent. I listen to it on long runs or hikes.,/review/rw8310205/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2022,iamjamalwhite,10," Easily thr best show on TV
","Read the book last month at the recommendation of a SEAL buddy, wow! And yes, the TV show does it justice. As a retired, career veteran, we notice the little things. This show gets those right. Pratt is a Sierra Hotel stud just like in the book. Just massively great! Must see TV. Hope it goes on through the whole series plus more!",/review/rw8310205/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2022,exoticcat,9," Well made series. Chris Pratt is awesome
",Love that he was properly trained for this role. Good actor. I recommend this series . The plot is well known nothing new but entertaining...............,/review/rw8310205/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2022,iconians,9," Excellent thriller
","I think it's fairly predictable, where a special OP goes bad and a survivor finds ones who blame. However, how it's executed that's the difference, which makes it enjoyable to watch.",/review/rw8310205/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2022,Blumanowar,9," Wow, this is very very good
","I never give 8 or 9 reviews but this series is fantastic. We'll written, full of action and Pratt is showing his best ever stuff here. Kitsch and others are very good as well. It's the best series I've seen in a few years and I watch them all lol. You definitely do not want to miss this series!!",/review/rw8310205/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2022,gavin-ferreiro,9," 8 Hours of Intense viewing
","You know when you have an early morning rise, say at 2.30 and you want to watch something so you haul out the stream and see what is good and then spend the next 8 freaking hours stuck to the TV as if it was a Lord of the Rigs (film) marathon.",/review/rw8310205/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2022,tarekali-19909,9," brooding, gripping modern warfare series
","Chris Pratt has delivered a brooding, gripping modern warfare series no less than the best from Rambo, Bourne and Tom Clancy. The underlying tragedy of special forces troops driven to breaking is well covered here, and it is no surprise that the powers seek even more insidious ways to turn men into machines. The struggle of Commander Reece is impressive, forging himself from incredible personal tragedy to a single-minded purpose of revenge and justice, using sheer willpower to overcome physical and tactical challenges with ease.",/review/rw8310205/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2022,murphy-77692,10," Loving it so far. 3 episodes in
",Chris Pratt does a hell of a job in this. I thought him being in comedy centric roles would throw it off for me but I was wrong. If you like violence and vengeance then this is the show for you.,/review/rw8310205/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2022,OneAnjel,9," Intense & entertaining
",This is a very fast-paced and intense series. I think it would be hard for some people to watch but a lot of people will really appreciate the attention to detail and the great acting.,/review/rw8310205/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2022,tgagovidigal,10," Great thriller
",If you like military thrillers don't miss this one.,/review/rw8310205/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2022,cscott2331,10," Yes please!! Pratt and Kitsch
","I enjoyed this series! Didn't read the books so I have no comparison there. I just know this had some really heavy hitters. I'm hoping this is what puts Kitsch back in the limelight, in a way that hasn't shown on him in a while! Because that's where he needs to be! I mean after ""Savages"" we should've seen him much much more than we have. I always l appreciated the comedic side of Pratt, but have really enjoyed him in these high octane rolls. He's really good at whatever he puts his mind to, I think. Constance Wu always shows up and shows out! Then Jai Courtney enters the picture along with Tripplehorn,Pardo, Vidal and so many more. Just an outstanding cast. I'm sure they could've gotten there in less that 8 hours, give or take a minute, but I never got bored. I was entrained and invested the entire time!",/review/rw8310205/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2022,jtags-84059,10," Awesome series
","I hardly give 10s but this series is worthy. I like how unabashedly gruesome it is with regard to how a vengeful person would behave, especially one that has seen and dealt a lot of violence as part of his job. Most movies/series nowadays try and suger coat how a person would behave and have him not go over the top when visiting violence upon his enemies but this one goes full on. Loved it!",/review/rw8310205/?ref_=tt_urv
