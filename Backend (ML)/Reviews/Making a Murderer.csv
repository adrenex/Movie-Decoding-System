26 November 2011,sngbrd39,," A loving take on the Muppets
","There are very few of us twenty-somethings who grew up without the Muppets. Between Sesame Street, Muppet Show reruns, and videocassettes of the various Muppet movies, we saw these guys all the time. We even had one or two theatrical releases of our own during the '90s. (My personal favorite of those is The Muppet Christmas Carol, which is still annual holiday viewing.) In recent years, since the very underwhelming Muppets from Space, we've seen them pop up now and again, mostly in similarly underwhelming TV projects and in short (yet hilarious!) YouTube videos. I am quite happy to say that, in this newest movie, the Muppets are back in a big way! ",/review/rw2639068/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2012,drqshadow-reviews,6," This Big-Hearted Revival Put a Big Smile on My Face
","Warm, charming and funny, just like the Muppets I remember from my childhood. I'm not often one for musicals, but this one - aided by the brilliant combination of fuzzy puppet singers and Flight of the Conchords composition - hits all the right notes. It's funny without nudging into blue territory, a talent that's becoming more scarce by the minute, with a heartwarming reunion storyline that slowly reintroduces the cast and reminds us why we grew to love them in the first place. Loaded with unexpected cameos and sly winks at the troupe's long history, it's clear that a lot of love went into the making of this picture; the screen positively resonates from beginning to end. Though I was hesitant to revisit this old territory at first, by the final act I was grinning warmly and nodding right along, utterly entranced.",/review/rw2639068/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2011,IllusionOfLife,10," The Most Sensational, Inspirational, Celebrational, Muppetational
","The Muppets is essentially flawless. I know this is a weird way to start a review, but I feel I should just forego formalities and cut to the chase. This year has been a fairly disappointing year for movies, but The Muppets just about makes up for it all by itself. It's an absolutely life-affirming tribute to beloved characters and memories that should have never been allowed to fade into obscurity, and if you care at all about movies you need to see this, as soon as possible.

24 November 2011,Chris_Pandolfi,5," Not Sensational, Inspirational, Celebrational, or Muppetational
","""The Muppets"" plays the music and lights the lights, but it's not sensational, inspirational, celebrational, or even muppetational, and that's the most disappointing thing of all. What we have are two movies vying for the same space, neither emerging victorious because they're not handled particularly well. On the one hand, we have a soppy, innocuous love story between Jason Segel and Amy Adams, which is occasionally interrupted by musical numbers that have plenty of singing and dancing but hardly any life. On the other hand, we have the Muppets themselves, which would be fine except that they're almost completely reduced to background scenery and aren't given anything much to do. For all the effort that was put into the sets, the costumes, the special effects, and of course the puppetry, the film lacks the imagination and heart that made most of the previous Muppet films so enjoyable.",/review/rw2639068/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2011,byrann_gowan,8," All you sceptics, have no fear! I was once like you, but the Muppets are here!!!
","For all of you who are wondering if this will even come close to capturing the magic of the original Muppet movie, I just have one thing to say to you: go see this movie!!!!! I was a little worried myself that this movie would not be great, but tonight, I gave it a chance. And I left with a smile on my face. :) The story is that Gary (Jason Segel), Mary (Amy Adams), and Walter (the new Muppet) decide to take a trip down to Los Angeles; Walter wants to see the Muppet studios, but Mary and Gary are going for their 10th year anniversary of dating. There, they discover the oil tycoon Tex Richman's (Chris Cooper) plan to tear down the Muppet theater. That's when they decide to get the Muppets gang back together, and to put on one last show to raise enough money to save the theater. I'll let you put two and two together now.",/review/rw2639068/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2011,D_Burke,9," Muppets, Welcome Back!
","It's difficult not to get swept up by the hype of the first theatrically-released Muppet movie in 12 years. The preview trailers have been going viral since this past summer, and the Muppets & their human co-stars have been hitting the talk show circuit like never before. Audiences who don't catch on to this Muppet fever will be missing a refreshingly entertaining movie.",/review/rw2639068/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2011,planktonrules,9," A whole lotta fun...
","I have a lot more respect for Jason Segal after seeing this film. Not only was he a good actor in support of the Muppets (which is pretty rare in their earlier films) but he also co-wrote and was an executive producer for the movie! Clearly, this must have been a labor of love for this ""Freaks and Geeks"" alumnus. Good job, Jason.",/review/rw2639068/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2011,neji107,9," The Greatest Possible Addition, and Tribute, to the Series
","The Muppets may quite possibly be one of the best movies of 2011. I don't just mean that as a fan. The Muppets had everything spot on â€“ it was clever, entertaining, adorable, heartwarming, and absolutely hilarious. The magical thing though is that The Muppets pleases everybody -- average moviegoers and Muppet purists alike, and that I believe is its greatest triumph. On one side is a modern comedy, chock full of hysterical celebrity cameos and pop culture references. And on the other side is a nostalgic throwback to the Muppets era. Those who remember the old series will unquestionably find delight in seeing their favorite puppets reunite for another big show, literally.",/review/rw2639068/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2011,moviemanMA,7," Food for the soul
","In Disney's major release for the holiday season, they went with an old stand by, the Muppets, in a film simply called The Muppets. It's a strange blend of humor, nostalgia, and satire. Here we meet Walter, who we know just by looking at him is a little bit different. He is, well, for lack of a better word, a Muppet. The only thing is he is a Muppet living in the real world, and not, I stress not, a member of the Muppet gang. At a very young age he fell under their spell, through television and video rentals. Walter's dream was to walk through the studio that his beloved Muppet's walked through. He gets his chance to meet them when his brother Gary (Jason Segel, who also co-wrote the script) takes his girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) to Los Angeles.",/review/rw2639068/?ref_=tt_urv

","""The Muppets"" is one of the most gleefully smashing movies of 2011. It's one of those pictures that is not only charming and clever, but does not smugly rub its accolades into the faces of the audience, so that they may just sit back and enjoy the show. Watching the picture with an auditorium full of persons from all ages and joining in with the unanimous laughter and cheers and shameless ear-to-ear grins was one of the great experiences that I have had in a movie theater. It's like one of those classic Broadway shows where even though you've seen it a dozen times and have a general idea of what to expect, you get never tired of. I personally loathe the idea of the Muppets ever disappearing from the screen. But never fear, this movie is proof that is not about to happen any time soon.",/review/rw2639068/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2011,liz-manashil,," See it.
","I wasn't raised on Barbie dolls, or cartoons. I wasn't in love with Duck Tales or The Secret of Nimh (in fact it scared me senseless), but I was raised to love The Muppets. Fozzie the Bear was a safe old friend who always cheered me up, Kermit was my sense of justice and reason, Miss Piggy was an exercise in the unrestrained Id, Gonzo was something I didn't and still don't understand, but he's blue and adorable! The Muppets are incredibly precious to me. And I just LUCKED out, because the newest Muppet movie was made by a fan who took all of that into account and made a film that just celebrated the glory of the Muppets. Sure there were moments of overkill, sure it sometimes got ridiculous, but The Muppets is about more than just the Muppets. It's about yearning for something pure; something innocent without patronizing its audience. This film was really clever, self aware with a great sense of humor with a giant heart. Definitely see it!",/review/rw2639068/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2011,DragoonKain,8," A heartfelt and hilarious tribute to The Muppets

25 February 2012,jboothmillard,8," The Muppets
","The last time we saw fuzzy puppet characters on the big screen was twelve years before this, when Gonzo found out his true origins, all that followed after that were television made specials and films, so it was wonderful to see that Disney were bringing us a brand new movie. Basically Walter (Peter Linz) is a puppet who lives with his human brother Gary (Forgetting Sarah Marshall's Jason Segel, also writing) in Smalltown, they watched The Muppet Show ever since they were young, and their love for them still continues as they have grown up. Gary is planning a vacation to Los Angeles, this is also a celebration of Gary's tenth anniversary with his girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams), she sometimes feels her boyfriend devotes more of his time to his brother than on their relationship. In L.A. the Muppet Theatre has become derelict, with a dull tour, so Walter sneaks into the old office of his idol, Kermit the Frog (Steve Whitmire), and he overhears Statler (Whitmire) and Waldorf (Dave Goelz) talking to oil magnate Tex Richman (Chris Cooper). They say that the Muppets can buy back the Theatre and studio if they can raise $10,000,000, but when they leave the room Richman and his cohorts Bobo the Bear (Bill Barretta) and Uncle Deadly (Matt Vogel) reveal their true intentions, to destroy the Muppet Theatre to drill for oil. With this knowledge, Walter, Gary and Mary go to Kermit's mansion to convince him that the Muppets need to reunite for a special television telethon to raise the money to save the Theatre, and even though Kermit is unsure due to so many years passing Walter says he should try. So they start the journey to get the rest of the gang back, wherever they are and whatever career or profession they are in now, and one by one they do eventually agree. Fozzie Bear (Eric Jacobson) was in a Muppet tribute band called The Moopets with a group of unconvincing impersonators, Gonzo the Great (Dave Goelz) had become a plumbing magnate with his own factory, and Animal (Jacobson) was in an anger management clinic, along with actor Jack Black, learning to resist his urge for drumming. In a montage the rest of the Muppets rejoin as well, with the Electric Mayhem - Dr. Teeth (Barretta), Sgt. Floyd Pepper (Vogel), Zoot (Goelz), Janice (David Rudman) and Scooter (Scooter), Dr. Bunsen Honeydew (Goelz) and his assistant Beaker (Whitmire), and Rowlf the dog (Barretta). Of course the last of the Muppets to be found is Miss Piggy (Jacobson), who in Pris, France working for Vogue as editor for plus-sized fashion, but her pride and remaining and feelings for Kermit forces her to refuse, so they are forced to replace her with an unconvincing impersonator, Miss Poogy (Rudman). The Muppets pitch their reunion telethon to several television networks, who all turn them down, and it is only after the sudden cancellation of a popular show the CDE network executive and Muppet fan Veronica Martin (Rashida Jones) gives them a two hour slot. The only condition is that they must find a celebrity guest, so while they try and find one they get started on repairing the old Muppet Theatre and rehearsing for the show. Soon enough Miss Piggy returns, forcing the mean Miss Poogy out, and Kermit asks Walter to perform on the broadcast night, but he has not found his talent, and meanwhile Gary realises that he has been neglecting Mary, after she is angry sight seeing alone, and he also forgot about their anniversary. They manage to get Jack Black on board, after kidnapping him, and the telethon gets underway, initially with no Theatre audience, but this does build, and telephone calls pledging thousands of dollars are flooding in, and Walter eventually feels brave to perform his talent, operatic whistling. Richman does try to ruin the telethon by turning off the power and stopping the money coming in, but it turns out that the pledge to raise $10,000,000 fails before the midnight deadline, they only raise $99,999.99. Kermit and the rest of the gang are forced to leave, and when they open the doors the streets are crowded with thousands of Muppet fans, and in the end they get the Theatre after Richman gets Gonzo's bowling ball on the head, Gary and Mary get engaged, Kermit and Miss Piggy reunite, and Walter joins the Muppets as one of them. Also starring Steve Whitmire as Rizzo, Link Hogthrob and The Newsman, Eric Jacobson as Sam Eagle, Dave Goelz as Beauregard, Bill Barretta as Swedish Chef and Pepe the Prawn, Matt Vogel as Camilla the chicken, Sweetums, Lew Zealand and Crazy Harry, Alan Arkin as Tour Guide, Bill Cobbs as Grandfather, Zach Galifianakis as Hobo Joe, The Hangover's Ken Jeong as 'Punch Teacher' Host, Jim Parsons as Human Walter, Sarah Silverman as Greeter, The Adjustment Bureau's Emily Blunt as Miss Piggy's Receptionist, Whoopi Goldberg, Selena Gomez, Foo Fighters' David Grohl as Animool, Neil Patrick Harris, Judd Hirsch, Mickey Rooney as Smalltown Resident and Jerry Nelson as Telethon Announcer. Segel is likable, Adams is adorable, Cooper is amusing as the nasty villain, new puppet character Walter is sweet, and of course Kermit, Miss Piggy, Gonzo, Fozzie, Animal and the rest of the Muppets are all the stars who still put a smile on your face. If you are a Muppet fan from their early beginnings, or even if were introduced them later in life, they are still as wonderful as before, and accompanied by great new songs and many celebrity cameos that you can spot, this is terrific viewing for both kids and adults combined, a fantastically fun family musical comedy. It won the Oscar for Best Song for ""Man or Muppet"". The Muppets were number 47 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!",/review/rw2639068/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2012,Beta_Gallinger,8," The triumphant return of the Muppets to the silver screen after over a decade
","The late Jim Henson's lovable Muppets have now been around for decades, entertaining people of all ages. I'm definitely far from the only one who can say that the world-famous puppet characters were a major part of my childhood, and I haven't been disappointed revisiting them after growing up. I didn't see this 2011 movie, simply titled ""The Muppets"", when it came into theatres late last year, but since I had seen all the previous theatrical Muppet movies, I was bound to see this one after it came into stores, hoping it would be a LOT better than 1999's ""Muppets from Space"", the only theatrical movie in the franchise that didn't impress me at all! Well, I've seen it twice this week, and can say I definitely got what I hoped for! ",/review/rw2639068/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2011,vikingrinn,," The Jason Segel & Walter Movie, featuring the Muppets...
","While the ""We Built This City"" number really stands out amongst a few others in capturing the essence of classic Muppets, overall Jason Segel and his puppet creation Walter simply wear out their welcome. Jason Segel (Gary) and Walter (Gary's 'brother') usurp/upstage and prevent the Muppets from rightfully ever taking center stage, as opposed to eventually settling in and complimenting Jim Henson's life work. At some point the film stopped being The Muppets and more so The Jason Segel & Walter Movie, featuring the Muppets. This awkwardly overbearing sentiment was cemented in one of the (borderline self congratulatory) final scenes of the film, where Segel's new 'reluctant' hero Walter is lifted up by the 'thankful' Muppets, the image on screen is brought to a still and framed in black and white...",/review/rw2639068/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2013,TheLittleSongbird,5," Rather underwhelming
","The Muppet Show, The Muppet Movie and The Great Muppet Caper are classics, Muppet Christmas Carol, Muppet Treasure Island and Muppets Take Manhatten are great, Muppets from Space was okay but disappointing compared to what came before it, It's a Very Muppet Christmas Movie and Letters from Santa were mediocre and Muppet Wizard of Oz was terrible. So as a fan of the Muppets of course I'd see this movie, and it was one of my most anticipated movies of the year. Sadly, it turned out to be one of my most disappointing. It does have good things. The movie does look good, it is well shot and with colourful scenery. The first 10 minutes were very moving, at this point I thought to myself now this is going to be a good movie with lots of heart. Walter was generally endearing for all his character flaws, allowing for some very sweet and heartfelt moments, and Chris Cooper was a funny and suitably nasty Scrooge-like villain, though the maniacal laughter was overdone. Animal had some funny moments, like with Jack Black, and two songs are good, if not on the same level as Rainbow Connection, First Time it Happens or Professional Pirate. Life is a Happy Song put a smile on my face and is very catchy and Man or Muppet was really quite poignant. The use of Rainbow Connection was also delightful, for a movie that felt too much like a Jason Segal vehicle it was lovely to have something to connect us to the Muppets we know and love.",/review/rw2639068/?ref_=tt_urv

","Before reading this review you should know that I've never watched a muppet movie, so this is the first one, nor the muppet show and that I've only watched the muppets on ""Sesame Street"". I would say that they're lovely and also that I enjoyed them. Well the thing is that I went to watch the movie to the movie theatre and I really thought it would be funny or at least as ""Sesame Street"". I went with my sisters and my mother, I really had good expectations. When the movie began and I was reading the credits I started to worry when I noticed that the movie had been written by Jason Segel. Then the movie began with that annoying puppet named Walter. At first sight the movie seemed boring and I said to myself ""Let's give it a chance, maybe it gets better when the muppets appear"". I was wrong because all the muppets appeared and the movie was still boring and ridiculous. I don't care what people think this movie is so boring, my mother and my sister fell asleep and I was almost about to and even my 9-year-old sister was kind of mad and bored. I really don't understand what you find funny or charming about the movie.",/review/rw2639068/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2014,Christopher_Reid,3," Terrible humour, tedious and predictable
","I was completely expecting to really enjoy this movie. The Muppets are awesome and funny, Jason Segel was in Forgetting Sarah Marshall which was very funny and Amy Adams is a cool, young actress. But the style of comedy in this movie was awful IMO. Obviously the plot and acting in this kind of movie are mediocre but that doesn't matter as long as it's entertaining and/or hilarious.

","Before the release of this movie the last time the Muppets had a theatrical release was way back in 1998 with Muppets From Space. Since then they have mostly stagnated with straight-to-DVD and TV movies. Someone at Disney reckoned a reboot was in order so now we have the unimaginatively-titled ""The Muppets"".
