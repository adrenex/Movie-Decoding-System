4 November 2021,classicsoncall,8," ""Well, now there's us..., and there's y'all.""
","I happen to belong to that school of thought that says I've never seen a Western I didn't like. As I come here for this review, ""The Harder They Fall"" only merits a 6.0 rating from over four thousand viewers, and that to me seems considerably on the low side. Although the film really doesn't break any new ground in the area of story telling, I did find it highly entertaining and enjoyable. As I read some of the more negative reviews, there seems to be a preponderance of those who can't accept the idea of black cowboys in the Old West, but even a modest internet search will reveal that there were plenty, many of them freed slaves who went West following the Civil War. And it's not like the concept has never been attempted before. As far back as the Thirties, there were a handful of all Black Western films starring Herb Jeffries as a singing cowboy who's voice sounded to me a lot like Gene Autry.",/review/rw7507039/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2021,eddie_baggins,4," Lots of style, not a lot of substance
","A distinctively different western that has style and swagger to burn, if you were to judge director Jeymes Samuel's first proper feature film The Harder They Fall on visuals and aesthetics alone it would go down as one of 2021's most impressive entries but sadly many other elements to Samuel's star-studded exercise don't stack up to much scrutiny.",/review/rw7507039/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2022,Leofwine_draca,5," Good for a single watch maybe
","If there's a problem with THE HARDER THEY FALL then it lies in the very familiarity of the plot, combined with a rather weak, going-through-the-motions kind of script. There's literally nothing here that hasn't been done a million times before, and done better to boot. The big sell is that this one has virtually an all-black cast, although for those of us versed in 1970s blaxploitation flicks that's nothing new. The cast don't make much of an impression here although Idris Elba is as charming as ever, even in a bad guy role. Otherwise, it's business as usual, good for a single watch maybe, but no more than that.",/review/rw7507039/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2021,Top_Dawg_Critic,6," Giddy up ya rasta tumbleweed bumba varmint claat
","Great casting and performances. Excellent sets, landscapes, costumes, shots and cinematography. But the 139 min runtime dragged on forever with the not-as-big plot, slow pacing and dragged out and unnecessary scenes. Then trying too hard to add the Tarantino flare was cringeworthy. The entire story lacked depth, and chose style over substance. Tons of action, bullets and blood, with a story that could've been told in 90 mins top. What was worse were the musical numbers and loud, overbearing and unfitting rasta music (for a wester?), something I'd expect from a B-movie. The ending was the only worthy act. Imo, it was a waste of amazing talent. It's a 6/10 from me.",/review/rw7507039/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2021,kevin_robbins,7," T his is a very well done movie that is entertaining and worth a viewing; however, it doesn't reach its full potential
",The Harder they Fall (2021) is a movie the wife and I recently watched on Netflix. The storyline follows a young man who suffered a horrific past when he whitenessed his parents murdered. When he discovers the man responsible recently escaped from jail he puts together a team to hunt him down and obtain revenge.,/review/rw7507039/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2021,lareval,8," Cooler than I expected
","Take it as it is: a terrific entertainment full of stars, charisma and pure fun. It took me by surprise, hooked from the very first cold blooded scene throughout and never let me down as a high budget Netflix film. So much fun!",/review/rw7507039/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2022,deloudelouvain,8," Great soundtrack, great actors and excellent cinematography.
","The Harder They Fall is something different than the classic western we're all used to. Almost the entire cast are black actors, which in itself is already quite extraordinary when you think about westerns. The truth is that there were a lot of black people in that time so the westerns we're used to see are not very believable. That said I would have been happier if there were more white people in this one, just to make it more believable, a fifty fifty would have been better. But it doesn't really matter, the movie is just more than good. And for that we have to thank the excellent cinematography, the very good acting, but most of all the weird but excellent soundtrack. The soundtrack is really something special, certainly for a western, where this kind of music doesn't seem natural. It made this western stand out from the rest, I really enjoyed that. The Harder They Fall is one of the better westerns I watched this year, something different but refreshing.",/review/rw7507039/?ref_=tt_urv

4 November 2021,efd-10467,2," So silly 2 is kind
","I enjoy a western, I didn't mind the use of black actors in every role (almost), I didn't mind the misplaced reggae music, the silly jokes, but the modern accents, modern vernacular, misplaced viewpoints and standards just make the whole thing silly, the gratuitous violence mixed with comedy, was too much.",/review/rw7507039/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2021,cliftonofun,7," Bad. Ass.
","This movie has so much style that substance is barely required. Yes, there were Black cowboys. Yes, these people existed. But this movie is mostly focused on (a) a ridiculously talented cast, (b) a familiar revenge tale, (c) amazing scenery/cinematography, (d) an absolutely banging soundtrack. By the end, you almost forget how whitewashed (and often boring) Westerns were for 100 years. It is big, bombastic, violent, unapologetic, and sexy as Hell. You may not love it, but you will 100% be entertained.",/review/rw7507039/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2021,faithless4734,5," The Harder to watch (or believe)
","Aside from the almost complete lack of anything that could be called reality. They way over did EVERYTHING in this show. In a horribly failed attempt to be ""tough"" or ""hard"" they went beyond those and became dense and thick. The acting was over the top bad complete with over acting under acting and plain old bad acting. The interaction between Love and Mary was unbelievable to say the least.",/review/rw7507039/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2021,Ed-Shullivan,8," I just love a good vindictive action filled western - It's now on my purchase list
","I was in the process of just putting our grandsons down to bed for the night when the film ""The Harder They Fall"" came on and I needed a good film to relax for the night and have a few cold beers. I have yet to see actor Idris Elba in a bad role ever, and this one is one of his finest. The film shows Idris's versatility and his machoism is in the forefront. When the townsfolk are out in the main street venting their frustration that their land may be taken from them out walks the slick ex convict Rufus Buck (Idris Elba) and you can just see the fear in the townsfolks eyes.",/review/rw7507039/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2021,nogodnomasters,8," From Bad to Badder
","This is a black western that opens up selling itself as a 70s grindhouse. The claim is the characters are real. The events are fictional. The sound track is modern. The film centers on Nat Love (Jonathan Majors) who as a child was marked by outlaw Rufus Buck (Idris Elba). Rufus murdered his parents. Long story short, they meet up again with a cast of characters.",/review/rw7507039/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2021,Tweekums,9," An impressive modern western
","As this western opens a reverend, his wife and their ten year old son are sitting down for dinner when a man, with associates, comes to the door. He clearly has a grudge to settle with the reverend. The woman then the reverend are gunned down before the man cuts the boy's forehead with a razor.",/review/rw7507039/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2021,wjosephjorob,8," Blood and Dirt
","A rousing fictitious tale from the west, straight up revenge story with a twist told from a modern perspective featuring a cast of excellent actors, I really didn't care about whether the cast was Black or the western was Black, I wanted to be entertained, and I received that in abundance, that to me is the most important aspect and I wanted to make that perfectly clear in this review,
the director took his inspiration in my opinion from a few of my favorite euro western directors Sergio Corbucci and Sergio Leone also with modern touches from Quentin Tarantino with the witty dialogue, I loved how aggressive the female lead actors were in this film, the secondary actors also stood out they did a solid job, the action scenes were well staged and executed, the soundtrack was also was good, Jonathan Majors, Idris Elba , Delroy Lindo, Regina King knock it out of the park, I want to see more Westerns like this in the future, told from a different view, a fresh look, a lot of the newer westerns look like they were shot in somebody's backyard and have atrocious actors, movie sets and costumes, the last decent pseudo-western I watched was Bone Tomahawk, revive this overlooked genre, there are many stories that could be told, this movie in my opinion is not to be missed, if you enjoy a good cowboy flick, well this is it.",/review/rw7507039/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2021,SenethavilayCasey,8," Don't Listen to the Haters, this is a Solid Western
","A black western that tries its best to be something special but falls just short in my opinion. Clearly inspired by Tarantino's Django, The Harder They Fall has some great action. It just doesn't quite have all the necessary elements of a truly great film. That being said, it's one of the best Netflix movies in recent memory. Worth the watch.",/review/rw7507039/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2021,Neptune165,4," Jamacan music.. does not even go with this type of period
","For a western. It's a joke and no reagee music doesn't fit at all in this movie looks like an Mtv production movie to be honest. This film was pretty bad. I
It had cheap looking sets, everything looked too clean and fake, and cringeworthy dialogue and performances. I couldn't get into this movie. I love westerns & think Idris Elba and team are some of the best actors out there right now. The plot was all over the place and it took a really long time to get going. I'd love to see a spinoff story specifically about Bass Reeves. My criticism on this movie was that it was too clean. Buildings looked like they came from disneyland... clothes looked way too pristine... and for westerns, i wish they captured more scenery, than close up shots. A crap film that wasted the talents of so many great actors... Jonathan Majors, LaKeith Stanfield and Idris are completely underutilised.",/review/rw7507039/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2021,trashgang,7," great start, great ending
",Original take on the western genre. The story is a pure revenge western style story o on that part no problem. The way it was shot is excellent too as was the editing.,/review/rw7507039/?ref_=tt_urv

5 November 2021,jaimemedina-36288,5," The dumber they are...
",So there's not a lot of IQ points going around in either gang both of which seem to plunge headlong into the fray with not a single thought in the brain. The whole movie would be just plain stupid if it wasn't for some truly great performances. The cast is great. But the rest feels a bit like a Guy Ritchie rip off to me.,/review/rw7507039/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2021,tlcgreggs,10," The cast and storyline are amazing! Can't please 'em all...
","The cowboys depicted, were all Black &/or Black /Native American... Nat Love, Bill Pickett, Cherokee Bill, Bass Reeves, Stagecoach Mary, Coffee, etc... do your research.... Way better than those BS John Wayne movies, and all the fake ass Native Americans and Black characters Whites portrayed and stole the identity of, over the years... Puuuhlease! This was a BAD-ASS Western made by Black people and is not blaxsploitation, just because there's an all Black leading cast. Billy the kid was no tougher than Black Cowboys, but he'll be portrayed in the movies as the baddest thing born since Cane & Able... FOH.... Anyone who doesn't like this movie, is either: A. More than likely not Black and 2. Feel uncomfortable with Black leads 3. Don't realize this is a loose fictional portrayal of life imitating art imitating life 4. Don't know Black History or what it means to be creative... No different than the Hateful Eight, The Kid, Deadwood, The Lone Ranger, Django, Tombstone, etc etc... Whatever. The cast was very entertaining and I look forward to more movie genres of all kinds that have more Black actors as leads, like this. That's my opinion, and I'm sticking to it. \m/(>¿<)\m/",/review/rw7507039/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2021,Luv2Spooge,1," As entertaining as watching my towel dry
","2 hrs of 20 mins of nonsense and stereotype. At least try to stick to the time period with the appropriate dialog. As others have said, a Django wannabe. I'd even say a cheap knock off of the Hateful 8.",/review/rw7507039/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2021,Nemesis42,3," Overly violent with a bad soundtrack.
","There's not much to like in this. Mean violence all the way through that tries to be 'cool'. It's trying to be Tarantino but doesn't have the humour or the wit. Also the soundtrack is grating and distracting. I was looking forward to a clever new western, but got this viscous thing in a glamorous fantasy setting. A few of the characters are interesting like 'Cuff' though that's it.",/review/rw7507039/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2021,bjcoleman35,5," Had higher hopes

3 November 2021,bbevis-47954,4," Some Style and Little Substance.
