","""The Suite Life of Zack and Cody"" is one of my favorite TV shows of all time. Yes, I said ""All time"" The characters in that TV Show are so awesome and lovable. I was expecting much the same from the spin-off series. I was satisfied, I guess...",/review/rw1960161/?ref_=tt_urv

","The show is amazing. The acting is really very good, the writing is great, and the look is very nice. The sets are pretty and the clothes are very cute. The story lines are captivating and the humor is impressive. The best show on Disney Channel.",/review/rw1960161/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2011,mrs-chatty,10," A successful spin-off
","I, like another member that posted, am not in the targeted age group for this type of show, but I loved it! I feel Suite Life both shows were really funny youthful shows. It was nice watching the boys grow-up on screen. Being that I love useless facts and statistics I love knowing where I have seen faces before. Amazingly enough I realized these were the little boy in Big Daddy. Wow on how old you seem when you remember seeing them as very young kids and now they are entering adulthood. I especially liked the closing; it was one that I enjoyed and felt that was relevant to the entire plot of the show. Few shows have had final episodes that were good and explained the future of the characters.(still mad at Seinfeld's ending)I will miss laughing at the characters antics. It was a wonderful show.",/review/rw1960161/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2010,brad_mcmillan,7," decent for Disney
","This show is my guilty little pleasure and I don't admit this to many people since I am 28 years old. No, I am not a creeper, I just enjoy the dynamic of the show and the twin's antics remind me of the stuff I used to do when I was younger. The show is sort of a nostalgic piece for me, a modern show of a more innocent time of moral family programming. Although my girlfriend despises the show and protests fiercely when she walks in and I am watching it, I find myself apathetic to he pleas. I guess I am just immature.",/review/rw1960161/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2008,gameusesonly,10," Very Good
","This is a great add on. I really liked the show before they made on deck. And even though they took out some of the good actors they got new ones which weren't so bad. Cole and Dylan still do a great job on the show and keep there character as if its not supposed to be new. London is still kinda funny but a little more retarded in my opinion. The new actors are alright, there's bailey who's a pretty good addition kind of funny and pretty much the (hot) girl of the show, and then there's Woody who is pretty crazy and like a wild card. I was a little worried at first that they had said the show was going to be completely different. But its the same old Zack and Cody and the other actors that moved on which really made me happy. I also want to point out that I am sure a majority of kids are watching the episodes on the computer and not the T.V. so there are a lot of viewers. The Beginning theme is pretty catchy, like the suite life. Sometimes the jokes can be corny and the laughing background clip is unnecessary. But the show mostly makes me laugh. KEEP THE EPISODES COMING!!",/review/rw1960161/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2010,sam_rox_xox,8," The Greek one
",i think that in the Greek one at the end when the are dancing they should really Greek dance not just walk.... i really enjoy the show i loved suite life of Zack and cody so this is just the same! Some parts are really funny and some are sad but the show is really good and i would like them to do some thing new tho it may be a good show but its always the same in a way they change it up but every episode has something the same in it.................................. the show should stay on and family should make it even better because some are getting bored but wont stop watching because it is some thing they like..,/review/rw1960161/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2008,christoph-l-reiter,7," Typical Disney show production ... great outcome!
","As with all Disney shows produced ""The Suite Life on Deck"" is a great show for kids and teens. The Sprouse brothers and the whole cast does a great job as well as the casting director by looking for guest stars and co-stars. As I already mentioned in the title - it is a typical Disney show production - so it is very likely that adults won't be tho thrilled with it. If you are not an adult in the entertainment business and watch it for the purpose to keep up with Disney and Nick style you have a real boring life. It is made for kids and teens and it is good. The show also, for adults maybe not so obvious, points out problems and issues of teenagers in our society. As it is with all shows and films it might be a bit overdone ... The show is obviously a bit campy - but in a good way - kids enjoy it watching fun and this is the only way to bring these issues closer to them. By observing the content and the plots we can filter out the issues of growing up teenage boys (also in some ways of girls) and the American issue of masculinity and femininity. Further we see the problems of school and leisure time and how it is supposed to look like in our society. Of course not everything in the show is great. It is not the most expensive production which of course takes away some of the quality. Some of the cast members from The Suite Life of Zack & Cody are not in this show. In some ways that's positive in some it is negative. Ashley Tisdale is missing to play the opposite of Brenda Song. Casting did a good job to find a substitute and therefore a new cast member with Debby Ryan. Still Tisdale is missing.",/review/rw1960161/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2008,wwehurricane1-1,10," Very funny! Good follow up!
","Just finished watching the premier episode. The show does have a different feel that the original, but is very funny. I won't give away any spoilers for those who haven't seen it yet, but so far, the show is off to a very good start. My honest opinion is that the first episode was funnier than most episodes of original and that's saying a lot.",/review/rw1960161/?ref_=tt_urv

","is great, very meal, I support that we can always do better but I like it as it is, Dylan and Cole do their job well and are fun, I have to do the series over the Internet (youtube) on Disney Channel of my country not to air this, I wish that it were and continue with its production which is fabulous.",/review/rw1960161/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2020,POIguy,10," Even better than the original
","When they announced the Suite Life was moving on Deck I was skeptical. Fortunately this show blew my expectations out of the water (pun intended) and was even better than the original! The antics were funny as ever, the cast extremely funny, and a pretty emotional ending considering how long Zack and Cody were on our television screens. If you loved the original, you'll like this even more.",/review/rw1960161/?ref_=tt_urv

","I think all of you are just afraid of change. Get real. The boys are older so it cant have the same plot line as the first. As a person gets older, they can't have the same adventures they had years before. Honestly, the twins are sixteen, not twelve anymore. The same dry and stooge-esquire humor is still there and to be frank, all of the characters are so comfortable in their roles its just a joy to watch them. And they didn't purposely get rid of Maddie, people move on. And sure Bailey isn't Maddie, but that's the point. She's Bailey, not Maddie. Stop being such snobs. Oh, AND this is a Spin off. It's not the original show. So the story is probably not going to be the same as the first series.",/review/rw1960161/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2020,careybrandon-41144,8," On a boat
","This is just about the exact same thing except the boys are older and they're on a boat. They even have some of the same characters along for the ride. It's not bad, it's just The sweet life 'On Deck'.",/review/rw1960161/?ref_=tt_urv

24 June 2010,brendonhull,9," Pretty Good
","London is dumber! Woody is somehow smarter than London, which I originally thought was impossible! But still pretty awesome!!! The episodes where characters of the original show (The Suite Life of Zack and Cody) were the worst, well, I kinda liked when Esteban (Julio Ricardo Montoya de la Rosa Ramirez) came on the show for that one episode. More inappropriate for the little kids, as it has some sexual reference (ex. Zack ripping off the girls shirt, and when Woody asks how they have a baby and their teacher says ""that's another class"", etc). I can see a PG13 to R rated theatre movie coming where there will probably be some sex and/or nudity (like girl on girl, Bailey on London). Anyway, I'll just stop talking about sex and just say 9/9, 4/5",/review/rw1960161/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2014,laurenblue2011,10," Brings your mood up
","I actually kind of enjoy this show. Its a guilty pleasure for me. I usually am not a fan of the Disney channel shows these days, but this one is just.... happy and nice. I struggle with depression, and this show surprisingly helps. When I get depressed, I like to watch TV to get my mind off things, but I don't like watching dramatic, or sad things when I'm in a depressed mood obviously. So, I turn to this show. It has stupid characters, and cheesy comedy, but I get a few laughs out of it sometimes. I think that the Sprouse twins are hilarious, surprisingly. They are super cute, and funny to watch. I mean, twins on TV are usually funny, but I really enjoy watching these Twins. Brenda Song is good for her role, London Tipton. She portrays her character as Stupid, Rich, Selfish, and mostly mean. You need a mean girl in every TV show though, right? Anyway, this show really just lifts up your mood, no matter how cheesy it is. If you enjoy Disney channel, then you will enjoy this show. Watch it when your sad, it brings up your mood.",/review/rw1960161/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2008,thedarkknight1984,1," The Sprouse Twins Can Do Better Than This!
","I like Dylan and Cole but honestly, the Sprouse twins can do better. The jokes are corny and terrible, London's stupidity is just plain annoying (is she mentally retarded or something?), Bailey is too sweet (made me want to throw up)... the only saving grace is Phil Lewis who plays Mr Moseby.",/review/rw1960161/?ref_=tt_urv

2 January 2013,junkmailstuff456,10," Amazing
","Most of Disney's shows are lame, and just not entertaining. I could watch this show all day long. This show is great for little kids, teenagers, and adults. The characters are funny, and I love how honest they are. They talk about things that I never would've thought Disney would have. They also have a lot of humor that you wouldn't believe they would say. The episode where Cody went to live with Monks, Woody makes a joke about a ""little dingy"" (a small rowboat). I just love how they aren't trying to shelter kids, and give them good jokes. Another reason why this show is so wonderful is how educational it is. They travel around the world, showing kids different heritages. I also love how good the characters are. They aren't bratty or snobby... well besides London ;) The characters are such good role models. I also love how they accept each other. All of the characters are so different, yet their good friends. London and Addison are airheads, Bailey and Cody are smart, Mr. Moseby and Ms. Tutweiler are great adult figures, Maya and Marcus are cool, and Zack and Woody are goofy. You can relate to all of them! Overall, this show is funny, educational, and just a wonderful show.",/review/rw1960161/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2010,kevinwilford,9," this show is 'suite'!
",i love both TSL. but this one gone better. new characters Bailey and Woody are really funny. cause we got the country girl and we got the slob. and the character Mr. Moseby gotten more grumpier...which is better!! the season 2 of the show gotten waaaay better cause now its in HD and the comedy gotten great and violence gotten violent and real! and also London gotten dumber and the dumber the better!! the thing that kinda bumps me is that Maddie isn't there anymore...i liked her on TSLOZAC...she was hilerious!!! but still the show is going strong!! so i put this show the 2th best show on Disney. hope the show will go for a 3th season!!!!,/review/rw1960161/?ref_=tt_urv

",As Disney plus came out not long ago in the uk I've dived back into watching my favourite shows (suite life being one of them) and I've realised how much I have missed watching it!

1 July 2010,SammyMitch,8," Good, but could have been better.

18 August 2009,Floated2,7," its alright
","when i first heard about this show is was a little excited and wondering how it would turn out. Well so far I've watched a lot of episodes (new and old) and the show is pretty good. It could be better and much more funnier. This show is different from ""the suite of life of zack and cody"" because the twins are grown up, they're new characters and they're on a bloodclat cruise..WOAH! The first few episodes i watched sucked and were lame, the jokes were not funny in the least bit but as i watched on, the show got better. The second season is great...The only real things that sucks about this show is the way London acts (shes more dumb than on suite life on zack and cody), and Woody (he's really annoying and stupid)",/review/rw1960161/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2013,meritcoba,1," The terror lives on: on sea
","A hotel became to small for the ambitions of the Sprouse brothers so they moved to the high seas. Except for the surroundings and some alterations in the cast nothing much has changed. The Sprouse brothers still lack any talent for acting, even after all these years. They need facial contractions to make the audience aware that they did something funny. Canned laughter is used again. The surrounding cast is acting on par or even worse as if that is possible. Plot consist of situations that are used and re-used. It doesn't matter. A bad series that shows that people can get away with.. badness. ",/review/rw1960161/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2008,slideon,3," Very Awful....but an Improvement
","The Suite Life of Zack and Cody is a very horribly produced show. The jokes are corny and constantly re-used, characters re-use these jokes all the time, and plots are re-used. This new series offers something new, but is till far from a good and watchable show. The only thing remotely funny in both these series is Phil Lewis, but the two blonde twins are unlikeable. But this time, there is this large kid with an afro who is so messed up, he is enjoyable. What annoys me the most is the stupid laugh track, obviously fake and there isn't any effort to make it sound real. There is a major improvement of the theme song, though! It's actually catchy this time. Overall, don't watch this show unless you're 3 - 6 years old.",/review/rw1960161/?ref_=tt_urv
