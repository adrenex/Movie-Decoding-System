3 October 2020,WatchAndSmile,10," Impossible to dislike!
","This show is amazing and sucks you in from the 1st episode. All characters are very unique and interesting and you come to like them all. Witty humor, smart dialogs and great script just keep it going.
It's one of my favorite shows and I wish there would be more seasons as so far there are only 2.",/review/rw7321249/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2019,nowego,9," A laugh a minute
",I was lucky enough to be able to binge watch all 6 episodes of the first series. The only disappointment was that there were only 6 episodes.,/review/rw7321249/?ref_=tt_urv

","Lovable characters, funny situations. Such a great show! Well done!",/review/rw7321249/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2019,Sleepin_Dragon,7," Totally enjoyable family fun.
","For me the fact that people are likening this to a seventies comedy series is good, a decade that brought us sitcoms that were actually funny, unlike most of what's produced nowadays. It is very much a mix of Rentaghost, Horrible Histories and from what I recall a show called Shadows.",/review/rw7321249/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2021,andymhancock,9," Surprised by all the negative reviews
","I thought it was entertaining. I couldn't understand the negative reviews. They compared it to other shows, but not ones I'm familiar with. Perhaps my bar is low, but if so, I am blissfully unaware of it.",/review/rw7321249/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2021,IonicBreezeMachine,10," One of my favorite TV comedies of recent years
","A young married couple, Alison (Charlotte Ritchie) and Mike (Kiell Smith-Bynoe), inherit a large countryside estate called Button House following the death of a distant great aunt on Alison's side of the family. However unbeknownst to the two, Button house is filled with all manner of ghosts ranging from pre-civilization cavemen to lecherous Members of Parliament who died in compromising fashion who are none too happy with the couple's intentions of turning Button House into a Bed & Breakfast and disturbing their peace and solitude. After Alison is push from a window by one of the ghosts and suffers massive head trauma, Alison finds she's able to see the Ghosts which leads to all manner of complications as Alison and Mike try to live side by side with the ghosts with comic friction aplenty.",/review/rw7321249/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2020,cherold,8," hilarious and goofy
","I loved this series about a young couple dealing with a mansion haunted by quirky ghosts from the start. It's so funny, and the actors do a great job in their eccentric roles. Me and my girlfriend binged through the first two season in no time and are eagerly awaiting the third. Hopefully in that one they'll finally give us Kitty's backstory!",/review/rw7321249/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2019,lyninbyron,10," BRILLIANT FUNNY QUIRKY FRESH ORIGINAL & VERY VERY ENTERTAINING !
","Absolutely captured me from the beginning, loved it!
I very rarely find what is packaged ""comedy"" to raise even a small titter out of me these days but Ghosts .....Haaa Haaa haaa. I was yukking it up and now I'm really sad it's finished. More please, and hurry up.
Congratulations to all involved. You are brilliantly talented !",/review/rw7321249/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2019,firballblaze-69689,9," This show is hilarious!
","So much better than American comedy. And yes I am American, but I hate crap like Seinfeld etc. this is actual comedy. Robin had me rolling LOL
This is well worth the watch. and as lurchjones stated, ""Ignore the sniffy reviews"" they all have sticks up their a$$es",/review/rw7321249/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2019,browndog181,8," Please keep this series alive
","If you like the classic good British humour, then this is worth watching.
Well directed, acted and produced.",/review/rw7321249/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2019,lurchjones,10," Ignore the sniffy reviews
",Passed the 6 laugh test easily in both episodes. My family and I are Horrible History fans and was made up with their latest artistic outing. Really funny enjoyable show.,/review/rw7321249/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2019,Jumbajookiba,10," Brilliant fun.
",Best new BBC comedy since Car Share. The Horrible Histories team have come up with an original and very funny comedy. Just what I needed after watching two episodes of the hyped up 'Fleabag' which is as funny as being charged Â£12 for a sandwich.,/review/rw7321249/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2019,garnet-30306,7," Hilarious ghosts.
","A venture into the hilarious side of ghosts haunting a country home, inherited by a couple who would like to turn it into something profitable. The problem is, the ghosts of the past has plans of their own.
And so, this is where chaos and mayhem begins !",/review/rw7321249/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2020,peterrichboy,7," Good clean fun
","From the Horrible Histories team comes a truly joyous half hour of mad cap entertainment. For those old enough to remember Rentaghost, the writers have struck a nice balance of silly childish humour and something adults can enjoy in equal measure. Which lets face it is something of a rarity these days. 7/10",/review/rw7321249/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2019,mikeross1966,10," Kept me in good spirits.
","Brilliant show, even my son laughs out loud and he's a miserable teen.
The plague victims in the cellar, experts on the boiler..Genius.",/review/rw7321249/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2019,kumkowskipaulina,10," My new favorite show!
","I am very picky with my tv shows. I also don't love shows set in the U.K. due to having a bit of difficulty making out certain words. I also don't leave reviews about TV shows till the season is over. However, with this show I had to make an exception so I could let the people that may be interested know that it is great. It is also hilarious. I find myself laughing out loud several times a episode and usually things aren't funny enough for me to even LOL! I have never heard of Charlotte Ritchie but her reactions to everything are on point and hilarious. I love this show so much , I would shout it on roof tops if I could. I don't feel there are many shows this good on tv and definitely not any that make me laugh , like this one does. It's clever and witty- go watch it!",/review/rw7321249/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2019,boggie4758,7," A good laugh all around....
",I gave this a 7.5 because it is just getting started and I will have to see more before I give more points. So far I laughed all through this 30 min episode and was wishing it was longer. I will put this on the same level as What We Do In the Shadows...off beat comedy....those ghosts were funny and silly and a great watch. I am hoping it stays silly with those crazy ghosts along with those unsuspecting two young people. I liked it and was a good laugh all around.,/review/rw7321249/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2019,staciarose20,8," Fun watch
",This show doesn't take itself too seriously. All the actors are good in their roles. I wonder if they will ever tell us why there are so many ghosts.,/review/rw7321249/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2020,ygwerin1,7," Button House
","This is a show that I have seen some of a while ago and trawling through TV channels, with nothing on them I decided to rewatch it.",/review/rw7321249/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2019,via-helena,10," Left me wanting more!
","Good little storyline, well scripted, well acted, good special effects, plenty of chuckles. Should appeal to age ranges 5 to 105. Hoping we'll get a second series?",/review/rw7321249/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2019,kath_in_cornwall,10," If you like Horrible Histories or Yonderland, you'll love Ghosts
","Great premise for a sit com, with ghosts from different periods of time 'living' together.
They Horrible Histories team is always funny, with well-written dialogue that makes me laugh out loud ""Dammit Fanny""!
So glad this has been commissioned for a second series.",/review/rw7321249/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2022,blankyblank,9," Simple comedy one situation at a time and it's great
","It's the cast of horrible histories and they're back at their old tricks. Are jokes simple - yes. Are they very entertaining - also yes. You have a bunch of stereotypical people from various time periods, they all have their typical quirks and they can't do much besides going through walls and annoying each other. They are still endearing. I've binged entire series in 3 days, time well spent. I don't even know what more to say, it's 30 minutes per episode, give it a try",/review/rw7321249/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2019,browndog181,8," After the first episode.....
","Ok, so I have only seen the first episode, but I enjoyed it as good old fashioned FAMILY comedy. The characters are quirky and I will be very interested to see how far this series goes.",/review/rw7321249/?ref_=tt_urv
