9 June 2013,StevePulaski,9," The obligation of growing up
","Is it fair to call Frances Ha a product of the mumblecore movement in cinema or is it all too, well, professional? Noah Baumbach's examination of culture, early adulthood, and obsessive friendships not only makes for a good, topical debate but a very worthy motion picture, as Frances Ha is one of the strongest films this year. Heavy on dialog, characterization, and the strong, stable topics to examine, this is a thoughtful mediation on what it means to grow up, stay true to your friends, and be self-reliant.",/review/rw3019973/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2013,ferguson-6,5," The Unbearable Lightness of Frances
","Greetings again from the darkness. All the critics are raving about it. Love abounds for the latest from director Noah Baumbach and his co-writer and leading lady Greta Gerwig. What makes my ambivalence even more confounding is that I'm a fan of Baumbach (The Squid and the Whale) and Gerwig (Greenberg). The expert level of filmmaking and acting is obvious, the script details and dialogue are exceptional, and the situations and setting are realistic. So why aren't I more excited about this one? That's what I've spent the past few days wondering.",/review/rw3019973/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2013,howard.schumann,9," Though Frances may be undateable, the film is unmissable
","Being called ""undateable"" is sort of like a team player being labeled ""uncoachable,"" not a strong recommendation. This label tags maturity-challenged Frances (Greta Gerwig) in Noah Baumbach's warm-hearted comedy Frances Ha, a film that has genuine affection for its characters. Co-written by Baumbach and Gerwig and supported by an eclectic soundtrack that includes music by French film composer Georges Delerue and the songs of David Bowie, Frances Ha (the title is explained in the film's final shot) is a film in which people talk and act like real human beings, not cardboard caricatures manipulated by a self-conscious script that ""strives for reality."" Though the film is full of light-hearted energy, it does not strain to be quirky or ""in your face."" It is clever because that's the way it is.",/review/rw3019973/?ref_=tt_urv

2 June 2013,nikicianciola-702-657633,6," Frances Hmmm...
","Can't really decide how I feel about this film. It was somewhat intriguing, beautifully shot (in black and white), and the lead character was perfectly cast. I love quirky characters in independent movies, but most of the time I couldn't decide if Frances was incredibly endearing or incredibly annoying. Immature, yes. Quirky, yes. Childlike, yes.",/review/rw3019973/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2013,evanston_dad,7," Dreaming the Impossible Dream
","I'm at a phase in my life where I generally have little patience for stories about adults who refuse to grow up. So I had some frustration with ""Frances Ha,"" in which Greta Gerwig plays a woman child who crashes with friends and sticks to her increasing unrealistic dream of being a dancer. But what saved ""Frances Ha"" for me was that I suspect Gerwig (who co-wrote the script with director Noah Baumbach) and Baumbach intend for us to be frustrated with Frances too. Life is a lot about compromise, and that's something that Frances won't accept until the film's end -- it's not all or nothing, and life can be satisfying without being a dream come true.",/review/rw3019973/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2018,MonsieurMS,," Eccentric and funny
","Bring out the adjectives--charming, quirky, funny, gentle. The cast is good, but Gerwig is terrific as the hapless dancer. She's likeable and pathetic at the same time. Everyone knows she is going to have a problem making it as a dancer, except her. This is her version of planning: she thinks about 10 minutes ahead. A sudden trip to Paris--but only 2 days, and then credit card debt. She doesn't seem to have a moment of fun there. ",/review/rw3019973/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2018,framptonhollis,9," noah baumbach becomes a much more cheerful man, and greta gerwig glows
","So much fun, so funny, so moving and beautiful and real. ""Frances Ha"" has gotten a few less than favorable reviews from folks on this very site, but I must strongly object to said reviews. Personally, this is just my kind of movie I guess. It's mostly plotless, episodically following the main character, Frances, as she struggles to make money and keep friends in NYC. It's very much in that classic indie movie mold of ""oft-romantically-involved, witty, well educated twentysomethings living their daily lives with plenty of comedy and drama to go around,"" but there really is something about ""Frances Ha"" that makes it so much more special than the average film that fits this formula. Basically, one of the very best things your independent film can have is a performance by the lovely and talented Greta Gerwig, particularly as your film's leading lady, and especially when she's playing a character as compelling as this. She is super likable in every single scene she's in, but she still makes a boatload of face palming mistakes throughout the course of the film, while still being so lovable that you can't help but be on her side. She's just such a wonderful character, and is played with so much genuine honesty and accuracy by Gerwig (probably partially because Gerwig herself acts a lot like this in real life considering her overall mood during interviews and (more triumphantly recently) award speeches) that this movie becomes so much fun to ""hang out"" with, sort of like ""American Graffiti"" or ""The Breakfast Club"" or ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" or ""Dazed and Confused"" (as well as ""Slacker"" and The ""Before"" Trilogy) or even ""Boogie Nights"" to a certain extent; these are all movies I love, and I am so very grateful that a film like ""Frances Ha"" can now join such a list!",/review/rw3019973/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2014,bob the moo,," Full of genre tropes but Gerwig delivers well to find a genuineness and engaging character in the core
","I like it when a film gives you early warning that you need to be in a certain mood to watch it and in the case of France Ha we get just such an opening. Two twenty-something woman goofing around in New York, play- fighting in the park, free-wheeling through the streets and generally not caring who sees or what others think. Being honest it is a beginning that put me on edge somewhat as I have seen too many films where carefree beautiful people seem to live an unaffordable life while also seeming to have no income and no worries other than the artistic/relationship/comedic/beautiful problems that they encounter on their way through the film. The start of the film makes it very clear that at very least this is the territory that we are in.",/review/rw3019973/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2014,dierregi,1," Vanity project of actress/director lovebirds and VIPs friends
","Frances is an ""apprentice"" dancer - which is hard to believe since she is very ungainly. Apart from ""dancing"" she never worked a real job in her life. Frances shares an apartment with BFF Sophie, in a sort of a ""celibate"" lesbian relationship (at least, from Frances' side).",/review/rw3019973/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2013,Turfseer,5," French New Wave tribute scores visually but its one-note protagonist and situations are less compelling
","Noah Baumbach co-wrote 'Frances Ha' with his current significant other, Greta Gerwig, the actress who plays the title role. It's Baumbach's take on a 27 year old aspiring dancer/choreographer who just can't seem to get herself together. Slate Magazine's Dane Stevens describes Frances as ""childlike and disorganized."" Stephen Holden of The Times has an even more prescient descriptor, describing Frances as one who operates under a sense of ""entitlement."" The film is shot in black and white and it reminds me of the 1962 French New Wave flick, 'Cleo from 5 to 7'. While 'Frances' is not filmed in real time like 'Cleo', it has the same feel: expansive shots of the care-free, largely self-absorbed protagonist, who prances about, highlighted by one urban backdrop after another. Baumbach clearly wants us to link his film to the spirit of the French New Wave, as he employs the famed French film composer, Georges Delerue, to provide much of the film's soundtrack.",/review/rw3019973/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2014,jackasstrange,8," The best film which Woody Allen never made
","Frances Ha is a very good film. And It's almost indisputable that Frances Ha resembles Woody Allen oldest works. The satire against the so-called intellectuals, the satire of a - perhaps ridicule aspect of society, that is the obsession with organization and patronizing, and the fact that the character - the protagonist - is an allegory, each one of these aspects are present in Frances Ha. Of course, there is some originality on here. The black and white choice, the occasional 80s beat which pops out of nowhere and ends fitting perfectly the scene, the great acting by Greta Gerwig - all of these are aspects which makes Frances Ha an unique film. And the dialogs are nothing like in Woody's films - sure about that. There is some surreal dark- humor on them, and adds to the uniqueness of the film in general. Overall, very well written, acted and directed. ",/review/rw3019973/?ref_=tt_urv

12 December 2018,miner-23176,8," beautiful.
","This movie is a sweet piece of art. Brilliant acting (Greta Gerwig is so into the character of Frances), excellent rhythm due to the fine/so accurate montage and very gentle touch of houmor at the right amount. The black and white gives to the whole movie a tone of shade which gives a nostalgic feeling. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry but above all it will bring you to the position to question your own motivations and choices in life and if fighting for your own goals is enough to finally make ends meet and come to balance with yourself. I really reccomend this movie and i'm happy that i discovered it.",/review/rw3019973/?ref_=tt_urv

","Not only is this a rip-off of the HBO's ""Girls,"" it's not even a good one...and I'm not that much of a fan of ""Girls."" In fact, Adam Driver from ""Girls"" is also in this movie! But if you like that show, you might like this (although I didn't). If you despise ""Girls,"" I can almost guarantee you won't like this movie. Unlikeable, spoiled characters throughout, with very little plot. Greta Gerwig is a disaster as Frances, and I think this is probably the last Noah Baumbach film I will be subjecting myself to.

20 November 2013,gwmdeclare,1," Ignorance is arrogant bliss.
","So, incidentally, Frances is an apprentice dancer for a professional dance company in NYC at the age of 27. This is absurdly out of touch with the realities of the dance world. If she were so fortunate to be associated with a professional dance company, she would have had to be focused and disciplined enough to endure a physical regimen that would have trumped all of this silly girl's petty indulgences. The movie is a fantasy about an ignorant and condescending, wannabe charmer who has no idea nor any interest in the art of dance or the daily struggles of anyone anywhere. Please, who cares what happens to this phony, self- indulgent poseur and her gang of narcissistic friends. No mention of the harsh realities that prevail outside her bubble world. A movie that inadvertently but perfectly indicts the superficial sensibilities of these spoiled children and the makers of this movie. Americans are pretty much reviled amongst much of Europe these days. Self-indulgent, destructive and oblivious certainly. Charming? In a word, no.",/review/rw3019973/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2014,3xHCCH,4," Open to Anybody's Interpretation

","Warning this review does contain spoilers! I really wanted to like ""Frances Ha"": after all it is an independent movie, right? Anymore, I wonder what kind of weight the term ""independent"" carries at least in the realm of movie-dom. This was the second movie that my friend and I saw that evening so we chose ""Frances"" because it seemed like lighter fair from the spy movie we saw earlier. My friend found the film mediocre at best, my criticism was much more harsh.",/review/rw3019973/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2013,Sergeant_Tibbs,6," Consistency mildly irritating.
","A festival favourite last year, Frances Ha quickly earned a reputation for being Noah Baumbach's best yet and feeling like Wes Anderson plus Woody Allen. With those two filmmakers in mind, I couldn't have been more excited for it. I quite like Baumbach too, he's a welcome addition to the writing team with Wes Anderson's films, The Squid and The Whale is a great film and while Greenberg is only good, Greta Gerwig was a total highlight. He has an interesting quiet sense of drama that I can sometimes really connect to. However, Frances Ha was incredibly disappointing. Consistently mildly irritating is the phrase I'd use. It's far too in the middle, rarely approaching dramatic extremities. I didn't connect or empathise with Frances as she had very little at stake and little to do in general.",/review/rw3019973/?ref_=tt_urv

We ended up seeing it because Blue Jasmine wasn't showing anymore, which seemed like a natural choice since Frances Ha was being touted as a a'modern Woody Allen-movie' http://goo.gl/0sHCY2 (which in itself is a stupid classification since many of Allen's movies are timeless, but whatever).",/review/rw3019973/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2018,gbill-74877,8," A cross between Girls and French New Wave
","This felt a little like a cross between the TV series Girls and a French New Wave film, updated for this generation. Its strength is in showing the bad decisions and social awkwardness of its main character (Greta Gerwig) in shameless ways, and though it teeters at times just along the edge of being vapid, it remains interesting throughout. There are several funny moments and some interesting themes explored here: 'becoming a responsible adult', differences in class, trying to find one's path, and friends drifting in different directions after college. What a sweet moment it is when Gerwig catches the eye of her friend (Mickey Sumner) after what she's said earlier about she wants out of someone she loves. I also loved the bit with her name not quite fitting into the postal box window, a nice touch that seems to capture non-conformity, how things aren't always perfect, and that we carry on as best we can.",/review/rw3019973/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2014,TheMarwood,3," Be afraid, be very afraid
","I hate Frances Ha. There I said it. I hate the movie, but I really hate the character. She's supposed to be cute and quirky, but I found her a deranged simpleton. A monstrous creature with an equally annoying and self centered friend. Greta Gerwig is basically just playing an extension to her Greenberg character, but without Ben Stiller yelling at her about how stupid she is. There's usually much to admire and enjoy in Noah Baumbach films, but here this is just a meandering film trying to float by on Gerwig's charms and I found this difficult to sit through. The issue I have is that Baumbach is clearly in love with the character -- sure she has her flaws, but the film wants us to love her back and I find her and the film grating.",/review/rw3019973/?ref_=tt_urv
