26 December 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,7," Fun, but not as good as the first one.
","The casting and performances by all were outstanding, especially Bautista and Norton, and I really liked the setting in Greece, but I feel the ending ruined what could've been a better sequel. There certainly was some creative ideas in the narrative, and even though the start was slow and tedious, it did get better when Benoit Blanc started to unravel the mystery. However, the unravelling was too as-a-matter-of-factly and too convenient in its set-up. And normally I'd be fine with that, because the few twists were a nice touch, but then right after the mystery was solved, the ridiculous antics just became too unbelievable and quite frankly, unnecessary. Still, and enjoyable one-time watch, especially if you enjoyed the first one.",/review/rw8693095/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2023,Tweetienator,5," A Step Back
","I liked the first Knives Out a lot because it felt like a warm homage to all those Agatha Christie novels that I like (books and movies): it got an interesting case and setting, a well playing cast, a fine production. Glass Onion is a little different - the story/crime is for
sure not that interesting or complex and there is a far stronger emphasis on comedy. One could dare to say that Glass Onion is more of a parody than a ""real"" crime case. The first movie got a straight 8, this one, did entertain me too (despite some lengthy parts) - but compared to the first movie, Glass Onion is for sure a big step in the wrong direction (for my taste) - it reminds me a lot of those mediocre attempts of Kenneth Brannagh's to revive Hercule Poirot. Also I do not like the ending at all, too a certain degree it is just a stupid one. Hopefully, the next one focuses again more on a complex crime case and its build up and last but not least, a real interesting and surprising ending like the first one got.",/review/rw8693095/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2022,Leofwine_draca,3," Not one for mystery fans
","As a mystery lover, this one disappointed me. The first movie, KNIVES OUT, was a reasonable reworking of the murder mystery genre but this one merely copies that and forget to be a mystery in its own right. It instead becomes an open satire of the mega rich and a certain Twitter-owning individual in particular, which is fine, but I couldn't help but feel this was missold. The first half is enjoyable, Craig's broad performance in particular a hoot, but then we start breaking all of the rules and overflowing with cliches. There's an excruciating fifty-minute flashback, a cheesy twin twist, and even the old saved-by-a-bullet-hitting-something-in-their-pocket moment, which I openly groaned at. As for the mindlessly destructive climax, is this the best they could come up with?",/review/rw8693095/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2022,eve_dolluk,5," It was written on a napkin
","After the first Knives Out I was expecting better than this. As Benoit pointed out the whole thing is stupid. Ironic really, i mean was that what this was supposed to be ?? A big fat Ironic slap in the face.",/review/rw8693095/?ref_=tt_urv

31 December 2022,levybob,2," What's Wrong With Me?
","I feel as though there's something 'wrong' with me. So many people I know, and respect, DID truly enjoy 'Glass Onion'. But for me, this film was so over-the-top that I continually felt as though I were watching a TV sit-com or vaudeville show. That, not a film during which several central characters actually are murdered. And a murderer must be uncovered.",/review/rw8693095/?ref_=tt_urv

23 November 2022,wd-8,6," I really wanted to like this
","I really wanted to like this, but the direction was lacklustre. When you have a very complicated plot, then editing, pacing and direction are critical. This is not nearly as much fun as the first Knives Out, and the dialogue is strained. The players try very hard, but it's all a jumble of dialogue and information with no time to enjoy the puzzle. It might be better second time around, so I will watch on tv in a couple of months.",/review/rw8693095/?ref_=tt_urv

23 December 2022,AJ_McAninch,2," The Decline of Western Filmmaking
","Put an A-List cast in a film with bad writing, give them a poor director who elicits wooden acting, make the whole thing boring and predictable, then nominate this mess for a bunch of awards-and you have another clumsy, dull, ghastly product from the dying west. Beginning in the opening scene, this is one of the worst movies ever made, and the fact it still gets rave reviews here and nominations out there makes this decline complete. There are far better films and series coming from international filmmaking today. I miss great moviemaking from Hollywood-the classics going back over a hundred years. But we have forgotten how to make great movies, and audiences have forgotten what they even are. Good grief this is awful.",/review/rw8693095/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2022,robertasmith,4," Utter rubbish
","In my criticism of the first knives out movie I questioned the silly accent of Daniel Craig and the mediocre acting. It's a masterpiece compared to this crock. Ed Norton is completely OTT, Kate Hudson proves yet again that she is a poor actor, at best, and Daniel Craig should be ashamed at taking the money. The rest of the cast try hard but either don't have the skills or were handed awful scripts and parts.",/review/rw8693095/?ref_=tt_urv

24 December 2022,li0904426,4," Absolutely nothing original!!!
","The movie ""Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery"" has a good premise but lacks originality and personality. The film is simply similar to any mystery movie based on the works of Agatha Christie. Even Daniel Craig's character Benoit Blanc is a low copy of Hercule Poirot. It's a good premise because it updates the characters to current times, parodying some current celebrities. The film is about a group of old friends who are invited to a private island for the weekend to participate in a fictional game of murder. The problem is that all the guests have enough motives to murder the millionaire friend who owns the island. The surprise is that the most famous detective in the world is also unexpectedly invited. As you can see, nothing original.",/review/rw8693095/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2022,MamadNobari97,6," Decent Start, Interesting Middle, Baffling Ending, Another ""Netflix Movie""
","So let me start by saying that I really enjoyed watching this movie until that ending happened. The movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes and not one minute of it is boring, so it's enjoyable - nearly - through and through.",/review/rw8693095/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2022,ericgoldberg-50159,3," Convoluted Mess
",This movie is trying desperately to be like the movie Clue and completely misses the mark. At least Clue is funny. This is stupid. It is visually nice but intellectually inferior. Its plot is more convoluted and hard to follow than Clue could ever be. There are some scarce moments of something interesting but that's nowhere near enough to save this trainwreck. Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc is such a caricature of Sherlock Holmes that he's hard to take seriously. Dave Bautista can't act if his life depended on it. Kate Hudson acted like an absolute idiot. This movie is supposed to be taken seriously but it's impossible to with the goofy acting and ridiculous plot. The first Knives Out was great. This is as dead as a murdered corpse.,/review/rw8693095/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2022,killercola,2," It's a Netflix movie, what did you expect?
","I watched it in three parts because I was so utterly bored and hoping each time I came back it would get better. It didn't. Terrible cast, acting, writing, story progression with no clear purpose. I could find no good reason to recommend this movie to anyone. Just a bunch of one liner cringe acting scripted type crap. Netflix just can't seem to do anything right anymore. I feel bad for the people that actually paid to watch this crap in a theater. Like a slow moving tortoise with no direction. Trust me on this one, skip this. There is no story value, no entertainment value and it's just a mess from top to bottom. Major disappointment.",/review/rw8693095/?ref_=tt_urv

30 November 2022,grumpy-3,1," a huge let down
","I really like the first one even on a second viewing, was so looking foreward to this. But my oh my what a total let down and a truly boring predictable film with the exception of the two main character benoilt and andy the rest of the people in this film were not just horrible people but boring people, they all acted way over the top especially kate hudson who never stopped whooping and shouting nothings. I knew who it was and why it was within the first twetny minutes, and it all played out as to how i imagined it, the script and story were just too lazy, banal and served no purpose; also the level of cast apart from Craig was nowhere near that of the first one, cannot believe how easily yet again the critics and quite a few audience are going for this drivel.",/review/rw8693095/?ref_=tt_urv

3 January 2023,Semisonic,6," Just a big buzz train going nowhere
","""Fake it till you make it"", this has become a definitive principle for everyone who wants to become big these days. And it looks like seldom do people have moral torments caused by faking. As for making, it doesn't come easy even to those who are more than willing to sell their integrity. The story of Theranos was a recent example of that.",/review/rw8693095/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2022,eabra48463,4," Moderately Entertaining but Nowhere Near Knives Out
","While ""Glass Onion"" is visually dynamic with good pacing and a compelling plot line, it simply doesn't match the total package provided in its original, ""Knives Out."" In fact, being associated with the well-written and directed first version is a big part of the problem. If ""Glass Onion"" were released as its own film with no association to KO, it might be better accepted. ""Knives Out"" was a reasonably realistic story with well-defined characters we identified with very quickly, which helped draw the audience into the film. It used dry humor and wit to drive home its points. ""Glass Onion,"" in contrast, is based upon an absurd, convoluted and childish plot that would be more appropriate in a superhero movie than an adult mystery. It is entirely unbelievable by any stretch of the imagination. The characters in this film don't use snappy dialogue and sharp retorts, they scream obnoxious and idiotic nonsense as if noise is supposed to make up for lack of a meaningful script. The cast of ""Knives Out"" was well-chosen, displaying chemistry with each other and the audience throughout its run time. In GO, chemistry between the players is absent; even Daniel Craig's inspector portrayal is reduced to a caricature in this sequel. ""Glass Onion"" is not an absolute disaster. It works as pass-the-time entertainment, offering enough visual stimulation to hold our attention. In the end, though, it's a loud, over-the-top hollow shell surrounded by pretty packaging and bows.",/review/rw8693095/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2022,FeastMode,7," Super clever and highly entertaining until...
","Glass Onion is a side-quel to the awesome mystery Knives Out. I found it to be super clever and highly entertaining. It has so many cool ideas. The comedy is a huge step up from the original. I full-volume laughed numerous times, as did my audience.",/review/rw8693095/?ref_=tt_urv
