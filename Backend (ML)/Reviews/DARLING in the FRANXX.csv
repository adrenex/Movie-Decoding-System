27 January 2020,anast555,10," Not worth watching since the second season has been cancelled.
","I started watching this show without any expectations since i didn't like Pretty little liars, and I was actually surprised in a positive way. The acting was much better than pll and the plot had enough mystery without all the
unnecessary drama that happened on pll.",/review/rw5134396/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2019,itsactuallyamanda,9," The Reboot/Sequel PLL Fans Needed!
","Wow. Just wow. PLL: The Perfectionists is the reboot us PLL fans needed! The drama, the love, the action is simply perfection and this is for sure so far, topping and beating the original. LOVE THIS SHOW.",/review/rw5134396/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2019,hnt_dnl,9," Welcome surprise
","For whatever reason, I was quite looking forward to this PERFECTIONISTS spinoff of ""Pretty Little Liars"". I had tapped out on PLL somewhere around Season 6. It felt like dragging out drama for the sake of it. Honestly, in retrospect, it felt like they were just making stuff up from Season 2 onwards. It's like the Dr. Pepper commercial ""I'm an A, she's an A, he's an A, we're an A, wouldn't you like be an A, too?"" It become too convoluted after a while. Of course I re-visited the show in the finale to find out who the true A really was. Yeah, not worth the wait.",/review/rw5134396/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2019,bregund,4," I don't see it lasting more than one season
","I admit it, I was a huge fan of PLL, I watched every single episode of a show that was intended for teenage girls, there I said it. The ending of PLL wasn't that good but it was all about the journey, and what a ride it was. I was never bored, and watching alliances form and dissolve over the years, and the rotating cast of villains and heroes, was all done with the finesse of a skilled juggler. It wasn't the greatest tv show ever, but boy was it suspenseful, and every episode featured a mystery within a mystery.",/review/rw5134396/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2019,smithfanthony,9," Surprising
","The Perfectionist was surprisingly better than expected and I already expected a lot from it. They didn't take Mona's insanity away, they kept Allison's past a big part of her narrative and they brought in new characters that are very different from the original PLL cast all whilst making us feel like we've known them for a long time.",/review/rw5134396/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2019,phd_travel,9," So happy to have a sequel
","More grown up things are going on. It's college. Alison is a teacher, Mona is in admissions. That's all that comes over from PLL. The production looks beautiful. The mood and atmosphere are so welcome.",/review/rw5134396/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2021,cjonesas,6," [6.5] Biggest fears...
","A nice shallow show with good acting, some interesting twists and turns, but as deep as a puddle. In the end, they fed us with a cliffhanger that never happened; never wrapped up.",/review/rw5134396/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2019,r-i-p_333,7," Interesting but flawed
","Let me begin by saying I've never watched Pretty Little Liars so going into this show, it was completely new to me. I hadn't even heard about it until today and I thought I'd give it a chance. Like every teen-drama based show, the pilot has several moments that had me rolling my eyes but when the episode focused on the main story, that's when it shined. There's definitely potential here for the show to be a really interesting mystery-drama show rather than just a typical teen-drama. The characters are all quite interesting and they all have something to hide which makes them complicated at times. By the looks of it, the pilot does reference Pretty Little Liars a fair bit and when it did that, I found it hard to keep track. This is an issue that several spin-off shows have, the show needs not to rely on the original series otherwise there will be people who'll feel like they're missing something. The actors are all pretty decent, Sarah Pieterse in particular is quite good and I can see her doing even better with a better script. The script isn't the strongest link of the pilot, hopefully this is something they focus on improving but as of right now, it's not too good. The overall story is intriguing and the twist at the end of the pilot definitely had me curious as to what comes next.",/review/rw5134396/?ref_=tt_urv

23 March 2019,jgkamunye-02794,8," Hmm..seems interesting
","After the awful pll series finale, I thought the sequel would obviously suck but the reboot's premiere seems interesting. Let's see how it goes from here. What I like from it is the fresh storyline and characters who are likable using the same pll tone.",/review/rw5134396/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2019,helenatentoma,6," Zero chemistry
","This series could have been SO amazing, had it followed the exact path of the book! I mean, the book was so good, I think I liked these ''series'' even better than PLL! But, unfortunately, they chosed a different way and it kind of sucks. I am going to give it a shot because of sentimental reasons, but if something doesn't radically change in the next episodes (e.g this LAME chemistry between the main characters), I am sure we won't have a second season.",/review/rw5134396/?ref_=tt_urv

21 March 2019,kcrocket131,7," Promising
","The pilot gives us a taste of what is to come. There are high expectations for any PLL fan. Creator Marlene King smoothly integrates characters Alison and Mona into the new setting of Beacon Heights. A gorgeous setting punctuated by the beautiful scenery of Portland Oregon.
Kelly Rutherford (Gossip Girl/Melrose Place) shows up to bring a level of sophistication to the proceedings. New PLL Sofia Carson stands out as the composed yet wounded Ava. The show brings a darker more mature sensibility than the predecessor's early episodes.",/review/rw5134396/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2019,Magow-Intermean,10," Pretty Little Liars: The Perfectionists Review
","Based on the book series from Sara Shepard, the Pretty Little Liars: The Perfectionists TV show comes from creator I. Marlene King. The spinoff features the return of Pretty Little Liars original cast members Sasha Pieterse as Alison and Janel Parrish as Mona. The series unfolds at Beacon Heights University and the surrounding town for which it was named. Everything is always perfect in Beacon Heights - at least it is supposed to be, but that very drive for perfection has deadly consequences. The story centers on three college friends - Ava (Carson), Caitlin (Park), and Dylan (Brown) - known as the Perfectionists. A trendsetting blogger, Ava has designs on being known as a fashionista. Caitlin is the daughter of two ideal mothers and intends to live up to the standard they've set. A type-A personality, she aspires to serve in the Senate. Dylan, meanwhile, is a talented cellist. Now that he's shaken off the dust of his judgmental small hometown, he intends to succeed at everything he tries. He is as devoted to his boyfriend as he is to music. Then there is the matriarch of a powerful Beacon Heights family, Claire Hotchkiss (Rutherford), responsible for founding Hotchkiss Industries and the university. She too strives for perfection at any cost. When the town's high-pressured environment proves too much, someone loses it and kills someone. After the first ever murder in Beacon Heights, although they work together to solve the mystery, each Perfectionist hides behind ""a secret, a lie, and an alibi.",/review/rw5134396/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2019,trishee,2," Not very good
","First off the acting is terrible. Except Kelly Rutherford...she's alway good. And the ladies from PLL is not bad, because I am used to them. I loved PLL, I was a fan. But this show is sort of irritating. The young actress's are terrible or it's the storyline. Not sure.",/review/rw5134396/?ref_=tt_urv

23 March 2019,agus-spd,2," Not again
","PLL used to be good. First seasons of the show were real good... mystery, good characters, and a pretty strong, believable plot. When they announced Sofia Carson was joining I decided to give The Perfectionists a shot. Wrong decision. Taylor's storyline is just so predictable. And all those people watching everything that happens everywhere on the campus? Too far fetched and absolutely out of tone. They should try and focus on the REALISTIC part of the stories and stop ruining the franchise",/review/rw5134396/?ref_=tt_urv
