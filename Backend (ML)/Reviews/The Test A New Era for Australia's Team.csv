4 June 2011,dee.reid,10," One of the greatest-ever animated superhero shows!
","It's been a while since I last watched ""X-Men,"" the animated series from the early 1990s, but I do remember that this is/was one of the greatest comic book superhero shows I ever watched during my childhood. I was a reader of the Stan Lee-/Jack Kirby-co-created X-Men comics for Marvel Comics as a child - along with Spider-Man, who remains my favorite superhero, and the two Marvel Comics titles formed the cornerstone of my fascination with comic book superheroes. The ""X-Men"" titles struck a personal chord with me as I got older because of how its world re-defined people's hatreds and prejudices against each other to accommodate people with mutant powers being discriminated against by the powers-that-be. Being a black American, I instantly related to the plight of the X-Men and any other mutant character who was the target of those who ultimately wished the destruction of anyone with mutant powers. That was ultimately the greatest element about the comics, and this incredible animated series. It's the reason why I grew to deeply appreciate Marvel Comics more than any other comic book publisher in the industry. ""X-Men,"" ""Spider-Man: The Animated Series,"" and ""Batman: The Animated Series"" were all the reasons why during the early '90s, I loved comic book superhero cartoon shows.",/review/rw2674328/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2012,TheLittleSongbird,10," One of my favourite shows as a kid and still is
","I love everything about X Men. The animation is very detailed and atmospheric, and the character designs especially with Wolverine are quite sophisticated for the time. The action sequences, which never suspended disbelief and had some wondrous elements for kids and adults alike to savour, have a lot of fluidity in that regard. The music is wonderful as well, the intro is one of the coolest of any animated series of the 90s(and there were a lot) and the background scoring manages to be beautiful and haunting. The writing is intelligent, sometimes affecting and sometimes humorous, though any sense of conflicting emotions are equally convincing, while the story lines are daring and always interesting and the characters right from charismatic Wolverine, sexy Rogue to the appropriately antagonistic villains are very well-written and likable. The voice acting is always expressive and never felt stereotypical, bland or overdone. In conclusion, a superb series. 10/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2674328/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 1999,Chiron1987,," Earnest Adaptation of Classic Marvel Comic
","The X-Men animated series was a terrific try at bringing the ultra-popular comic book featuring mutant outcasts to the small screen.  While the animation was amateurish and choppy at best, the voice over work was a particularly wonderful highlight.  The stories were re-hashes of the plots from the comics' 30+ years in publication, and a few standouts included the Phoenix Saga, and its follow-up featuring the reconciliation between Scott Summers, alias Cyclops, and his father, the interstellar pirate/freedom fighter, Corsair.",/review/rw2674328/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 1999,Havoc1,," One of the best cartoons to grace television
","The X-Men Animated Series was great, hands down.  Sure, it wasn't the comic -- and yes, the X-Men lineup stayed the same through all six seasons... but it handelled very well.  In some ways I wish the comic could have been more concise like the Animated Series was.  Some guest characters (Dazzler, my favourite X-Man, for one) weren't portrayed very well, especially in the explenation of their mutant powers, but it was very cool to see it all piece together.",/review/rw2674328/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2002,TheMan3051,," Great show
","This was an exciting and great show. It featured good story lines, great character development, and good animation. This show is definitely better than the movie because it takes it's time to tell us a good story. Also it was quite faithful to the comics.",/review/rw2674328/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2004,DarthBill,10," X-Appeal
","I remember back in 1992 when this show debuted, I thought it was one of the best cartoons on the air, along with ""Batman: The Animated Series"". The characters had great powers but no one was so incredibly powered that they couldn't get knocked down and knocked around. Plus they were always getting on each others nerves. As cool as Wolverine and Gambit were, I always held great fondness for Cyclops and Beast, I guess because I admired Cyclops for being so stalwart and steadfast and Beast for being so damn smart, laid back and intelligent. Gambit's love/hate relationship with Rogue, the hottest virgin super-heroine in comic books, was always good for a laugh and only occasionally got dramatic but never so much that it got sappy. Professor Xavier, Storm, Jean, and Jubilee rounded out the cast of heroes with their own powers and self-doubts and dreams. Well, actually the only character who probably didn't benefit from the series was Jean Grey, who for some strange reason was always fainting in action scenes. I'm guessing the writers simply didn't have a good grasp of her character or a strong idea of how to make her powers look cool and dynamic compared to the weather controlling Storm, high flying super tanker Rogue or even fire work shooting Jubilee.

26 August 2006,cosmic_quest,9," Excellent, more faithful to the comics than the mediocre films ever will be
","I was in my early teens when I first saw this cartoon version of 'X-Men' on television and it was what ignited my long-standing interest in the Marvel universe. If there was ever a lesson to be learnt about what it is to produce a faithful, involving adaptation (be it from a comic or a book) this show was the perfect example as it managed to successfully transfer the characters and plots from page to screen without dumbing down or altering things for the sake of making them 'cooler'.",/review/rw2674328/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2005,boyinflares,," A great animated series, a tribute to the comics
","It was this animated series that got me into the world of the-Men and other Marvel comics, which are far superior, but that is not to say this cartoon wasn't good, for it was. What we have here is the four core X-Men - Cyclops, Wolverine, Jean Grey and Storm - along with popular characters from the comics - Rogue, Beast and Gambit - and Jubilee for the teens and Professor X as the basis for the series. Many mutants and other X-related characters make appearances through the series, some more often than others, and to varying degrees of likeness to their comic counterparts, (and Morph who was created specifically for the series). The X-Men are portrayed well to their comic-counterparts, with the exception of Jean Grey. Although it was this series that got me into X-Men, and made Jean my favourite character, in this series she was somewhat wasted, not used to her full potential. She was shown less-powerful than the others, when in the comics, she is one of the most powerful mutants in existence (even without the Phoenix Force). However Jean did get a few good stories, notably the ongoing Sinister stories, her and Wolverine's love subplot and the Phoenix and Dark Phoenix Sagas.",/review/rw2674328/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2009,Quinoa1984,10," plays great to kids, but the adults can join in the danger and fun too
","X-Men is one of the perennial favorites in the Marvel catalog, maybe as well known now as Spider-Man, and seeing this TV series it's not hard to see why. This is taken, as far as I can tell from my limited knowledge of the original comics that featured the main cast assembled here (Cyclops, Wolverine, Rogue, Storm, Gambit, Jean Grey, Xavier, Jubilee), right from the source material, and it's a pleasure to see how the series in the first two seasons followed a fairly straightforward continuity. Indeed it's like going through a comic book series; you can't really jump in on any episode to really gage the plot (albeit there are some great stand-alone episodes, particularly in the second season where we get some backstories on Gambit and Rogue), though at the least you get an idea of who every character is and what their interests, powers, concerns and little dramas tend to veer toward.",/review/rw2674328/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2004,SonicStuart,," X-tremely X-cellent Cool Series!
","X-Men is another one of my favorite cartoons that used to come on some of the old Saturday Morning Fox Kids lineups. I really liked the way Wolverine was in the series, one of those tuff and rough characters who does things there way. That sort of reminds me the way Knuckles the Echidna was in the beginning episodes of Sonic X. The other X-Men were really cool also! I had this huge crush on Rogue because I thought she was sexy with her looks and sexy southern accent. I also remember that on the 1994 Spider-Man cartoon that the X-Men made some guest appearances on some episodes of Spider-Man. The series is most same way as the comic book about a group of mutant superheroes who live at a school for mutants hosted by Professor Charles Xavier who formed a group of superhero mutants to fight against Magneto and the other evil brotherhood of mutants. This was another one of my favorite Marvel comic book superheroes! I have always liked Marvel comics a little better than DC comics because Marvel has more superheroes than DC. I also remember that this show came back on Fox Kids in Summer 2000 when 20th Century Fox released the live-action X-Men movie in theaters. Then I caught some more reruns for when they showed it for a while on ABC Family!",/review/rw2674328/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2005,VianneChocolat,8," Outstandingly good!!!
","I remember in 1993, X-Men the Animated Series is my obsession and I'm not the only one. For a lot of people in my country, 1993 - 1994 is the X-Men craze era. The said cartoon series was one of the highest-rated TV shows at the time. I was especially obsessed with Rogue. She's beautiful and sexy. She of superior strength and when she fights, she rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yet she can't be touched. She's an irresistible temptation to men, especially to Gambit who longs to touch her so much, when she can't be touched.",/review/rw2674328/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2008,mirwais-orbit,10," The perfect animated series ever!
","After 16 years since its release and almost 11 after its last episode, I still think that X-Men TAS stills being the perfect animated series ever based on a comic book so powerful as X-Men ever was. I still miss it.",/review/rw2674328/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2007,wchngliu,8," Faithful To The Original Comic Book Series, Though Superior To The Films Themselves
","In my very own opinion, the X-Men cartoon series was arguably the closest remake of the X-men that fans could get and much more faithful to the comic books themselves than what the live action movies will ever be. The costumes were identical as the comics, the superheroes were as realistic as they were and the story lines were much more varied, exciting and believable. Wolverine, Storm, Gambit, Rogue, Cyclops, Jean Grey, Beast, Professor Xavier and Jubilee were as they were. The artwork was also excellent, but just what you'd expected from Marvel.",/review/rw2674328/?ref_=tt_urv

She is rescued by the X-Men; Wolverine, Beast, Cyclops, Professor Charles Xavier, Rogue, Jean Grey, Gambit, Storm, and Morph. Professor X advocates the harmonious coexistence between mutants and the regular human population. He is opposed by others in both human and mutant world.

19 February 2013,talarisw,10," A classic cartoon about Marvel comic's team of mutant's called the X-men led by professor X, fighting for peace even if it means protecting those who hate them.
","I'm a huge fan of comic book superheroes and the X-men are my favorite from Marvel comics. This is the best interruption of the X-men. I LOVE the live action movies by 20th century fox with Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry & etc. But this is the best adaptation from the comics. This is also an iconic staple of Saturday mourning cartoons of the 1990s. In the comics about every decade there's a different X-men team with different characters and this cartoon is perfectly based on the 90's team of X- men, which might be the best one. The show does an EXcellent job at staying true to the comics, the animation was great, the action was great and the stories/episodes where great! The best thing about the X-men in general are all the wide range of great characters. Marvel comics done a great job in creating many, many truly interesting characters with great powers, back-stories, personalities and cool looks. It's the colorful characters that makes the X-men so iconic. First there's Charles Xaviar aka Professor X voiced by Cedric Smith. He has a great voice for Xavier. He's the leader of the X-men and one of the world's most powerful telepathic. They did a great job at always giving him an important part in the show not just the typical boss role. The field leader of the X-men is Scott Summers aka Cyclops voiced by Norman Spencer. His voice is perfect for Cyclops. He has one of the most tormenting powers as powerful rays shoot from his eyes which can only be controlled with a visor he wears but he can never look at anyone with a naked eye. They did a great job showing his personality and how serious he takes things as well as his rivalry with Wolverine. Catherine Disher is great as the voice of Jean Grey, who's power is telekinesis(moving objects with her mind). I like her romance with Cyclops and like Scott she takes things seriously. The 2nd in command after Cyclops is Oroa Munroe aka Storm voiced by Iona Morris. Her voice is perfect, I love her African accent. She can control the weather around her and I love how she makes dramatic statements when using her powers like a God commanding the weather to act by her will, even Rouge commented on it by saying ""lighting up with the speeches"". I love Hank McCoy aka Beast. He looks like a fury animal but is actually an sophisticated Genies scientist. George Blaze is great as his voice, I love how they show his love for reading, poetry and art and how he quotes poetry. I love Rogue, she's a great character. She has one of the best personalities and back-story. Lenore Zann is great as her voice, I love her sassy southern accent and flirtations. But she is also tragic as her power is to absorb the life force and/or powers of anyone she touches, making her incapable to touch anyone. My favorite character is Remy Lebeau aka Gambit, who's power is to turn any object into an explosive by touching it. He just has a cool personality. I love Chris Potter's voice, his French accent is perfect. I love how he uses game cards as weapons and all of his ""card talk"" like saying ""five card stud"" before blowing something up. I also like how for some reason he always talks in a 3rd person. The youngest member is teenager Jubilee voiced by Alyson Court. Her hands can create fireworks like sparks. She's cool but I think they made her too immature. But the breakout star is Logan aka Wolverine. I love Hugh Jackman but this is the best take on Wolverine ever. His scratchy, Clint Eastwood like voice by Cathal Dodd is great. His heart's always in the right place but he has such a bad attitude and unlike the other X-men he'll kill . They couldn't show him actually kill(like in the comics) but heavenly implied he's willing to kill. I love his rivalry with the vicious Sabbertooth and how he's in love with Jean Grey. He is definitely the most interesting & complex X-men character. The show also did a great job with the villains. The mutant- hunting giant robots called Sentials were perfectly done. Professor X's former college, the non-mutant hating Magneto is good but unfortunately he dosen't have the brotherhood in this show, he works alone. I like Mystique, Avalanch, and Pyro. Mr. Sinister is one of my favorites, he's really creepy. I love the Juggernaught, he's a smart-ass, a bully and his super strength makes him literally unstoppable. The biggest villain is Apocalpse, who's really scary. Other X-men characters from the comics appear like Collosus, Nightcrawler, Iceman, Angel, Dazzler, Cable but unfortunately no Kitty Pryde. I love the opening credits and theme music, there's no lyrics but the music is unforgettable. The series is very mature and deals with intense issues like prejudice, bigotry and abuse. The 1st season is the best but the entire series is fantastic and is the best from Marvel comics.",/review/rw2674328/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2010,Rectangular_businessman,9," This was a very good series
","This was a quite good series, as far I remember. The animation wasn't very good, actually it was the worst aspect of it, but the plot and the characters were excellent: Even as a child, I admired this series for the interesting plots and the rich complexity of the characters, dealing with themes as intolerance, racism, war and divorce. Also, it was pretty funny to watch, mostly because I always was a huge fan of the ""X-Men"" comics (Which are my favorite comic book characters) and this series made justice to the original source material. This was the best of the animated adaptations of the X-Men comics into an animated form (Compare this with the short ""Pryde of the X-Men"", ""X-men: Evolution"" and ""Wolverine and the X-Men"") I highly recommend it to anyone.",/review/rw2674328/?ref_=tt_urv

","The X-Men TV series has been cited as one of the greatest televised- cartoons of all time. And I completely understand why: the characters are near-perfect reflections of the comic counterparts, the stories respect their source material(s) beautifully, and the music is a '90s nutshell! X-Men is still Marvel's best animated series to date, and though live-action shows like Marvel's Daredevil and Legion have overshadowed the show's legacy somewhat: I still LOVE this series!",/review/rw2674328/?ref_=tt_urv

","When I was younger, I was strictly a reader of D.C. comics, and still am. I wouldn't have anything to do with Marvel because I felt they were nothing but hyped and most of their storylines were confusing and boring.  This show is perhaps the only thing that I think they did right.  You did have the Marvel trademarks of fully drawn characterization, but at least each episode was very concise and didn't get into confusing subplots that tended to bore me.  This also was one of the first animated shows that showed a lot of action and proved that a cartoon could be action oriented without being overly violent.
