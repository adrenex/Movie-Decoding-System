30 January 2014,siderite,8," Amazing acting by McAvoy, but not so easy a film
",Remember when Ewan McGregor played in a little movie called Trainspotting? The film was made after a book by Scottish writer Irvine Welsh and it was an intense and often funny window into the complete wasting of human life due to heroin. It made McGregor famous.,/review/rw3332510/?ref_=tt_urv

","I left the cinema speechless; i normally try to critique and discuss the film straight after, but i was speechless. It was the craziest film i have seen in a long time. It takes boundaries and tells them to f*** off. There are no restrictions with this film. There is brutality, sexism, racism, oppression, homophobia. It is polluted with prejudice. But i thought it was a great film. Am i part of those worldly problems? No. But let's face it, this is unfortunately the way the world is and all this film is doing is showing you just how filthy this world can be. ",/review/rw3332510/?ref_=tt_urv

11 October 2013,rooee,7," Grubby in a good way
","This is another film adaptation of an Irvine Welsh novel that was referred to as ""unfilmable"", although when reading the book when it first came out I for one was struck by the tightness of the narrative and the cinema-friendly focus on a single protagonist.",/review/rw3332510/?ref_=tt_urv

","There is no other way that I could describe this film. It is filled with some of the most crazy and strange scenes that I have seen in film. There was weird sex, masturbating, murder, drugs. Pretty much everything offensive that you could think of is in this film. ",/review/rw3332510/?ref_=tt_urv

19 October 2014,lee_eisenberg,10," this is as close as you can get to a Quentin Tarantino movie without it being a Tarantino movie
","""Filth"" is from ""Trainspotting"" author Irvine Welsh. If you remember what the latter was like, then you'll have an inkling of what this movie is like. And believe you me, ""Filth"" features every type of debauchery known to humanity. James McAvoy's corrupt, vicious, manipulative cop makes you feel as if you're walking on eggshells, but you still gotta love him. Throughout much of the movie I couldn't understand what the characters were saying. These are some THICK Scottish accents.",/review/rw3332510/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2013,eonbluedan-1,9," Surprising - the best in bad taste
","We have had a few fairly unremarkable adaptations of Scottish novelist Irvine Welsh's books, supporting the notion that with the one exception of Danny Boyle's phenomenal 'Trainspotting', his material remains pretty much impossible to put on the screen. Indeed, 'Trainspotting' itself was not a direct adaption as such, but rather an extrapolation of bits and pieces of it to make a cohesive narrative. In the Welsh lore, 'Filth' is put up there as one of the most difficult, and so it is with great surprise that Jon Baird's take on the book is not only a good piece of work, but also perhaps one of the most accomplished films of 2013! ",/review/rw3332510/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2013,Horst_In_Translation,6," Same rules apply
","Five years after Cass, Jon S. Baird comes up with his second feature film for the big screen, an adaptation of Irvine Welsh's novel ""Filth"". This was truly one shocking movie. It's about a rogue cop on his way to promotion and how his mental illness actually result in demotion, which turns out as the final nail in his coffin. Sometimes, its most extreme moments worked actually pretty well to develop the main character and the story, but sometimes it also added nothing and felt really only included for nothing but shock value. The one scene that comes to mind particularly is when the main character catches an underage girl in sexual activity with a grown man and threatens that he'll tell her (very influential) father unless she gives him a blowjob. So yeah, you get the full program here: vomiting, sex, drugs, violence, murder... However, the suffering of McAvoy's character is occasionally also depicted in a more subtle manner (e.g. when we find out why he became what he is, his previous and possibly next family are referenced or during his video message to his friend near the end) and that's where the film is usually is at its best. Above that, you could certainly make a point that his homophobic, racist and misogynist comments are not really what he is like, but truly more a symptom of being hit metaphorically in the face one time too many.",/review/rw3332510/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2013,james_williams360,10," Absolute brilliance, it was utter Filth & I loved it.

16 December 2018,Bored_Dragon,8," Where's Oscar for McAvoy?
","If you like ""Trainspotting"", you'll love this one. ""Filth"" is also an adaptation of Irvine Welsh's novel and, although the stories do not have much in common, the movies share a specific atmosphere that will pin you to the screen. Its name fits perfectly, because the film is uncompromisingly dirty. James McAvoy plays a corrupt police detective who would stop at nothing to get his promotion. But behind the mask of a self-confident macho chauvinist, there are hidden secrets that the movie gradually unfolds, up to the totally wicked twist at the end. Although McAvoy's character is almost utterly bad guy, his rude and ruthless charm will mesmerize you and make you be on his side all the time, even when his behavior is inexcusably brutal. In addition to his undoubted acting talent, Mcavoy dedicated himself to the credibility of his performance, so he drank lots of whiskey in order to make his role of heavy alcoholic and drug addict more convincing. His transformations throughout the film, and the powerful expressions of psychological states and emotions of his character definitely deserve an Oscar. Although the film is full of insane moments, surreal scenes and filthy humor, ""Filth"" is primarily a powerful and shocking drama about a man who is falling apart inside, but whose life thought him that he must not show it. The film brings this phenomenon to surreal extremes, but essentially it is something with which many of us can identify, and I think that's precisely what makes McAvoy's character rather antihero than a villain, and what makes us sympathize with him.",/review/rw3332510/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2013,Denisebridgetryan,9," Top film!
","Probably my favourite film of 2013 so far. Gripping all the way through, with all the aspects you need from a feature length film. Yes, it has the obvious overtone of 'filth', but it's not at all in its nature... it's humorous and very touching at times. I think the casting is brilliant and I have a new found respect for James McAvoy, who in previous films I have found to be almost nondescript. He shines here, brighter than most Oscar winning performers I've seen. Ray Donovan's Eddie Marson is also fantastic in his role, so well cast - he's funny and warm in such a subtle way. This is not one of those situations when someone can rightly say 'the book is better' - I think the job has been done so well of adapting it into film format that the book is not better at all, just a different experience. It is honestly a film I want to see again. I think an instant classic, not filthy at all, but pure class.",/review/rw3332510/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2014,jimbo-53-186511,5," Stumbles and falters at the beginning, but it actually ends up being a fairly good character study
","Bruce Robertson (James McAvoy)is a corrupt police officer that isn't bothered how he gets results - whether they are obtained ethically or not. When a Japanese student is murdered in the local area, Robertson sees this case as an opportunity to gain that much needed promotion. His confidence is given a bit of a boost when his commanding officer Superintendent Toal (John Sessions) asks him to oversee the case and informs Robertson that if he gets the necessary results that it will put him in good stead with the promotion board. Naturally, Robertson relishes this opportunity and does his best to put himself in a good light - albeit in an unethical and underhand way.",/review/rw3332510/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2013,bialas-ole,8," Take one cup of ""Fear and Lothing in Las Vegas"", one slice of ""American Psycho"" and add a bit of ""Fightclub""
","If you are a friend of funny, thrilling and bizarre movies, you're gonna love this one! First of all, this movie manages to surprise you again and again till the end. It switches between funny, dramatic and thrilling elements. James McAvoy gives an amazing performance (by far the best I've seen from him) as the funny, manipulative, sick, drug-addicted, broken, Cop and manages to portrait every aspect of the character. Another piece of awesome acting is delivered by Jim Broadbent who plays his psychologist. The dialogues between him and James McAvoy are just amazing! The rest of the cast is also decent and the characters are all very special in a refreshing way. The only bad thing i can mention about this movie is, that it has some (but small) longueurs. I can recommend it to everyone who likes movies of this kind and has no problem with movies containing a lot of sex, drugs and f*cked up moments :)",/review/rw3332510/?ref_=tt_urv

","Bruce Robinson (James McAvoy) is working for a promotion. The film starts with some first person narration as we see Bruce as the idea man for the job. However we soon discover that Bruce is out of control and works to destroy his fellow detectives in order to ensure he gets the promotion. As Bruce spirals down in his psychotic world, the film becomes darker. This dark comedy had scenes which gave me flashbacks to ""Clockwork Orange"" although the films really have nothing in common.
