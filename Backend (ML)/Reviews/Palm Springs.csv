10 October 2018,fpmegan15,10," I AM IN LOVE WITH ELIZABETH GILLIES !
",She's one of the most underrated actress! She's so good back in victorious ! I'm glad she have her own tv series now. Please don't cancel this show,/review/rw5034478/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2018,sidney_amsterdam,9," Great nonsense
","I m from the older generation who sat home to watch Dynasty decades ago.
Out of curiousity I start watching the new series and I enjoyed it.
Since Alexis made her entry the show really started.
Without that character there is no Dynasty.
The casting of Fallon is excellent, I really like her personication of the old Fallon.
Forget the old Dynasty and for tv that has no meaning and message it 's great to watch this to set your mind of things",/review/rw5034478/?ref_=tt_urv

","One of those tv shows that makes me miss gossip girl. Definitely dramatic and twisty in one of those highschool drama ways, but sophisticated. And reppin ATL...? I love it!!!",/review/rw5034478/?ref_=tt_urv

","Love this show, Fallon Carrington is my favourite! Honestly I would recommend this show!! ",/review/rw5034478/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2019,joyousb,7," Nicollette Sheridan must stay!!!
",I hated last nights episode. What were you guys thinking taking Nicollette Sheridan off the show!!! She was the perfect cast for Alexis. The Fallon lookalike is ridiculous. I think you just ended your show!!!!,/review/rw5034478/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2020,shiranai-73770,5," The writers of season 3 should be fired
","I enjoyed this show a lot and the first two seasons are really good and binge worthy. But the third season goes too much into cheesy slapstick land which peaks in episode 4 when they start SINGING (this is blamed on hallucinations by a gas leak).
What the EF?",/review/rw5034478/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2020,cdeanroane,3," Dynasty not hardly, more like Dyna-farce
","Well this show has managed to replace the actresses playing the characters of Crystal and Alexis almost each season with each one getting more outlandish for the 2nd Alexis's and duller for 3rd Crystal the previous one. Sadly none have brought the chemistry and fireworks that the Crystal (Linda Evans) and Joan Collins brought to their characters of Dynasty as Crystal from Jan 1981-89 and ALexis From Nov. 81-89 . Even the this show version of Dominique Deveraux is weak and with out the class or ruthfulness of Diahann Carroll version of the character.
The one bight spot has been this shows version of the character of Fallon Carrington, Elizabeth Gillies. She has pulled off the spoiled selfish rich girl in a way Pamela Sue Martin or Emma Samms never did.
This current shows Blake Carrington acts like a spoiled male version of the current Fallon and more as a brother would and not as her father. Grant Snow lacks the class and craftiness of John Forsythe version of the same character.
This shows actor Alan Dale who plays Joseph Anders, Blake's Majordomo, would have been cast as Blake Carrington.
The rest of the cast between the changes to their race, sex, nationally, or sexual orientation have done nothing to improve the show but just feel as the changes were added reflect current thought of being PC and a diversity that come off as fake.
Where the Dynasty of 1981-81 was a dramatic soap opera this version is comedic soap operaish farce good for laughs with it's thin plots where one can foresee what the outcome will be from the time it starts.
I cannot see this show lasting more then another season or two at the current way it is going. However it is always the best laugh one will find on Fri. night regular TV.",/review/rw5034478/?ref_=tt_urv

20 January 2019,miaegekvist,10," Fallon is straight up amazing
","The portraition of Fallon is amazing - its been years since Ive been this hooked on a tv-show. Especially the chemistry between Liz Gillies and Adam Huber is brilliant and everytime they appear on the screen togehter, the episodes gets 10 times better. Just brilliant.",/review/rw5034478/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2019,B24,4," We're Not In Denver Anymore
","This copycat series proves that, no matter how much money is spent trying to improve on the original, it's just a case of adding too much and too many ingredients to a proven recipe. All the new socially acceptable vulgarisms and politically correct characters overpower an already thin tale of how the rich make their money and are corrupted by it. Which means it's just like many new films or series I have seen lately that fall flat of their own extravagant weight.
In order for such a story to have dramatic effect, there must be at least a few characters or situations able to excite the passions of and suspend the disbelief of an audience made up of ordinary people, not just a few servants and hangers-on as represented here. Even the eye candy of the earlier Carringtons was superior to this mismatched bunch.
Do yourself a favor and find a copy of the one with real actors back in the 80's.",/review/rw5034478/?ref_=tt_urv

",...how much people got paid to gave this a 10 star rating.,/review/rw5034478/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2018,reymontero,4," What a joke
","I was a fan of the original Dynasty and watched most of it on re-runs.
I can say that Fallon was a good choice, also Blake...the rest is bad. The stories are extremely campy, is this a comedy, a drama or a soap?
Blake is a secondary character, given little to do as the series focuses on Fallon and a bunch of lifeless gay characters.
I tortured myself through 3 of the season 2 chapters and there's one where they go to Paraguay to ""build"" houses, another chapter focuses on a palm reader, and another on a dream sequence around Fallon.
After that, no more. There are many better ways to waste my time than this.
This seems misguided - to what type of audience are they aiming for?",/review/rw5034478/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2019,adamdotg,," This series had so much potential, where did it all go wrong?
","Season 1 started off so well, a good storyline, reasonable twists & turns, and a lot wealthy people. Like most of the viewers, I started off slightly disliking Cristal 1.0 (Nat Kelley) and by the end of the season she was one of my favourite characters.",/review/rw5034478/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2018,tjharden,10," Nostalgia & Cheese at it's Best!!!
","I was addicted to Dynasty in the 80s.. And saw it was coming back, and I rolled my eyes.. But, I can't help myself. The nods this does to the original, the 80s party, how the characters (The Colby's) play out is pretty damn creative, and knowing the original like I do, just makes me smile and enjoy this guilty pleasure.. I hope it get's renewed.. I honestly paid for the episodes I missed on Amazon - I enjoyed it that much!",/review/rw5034478/?ref_=tt_urv

24 October 2021,laragi,4," UPDATE
",The new season is so boring. What happened to the soap opera quality? Nothing really happens. Even Adam's character is tame. Snooze. I'm disappointed.,/review/rw5034478/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2017,Frederique14,10," Captivating and addictive new show
","This reboot of Dynasty looks very promising. Most of all the pilot is a addicting soap drama full of complicated relationships, scheming, sass and plot twists. The cat-fights and cliffhangers are great and make this show really addicting. After one episode I am already wanting more.",/review/rw5034478/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2018,elle-787-399491,10," Good mix of Actors and Actresses!
","I hope the CW Network does not cancel this show! Besides John Forsythe, Joan Collins and Linda Evans have all been replaced with some very strong Actors. I like the change from Colorado to Georgia. More plausible for treachery surrounding Oil Rigs. The emphasis on Green Energy is great too.",/review/rw5034478/?ref_=tt_urv

","Season 1 was exciting, the right Alexis and Krystle. Season 2 was ok. Season 3 is stupid and kinda sloppy written. Boring storyline and the twists are missing. The Deveraux-family is really boring and not interesting characters.",/review/rw5034478/?ref_=tt_urv
