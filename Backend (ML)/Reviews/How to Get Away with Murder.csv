","For me, its basic virtue remains to discover Viola Davis. and to admire her impecable performance. to see the labyrinth of a murder and the pressure and a story without real heroes. her force to define the lead character is the best motif to see the serie.",/review/rw5276724/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2015,emonaghan-64172,9," How to Get Away with Legal Inaccuracy
","I saw at least 3 other reviews of this TV show that put it at a 6/10 for the sole reason that it is an inaccurate portrayal of lawyers. Yes, and...? Does that take away from the brilliant plot and acting? I don't think anything in film or television is an accurate portrayal of anything. If someone were to rewrite this exciting show into an ""accurate portrayal"" of law, then it would just be a show about Viola Davis filling out paper work and occasionally showing up in court. And some of these reviewers go on to say that it is a shame that people believe that is how the court of law is in real life. My advice to them is to go to the IMDb page of the Avengers and write a review that says, ""it's a shame that every single person who watches this movie now believes superheroes actually exist,"" because apparently no one who is a consumer of media entertainment has the common sense to know that lawyers do not, in reality, go around killing and bribing everyone.

","I'm heartbroken this is over but it ended so perfectly, something a majority of series completely fail to do! I've never rated anything a straight up 10 before but, this gets it! Each season is gripping, it is so cleverly done and will have you on the edge of your seat gagging for the next installment. The writing, the acting, the flash backs (and forward) are all on point here. Hats off to Viola Davis, a truly awesome lead!
How To Get Away With Murder doesnt ""drag on"" or ""get boring"" part way through. Another thing so many other series fail to accomplish.
This is a brilliant watch and I highly recommend.
Thanks so much for this total gem!",/review/rw5276724/?ref_=tt_urv

","Annalise Keating (Viola Davis) is a sought-after law professor and a famous hard-charging defense attorney willing to push the envelope. She selects her students Wes Gibbins, Connor Walsh, Michaela Pratt, Asher Millstone, and Laurel Castillo as her interns to work on her cases. There is Annalise's husband Sam and her secret affair with police detective Nate Lahey. There are her associates Frank Delfino and Bonnie Winterbottom. The first season centered on the murder of student Lila Stangard and Rebecca Sutter who is the main suspect.",/review/rw5276724/?ref_=tt_urv

11 February 2017,lucaleog,10," Among Network TV's best dramas
","I have no idea why it has taken me this long to write a review for this show since I have loved it since day 1. Meanwhile, How to Get Away With Murder has become my favorite show on television, and here's why: Even in a golden age of television, network TV has been lacking original content in the last few years. There are too many procedural dramas and too many superhero shows, so therefore I am glad to have a show like HTGAWM. Yes, it is partly a legal drama, but it is definitely so much more than than. IMO it is primarily a mystery and a thriller at the same time because every season starts with an intriguing flash-forward, showing us a very dramatic event that takes place in their mid-season finale. However, when most shows have flash-forwards they only feature one in the premiere and practically have no build-up to it, HTGAWM does the opposite, it features a flash-forward in every one of the first 8 episodes of a season and plays with our mind. By the time you have watched the mid-season finale itself, your mind will be blown. But why am I telling you this? Because I am trying to underline that this show has the most brilliant and shocking twists you could even imagine, and they have about 100 of those. They are executed with such brilliance and complexity that you will never get bored or annoyed by them. What is probably even better than the brilliant twists, however, is the masterful acting. Viola Davis nails every single scene she is, she portrays this deeply flawed character beautifully with so much depth. I cannot praise her enough, she deserves every single award that exists. That is not to say that the supporting cast is any less mesmerizing, they all bring their A-game consistently. They all deserve recognition. And one last thing: character development!!!! So so brilliant! The characters that you meet in the pilot change a lot as time passes and they all become very three-dimensional! Just go ahead and watch this show. I could say so much more, but just go enjoy the fun and crazy ride. You won't regret it, I promise!",/review/rw5276724/?ref_=tt_urv

30 October 2020,am-by,5," Complete and utter Nonsense
","Far fetched and unrelated from reality completely. Its watchable if you look past its fantasy scripts. Lead character so far 8 episodes in wins every single case in implausible ways. Sometimes just by shouting at witnesses, aided by private detective / legal students. If your understand of the law is that of a child its not too bad.",/review/rw5276724/?ref_=tt_urv

","If you want to watch yet another procedural about lawyers that's realistic or even researched in any way this is not the show for you.

",So far it's just the same 3 week period played over and over every single episode over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over. It's one thing to have an entire season of How I Met Your Mother take place over a weekend in real time but at least it moved forward albeit at an absurdly glacial pace. This is something different. This is literally the same period of time with the same people doing the same thing say the same thing week after week. Laziest writing in the history of people.,/review/rw5276724/?ref_=tt_urv

","I started watching this show as it was recommended highly and also had good online ratings. I REALLY enjoyed it at first but halfway through the season it started feeling tedious. Things got convoluted & started to get unreal. I was REALLY dissappointed at the end of season 1, so I won't be continuing to watch.",/review/rw5276724/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2015,A_Llama_Drama,7," I don't usually use the term guilty pleasure...
","This is definitely a time to use it. Unlike other ABC shows I used to watch like Desperate Housewives, I never heard a good word about HTGAWM. When Desperate Housewives first appeared there were plaudits and comparisons with Six Feet Under and Sex & The City. Much like DH, this show centres on a mystery (who killed Lila Stangart and how are the main characters going to get away with murder?). Add to that some of the horniest students and professionals I've seen on television since Queer as Folk, you've got a great mix of intrigue, hysteria and mystery. It doesn't pretend to be a good show. It's overblown, it's riddled with over-acting, the plot is paper thin and the court scenes are like cheap episodes of ""The Good Wife."" And it works in the shows favour. It's so good because it never once puts on the front of being a good television show. It's trashy and dirty and Viola Davis is absolutely amazing. If you're needing to wind down after a hard day of actual work, tune in to How To Get Away With Murder and enjoy the petty dramas of an oversexed, over-thinking, overdressed cast. The jury is out - How To Get Away With Murder is guilty! Guilty of being pleasurable.",/review/rw5276724/?ref_=tt_urv

2 October 2015,Nunyrbusiness,8," Fun!
",I just binge watched season one and I loved it. First off I want to say that there are a bunch of complaining critics on here that I think are missing the point of the show. How to get away with murder. It's not a show that's going to depict total reality. It's a fun to watch exaggerated clever show (but there's a bit of truth behind every bit of this exaggeration). Maybe the critics that rate the show so harshly should really watch it with a grain of salt. So many are saying that it's unrealistic. The law schools are not at all like this. Law isn't practiced like this. Oh grow up. The crazy twisting corrupted lying cheating goings-on are exaggerated and accelerated to make it more fun to watch. This is a fun show and I am most certainly looking forward to season two. Now I will agree that there are some gratuitous sex scenes that just really aren't necessary. The writers really don't have to spell it out for us. We get it. Maybe they will ease up on that kind of stuff in season two. Good show and I recommend it to people who are open-minded to the fact that TV doesn't always have to be based on true absolute reality. It's supposed to be entertaining. And this show is definitely entertaining.,/review/rw5276724/?ref_=tt_urv

15 May 2020,m-47826,3," Another decent enough series ruined by the crazy.
","Forget the spam reviews, 10/10 is just the rating fans give it to feel good about loving this pretty shallow legal drama. It's everything we knew and sometimes loved about Shonda Rhimes series. Season 1 was a fresh concept, but each seasons got more ridiculous and extremely soap-ish, with all the family/relationship dramas, and over the top twists and turns. With some characters backgrounds changing every season, to fit the Â« woke Â» agendas more. It even made re-watching the show, a real chore for me. After that nearly perfect second season. Too unrealistic, forced and theatrical for me taste. And PC, too PC for its own good. With the usual amount of double standards and what not, some viewers eat for breakfast. The madness surrounding the main actress Â« talent Â» went to such extremes... She was good, but not THAT good. Only things I really liked about this show, was that sense of novelty, first season brought to the genre. Some of the cast members, and the music selection (very distinctive to the atmosphere of the series, and full of hidden gems). Other than that, it's decent enough to be watched (or hate watched, thanks to some regulars and main characters choices and reactions) But not that unforgettable, or addictive after a couple of seasons.",/review/rw5276724/?ref_=tt_urv
