13 November 2011,brent_a_graham,9," What's Wrong with You People???
","How is it a fantastic show like ""Unforgettable"", that improves every week with wonderful character development, and a superb lead actress (Poppy Montgomery as Carrie Wells) fails to stimulate the US viewer? Yet ridiculous shows like ""Amazing Race"" or ""Survivor"" drone on year after year. I just don't get it.",/review/rw2588457/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2011,ldddhunter,10," Unforgettable
","I actually really really loved the concept of this show and am a huge fan of Poppy -- she is perfect for the part. I like how she has this out of body experience (which it really isn't). It just shows you how she puts her theory together by using her fantastic flawless memory - I will continue watching this show - CBS needs to give this show a chance bc its totally different from any other detective series. I also like her backstory about her sister Rachael - it shows how vulnerable Carrie's character is and why she is not anxious becoming a detective again. But, w/her abilities of course she would help out a lot. I also like the whole cast, Dylan Walsh is perfect as her ex boyfriend/partner -- ppl need to give this show a chance and not give up so easily, bc it will progress and become even more interesting.",/review/rw2588457/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2011,Sharbysy,8," I really like it
","I decided to record this show because I liked Poppy Montgomery when she was in Without a Trace. I wasn't sure how the concept of this show would play out and if it would be interesting to watch, but I was not disappointed. The pilot had me hooked right away. It was filled with suspense and kept me interested through the whole episode. ",/review/rw2588457/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2017,sfhamm,7," last episode season 4 Paranoid Android
","I did not like the Cliff hanger at the end! I guess the Show was cancelled and everything was up in the air. No season 5 means no resolution.....I would have liked to see a season 5 with a proper ending to the series, not Bang ...you're dead??? Really????",/review/rw2588457/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2020,Johnny_West,3," First Season was very good, then they changed the cast
","I enjoyed the first season in spite of Poppy Montgomery. She is constantly rolling her eyes when other detectives are talking to her, batting her eyes, flirting with everyone like she was god's gift to humanity, preening her body to push her breasts in front of men, and smirking when she gets her way. She is supposed to be an ace detective, but she acts very unprofessionally for a detective. She also frequently violates all the rules, and gets other people in danger.",/review/rw2588457/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2020,Xavier_Stone,3," One trick pony gets old fast
","The lead character has a perfect memory and it seems to be able to solve crimes at an amazing pace. Average acting by all, the characters are just basic, and the plot is always the same with her using her memory to find the killer by using the other characters to lure the details out. Poor character development as Poppy is in 80% of the scenes and it's all about her.",/review/rw2588457/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2011,LoveMyTwoFerrets,9," AWESOME new show!
","I totally love everything about this show ... the concept is fantastic and actually believable! All of the actors are superb, particularly Poppy Montgomery, Michael Gaston and Dylan Walsh! Also, the skepticism shown by team members Kevin Rankin and Daya Vaidya are absolutely perfect! ",/review/rw2588457/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2021,pkxcsqin,10," Can someone smart PLEASE pick this show up for Season 5
","OMG.... I did not know this show even existed and happen to stumble onto it. Then come to find out it only has 4 season; wasn't mad until I started watching it and couldn't stop watching. Then they end the series with Al getting shot right when Carrie was going to say ""I love You,"" definitely wasn't expecting that. PLEASE PLEASE start this series back up.",/review/rw2588457/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2011,nowego,8," Another OK Police Show with a Twist
","I am a fan of The Listener so another show with similarities is fine by me, I am not sure what the other reviewers were watching but it could not have been the same show as I watched. The one I watched was quite good and I really liked Poppy Montgomery and Dylan Walsh. I can not recall any other shows that Poppy Montgomery has been in but I liked Dylan Walsh in one of my favourite movies, The Lake House.",/review/rw2588457/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2021,k-verse,8," Fun show
",Great characters and fun cases each episode. Two leads are fantastic. They have great chemistry and the will they/won't they tension adds to the fun of the show. Loved seeing Jane Curtain in this too. I really enjoyed it and would watch again.,/review/rw2588457/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2013,edwarren_1,3," Forgettable
","Unforgettable has lost season one's intrigue and cast. The dynamics no longer work. Everything centers around Poppy. Pretty but not the best actress in the world. Her depth is weak and emotions, responses typical. Even story lines lack luster. Sure they have new props and technical gadgets, but so what..everyone does these days. Enjoyed first season. They had interplay with all the cast, not just her. The stories were more intense and showed a sense of drama. Of course, I liked Jane Curtain in SNL, who didn't? Liked her in season one, but she is stale and predictable as well this time round. The rest of the characters exist without existing. I have no idea who or what they are. I was looking forward to watching this year's shows. The idea was and is intriguing, but ideas without depth become boring and ...forgettable.",/review/rw2588457/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2014,Solaris88,2," Rather poor
","A fairly standard police show, with the hook being the woman with the perfect memory who never forgets anything. The cases are routine and there's no absolutely chemistry between the cast members. Worst of all is that the lead actress, Poppy Montgomery, seems weirdly miscast in her role. Either that or the writers/directors are mismanaging her badly. Watching her twirl her hair around her finger, bat her eyes coquettishly, and giggle like a little girl is just flat out embarrassing. She's supposed to be a 40 year old police detective, yet she has all the mannerisms of a fairly air-headed teen-aged girl. What the heck is that all about?",/review/rw2588457/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2021,Top_Dawg_Critic,5," I finally figured it out
","Something about this show had an annoying tic, and I couldn't put my finger on it. Well, I finally figured it out. Think; you just changed your babies diaper, and all of a sudden you hear a giggle, then they get all serious, stare into space, and do a little pucker thing with their lips. They are peeing! THAT is the look the beautiful Poppy Montgomery makes when she's remembering a detail. And I just can't get past that. It's a decent idea/concept, but going up against the likes of The Mentalist, this starts to look like a comedy. Great performances, decent directing, but there's nothing new and different in the stories of similar shows. Then add that look... I can't watch this show any more. It's a generous 5/10 from me.",/review/rw2588457/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2011,TeOfLeDiKi,2," Interesting premise but ultimately forgettable
","I wanted to like this show, I really did. But it suffers from too many issues, and after 6 or 7 episodes, I've given up. Poppy Montgomery's WAT character, Sam Spade, became extremely popular, and like so many TV actors whose characters skyrocket like that, the actor herself became lazy. Although she attempts a decent American accent, her vowels are heavily colored with Australian diphthongs, and she really needs a diction coach. Her character, Carrie Wells, isn't even all that likable - she's a bit arrogant and ill-mannered, and completely fails to evoke sympathy for her past. Unlike Jane Timoney in ""Prime Suspect,"" however, Carrie isn't a brilliant detective, she just has a really good memory. The producers of the show and Montgomery herself apparently want to show off her incredible physique, but she's so hardbodied it's almost a caricature. Tight, skimpy tank tops, heaving cleavage, and close-up shots of a butt made out of granite aren't really all that attractive. There was a recent web post somewhere about how Robin Tunney's portrayal of Teresa Lisbon on ""The Mentalist"" shows women in law enforcement in a positive and professional light - Montgomery's appearance and performance in ""Unforgettable"" do just the opposite. So, I give up. Bye, ""Unforgettable.""",/review/rw2588457/?ref_=tt_urv

",Unforgettable was a very enjoyable series for me throughout its 4 seasons.,/review/rw2588457/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2019,mariangella,1," Take a lesson from Teresa Lisbon, Carrie
","Wow, this is so bad I barely made it through two episodes. I haven't seen such an annoying main character in a really long time.
This is supposed to be a cool female cop? More a spoiled egocentric teenager.",/review/rw2588457/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2011,jonmccann,1," More like forgettable!
","What do you get when you throw together two mediocre actors, add them into a cop show and come up with a very unusual 'gift' for one...That show would be unforgettable, which is sadly, quite forgettable.",/review/rw2588457/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2012,maine_310,9," An Unexpected Hit
","Unforgettable reminds me of 'drama' series that aired in the earlies. It has that slowed pace that gets you hooked on the story. Characters are layered with pure emotion. It leads you to believe that these people very well exist in reality. Then there is Carrie. Most people have commented on her memory skills. It leads me to think that some may not like the actress Poppy Montgomery, but her talent as an actress surpasses any superficial criticism. Be it the clothes she wears or her pride about her 'superpower', she is made human because of them.",/review/rw2588457/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2012,gareth-91,9," enjoyed this
","Have just seen episode 2 here in the UK. I enjoyed this, a gutsy woman trusts in herself. I can see it's quite new as the actors aren't settled into the characters yet. But it's also someone who has had a trauma, so she's been there. Worth a lot more than all sorts of paper qualifications. There will have to be other things introduced into it, or just the memory thing could get a bit boring. But I find what's more interesting than the total visual recall thing is her attitude of ,'I play by my rules"", this girl is not going to kiss ass. Whew, what a relief. So, if there could be some more nice complex plots that slowly let us get to know Carrie and the other characters that would be great. I love in Bones how it took so long for people to get to know each other - it felt real.",/review/rw2588457/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2011,maros612,3," disappointing after all
","When I read about the show I built some expectations. Unfortunately, they weren't met by far. I went through two episodes, trying to understand the means this show is supposed to draw attention and provide amusement of any kind, then I finally gave up.",/review/rw2588457/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2017,twinkle_pink,1," doesn't add up to enjoyable television
","I watched episode one, and that is enough of this show for me. I almost turned it off halfway through, after the first few scenes included:
1. main character helping old people in a nursing home by day (awww, look how caring and wonderful she is)
2.main character goes gambling at night and wins fight with random gambling fiends by using her memory and their own gun (ooooh, look how badass she is also!)
3. main character gets home from her gambling escapades and sadly watches two lovers being happy (awww, but she's so lonely)",/review/rw2588457/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2020,pumping_iron-1,1," Unforgettable! Really?
","I actually made it through S1 Ep 12. I really wanted to like this series. But Carrie is so annoying. She is totally unbelievable. She has Hyperthymesia, an autobiographical memory. However, you'd think she was a teenager with super powers. So annoying that she'd go into situations alone, no backup. Ms Montgomery's acting skills suffer in this role. They are mediocre at best. The rest of the cast seem uncomfortable in their roles. There is no chemistry at all. I'm done.",/review/rw2588457/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2019,sawznhamrs-1,3," The surprise is it lasted four seasons--
","This type of amazing memory does exist. Marilu Henner ""has been confirmed to be one of a rare group of persons, who possess ""hyperthymesia"" (Superior Autobiographical Memory) which allows her to recall almost every day of her life."" I'm not sure whether this fact was inspiration for this show. So, it's not such a far-fetched notion. But it hardly translates to a successful crime series. The challenge was in portraying the use of this memory in an interesting and compelling way. It fails because watching someone on screen who is simply using their memory of detail is not a very interesting activity. I have only begun watching the series recently in syndication on StartTV. No wonder it bounced around from network to network seeking an audience. The user reviews are certainly not absent of favorable commentary, but there are always various reasons that viewers relate to a series.",/review/rw2588457/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2012,dmaz101,3," So incredibly annoying!
","The premise of the show is a good one, and I feel that by making just a few changes in the main characters, I would look forward to watching! A couple of reviewers hit the nail on the head. There is so little to like about Carrie, and so little to respect in her boss. I feel sorry for the more serious characters, plodding along, doing their jobs, and receiving no recognition on the show. Now I'll be petty...why does Carrie dress like an 18 year old, who shops at Discovery and dots (even her ""formal wear"")?",/review/rw2588457/?ref_=tt_urv
