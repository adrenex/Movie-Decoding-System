3 January 2023,ella-48,8," Art, not history
","I've noticed a number of reviewers having difficulty with this film on grounds of its historical inaccuracy. I can't speak to any of that. Being myself blissfully ignorant of the relevant history, I was untroubled by such considerations as I settled into my seat at my local Picture House - perfectly happy to take it as Art: a work of speculative fiction, and a somewhat impressionistic one at that.",/review/rw8606472/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2023,Bachfeuer,9," Being an empress is no fairy tale
",It has been many months since I came across a new film as satisfying as this one. The unusual device of seeding a big-budget costume drama with anachronisms to signal that something applicable across time is being communicated does alas lend itself to misunderstanding. It is good enough for this to be merely a vehicle for Ms. Krieps. That being a woman is complicated no matter the time period or the circumstances is enough for a premise.,/review/rw8606472/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2022,CinemaSerf,6," Corsage
","The danger with fictional accounts of the lives of real people, is that it is frequently all to easy to poke holes in the plot. This is one such film that takes just a little too much creative licence with the the life of the Empress Elisabeth (Vicky Krieps). Wife of the famed Austro-Hungarian Emperor Franz Josef (Florian Teichtmeister), this film follows a supposed year in the life of this curious historical figure who, having suffered a family tragedy and having a rather estranged emotional relationship with her husband, spends much of her life obsessing with her weight and seeking solitude. Krieps is on good form, she creates a persona for her character that is effective to watch, but the mixture of modern and period scenarios (old buildings with modern fire doors; a cross-channel ferry!) seems anachronistic - to what end? The buildings in which she and her family inhabit have none of the opulence and grandeur of the Hofburg or Prague Castle, indeed the British home of her horse-master ""Bay"" (Colin Morgan) looks little better that a ramshackle ruin - and this is incongruous with the way we know she lived her life. Reclusive, yes, but still in splendour. It is also a particularly unremarkable year in her life to have chosen to illustrate. Not the previous ones where turbulence within the Imperial family reigned, not the famed ""Mayerling"" period which was ultimately held responsible for the final decline of this lady. There is also an highly speculative portrayal of her relationship with Bavaria's equally famous King Ludwig II (Manuel Rubey). The denouement itself is presented here in a rather too bizarre fashion that rather topped off this interesting but frankly flat and pace-less drama that offers us a glimpse of this intriguing woman, but little more of substance. Pity.",/review/rw8606472/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2022,FilmFanatic2023,7," A Stunning Exploration of Beauty, Power, and Constraints
","A beautifully shot and elegiac film that explores the life of Empress Elisabeth of Austria as she navigates the expectations of her culture and her own desires. Vicky Krieps gives a layered and nuanced performance as Elisabeth, and the metaphor of the corset effectively symbolizes the constrictions of her privileged but powerless life. While the film is unabashedly fictionalized, it effectively captures the internal struggles of a woman who is constantly told what to do and who grapples with the fear of losing her beauty and power as she ages. The sumptuous settings and contemporary songs add to the overall atmosphere of the film, which is both poignant and thought-provoking. Overall, ""Corsage"" is a worthwhile watch for fans of historical dramas and those interested in exploring themes of beauty, power, and the constraints of societal expectations.",/review/rw8606472/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2022,Blue-Grotto,10," Everyone doesn't love us in the way we want to be loved.
","It is birthday number 40 for Empress Elisabeth ""Sissi"" of the Austro-Hungarian empire and many people are predicting her downfall, including herself. Idolized from the age of 16 when she became Empress, Sissi rebels at the notion of following conventions, meeting expectations, and bowing to the opinion of the masses. ""A lion doesn't lose sleep"" she says, ""over the opinion of sheep."" Sissi is mischievous, wily, willful, and passionate. She embraces ephemeral moments that provide pleasure; riding horses at night, friends with benefits, and swimming nude in mountain lakes in the darkness. Her family reluctantly tolerates her, and that makes her uncomfortable and depressed. ""If you allow yourself to be swayed by gossip"" she tells her son, ""you are not worthy to be emperor."" She wishes her relatives were as bold as herself and loved her for who she is.",/review/rw8606472/?ref_=tt_urv

","Greetings again from the darkness. Royals are having a moment. Well, actually, the Royals have had a few hundred years of moments ... but now, they are having their moment in the entertainment world. It seems almost everyone watched ""Downton Abbey"" and now ""The Crown"", and last year we saw Kristen Stewart's Oscar nominated performance as Lady Di in SPENCER. Of course, there have been countless other films focused on Kings and Queens and other royal types, and now writer-director Marie Krutzer (THE GROUND BENEATH MY FEET, 2019) serves up a (mostly) fictional account of Empress Elisabeth of Austria from the 19th century.",/review/rw8606472/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2022,dzeilstra,4," Annoying anachronism of history
","Empress Elizabeth or Sissi has inspired many books, movies and even a musical. The early Romy Schneider version was especially loved by teenage girls. She had a complicated life, about there is much to say. It eludes me why you would choose a historical figure and then tell a story that is far off the historical facts. The anachronisms of music and props, and also of facts and personages become annoying. There is hardly a story line or a plot and the end is totally absurd. The film does not become interesting or gripping at any point. A superfluous and unnecessary addition to the movie library.",/review/rw8606472/?ref_=tt_urv

","Empress Elizabeth of Austria-Hungary (Vicky Krieps) blows out all the candles on her 40th birthday cake in 1878, and everyone tells her how young she looks. She doesn't feel young. At a time when half her female subjects wouldn't make it to her age, when she eats so little a wren would starve, and the maids are too weak to cinch her corset tight enough, she's grown bored with the court, bored with the pretty clothes, and takes frequent trips out of the country, like her journey to Britain, where she founders her favorite and Louis LePrince (Finnegan Oldfield) makes motion pictures using his new technology of a roll of film, she's had enough. So she takes the cross-Channel ferry back home...",/review/rw8606472/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2023,JBLOSS,8," Vicky Krieps performance is excellent!
","I knew pretty much nothing about the protagonist in this film and I feel those hung up on historical accuracy have completely missed the point. This is a film about a suffocating society, a courtly culture that stifled a clearly very intelligent and emotionally complex woman. The title of the film gives a clear hint of this and we see through the course of the fictional or reimagined series of events the impact it has on Empress Elisabeth. If you're expecting a historical biopic then you'll be disappointed.",/review/rw8606472/?ref_=tt_urv

","Vicky krieps is quite wonderful in this fictionalized account of elizabeth of austria. Known for her beauty and tiny waist, she was head strong and very independent. In this film she is those things and much more. Imperious and loving, crude and impassioned. She seems to have a love hate relationship with her husband , emperor franz joseph, from the old school of monarchs. His son, the crown prince, recognizes that the monarchy is on the way out and in real life committed suicide with his mistress. Elizabeth never recovered from that. No such thing happens here, but a version of it does. All the actors are very good, but vicky shines, in an award deserving performance. Although, fictional, this movie is for history buffs as well. The director, marie kruetzer (sp?) provides us with a film without one moment of sentimentality. Very rare. Bravo.",/review/rw8606472/?ref_=tt_urv

",Writer-Director Marie Kreutzer's somewhat cheeky if undernourished costume drama features the ever fascinating Vicky Krieps as the Empress of Austria in the late 1870s.

4 November 2022,whain,1," A complete historical nonsense and stupid
","This film is complete historical nonsense and stupid. The Emperor plucks off his fake beard, the Empress walks around puffing on cigarettes and showing the middle finger. She bangs on the table and doesn't act imperial at all. That is not at all the nature of the true Empress ""Sisi"". She was rather shy, reserved and spoke very softly. If she wasn't happy with something, she just walked away or didn't go at all. The film is supposed to show the aging Empress who, at the age of 40, is no longer an ideal of beauty. At that time, however, it was still very popular and quite handsome. It was the time of the riding stays in England and Ireland where, as is well known, she had received great admiration from the local community - especially from Bay Middleton, one of the best riders.",/review/rw8606472/?ref_=tt_urv

","An interesting movie where we know more about that woman, her status. The relationship between her an her kids. We saw her different difficulties with her weight and the problem of her child's future. The relationship with her husband is great and they have also some good sexual relationship. We saw also the main character masturbate and really have her own pleasure. We have also the birth of the video with the french man who will make pics and will make it move. Great for this century. I dont really know that woman who come from Austria and cant really say if they hade some credibility issues or fidelity but that was great to see and give a certain style to the movie. We have also some problem with that kind of status: the power, the people, the family. I enjoyed anyway the movie and find it pretty interesting in some ways and it have great moments. We have also sometimes some quotes or some stuff that the woman said that can represent the way she thought at the century but it was an interesting movie if you want to know more about that woman.

History might not have allowed Elisabeth the kind of power she wanted, her death in 1898 also bringing her life to a violent close. But Corsage reimagines it all, granting her unexpected agency and, in eventual death, one moment of pure, well-earned freedom.",/review/rw8606472/?ref_=tt_urv

","Being a 58 year old guy, its lucky i did not read the summary of what this film is about. If i did i would not have gone to see this movie. What drew me in was the poster for the film. It says it all and those reviewers who saw this poster before they saw the film, then i say to them 'what did you expect'. The film is gloriously shot and for a while there are warning signs that indicate that the movie may be slow and boring, it grows on you and builds up in layers of atmosphere.

","""Uncharacteristically applying anachronism (like chanteuse Camille's empyrean soundtrack bonanza, so disengaged from the period but superbly attuned to Elisabeth's quandary) and presentism to the period drama, Kreutzer doesn't delimit her film in the 19th century, the emptiness of Elisabeth's consort role can be efficaciously likened to the similar dread of trophy girlfriends/wives whose beauty has sailed past the sell-by date in the modern era, and the mental toll it takes. The gist is if a woman has no anchor in her life, the consequence will be rather grave. Sifting out nuggets from past history, which can edify today's viewers, at the very least, CORSAGE strikes home on that front.""",/review/rw8606472/?ref_=tt_urv

","Christmas 1877. Empress Elisabeth of Austria turns 40, a proud age for a woman in the late 19th century. As the wife of one of the most powerful rulers in Europe, she only has representative duties. Her life is determined by strict courtly rituals, but her own image in public has the greatest power over her, with Elisabeth being held up like a mirror everywhere. It shows a beautiful and graceful young woman, a style icon that was admired and viewed critically in equal measure and an adored role model for many young girls and women of her time. But at the age of 40, it is becoming increasingly difficult for Elisabeth to live up to this ideal.
