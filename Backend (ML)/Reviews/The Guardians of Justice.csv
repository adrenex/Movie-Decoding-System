10 September 2009,TheLittleSongbird,9," Good spirited and absolutely hilarious film!
","True the plot is a little corny, my only criticism of the movie, but Jim Carrey's wonderfully energetic and most of the time hilarious performance more than compensates. Liar Liar is easily one of Carrey's better films, I do confess I will need to see a few more of his movies before concluding which one's his best to save bias. What Liar Liar manages to do is have a slightly corny though very interesting idea, and make into a good spirited and absolutely hilarious film. The script almost the whole time verged on hysterically funny, and there are many priceless scenes, especially the courtroom scene- I needed to go to the bathroom to check I hadn't wet myself from laughing so much. The other performances were great, Cary Elwes was excellent, and the boy was very sweet and charming. Overall, a hilarious movie, that does cheer you up considerably after a hard day, I still chuckle even thinking of it. There is so much to recommend this, but at the end of the day, it is Carrey's picture. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2771362/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2007,Atreyu_II,7," One of Jim Carrey's funniest movies
","This movie is absolutely hilarious! There are few movies as humorous as this one, being ""Mousehunt"" one of those few - another 1997 motion picture.",/review/rw2771362/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2002,DennisLittrell,7," Pants on fire
","Jim Carrey puts so much energy and pure comedic brilliance into this movie that we hardly noticed how corny and hackneyed was the plot or how wearily didactic was the moral lesson for all fathers who neglect their children for the goddess of success. And really we didn't care. What we loved almost as much as Carrey's rubber mouth and oral blockage (like an overheated boiler fighting not to explode) was the premise: a lawyer that can't lie. Now there's an oxymoron! As Carrey tries to explain to his son Max, lawyers need to lie. Actually he says grownups need to lie, which is a truth that we really do not need to exam too closely here. To laugh at something deeply troubling in our nature is a way of dealing with it.",/review/rw2771362/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2000,Anonymous_Maxine,8," Jim Carrey is back in yet another great comedy, although it doesn't quite live up to the spectacular Dumb & Dumber.
","Liar Liar is about a boy who, after being stood up by his big-shot lawyer father one too many times, wishes that for just one day his dad couldn't lie. This wreaks havoc on his personal life and even more on his professional life as a lawyer who makes a living putting criminals back on the streets. ",/review/rw2771362/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2003,Smells_Like_Cheese,10," Jim Carrey's best film!
","Liar Liar is in my top 3 favorite comedies of all time and my favorite Jim Carrey flick! He was just so awesome and hilarious in Liar Liar! Not only did he do mental comedy, but physical comedy that will make your stomach hurt from laughing so much! I'm not kidding when I say that I know a dozen people where we just rehearse the lines from Liar Liar back and forth, because all the scenes are just so memorable.",/review/rw2771362/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,7," Carrey at his best
","I have to admit, I'm probably a little biased with this movie, as it contains two of the things I love the most in any movie; court scenes and Jim Carrey. I'll try my best to be objective in this review, though. The plot is good, and as the film barely takes 90 minutes it's fairly fast-paced(well, for a Jim Carrey comedy, anyway); I don't think there ever passes 5 minutes without one single joke. The acting is fairly good; Jim Carrey is in his element, so it's no surprise that he's good, but I did find both Maura Tierney and Cary Elwes pretty good too. I know that Elwes is English, not American, and after seeing another movie in which he has a strong English accent(Robin Hood: Men in Tights), I was impressed at how well he does American parts as well. The characters are well-written and credible. The humor is great, partly because it's, well, Carrey, but also because unlike some of Carrey's previous roles, this is fairly ""clean"", so teenagers and some kids will be able to enjoy it as well. The theme of the film is great; I mean, we all know that we lie several times a day(heck, it's even been scientifically proved), but what about if we, for one whole day, couldn't tell one single lie? Great theme, provokes some thought and is executed fairly well in the film, though I do think it could have been done a tad better. Overall, I don't have any major complaints with the film though; I guess it could be argued that most of what Carrey does in this film, the comedy and all, is stuff he's done before, but that's OK; it's not any less entertaining here, regardless of the fact that we've seen it(or something similar to it) earlier. The dialog is great, with some very memorable and quotable lines. All in all, a typical Carrey film, which can be a good thing as well as bad; Carrey does exactly what you expect him to, and he's very entertaining and all, but it never transcends the standard level of the typical Carrey comedy. On a final note, I think this(as well as his other work) proves that Tom Shadyac is the best there is at bringing out Carrey's talents(he also directed Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and Bruce Almighty). I recommend it to any fan of Jim Carrey and/or Tom Shadyac. 7/10",/review/rw2771362/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2000,jhaggardjr,10," The best comedy of 1997!
","""Liar, Liar"" was easily the best comedy of 1997. When I saw this when it first came out in theaters I was literally laughing my head off. Jim Carrey gives the best comic performance of his career here as Fletcher Reede, a fast-talking lawyer who's always lying. His son Max doesn't like this one bit. Fletcher promises Max that he'll be at his 5th birthday party. But Fletcher calls and tells his ex-wife Audrey that he can't make it because at the moment he's being seduced by a female partner. Max has had enough. His birthday wish: for one day his father can't tell a lie. And it miraculously comes true! And this is where the movie gets explosively funny. This is the beginning of a long and crazy day for Fletcher. He gets in trouble left and right. Everyone around him thinks he's going crazy. And the habitual liar continuously makes a complete fool of himself. Carrey is the whole show here in what has got to be the craziest, nuttiest, silliest, goofiest, and downright best comic performance of his career. And he's got a terrific cast of actors to support him. Maura Tierney and Justin Cooper shine in the main supporting roles as Audrey and Max, respectably. Swoosie Kurtz, Jennifer Tilly, Amanda Donohoe, Anne Haney, Cary Elwes, Mitchell Ryan, and the late Jason Bernard also generate laughs amongst the craziness. ""Liar, Liar"" is one extremely funny comedy directed by Tom Shadyac who directed another crazy comedy, the aptly titled remake ""The Nutty Professor"". ""Liar, Liar"" has lots of big laughs and I enjoyed it alot. One of the best comedies of all-time.",/review/rw2771362/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2007,mjw2305,7," Gotta love the concept
","Jim Carrey is an attorney, who finds putting his family before his work to be a tough challenge, when he fails to show up at his son's birthday party; his son make a wish that prevents him from lying. With a huge career changing case that is based solely on lies about to go to trial, he is stuck in an unfamiliar position, that may just change his life.",/review/rw2771362/?ref_=tt_urv

",Jim Carrey plays a liar lawyer called Fletcher Reede.His son Max (Justin Cooper) makes a birthday wish that his father can't tell a lie in 24 hours.And the wish comes true. That gets Fletcher in many embarrassing situations.It's hard to tell the truth all the time especially for a lawyer.That's not the only problem Fletcher is having.His ex-wife Audrey (Maura Tierney) is moving to Boston with his boyfriend Jerry (Cary Elwes).That must be stopped.Jim Carrey does incredible role work in this Tom Shadyac's 1997 comedy Liar Liar.Jim is amazing comedian.He can pull his face just like Jerry Lewis.This is completely a Jim Carrey show.There are many hilarious scenes in the courtroom.Liar Liar is for all you liars out there.,/review/rw2771362/?ref_=tt_urv

12 September 2005,StanleyStrangelove,," Cute message movie with Jim Carrey
","Liar Liar is one solution to the problem of what kind of movie vehicle to write for overacting, rubber man Jim Carrey. Following the success of Ace Ventura, director Tom Shaydac casts Carrey as a divorced lawyer who has no time for his young son. In the film, the word liar is a pun on lawyer, equating the two words since his character is a lying lawyer. Every time he promises to attend one of his son's school events or play with him, Carrey finds some excuse to get out of it. His son makes a birthday wish that just for one day his dad would tell the truth and it happens. Carrey is incapable of lying and when he tries to lie, his face and body go into every contortion imaginable as he tries to suppress the truth. There is a literally ""off the wall"" scene where he beats himself up in a bathroom. Carrey is a likable guy and carries the movie. Of course, you can't believe for a second that he's a lawyer but belief is not needed in this film. This is a movie with a message that fathers shouldn't ignore their children. For a film aimed at kids, there is a surprising amount of boob and sexual humor. Maura Tierney is very cute as his ex-wife. Amanda Donohoe plays Carrey's seductress law partner and Jennifer Tilly is a buxom, bimbo client. Director Tom Shadyac later worked with Carrey in Bruce Almighty. Liar Liar is for Jim Carrey fans and fathers who ignore their kids.",/review/rw2771362/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2003,FiendishDramaturgy,8," One of Carrey's best!
","The premise is simple. A heartbroken and often disappointed 5 year old boy makes a birth day wish that his father, a prominent and up-and-coming civil attorney, cannot lie for just one day.",/review/rw2771362/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2006,ccthemovieman-1,6," Has Its Moments, But Wears Thin
","This is another of fairly-early Jim Carrey films in which he played a dopey, exaggerated character that is funny but can wear thin on you after awhile. It's almost exhausting to watch this guy for over more than 45 minutes at one time with all the gyrations, rubber faces, screaming and yelling. I am glad he has mostly abandoned roles like this since the turn of the century and done a lot better work.",/review/rw2771362/?ref_=tt_urv

21 December 2000,mattkratz,," Quite possibly my favorite Jim Carrey role
","This was perhaps my favorite Jim Carrey movie. I found it to be hysterically funny, and Carrey was perfect for the role. His son wishes Carrey can only tell the truth for 24 hours, and it comes true. Unfortunately for Jim, it comes just as he is about to embark on the court case of a lifetime. Watching him go through the motions was a treat, and i guarantee you will love it. You will have to see it to understand, because most of it is too difficult to describe with written words, but it was FUNNY!",/review/rw2771362/?ref_=tt_urv

5 May 2001,Doylenf,," The truth shall set you free---yeah, tell me about it!
","Not since Cary Grant mugged outrageously throughout 'Arsenic and Old Lace' has another actor accomplished what Jim Carrey does here.  In one of his more plausible, more restrained comedy roles--(restrained???--well for Carrey anyway)--he does wonders with voice, looks, expressions and double takes. The storyline is a slim one--can a lawyer who tells lies (seemingly for a living) tell the truth for 24 hours? It's a cute premise and is given its full potential thanks to a witty script and the right actor in the lead. Nobody else in the cast registers strongly because it's pretty much a one man show. Carrey delivers a knockout performance. ",/review/rw2771362/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2020,blott2319-1,9," Superb comedy that still makes me laugh out loud
","I have loved Liar Liar for decades. It came out when Jim Carrey was still at the top of his game, and was a massive box office draw. While goofy things like Ace Ventura and The Mask made him popular, I think that this film is the ultimate example of what he can do as an actor. This movie allows him to have those unhinged moments, but gives an explanation for his insanity that makes it feel relatable instead of idiotic. I love the more heartfelt moments that he includes in the movie as well. He never feels like he's faking it when he's with his son and ex-wife, despite the fact that a few scenes earlier he was flopping around on the ground simply because he couldn't say the color of his pen. The film has a charm that makes it feel authentic even though the premise is crazy, and most of the sane characters would try to have him committed if this were the real world.",/review/rw2771362/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2020,FilmMan47,10," no other actor could do this only jim carrey can do it.
","Pick any film of jim carrey there is not a single actor in the world who can do what he does or even comes close to it when it comes to the comedy or this type of roles,jim carrey outperforms not only others but himself its his this ability that makes him set apart from others ,when others try to do comedy they simply look stupid and boring.this man jim carrey is a legend an icon for a reason..see this funny film and find out yourself.my rating is 10/10",/review/rw2771362/?ref_=tt_urv

23 March 2013,bigverybadtom,1," Could The Movie Have Worked If It Weren't For Jim Carrey?
","My mother, my late aunt, and I picked up this movie because we thought it was going to be good. The concept might have worked, but the problem was that Jim Carrey spoiled everything by his extreme facial mugging. We compared him to Jerry Lewis, whom he was trying to imitate, but even Lewis never twisted his face around so much like Carrey kept doing in this movie. After a half hour, we got sick of it and unloaded the video.",/review/rw2771362/?ref_=tt_urv
