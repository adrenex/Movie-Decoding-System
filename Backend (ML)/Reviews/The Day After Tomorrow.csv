7 March 2009,planktonrules,8," Exceptional, but probably not for younger viewers
","CORALINE is an exceptional movie and I really have to admire the folks who made it. However, I should point out that this is NOT a movie for younger viewers because the movie is basically like walking into a nightmare. I think I'd be very hesitant to take a child younger than 10 to see it--it is that dark and scary.",/review/rw3607543/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2010,Rectangular_businessman,10," A masterpiece
","""Coraline"" is simply one of the best animated films ever made: The plots is brilliantly developed, the animation is detailed and beautiful to look at, the characters are fascinating and interesting, and the world created by Neil Gaiman and Henry Selick it's simply captivating, but mysterious and dangerous and well.",/review/rw3607543/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2009,ccthemovieman-1,10," Another New Standard In Artwork
","Well, it's happened again: another animated movie that can I describe ""the greatest-looking animation I've ever seen!"" (This has happened several times now in the past few years, and especially when them available on a stunning Blu-Ray disc transfer).",/review/rw3607543/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2009,ametaphysicalshark,," Very enjoyable fantasy with superb animation
","Henry Selick's ""Coraline"" is a smart adaptation of Neil Gaiman's extremely popular award-winning novella. Selick's screenplay is excellent and faithful without being a carbon-copy of Gaiman's story, and Selick adds some of his own dialogue to the film, so his contribution is most certainly not only visual, and chooses which dialogue to use from the novel wisely. Less of a horror story than the novella and more of a dark fantasy, ""Coraline"" features a well-written and well-drawn lead character and brings the novel's bizarre world to life without compromise. The film's fantasy world grows more bizarre each time we see it, and is as discomforting as it is fun. I missed the singing rats from the novella, but this was more than compensated for by the visual splendor of the garden scene, and there are numerous other examples of the changes from the novel making total sense as Selick's vision of the story differs from Gaiman, but doesn't betray the original work of art, only compliments it. The voice cast is very good and one cannot praise the spectacular animation enough. I was very pleased with the 3D presentation here, it was very, very rarely (only once or twice) used as a 'cool effect', and overall was very tastefully used to give the visuals more depth. Perhaps the first really good film to have a wide release in 2009, and looking at the next few weeks I see more than one film I'm moderately interested in, so this might end up being a pretty good year.",/review/rw3607543/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2009,jaredmobarak,8," Great, the village stalker  Coraline
","OK America, before you go blindly into an animated film with your young children, why don't you do a little research on what they are about to witness. A PG rating and stop-motion animated aesthetic do not always make a child-friendly adventure. Based upon the horror novella by acclaimed author Neil Gaiman, Henry Selick's Coraline is chockfull of heavy material, dark story threads, and bleak possibilities. For a guy like me, those things equal undivided success; for a child aged ten, those things equal nightmare filled evenings and parents writing angry letters to Focus Features for subjecting their children to lewd and horrific imagery. Well guess what parents? No one is to blame but you. I'm not saying keep all youngsters away, but do use some discretion on whether your son or daughter can handle the fantastical elements. This is very much Alice in Wonderland displayed in all its non-Disney possibilities. A cautionary tale on being careful what you wish for, our heroine must discover the difference between a world of people neglecting her and that of people doing all they can so that they may give her all she could ever want in the future. Life is not about getting it all right now, but instead a slow and steady climb built on love and trust, one whose benefits far outweigh the whirlwind romance that is never truly as it seems.",/review/rw3607543/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2009,Vic_max,," Dark, Stylish, Visually Amazing .... and not really for young kids.
","First - if you see this movie, try to see the 3D version - not all presentations are in 3D. Second, know that this movie is way too dark (IMHO) for kids under 10. Not only could the visuals be too intense, but the pacing is not that of a children's show.",/review/rw3607543/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2009,treadwaywrites,8," An Instant Classic
","Feisty eleven-year-old Coraline walks through a secret door and discovers a parallel reality. That reality is sort of similar to the life she already knows yet deeply unsettling in a number of ways. Coraline (voice of Dakota Fanning) begins a journey of adventure and self discovery when her parents (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman) relocate the family to Oregon from Michigan. No one in this new space has time for her so she spends her time exploring her new neighborhood with an talkative local boy named Wybie Lovat (Robert Bailey Jr.). After discovering the odd neighbors all of whom are true characters, she is still bored somehow.",/review/rw3607543/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2009,claudio_carvalho,8," Dark and Creepy
","When Coraline moves to an old house, she feels bored and neglected by her parents. She finds a hidden door with a bricked up passage. During the night, she crosses the passage and finds a parallel world where everybody has buttons instead of eyes, with caring parents and all her dreams coming true. When the Other Mother invites Coriline to stay in her world forever, the girl refuses and finds that the alternate reality where she is trapped is only a trick to lure her.",/review/rw3607543/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2009,TOMNEL,9," Imaginative story, amazing visuals and uniquely great music.
","Henry Selick's latest movie, and his first in 8 years is a true treat. It was excellent in every way, except for the emotional punch, which wasn't even really necessary. The 3-D is very good, and without the 3-D, though the movie would lack the depth, it still would stand out. It is the visuals that make this movie so great, but the characters, plot and music are all top notch too, which add up to a fantastic film.",/review/rw3607543/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2010,mooitoy,10," Amazing and unique!
","I am eleven years old and I absolutely loved this movie. Every bit of it was fantastic. I read the book before I watched the movie and was quite satisfied. I, for one did not have any nightmares of such. I think adults are completely overestimating what children can't handle. This was a fine movie. But maybe some of the elements weren't appropriate for younger viewers, like when Miss Spink and Forcible were performing in the other world. I may be different then other children because I can tolerate more scary elements. This was creepy and very original. I loved how twisted and strange it was. The movie was very good and I do suggest some of you actually allow yourselves to enjoy it without criticizing the moment you see something that seems inappropriate. I am a huge Neil Gaiman fan and trust me if I can endure The Lost Boys, I am pretty sure I can endure this. Parents, stop being overprotective and allow yourself to see the good things.",/review/rw3607543/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2010,TheLittleSongbird,9," Wonderfully atmospheric with exquisite visuals
","Adapted from Neil Gaimon's book, comes Coraline, a truly wonderful animated film with lots going for it. The atmosphere was wonderful, people may find it too dark, but I for one loved how dark it was. And of course the visuals are absolutely exquisite, I loved the backgrounds, character designs and the darkly bold colours. The music is nice and quirky while having an appropriate atmosphere, while the script is intelligent and well balanced and the story is well paced and compelling with very few dull moments. The characters are great, I love Coraline especially because she is very inquisitive, and I like that in a protagonist, and the voice acting is superb especially from Dakota Fanning and Keith David. Overall, loved the atmosphere, loved the visuals, loved the flick. 9/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw3607543/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2009,DoctorWhy,10," Coraline.
","As a Neil Gaiman fan, I was, of course, very happy with the book ""Coraline"", and was extremely excited to hear that a movie was being made for it. I had very high expectations from director Henry Selick after seeing 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' and 'James and the Giant Peach'.",/review/rw3607543/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2009,uruseiranma,9," Henry Selick's latest film is a delight!
","Almost 3 weeks ago, I attended a screening from Ain't It Cool News to see Henry Selick's latest film, 'Coraline.' I was excited because the screening would showcase the film in 3-D technology, and there was the chance to do a Q&A with Director Henry Selick (unfortunately due to bad weather, Mr. Selick did not make it to our screening).",/review/rw3607543/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2009,ingloriousbasterds,8," Wonderfully imaginative animation; a visual masterpiece
","Henry Selick, the director of "" The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""James and the Giant Peach"", once again takes us to a world full of imagery and wonder...but this time...some of it is actually frightening. It was filled with such magic and enchantment that I completely forgot that it was a dark tale..until the occasional scares filled the air. It has some highly fun and amusing characters in it also, and that is the strongest thing of the movie. After viewing it, I came to the conclusion it was basically an ""Alice in Wonderland"" tale (girl entering new and strange world, plus the cat that talks makes it obvious) but this world has a dark twist. Filled with a great cast and terrific visionary, I feel this movie is fun for all ages (who says kiddos shouldn't be scared?)",/review/rw3607543/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2011,dwarfrunesmith,10," What an artistic movie
","The Movie Coraline is an animated film well worth watching more than once. SPOILER ALERT The movie starts out introducing Coraline, voice actor Dakota Fanning, who is new to the Pink palace and is soon introduced to the black cat, voice actor Keith David, and Wybie Lovat, voice actor Robert Bailey Jr., who both are stalking Coraline. We then meet her mother Mel Jones, voice actor Teri Hatcher, and her father Charlie Jones, voice actor John Hodgman. Corallines' new life is shown to be less than wonderful as she meets her other tenants and is unable to realize her dream of gardening. Soon she discovers another world, which is much better in every way tailored specifically to Coraline based on information gathered by a spying Coraline doll carried by Coraline unknowingly. The other mother quickly turns villainess, as she is unable to get Coraline to do what she wants. With the help of the black cat, Coraline is able to escape the other mother and return home saving other children's souls who were less fortunate than she was. As well as her parents who were trapped to lure Coraline back to the other world.",/review/rw3607543/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2009,renedelagza0,7," Creepy, in a really creative way.
","When i saw a teaser of this film i didn't imagine it would be a fantasy/horror movie for kids. That's great because there aren't many, and it must be difficult to display a colorful world with the right amount of frightening elements not to leave a child having bad dreams up to adulthood.",/review/rw3607543/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2009,bob the moo,," Dark and inventive film even if it is perhaps too scary for particularly young children who will not understand the context and only see images
","I had not heard of the book on which this film is based but the involvement of Selick was enough to convince me that it was worth a look even before the uniform spread of five star reviews of it starting appearing in the media. I wanted to see it even more when some of the same media outlets starting having ""complaints"" from parents who had taken their toddlers to an animated film safe in the knowledge that NOBODY had ever, ever made an animated film that wasn't aimed at toddlers. Well, actually it turns out that, as well as countless other films, this is not a film for very young children – by which I mean children who are not yet old enough to be able to cope with a narrative and be able to take their heads into a story, there is not a specific age on that, which is why generally one expects parents to do the job of weighing that up on behalf of the humans they created.",/review/rw3607543/?ref_=tt_urv

16 February 2009,Turfseer,5," Storyline fails to fulfill its potential despite excellent animation
","Coraline is a film that employs computer enhanced stop action animation. So visually it's sort of a combination of the old and the new. What's more, some theaters show it in 3-D and it was neat wearing the special glasses and occasionally being startled as images seem to be jumping out right off from the screen itself.",/review/rw3607543/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2009,Tweekums,10," Brilliant animation
","Having seen ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" many times and loving every minute of it I was keen to see Henry Selick's latest stop-go animation story. When I learnt that the film was based on a book by Neil Gaiman I was even more certain that I would enjoy it. When I watched ""Coraline"" I was not disappointed in the slightest. I hadn't seen a 3D film since the awful Jaws 3D so wasn't sure how the 3D would work here, thankfully it felt immersive rather than just having the occasional item appear to jump out the screen. Watching on DVD meant wearing red/green glasses which obviously had an effect on the colour of the film, while many colours appeared washed out others appeared much more intense such as Coraline's blue hair and yellow coat. Thankfully this just had the effect of making the film slightly more creepy.",/review/rw3607543/?ref_=tt_urv

28 December 2016,Kirpianuscus,," dark . and useful
","a dark film. creepy, seductive, far to be comfortable but useful. because its theme is one of the most common in every day reality. parents too busy, solitude of a child, temptation of alternatives who, at the first sigh, seems be ideal. Coraline is special for the exploration of well known cultural references and, in same measure, for the science of detail. because it is a film about illusions. a film for adults because it reminds more than presents. because it is an ironic portrait of a society for who to escape from yourself is more interesting than to live.in same measure, it is a beautiful animation. and this is one of the basic motifs to see it. because it has the gift to present the ordinaries details in the perfect light.",/review/rw3607543/?ref_=tt_urv
