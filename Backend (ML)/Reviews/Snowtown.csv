22 August 2002,TxMike,," ""No, this is not a love story, but is a story about love and the power it has over life, the power to heal, or to destroy."" ","Set in the late 1880s in Cuba, Luis (Banderas), a wealthy coffee magnate, places an ad in a Maryland newspaper for a wife, ""because America is the future."" He tells his close friend, ""She is not meant to be beautiful, she's meant to be kind, and true, and young enough to bear children."" You see, Luis also thinks, ""Love is not for me. Love is for those people who believe in it.""  He just needed heirs. The boat is due in at 6AM, they can be married at 9AM, and ""I can be back to work by 10AM.""",/review/rw0687933/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2006,diane-34,9," Much underrated!
","Unfortunately I saw this marvelous film on TV last night-unfortunate because it was on the small TV screen and not a large movie screen. I admit it-I am totally taken by period pieces whose setting is somewhere in Latin America and if those movies have good sets and/or locations then I am smitten. Original Sin, set in Cuba and filmed in Mexico had the visuals down perfect-throw in the acting of Jolie and Banderas and you have a visual feast.",/review/rw0687933/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2003,perfectbond,7," Overlooked erotic thriller
","Original Sin slipped under the radar and in fact tanked at the box office back in the summer of 2001 despite the fact that it starred Angelina Jolie at the peak of her fame. The movie itself is not bad at all. There are surprises a plenty which of course I won't reveal. Since the expected doesn't occur that provides plenty of incentive to follow the story through to the end. Since the movie is an erotic thriller there are of course... erotic scenes! Ms. Jolie is definitely an attractive woman by conventional standards! It goes without saying that her smoldering looks keep the viewer fixated on her character, Julia. Banderas fans should note that his chemistry with a female costar hasn't been this good since his hookup with Catherine Zeta-Jones in Zorro.  Thomas Jane, whose other work I am not familiar with, is also excellent in his role. Very good entertainment, 7/10.",/review/rw0687933/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," fantastic love story.
","This is a tragic story. Angelina and Antonio make for a very enticing pairing but nothing is as it seems. Can love really exist or is all a double-sided blade of emotions and illusions, lies and deception?",/review/rw0687933/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2004,Pookyiscute,," wow...
","This movie was surprising to put it mildly.  When I saw the cover, I figured it was going to be just your typical dark love story...ha ha, guess again. This movie was awesome!  Not only does it keep you guessing throughout the entire story, you can't help but notice all of the eye stoppers.  The cinematography was absolutely stunning, the filming locations were impeccable for beautiful scenery and spots, and the graphic love scenes...well, as much as I could have done without them, they certainly did add a lot to the film.  Every part of the movie was exceptionally well done, and I fell in love with this piece.",/review/rw0687933/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2005,el_nickster,8," One of the better ""Erotic Thrillers""
","The film's plot, script, and acting are only average, but the film is buoyed by some sizzling chemistry between Jolie and Banderas. Their sex scenes are extremely memorable, so make sure you get an un-edited version (unrated).",/review/rw0687933/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2001,Minerva_Meybridge,10," il Purgatorio
","It is unfortunate that American audiences appear to want three things in a film: action, action and more action.  Original Sin is a tale of emotion. With beautiful cinematography, wonderful costumery, the plot is rivalled only by Hitchock's Vertigo.",/review/rw0687933/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2004,QueenMakeda84,," Surprisingly Good
","I was pleasantly surprised at this film. Thinking it was more or less about Jolie's T&A, it actually had a decent plot with some twists and turns running throughout. I liked this film a lot. Her character had many levels that you didn't see coming. It seemed like a one dimensional character as most temptresses are, but Jolie was nothing of the sort. She attacked the role with her usual vigor and gave life to what could have been a meaningless character. Banderas was a little overdone I think, but it kinda makes sense with the lines he was given. Being all obsessed with his wife like that can make you seem overly dramatic. I'd recommend it.",/review/rw0687933/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2002,cerasea,10," If truly watched, you cannot walk away from loving this gem!
",Usually I rely on the voting averages to give me an idea of how good a movie is. I have to admit that a 5.6 rating is much different from what I would give this film.,/review/rw0687933/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2003,georgeleague,9," I loved it.
","No long comment here.  I just thought it was a great movie. A lot if intrigue and plot twists, and of course, Angelina Jolie and Antonio Banderas were well matched as lovers. There was a lot more to this movie than just the sex scenes.  10/10.",/review/rw0687933/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2001,Quinoa1984,6," Enough to make it watchable
","Original Sin, a movie with scandal, surprises, and a whole lotta love (I mean the physical kind) has Antonio Banderas as a wealthy Mexican coffee maker owner who orders a mail order bride (weird to have this in 1900) played by Angelina Jolie.  They get married, seem to start falling in love, but then the film turns into a twisting film.  These twists give some great scenes of power for Banderas and Jolie to work off of, plus a excellent amount of sex and nudity from Jolie and a good feeling for the movie throughout.  Unfortunately, the film has some flaws including an overused music score, overacting, scenes that make the film confusing, and an ending that had me a little dissapointed, then really dissapointed.  Still , it's OK.  Thomas Jane has some wicked fun playing a, uh, detective. B",/review/rw0687933/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2003,ldavis-2,3," ""Cheap Melodrama""
","I rented the unrated version because of - I admit it - the sex scene. What a letdown! As I watched, I kept thinking: ""aren't they supposed to be in love?"" because they sure didn't act like it. There was no romance, no nothing. Like two wild animals. It left me cold.",/review/rw0687933/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2007,aj-to,9," The rating is an original sin
","Now here is a film that that makes the most of this medium and gives it its worth beside or, if you like, above a book. The settings were so beautiful: the environments, the historical portraying, the story, the clothing and, not the least to mention, the acting. I so much admire the skill of creating such a masterpiece; it's like depicting one's dream to become reality. There has been paid so much attention to every detail, you can tell the director is a true artist. And I must say, the play of Jolie and Banderas is excellent and they fit so well in their roles! What's that with the low ratings? Have people lost their sense of beauty? Or is this site mainly used by that flat type of action lover? Is recognition of quality a dying feature? Let's not hope so; for it would be an eternal sin to be, for lack of interest, restrained of these kind of movies in future.",/review/rw0687933/?ref_=tt_urv

","A provocative film and this is one of basic motives to see it. Because it use traits of Lationo soup opera , in inspired manner, beautiful locations and gives the chances to Angelina Jolie, Thomas Jane and Antonio Banderas to seduce in a smart game of ambiguities.

","I found this movie very stirring.  I found the chemistry between Banderas and Jolie so enthralling. Leaves you breathless and wanting more.  Jolie is the perfect actress to play this bad girl with such grace and sexuality. Banderas becomes every woman's ideal...rich, handsome, passionate, and that ACCENT!!

27 April 2008,Jax0524,10," A real story about love
",This is one of the most tasteful romantic dramas I have ever seen I absolutely loved it the chemistry between Angelina and Antonio was superb I didn't really mind the sex scenes as much I thought they were pretty tasteful and fufilled their purpose. I also thought Angelina was perfect for the role of julia/bonnie she really captures the essence of the femme fatale and I greatly sympathized with her character she wasn't really playing a villain she was more influenced by her accomplice/lover Billy who manipulates and twists her mind into thinking that no one could ever love her.In my opinion Julia/Bonnie was struggling with inner emotions and was even more confused by what she was feeling for Luis which is why she tries her hardest to deny that Luis does indeed love her. My favorite moments in the movie is when the two Luis and Julia are arguing in the hotel and Luis goes into a rage telling julia how much he loves her and the last few scenes in the movie when Julia poisons Luis' coffee and Luis practically pours his heart out before willingly drinking the poison telling Julia he loves all of her good and bad inspite of all the hell she put him through(I even cried a little. I totally recommend this movie to anyone who isn't looking for a simple cliché love story,/review/rw0687933/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2010,moonspinner55,3," Flagrantly ridiculous; one can have a good time laughing at it in spite of Antonio's strong performance...
","A wealthy, handsome businessman in 1880s Havana advertises in the States for a marriageable woman to sail to his country, become his bride, and bear his children; however, the sultry, lusty young thing who arrives from Delaware curiously bears no resemblance to the photograph she has sent (she's even hotter!), and soon a private detective is snooping about asking questions. Cornell Woolrich's novel ""Waltz Into Darkness"" would seem an ideal murder-mystery/sexual thriller to absorb a modern-day audience (as a storyteller, Woolrich was far ahead of his time), but writer-director Michael Cristofer doesn't have the teasing personality, nor the sure-handed style, to bring out the juicy twists of this tale. Leads Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie look good together in and out of their clothes, but his forceful, full-blooded acting eclipses hers by a mile. Jolie is not convincing in this period setting; she has little range and, once the camera begins feasting upon her features in Mount Rushmore-like close-ups, her focus visibly wavers (it's a dreadful performance). Told in flashback, we are immediately privy to Jolie's mysteries, with an outcome that defies explanation. Cristofer intermittently tries out different photographic tricks and editing techniques, presumably to pad the running time but in effect showing off his uncertainty as a filmmaker. The dialogue (and Jolie's indifferent delivery of it) is often ludicrously funny, though Banderas deserves credit for at least attempting to take his part of the project seriously. *1/2 from ****",/review/rw0687933/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2001,baumer,6," I wanted to leave, then I liked it, then I wanted to leave again...
","With much trepidation I ventured to go see Original Sin.  It was with hesitation and angst because I really didn't think there was much to look forward to in the film.  The trailers didn't make it look overly appealing and to be honest I really didn't hear much from the stars in the promotion department.  But, today it is about 45 degrees here in Toronto ( that is about 110 for our metrically challenged American friends ) and even though I had pretty much seen everything else, the idea of spending 2 hours in an air conditioned theater and only paying six dollars to see the film, appealed to me.  So I did.  And to be honest, I can't decide if it is a film that I enjoyed or I despised or if it is somewhere in between.  There were times when I was mildly interested, times when I was emotionally involved and there were many times when I was completely apathetic to it.  So what do I say about a film that makes me feel so much yet so little.  Well it was better than many of the teen gross out comedies that have come out in the past few years and not as good as almost every other film I have seen.  So that means it rates around a 6 out of 10.",/review/rw0687933/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2004,whpratt1,10," Jolie & Bonderas Burn Up the Screen!
","This film was fantastic for the great acting performed and the beautiful location in Mexico and great photography.  Antonio Bonderas (Luis Antonio Vargas),""Imagining Argentina,""'03, ordered a bride who was really very much like himself in many ways.  However, Angelina Jolie (Julia Russell),""Taking Lives"",'04, had a mind of her own and enjoyed all sorts of men, especially Actors who played the DEVIL! The film kept you guessing about where this love between these two lovers was really going to lead us.  Antonio and Julia made a charming couple and especially when they were both involved in gambling with cards.   There were hot scenes in the bed and a giant old time bath tub which got quite steamy!  Angelina Jolie looked very beautiful and the close ups of her face and lips were FANTASTIC! ENJOY.",/review/rw0687933/?ref_=tt_urv

25 April 2003,michaelRokeefe,4," You can not just walk away from lust in love.
","It is the 1880s and Cuba is a hotbed of commerce and personal manipulations. A wealthy businessman(Antonio Banderas) is thrust into a dizzy world of danger and mystery after marrying a sensationally beautiful woman(Angelina Jolie). Her past governs her future and her newlywed husband is obsessed with giving her his whole world. The story line seems at times a bit haphazard; but the steamy love scenes are worth more than the cost of admission. And we are talking about full redeeming nudity, because the story's very meaning lies within. Banderas has not been this powerful since MASK OF ZORRO(1998). And Miss Jolie evokes sex period. The sizzle between the two is what holds the movie together. In supporting roles are Thomas Jane and Jack Thompson. This movie may not be the best or even that memorable; but it will damn sure give you something to talk about.",/review/rw0687933/?ref_=tt_urv
