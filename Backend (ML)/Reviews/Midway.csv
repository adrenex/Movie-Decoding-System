1 January 2013,EephusPitch,7," 40, down
","Wow, this film seems to be generating a lot of hostility: I am not quite sure what's behind it. I guess people went into this expecting a sitcom-like, snappy feel good film, like 40 Year Old Virgin? Or goofy, happy-go-lucky characters such as Seth Rogen's posse in Knocked Up? Did these people not see Funny People? I am all in favor of letting Mr. Apatow develop as a director. To be clear here: this film follows Pete and Debbie's story arc from a few years after the events in Knocked Up. The are both turning 40, and neither is handling it particularly gracefully, but they weren't handling their lives and relationships particularly well in the earlier film. I found this movie to have a Larry David Show quality to it: however irrationally and offensively our protagonists behave, there are always others who will go them one better (or worse). Yes, Debbie and Pete are defective human beings; but so, I would argue, are all the people inhabiting this world, excepting the very gentlemanly Graham Parker (and Billie Joe Armstrong). Such is the stuff of comedy. Are these caricatures? Surely, and yet they are caricatures of realities which I see every day. Is the teenage daughter given to histrionics? You bet, but that is what teenagers are like, and the fact remains that teenagers turn their parents into equally irrational and histrionic characters in that relationship; I actually found it refreshing to find a teenager in a movie, played by a teenager, who isn't a wisecracking savant commenting on the follies of her elders.",/review/rw2726545/?ref_=tt_urv

4 January 2014,A_Different_Drummer,7," .. makes sense only if you are actually ARE Judd Apatow
","You may recall a major hit a few years ago entitled KNOCKED UP by Director Judd Apatow. You may also remember the ""other"" couple in that film, the secondary characters, the characters that the main characters ""played against"" for dramatic exposition. Well, Director Apatow, for reasons that are less than clear, decided to not only do a follow=up film to that hit, but to base said film on the second couple, the couple most viewers who saw the first film have likely forgotten. Wait, it gets better. The actress who played the wife in the original film (ie, in the ""second"" couple) is Leslie Mann, who, by coincidence, is Apatow's wife in real life. And, ergo, the star of the current film. See? And -- if you like coincidences, you will love this -- Mann herself turned 40 years old the same year that this film was made. So -- let's sum up for those of you having trouble with all this, which should be most of you -- Apatow took the secondary characters from a hit film and made a brand new film about middle aged married people, casting his very own wife. In other words, he decided to do a film about his own marriage. The reviewers have so far been less than kind about his film -- one major reviewer suggesting that all the characters are so horrible he wanted to sell the bunch of them to white slavers -- but one suspects Apatow could care less. This is the film he wanted to make and he made it. Deal with it. Comments... * if you are married, you will ""get"" a lot of the set pieces in the film. If you are not, you won't. In fact if you are not married, this film may possibly damage you for actual marriage, and should be avoided simply on the grounds of public policy. * Leslie Mann is one of the most photogenic actresses in Hollywood and under different circumstances probably deserved an entire film of her own, just like this one. In fact, she steals entire scenes from Meghan Fox. However, all things considered, these are NOT those circumstances... * overall a forgettable film. Unless you actually are Judd Apatow",/review/rw2726545/?ref_=tt_urv

Paul and Debbie, who lies about her age, are turning 40 and they are planning a party for Paul. He lost his job in Sony and now he has a nostalgic record label with only one artist, the British rock singer and songwriter Graham Parker that was successful in the period from the 60's to the 80's.

9 February 2013,napierslogs,4," Dragging out unfunny comedy with rude characters
","The supporting characters of ""Knocked Up"" (2007) have matured. Married couple Pete (Paul Rudd) and Debbie (Leslie Mann) are turning 40. This does not mean that writer, director Judd Apatow has matured. It's a bit more of a dramedy than some of his other comedic adventures but it's still his typical low-brow humour spread out for over two hours. The characters are older, more assured in who they are, but their responses to life are less cultured.",/review/rw2726545/?ref_=tt_urv

","Debbie (Leslie Mann) and Pete (Paul Rudd) are both homing in on 40, a breakthrough age, where youth is now firmly behind us, highlighted by their elder teenage daughter Sadie (Maude Apatow) going through her puberty. Far from a dysfunctional family nonetheless Debbie and Pete struggle to rekindle the attachment and mutual fulfillment that this marriage has brought forth. Pete is a loving father, despite the fact that Sadie was never planned, he affectionately tries to perform his duties, even if his love for rock music places him as somewhat of a family outsider. Coupled with his ailing music label, dedicated to the old timer music lovers, Pete is increasingly left alone.",/review/rw2726545/?ref_=tt_urv

3 October 2013,mitchco10,2," ""This is 40"" IS WORTHLESS!
","I just sat through ""This is 40"" , and I think they should rename it ""This is Pointless"". This self indulgent , sloppy , lazy , whiny excuse for a movie should have never seen the light of day , and to think it made nearly $80 million at the box office is an embarrassment to people who have any taste for good filmmaking. While I have enjoyed some of the previous films of Judd Apatow, It seemed the studio had so much confidence in his previous track record that they just gave him a bunch of money and said ""Do whatever you want"" , and that's what he did , and that's what we got. The enormous waste of talents like Paul Rudd , Albert Brooks , John Lithgow , etc. , is glaring , and I was just waiting for something, anything to happen in the movie to break up the monotony. The use of Apatows two daughters , non actors they are , was as annoying as the obvious lack of a script , and the fact that a lot of the movie seemed to be ad libbed , and really had nowhere to go, and basically wasn't the least bit interesting , or funny , just annoying. The movie went on and on for over two hours , weaving it's little plot of this annoying, self absorbed little family , the plot was about How Paul Rudds' record label was struggling , how Leslie Mann , playing his wife, ran a store which was losing money from a possible thieving employee , and how their daughters were driving them crazy with their daily demands. All in all , I had to go ""Who the hell cares?"" These self absorbed , totally unlikeable , totally unbelievable characters had nothing to say , nowhere to go , and nothing to do. If I'm ever going to see another Apatow project , I hope he gets his head out of his butt, and can make a movie with interesting characters and situations, instead of the loathsome , uninteresting characters and storyline that go nowhere, which is what this movie is.",/review/rw2726545/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2021,vithiet,7," Decent Apatow movie you might enjoy more if you can relate
","While I'm in my 40s I am single and childless but I hear enough stories from people around me (same age, middle class Californians) to know this movie is actually touching on what are real world situations for some people. So I didn't feel like there was much overdramatization as most critics point out. I also didn't feel like it was too long as I did enjoy the story, dialogues, etc. So I didn't think it felt drawn out. At the end of the day, most of the jokes work, plot and characters are engaging, and so there is enough to enjoy despite having nothing extremely original to rave about.",/review/rw2726545/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2012,griaustiniss,9," A quality comedy which is rare to find these days
","Wasn't expecting much before watching the movie, but was pleasantly surprised. Firstly and most importantly the comedy was not lame. The jokes were down to earth, made sense and made me laugh sincerely. This rarely happens with all those stupid comedies nowadays. Secondly - the topic and the storyline was so relevant in regards to relationships and families of our society. Though it is a comedy genre - but underneath that you can fell that the problems and situations that are being touched are important and worth thinking about. The performances by Paul Rudd, Leslie Mann and Maude Apatow - were amazing. Paul and Leslie were perfect, but also my respects to the youngest cast members, as they were convincing and did their part flawlessly.",/review/rw2726545/?ref_=tt_urv

6 January 2013,chazzo-crw,6," I gave it a 10 because I didn't think anyone else would.
","First and foremost, this is the first movie I have seen in years that actually has something to do with my life. I read through the threads, and I wasn't surprised that people found it depressing. They were probably expecting to see Knocked Up or I Love You Man. It lacks the stoner cool single guys being all zany about porn. Instead the comedy comes from things that forty somethings deal with: mortgage, kids, hormones, diet, expectations, etc. I rarely get to see a movie about people my age or having problems and solutions that don't involve guns, drugs, superheroes, cartoon birds, and people who have 8 figure life styles without ever having a job. Okay, so he's a groovy record co. guy, and she has a chic boutique.... Definitely way more California than my life, but still it is pretty real to life. I will concede that there are some gags that don't quite work, but like I said: I'm stickin' up for this one because I think it is getting a bad rap based on expectations. Thanks to Judd Apatow for making a movie about life instead of (hip jobs aside) hyper-situational life.",/review/rw2726545/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2012,zardoz-13,10," Fantastically Funny!!!
","""Funny People"" director Judd Apatow's hilarious comedy ""This Is 40"" concerns the trials and tribulations of a Generation X couple approaching middle-age with two daughters and debt mounting up around them. This Southern California based laffer qualifies as funny, straightforward, and full of insight. Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann play Pete and Debbie so convincingly that you'd swear they are real-life spouses. Actually, Mann and the two daughters belong to Apatow.. If you saw an earlier Apatow comedy ""Knocked Up"" (2007) with Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl, you may remember that they played supporting roles. Five years older by the time this comedy rolls around, Pete owns a small music recording business while Debbie runs a boutique. Things aren't all they would seem in this paradise. This vaguely affluent pair are suffering mid-life crises as well as financial problems. Predictably, everything works out by fade-out, but this doesn't mean it will be easy for them during the 132 minutes that ""This is 40"" runs. Nothing about this melodrama seems phony, except that Pete and Debbie lives in dream world and seem oblivious to the outside world. What makes this movie so comedy is that you enjoy watching them smash up on the rocks of middle-age along with everything else they have to negotiate to return to normalcy. Apatow has written some sizzling dialogue, liberally laced with the F-word. I lost count after about 50 or 60 F-words. No, ""This is 40"" isn't fit for younger ears, but adults who've had to put up with larger-than-life fantasy films will find this a refreshing change-of-pace.",/review/rw2726545/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2019,masonsaul,8," Very funny but lacking in plot
","This Is 40 is a very funny comedy that's also got some good emotional moments but doesn't really have much of a plot. Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann give great performances and have amazing chemistry. Albert Brooks, John Lithgow, Maude Apatow and Iris Apatow are all really good. The jokes are consistently really funny throughout. Judd Apatow's direction is great and it's well filmed. It's also well paced and the music by Jon Brion is good.",/review/rw2726545/?ref_=tt_urv

","First off--this is well worth seeing, it is consistently funny--and at times keel-over funny. However if you're looking for a meaningful plot that gets neatly wrapped up, that's not gonna happen.

6 January 2013,LeoReich1,8," Apatowian genius
","Judd Apatow is undoubtedly directly at the centre of the USA's comedy universe. Discovering and nurturing stars such as Seth Rogen, Jason Segel and Jonah Hill, and with movies like Superbad, Bridesmaids and Anchorman to his name, Apatow has earned the power to make movies about anything he wants, starring whoever he wants. And so we have This is 40, the fourth film that he has written, directed and produced (after The 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up and the far weaker Funny People). Starring his wife, Leslie Mann and two kids, Maude and Iris, and filmed on the Apatow's street, this is bordering on autobiographical- even Judd's 90 year old grandmother makes an appearance.

27 December 2012,Planetpulp,2," Stay away from this movie
","I just saw this movie last night. I was a fan of Knocked up even though my wife and I fought like cats and dogs after the movie (it was about having kids. This time around, the movie did only one thing for me, it made me thankful for my family. Leslie Mann's character was even more of a raving bitch than in Knocked up. I told my wife that I would have shoved her head in the toilet when she was trying to inspect it to see if Paul Rudd's character was really taking a crap or just avoiding her. He was probably defecating on paper so he could help make this film. Actually only Paul Rudd really brought anything to the picture unless you count Megan Fox as a hot boutique worker. The film showcases a small part of the miserable lives of Pete and Debbie as they spiral into unhappiness and misery. Into the mix are thrown several more characters who are equally miserable. I was looking forward to this movie big time and when I realized that it was going south I couldn't wait for it to be over. Unfortunately its over two hours long. So, if you are looking for a way to spend a few hours in the dark, lock your self in a closet or just close your eyes but do not go see this film--it sucked!",/review/rw2726545/?ref_=tt_urv

",All these people that gave this movie terrible ratings need to lighten up ! First many of the actors are also comedians! If you can't handle mature dark humor than this movie isn't for you . Real people have to deal with a lot of things on their plate . The two main characters are dysfunctional individuals trying to make sense out of their crazy lives . The only part that I thought was over the top was the reaction to the child that said negative things about their older daughter . What they said could be outright threats that could be criminally charged. But at the end of the day it is a dark comedy. I like the ending.

10 November 2013,Jerghal,5," Self indulgent nagfest
","It's hard to feel sorry for people who live in a $900.000 house, drive a 5 series BMW and a Lexus SUV, own a large heated swimming pool, use iPhones/iPads/iMacs, have a Spine surgeon as a father and who organise large garden BBQ parties. These 'poor' characters are bogged down by simple superficial problems that could be easlily solved and are plagued by their Mid-life crisis', coz their relationship doesn't feel as fresh anymore. Mediocre acting by Leslie Mann & Paul Rudd makes you care even less about the outcome of this 137 min long self indulgent nagfest.

25 March 2013,KineticSeoul,4," More uncomfortable to sit through than actually funny
","This is more of a uncomfortable movie to sit through than actually funny because of it's wits and how it's true to real life. The movie is basically about a married couple that has 2 kids dealing with there marriage and struggling...In a very immature way. I guess they had to be a bit immature for this movie to work or it would just be like watching 2 people bicker and argue back and forth. The actress Leslie Mann who plays the wife and Paul Rudd who plays the husband are both really ballsy in this. And goes in areas that almost any actors or actresses would be uncomfortable to be going towards. But they play it off very naturally. Watching this movie was like watching ""Chang-Up"" except basically only focusing on Jason Bateman's side of things. And the movie ""The Descendants"" because the two kids in that movie reminded me of the two kids in this movie, except they are more annoying in this one. I am not quite sure what the message about this movie is though. Like you shouldn't get married because it's nothing but struggles and unhappiness. Or through those struggle you will bond and get close or something. When it comes to the humor it sticks to Apatow's trademark of adding sex, insulting and bickering, pop-culture and toilet humor in a crude way, except not that funny this time around. But yeah with the arguing and stuff this one was more uncomfortable to sit through than it actually being funny. Maybe when I 40 I might understand this movie a bit better and find it amusing.",/review/rw2726545/?ref_=tt_urv
