9 July 2011,claudio_carvalho,9," A Wonderful and Entertaining Tale of Love and Friendship
","Manny is anxious with the pregnancy of Ellie and builds a playground for the offspring. Meanwhile, Scrat disputes an acorn with the female Scratte and they fall in love with each other while Diego feels old since he is unable to catch a gazelle. The lonely Sid feels jealous of Manny and Ellie and when he finds three dinosaur eggs in an underground cave, he steals and brings them to the surface. He hatches the eggs during the night and on the next morning, three dinosaur babies believe that Sid is their mother and follow him everywhere. ",/review/rw3517666/?ref_=tt_urv

","Frankly, I was shocked this movie was so good. I mean, sequels aren't supposed to this entertaining, are they? This Ice Age series - three films, so far - just keeps getting better and better, funnier and funnier.",/review/rw3517666/?ref_=tt_urv

1 July 2009,RichardSRussell-1,8," A Joyous Delight
","I haven't had so many laff-out-loud moments in a movie for a long time. There's about an even mix of verbal and visual gags in this 3rd installment of the Ice Age family saga, they're all fresh instead of hackneyed, and they all work. You wouldn't think a film set in the age of mammoths would be able to run a parody of the old ""red wire vs. blue wire"" time-bomb scenario, but they find an ingenious way to do it.",/review/rw3517666/?ref_=tt_urv

28 June 2009,saarvardi,9," Ice Age 3 delivers the goods, and appeals to grown-ups and kids alike
","My wife and I attended an early press screening for the third Ice Age installment two weeks ago and had a wonderful time. The film easily tops the second outing of the series, and is right on par with the first - with just the right mixture of new characters and settings vs. the older ones we've all grown to love (especially Scrat. I can watch a whole movie with this guy).",/review/rw3517666/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2014,hayashimegumi,8," How not to become a fan of Ice Age after watching this?
","This is second film series that I did a personal research on and there are many negative reviews. I don't understand why most film critics and movie reviewers don't like this film. It is understandable for the first two films as there are plenty of shortcomings but this film is certainly so much better than predecessors. Not to mention, this film series is also rightfully children films; you can't expect it not to be lovable and be more appealing to children. There are already thousands of films out there that are more appealing to adults more than children and while their opinions may not affect all the audience worldwide... Come on, don't be harsh!

21 June 2009,shanpanjwani,9," An excellent and welcome addition to the Ice Age franchise
","I saw this film earlier today, since it was a sneak preview, and I must say, it was fabulous! When I first heard about the sneak preview, I actually had some doubts about whether to go or not. I recently went to a sneak preview of the proposal, which wasn't half bad, but the theater wasn't even half full!!! when i got into this one, all but the fist two rows were completely full! Still i got a great seat. As for the movie, it was great. All the characters had their fair share of laughs, and they all were equally great! The story revolves around change: Manny and Ellie are together, she is pregnant, Diego wants to move on, and Sid wants to belong and have a family. In order to attain his goal, he goes to look for some friends, but falls through a sheet of ice in the process. He then sees three eggs which turn out to be dinosaur eggs, and believes that they were abandoned. He takes them, and chaos ensues. I would reveal more of the plot, but that could take hours! It may seem like a thin plot if you haven't seen the movie or read the script, but once you do, you will realize just how dense the storyline really is. The cinematography is spectacular, the pop culture references(past and present) are very creative, and the addition of real d 3D just adds more to the film: it is perhaps the best 3D I've seen! Also, all the characters, as said earlier, are also great, but new additions, such as the dinosaurs, and of course Simon Pegg as Buck, are also very funny. There is also times where some of the jokes from Manny seem like the material that made Ray Romano a household name! However, the tie that binds the movie together is the emphasis on the main theme-family and friendship. There are some very dramatic scenarios that display them throughout the movie, and even allow you to feel like you can relate. Since most triquels like Shrek the Third and Spiderman 3 are considered to be clunkers, this will surely be a breath of fresh air to the sub-genre, and is definitely worthy of being an addition to the Ice Age trilogy. A must see in 3D!!! 9/10",/review/rw3517666/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2010,dudedazzreviews,7," A cool addition to the Ice Age series
","I'm a fan of the Ice Age movies and I think they're quite funny to watch and it's one for kids and adults but is a trilogy always a good idea? After Ice Age 2: The Meltdown, a lot has happened for these lovable characters. Now that Ellie and Manny are together, they are going to have a baby which leaves Manny wanting everything to be perfect for when the addition arrives. Diego is bored and takes a look at his attitude and wonders if he's too laid-back about everything. Ice Age wouldn't be Ice Age without Scrat who is still trying to catch that acorn but has met his match when female sabre-tooth squirrel, Scratte, wants the acorn too. After Sid sees how happy Manny and Ellie are, he wants a family of his own so he steals three dinosaur eggs which leads to Sid being kidnapped to a weird underground world where his friends have to save him.",/review/rw3517666/?ref_=tt_urv

3 July 2009,kirk-246,10," Fun for everyone.
","6 hours ago,I went to the movies to catch the 4:40 showing of 'Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs' with my older sister and her boyfriend.I liked the first movie but I haven't seen the second,but that didn't stop me from wanting to see the 3rd installment in the popular series.Boy,am I glad that I spent money and 94 minutes of my life by seeing this.The movie was packed with humor,action,adventure,interesting characters,and even some heart.There are many relationships between characters in this movie that help it from melting.Manny and Ellie are 2 happy woolly mammoths who are expecting a baby.Scrat,the squirrel who continues on his hunt for acorns,meets a female squirrel named Scratee(Scrah-tay),and falls for her.Sid becomes a parent when he discovers 3 eggs underground.In short,I loved this movie.",/review/rw3517666/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2009,TheUnknown837-1,5," all the charm and wit that made the first two ""Ice Age"" pictures so wonderful has withered away and what we're left with is an entirely forgettable third installment
","Isn't it quite amusing that seven years ago, the creators of ""Ice Age"" declared that there would be no dinosaurs in their saga? In a way, that was false right from the start. Remember, there was a dinosaur frozen in ice in the first movie, two prehistoric marine animals let loose in the second, and now here we are, and a tyrannosaurus rex is stomping around having left a subterranean underground prehistoric world in search of her eggs. The idea of reusing the old underground prehistoric world and incorporating it with the Ice Age saga is enough evidence to tell that the filmmakers are running out of ideas. The animation is still top-notch, the voice-acting is great, and the intentions are still good, but the charm and wit and magic that made the first two movies so much fun has withered away and what we are left with is a cheap thirty-minute cartoon expanded into a feature-length movie. ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" is a movie made strictly for profit and not for entertainment. It's not really a bad movie, but unlike its two predecessors, it's completely forgettable.",/review/rw3517666/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2009,dobbin-4,5," Sometimes funny, sometimes not
","This is the third movie in the highly enjoyed Ice Age trilogy and after the fantastic first one and sadly slightly lackluster second movie, my reactions when I heard of this movie was that of not caring. But when I had seen everything else at the cinema I went, and I must say this movie was pretty entertaining. Its plot, while predictable kept me entertained and the character's were kept true to their usual self's.",/review/rw3517666/?ref_=tt_urv

4 July 2009,DICK STEEL,6," A Nutshell Review: Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs
","I think Ice Age has already established a strong franchise, and if it sticks to its own narrative formula, it should still find some legs to carry on the laughs with more movies to come, since the character base keeps on expanding, and unless the box office receipts tells the filmmakers otherwise. Like the adage goes, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.",/review/rw3517666/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2009,troykleasner,7," Surprised that I enjoyed it.
","Not a bad flick. I don't remember liking the first one, skipped the second one and the only reason I went to see this one was because it was a ""sneak preview"" that started right after the movie I had gone to see and it was in 3D. I recommend seeing this one in 3D as it was worth the extra couple dollars. I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The story was really stupid and didn't make any sense (dinosaurs living under the ice???), but it kept me interested the entire movie, partly because of the hilarious side story with the acorn loving animal and an excellent job by Simon Pegg as Buck the weasel(I just got done watching his TV show ""Spaced"" so maybe I am a little partial), who I had no idea was going to be in the movie. This movie also did a wonderful job of keeping everyone in the audience interested. The theater was packed and the only things you heard besides the movie was popcorn chomping and laughter, lots of laughter. Definitely worth seeing at the theater.",/review/rw3517666/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2009,C-Younkin,5," Mediocre third flick
","A meltdown couldn't stop the ""Ice Age"" crew the last time so now the filmmakers are upping the ante with dinosaurs. Does it make sense? No. If this third film in the series does as well as the first two, will Manny, Sid, and Diego next contend with aliens? I wouldn't put it past them. Heck, the only thing that's really supposed to make sense here is that these movies are trying to capitalize on a hit franchise. (""Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" even more so as it rolls into theaters in not just 2-D but 3-D as well.) Just much like the third ""Shrek"", this is a forgettable and hollow installment, fine for kids but sure to have older fans of the series checking their watches.",/review/rw3517666/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2009,popcornposse,8," A simple story executed to near perfection.
","Its all about family in essence. Starting one, keeping one, becoming one, protecting one. A family film about family is always going to ring the right bells (unless Eddie Murphys in it), and this is no exception! It's funny, its sharp, it's clever, and when it wants too will tug on your heart strings. It's everything a great family film should be. It has just as much humour to keep the grown ups happy as it does the kids.",/review/rw3517666/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2020,BabelAlexandria,8," Ice Age Mammals. DINOSAURS. Enough Said.

14 September 2009,kosmasp,9," Best 3-D movie yet!
","There have been quite a few movies in 3-D lately (and there are more to come), but at this moment (Pixars Up is not available to review yet), this is the best of them. It's not the effects, that make this movie wonderful. They are nice, but I'm sure there will be better ones shortly (like in the movie Avatar by James Cameron). It's the movie/the story itself that convinces! ",/review/rw3517666/?ref_=tt_urv

2 July 2009,Guardian_of_the_Tomato,6," Captivating Visuals, Humdrum Story
","Many reviewers have stated that if you liked the first one, you'll love the second one and worship the third one. Not so. The original Ice Age told a genuine and well-crafted tale, and remains the only compelling film of the trilogy. The sequel, Meltdown, delved into nonsensical antics with little to no plot support. Alas, the third film follows a predictable storyline (mammoth has baby during critical moment; mother dinosaur arrives on cue) but manages to surmount the tired babble by way of a subterranean twist. Oh, yes, beneath the icy tundra is a hidden tropical paradise, home to prehistoric beasts long thought to be extinct. Twilight of the Dinosaurs would be more accurate. If you're looking for alliteration, then perhaps Twilight of the Pterodactyls would work.",/review/rw3517666/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2016,CinemaClown,," An Absolute Riot That's Well-Aware Of Its Limits.
","Although Ice Age never needed a sequel to begin with, the success of the second chapter did give its studio another franchise to milk for all its worth. The third instalment in the Ice Age series once again fails to offer a compelling story but for me it is the most enjoyable chapter in the saga so far, thanks in particular to its energetic pace & vibrant slapstick humour.",/review/rw3517666/?ref_=tt_urv
