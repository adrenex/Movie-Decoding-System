1 May 2010,skoyles,9," A fine series with a charming lead
","Having neither read the books nor seen the original television movies, I come to the series with unbiased (if ignorant) eyes. My wife and I, who lived briefly in Toronto, are both charmed by Murdoch and his slightly daft colleagues. ""Charmed"" is the word, for we find the actors, scripts, clothing, details and the City of Toronto itself charming. The bigotry faced by a Catholic detective in the city of the Family Compact rings very true as does Murdoch's gentle piety, a refreshing change in today's detective shows. It is a bit mystery, a bit soap opera, a bit character study and a lot of fun. We, at least, have been captivated by William Murdoch as portrayed by Yannick Bisson, a character who is a genuinely honest, gentle and quiet man of strength facing ethical, moral, professional and legal challenges in each episode. George Crabtree and the Inspector become more interesting as time goes on. The corruption of Toronto and Ontario politics hides behind several episodes while the turn of the 20th century fascination with science and ""the coming thing"", as Brisco County Junior would say, gives some lightness to the whole thing. In the final analysis it is the interplay of characters, centred on the troubled but charming Murdoch himself, that elevates the Murdoch Mysteries to the level of Midsomer, Taggert or Poirot. A fine series and not only for Canadians.",/review/rw3473990/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2010,WelshFilmCraze,8," Very well made and acted Victorian era set Canadian crime series.
","'Murdoch Mysteries' stars Yannick Bisson as Inspector William Murdoch who solves crimes in 1890's Toronto, is an exceptionally well made and acted series, which makes a nice change from CSI/NCIS etc. staple of whiz-bang, FX laden crime shows",/review/rw3473990/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2020,Ashitaka137,5," Historical revisionism isn't good
","I really love this show, but as a black man i can't get past when period fictions portray the history part of their shows inaccurately, especially when it comes to rewriting the discrimination of some groups during those times and for like in this show, placing black people and women in a position of power, like normal, everyday considered detectives, doctors, or coroner in the early 1900's! How will the historical pioneers's struggles who fought and died to open doors for future generations would be remembered and be relevant if shows and movies like this, confuse people especially young people by rewriting History! Shows like The Knick are far better, because more authentic.",/review/rw3473990/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2010,llawrance1972,8," A fun, yet thoughtful show.
","I caught 'The Murdoch Mysteries' by accident while drifting around the satellite channels and was instantly hooked. A well performed, touching and interesting show caught my eye. The characters are involving, are worth caring about and have a strong sense of purpose. Each one brings something to the mix and adds their own skills to the events of each episode. Each episode has a strong mystery to be solved, sometimes offering an intriguing moral dilemma to both Murdoch and the viewer. It is also very reassuring to not have modern day morality thrust into the past as happens so frequently with other shows (yes 'Dr Quinn Medicine Woman', I mean you), dealing with the nineteenth century. Instead we are allowed to explore the world as they see it, enjoying the discoveries and trying to find a way forward into a new century. Well done to all concerned and long may it continue.",/review/rw3473990/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2020,reb-warrior,10," A charming series that winks at the audience. Strong characters are the strength of the series. Anachronistic with kind of a fantasy vibe.
","The series starts off around 1895 in Toronto Canada. William Murdoch is a detective that mainly uses science and charts in order to solve the mystery. The show is admittedly anachronistic. There's sort of a fantasy vibe to it, tho the show doesn't actually go there. I like to think of it as an alternative reality. It's lighthearted for the most part, tho it does delve into some dark and serious things. There's a really good balance. Bravo to the writers.",/review/rw3473990/?ref_=tt_urv

27 September 2015,Ed-Shullivan,10," This is Mrs. Shullivan and my own ""Go To"" television series
",When you get bored with everything else that is currently on television and you need a guaranteed hour of sheer entertainment that can whisk you away to a simpler time when the world was not as chaotic and confusing as it is now than may I suggest getting hooked on the CBC's (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) television series Murdoch Mysteries which is now entering their ninth season of continued success.,/review/rw3473990/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2021,aislingdublin,5," Has had its day
",Once upon a time was about quirky inventions that assisted a likeable detective and his colleagues. Also a nice bit of 19th century romance. Then more and more the detective work and inventions disappeared and the show became a lecture about social justice. Its bizarre. Minorities are always spoken about as being very badly treated while at the same time the show has minorities in very senior posts that they never would have attained. A very mixed message.,/review/rw3473990/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2022,pgooden,4," NOt as good anymore
",I am noticing a lot of anacronisms. And lack of attention to things that were sad/ laid. Out in previous episodes. Also I think leaving the Crabtree character out of so many eisodes does damage If Jonny wants to work on other projects and put MM on the back burner then let him go and develope Higgins more . At tnis point I don't really care if I watch it or not.,/review/rw3473990/?ref_=tt_urv

27 February 2010,landew,10," Simply The Best Mystery
","I'm been watching mysteries for many years and never have enjoyed a series more than Murdoch Mysteries. The time period, set design and writing matches the great performances by the cast, who you can't help but appreciate. If ever a series deserved a wider audience and advertising, it is this one. The unfulfilled love affair between Doctor Ogden and Murdoch is so well written and performed perfectly by Helene Joy and Yannick Bisson. Also, top notch acting by Jonny Harris in his portrayal of Constable Crabtree gives just the prefect comic relief while Murdoch solves the case using every scientific method available. Thomas Craig is also marvelous as the cranky Inspector Brackenreid. I can't help wondering why this show does not have a larger audience base since it is the talk of so many people I know, both at work and socially. My wife and I eagerly await each and every episode. Please make many many more!",/review/rw3473990/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2012,Bmart-405-556104,10," Murdoch Mysteries Show
","Great Canadian show. Simple, yet top notch with a Canadian like atmosphere.Very realistic for the times. History is great. The clothing designs and artifacts is exceptional. It seems the times were simple back then. Well written with a touch of humour. The cast are all excellent. You can tell they all get along really well. The show reminds me of Sherlock Holmes and yet it also reminds me of Sue Thomas FB Eye and Due South which by the way it sure was nice to see Paul Gross (from Due South) appear in an episode as his brother, although not sure what episode it was. We didn't see his name on the cast list as a guest star. The guest appearances are outstanding and it sure is nice to see some familiar faces. We love and watch all the episodes. With each season the character story lines change as in the case of Helen Joy, Yannick Bisson which is excellent leaving us more curious with what will happen next. That is one of the reasons we like the show. Now that the show is in it's fourth year the plot lines are continually changing which goes to prove that Murdoch Mysteries is a true success. Keep up the excellent work.",/review/rw3473990/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2022,countessemily,4," Starts off good, becomes great, then gets really terrible
","I started watching Murdoch mysteries after I watched Miss Fisher and then Dr Blake. I started watching in 2015- binged until I caught up. To be honest Dr Blake and Murdoch were to 'fill the void' left by Miss Fisher, as I think Miss Fisher is better than Murdoch and Blake.",/review/rw3473990/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2017,dkparent,10," History and Morals
","A wonderful Victorian era show that highlights many of the issues they had at the time, though some reviews I see do not understand this. It goes without saying that the show is not for everyone, I appreciates history, even when it is lightly played with inventions and such as Murdock does. This is a show that highlights Canadian values and has some deep underlying moral questions that will tug at your mind. You may not agree with all of the politics and religion that a few shows have but they are true to the time. I only wished people had the same decency that many of these characters have as it appears in this century we have lost many of those values.",/review/rw3473990/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2008,hmflashgordon,," Great Series
","I like this series as it has so much to offer. The scenes & locales are interesting & very real to life. The actors demonstrate their abilities to fit the characters & make the characters real. I've seen both versions of Murdoch Mysteries with the 2 different lead roles & find them both a credit to each of the actors. Yes, obviously, they present different aspects of the character but each brings quality to the part. I really enjoy this series & look forward to each episode. It's great to see a Canadian production of this quality on TV - such a rare gem. I do hope this series is kept on & is appreciated by both the public & especially by the TV providers - cable & satellite.",/review/rw3473990/?ref_=tt_urv

","What a shame to put 21st century causes, fads, and issues into an early 20th century comedy/drama. I used to look forward to this period piece of fluff, about where I grew up, but now I rarely bother. I don't know if it's the CBC's heavyhandedness or that of the production company, but I fear you've killed the goose that lays the golden eggs.",/review/rw3473990/?ref_=tt_urv

5 April 2022,bosporan,8," Excellent TV, now turned to mush and beginning to rot.
","Murdoch was a superb blend of concept, plot, wardrobe and character. I enjoyed the first thirteen seasons. The cast is strong throughout and the stories interesting and believable in the context of the show. Some of the historical figures inserted into the story have added flavour. The relationship between Murdoch (Yannick Bisson) and Ogden (Helene Joy) works remarkably well with both of them contributing to cases and providing a spine from which to hang various plots.",/review/rw3473990/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2020,elbonian00-218-882971,6," Too ""woke"" for its time...
","On its ascent into TV immortality, this unique detective series was about science, intellect, and innovation well ahead of its time. In recent years it has devolved into smug intersectional sermonizing. The writers appear to be attempting to rewrite the history of the North American cultural conscience, ascribing to it a woke perspective that wouldn't assert itself as a cultural seismic event for a century yet.",/review/rw3473990/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2020,ma-cortes,7," Agreeable Canadian series in which a young Inspector uses revolutionary forensic techniques to discover crime evidences and chase delinquents
","Good show revolves around Forensic sleuthing in the age of invention. In the late 1890 Toronto, a Police Inspector, Murdoch : Yannick Bisson , employs unconventional approach in hunt for criminals, this one elicits distrust and skepticism from his doubtful superior officers.

As he investigates mysterious cases with difficult challenges along the way, being assisted by
the stubborn Forensic woman called Julia Odgen : Helena Joy and under superior command of a stiff-upper-lip boss, Brackenreid : Thomas Craig, who is reluctant to new techniques used by the young cop.

21 May 2016,bwallarab,1," Strange amount of praise for a truly amateurish program
","The ratings and reviews would lead one to believe that ""Murdoch Mysteries"" was among the finest series on television today. I have watched several episodes from different seasons, trying to find some redeeming features and have come to the conclusion that either there is an active campaign to artificially boost the ratings of this poor production or this series suggests a backlash against the complex, highly sophisticated, high production value television available elsewhere. Whatever the reason, ""Murdoch Mysteries"" is shockingly under par in writing, acting, and production values, especially glaring in this new ""golden age"" of television. At it's best ""Murdoch Mysteries"" is blandly charming in it's local dinner theater quality. One can sit through an episode or two while visiting one's aging parents easily enough. Written and produced to be easily grasped the average 10 year old, this is probably ideally suited for families looking for something safe to watch with pre-teens. But please, let's save the 10/10 ratings for series that truly deserve it. This is a 6/10 series at best and there is nothing wrong with that.",/review/rw3473990/?ref_=tt_urv
