17 June 2019,simodeev,10," 10-star reviews are right, 1-star reviews are right
","It's condescending to tell people they don't 'get it', and it's narrow-minded to claim anyone who loves it is pretentious. I adored this new Twin Peaks, and I understand why it's divisive.",/review/rw3752359/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2017,recklesscow,10," Sure to repel traditional watchers and please anyone looking for something different.
","If you don't know anything about the original 1990s predecessor, I can't imagine what you'd be doing here, so let's skip all that introduction nonsense.",/review/rw3752359/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2017,Ziglet_mir,10," David Lynch's Swan Song
","When someone works hard at something or does something for a long time you can surmise that they well eventually get good at that thing, even masterful. Generally, this is the case for all great directors and David Lynch is no exception. With the newest Lynch-piece we are given something that is an amalgamation of all his previous work without sacrificing his style or creativity. We see the dark-industrial vibe of ""Eraserhead"", the American suburbia and the dark underbelly late-night bars/clubs/people from ""Blue Velvet"", ""Wild At Heart"", and ""Twin Peaks"", the winding roads and nightmarish features from nearly all his projects specifically ""Lost Highway"" and ""Mulholland Drive"", and then last but not least, we see the venture into the digital age with non-linear story and the craziest sound design you may possibly experience in any piece of media that we get from ""Inland Empire"". There are even remnants of design that hearken back to his old shorts. ",/review/rw3752359/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2017,cherold,8," For those who liked the weirdest parts of Twin Peaks
","A quarter of a century after it ended, Twin Peaks gets a season 3. That in itself is part of the weirdness of Twin Peaks; it's not a reboot, or a remake, it's just ... season 3, picking up just where season 2 left off. ",/review/rw3752359/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2017,akshatdave,," It is compelling enough already, perfect return of 90's masterpiece..
","Possibly one of the best TV dramas ever, ""Twin Peaks"" managed to return in a challenging and unique way It is bizarre (not to mention intelligent) piece of television that has returned again with putting the pieces of puzzle together..",/review/rw3752359/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2017,TouchTheGarlicProduction,10," Bold, original, and uncompromising; well worth the wait but sure to be controversial.
","After 25 years, Twin Peaks is back on the air. This revival is one of the most hotly anticipated events in entertainment to come along in a long time, and I think that many fans might not like this revival. This is not the goofy, bright Twin Peaks of the 90s, nor is it the bleak depressing Twin Peaks of Fire Walk With Me. This is something new. In fact, most of the first episode does not take place in Twin Peaks, with the people we know and love. When it does cut back to the titular town for a brief scene here or there, it is actually kind of jarring, as we feel that we are watching a completely different show. Nor do there at first appear to be any elements connecting the new central plots to Twin Peaks. I imagine that many people will be frustrated by this and maybe even quit watching, which is a shame because as the show goes on it gradually ties these things in to the main plot in a way that is very satisfying. So despite a rocky start, by the end of the second episode I was on board.",/review/rw3752359/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2017,tor-claesson,5," Not relatable anymore, nor very likable
","Although I've not enjoyed very much of The Return (with the exception of the exceptional Mitchum brothers and their female associates) I've done my very best to like it. To try to accept and understand it, but I find myself failing at that. Jeffries as a tea pot, an hour-long episode of a nuke going off and 15 episodes of Dougie. It's just a bit much to me. Throughout, there's just not very much to like about it.",/review/rw3752359/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2017,MikesIDhasbeentaken,4," Notice how all the rave reviews praise the director?
","Lynch is amazing, Lynch this Lynch that. ",/review/rw3752359/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2017,FabledGentleman,8," A masterful continuation of the original saga
","It's finally here! And the first 2 hour episode of season 3 is an absolute joy to watch. When the original series aired, i was in my early teens, but i could still enjoy the show. I might not have understood all that was going on, but as it turned out, neither did anyone else.",/review/rw3752359/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2017,dierregi,1," A surreal conversation

9 August 2017,horrorgasm,," The emperor's new clothes
","What a fascinating case of mass self-delusion this has been. It's truly amazing and disgusting how heavily people are stroking themselves over their ability to force themselves to choke down something that is so very poorly executed just so they can reach that oh so ""clever"" hidden story within.",/review/rw3752359/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2022,rewtmoose,6," We'll never agree on this
","Upon first viewing I absolutely hated this show. It wasn't the Twin Peaks I had been excited for, having watched the original series many times over, and I saw few, if any, redeming qualities.",/review/rw3752359/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2021,davidmvining,10," A capstone
","This really is an 18-hour movie. From beginning to end, it's the same pair of writers, Mark Frost and David Lynch, the same director, Lynch, and the same cast in the same production telling one very long story. That it was released in individual episodes on Showtime makes little difference, I think. It's also my favorite piece of storytelling from the entire franchise of Twin Peaks. The first season is good, but its adherence to a pretty much dead genre, the primetime soap opera, limits my enjoyment of it. The second season has a real dip before ending strong. Fire Walk With Me is very good, but suffers from the hope that it would spawn further movies. This return is a go for broke attempt at creating the combination of quality character based storytelling and weird mythology that made Twin Peaks at its very best.",/review/rw3752359/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2021,ernesti,4," Lacks atmosphere, heart and soul of the first two seasons
",There's always a great chance that sequels aren't going to be as good as the original and this is yet again another fine example how it usually goes.,/review/rw3752359/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2019,dkwestbrook,9," Sure to be controversial but rewarding for Lynch fans
","If you're not a fan of David Lynch then you're not going to like this show. End of story. Unless you've watched and loved Lynch's movies like Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, Wild at Heart, Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire, then you're not going to like The Return. This is hardcore Lynch, challenging for even his biggest fans. I wouldn't call The Return a sequel to the original Twin Peaks. It's more a sequel to Fire Walk With Me than anything else, with a few elements of Twin Peaks sprinkled in. So, if you're just a fan of the original Twin Peaks and you're not familiar with Lynch's work, then The Return is not for you. You're not going to like it, I can assure you of that.",/review/rw3752359/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2021,jjdausey,5," 9 episodes stretched out to an interminable 18
","Slow pacing is one thing. But going nowhere fast isn't my cup of tea... or coffee. But there are myriad flaws with this: limited time in Twin Peaks; cheap-looking digital look; too many newcomers; underutilized and/or misused legacy players; a terrible performance from a non-acting key player (you know who); no fan service at all; new loose ends; an ending that literally snapped me out of my romance with ""Twin Peaks."" Sorry, but Lynch ""on heroin"" was not the alchemical formula that made the og series work. What a disappointment.",/review/rw3752359/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2018,shanayneigh,1," Do you want to watch David Lynch masturbate for 18 hours?
","I haven't seen anyone this convinced of and enamored with his own ego and perceived greatness since I read Norman Mailer's ""Of a Fire on the Moon"", which was an equally dreadful experience. It's once and for all clear that David Lynch is the Donald Trump of film making. ",/review/rw3752359/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2020,cjonesas,1," Completely and inadmissibly Not understandable
","With respect to viewers sharing and viewing this piece of work as masterful and being enthusiastic about it, I couldn't have the same opinion after watching it, most of the time with lowered volume throughout the episodes",/review/rw3752359/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2017,amesmonde,," Quirky must see
","The David Lynch and Mark Frost revival brings back the show without the restrictions of network television as a single 18-hour movie split into chunks and (I'm currently 4 episodes in) all end with a different band performance. Yes, composer Angelo Badalamenti has returned and the nostalgic Twin Peaks theme is intact with a slightly different credit sequence, the mill replaced with the Red Room's curtains.",/review/rw3752359/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2017,jgcorrea,," It never peaked, much less blinded me
","Not like the first TP, or Fire Walk with Me. This is sheer nonsense and no rhythm: unbearable, charmless and humorless, with countless new characters and confusing plots that do not connect with each other. Ridiculous dialogue and too much Actors Studio Method also aggravate the nightmare. The action does NOT occur in Twin Peaks. It is a surrealistic and abstract collage of images that lack consistency. What nonsense is this of a zombie for protagonist? All this ""symbolism"" is agonizing, pseudo-sixties. What sounded at first like a great idea - to reinvigorate an icon from the '90s - has not returned what it was permissible to expect.",/review/rw3752359/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2017,planktonrules,8," Confusing and strange...exactly what you would expect!
","""Twin Peaks"" and this re-boot of the series on Showtime is a program for select audiences only. Those who consistently watch the show love it and many might try but not stick with it because there is so much strange and surreal content. This isn't a criticism...just that it's a show that would tend to have polarized reactions since it is so unique and strange...which isn't that surprising considering it's from David Lynch.",/review/rw3752359/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2017,hitch-34,1," At least I figured out the alleged High Ratings here on IMDb for this DRECK
","Quite simply, I loved the original TP. I even like most of David Lynch's work, although not all of it. But in watching this, all I can say is, DL, either go BACK on your meds, or get OFF of your meds-- whichever is making you think that this crap is worth watching. If it gets renewed, I'll know that you obviously have the pictures of some studio boss somewhere, with a kid and a dog. And you KNOW what I mean.",/review/rw3752359/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2017,ollie1939-97-957994,10," A show like no other!
","Wow, what an absolute ride! 25 years after the critically acclaimed Twin Peaks was abruptly cancelled by ABC, Showtime's 2017 revival is going to baffle and enrage many people including new viewers and fans. And that is exactly what TV needs right now. I'm a big fan of the original show as well as the majority of David Lynch's work. However, even I did not expect the type of show that this has ultimately turned out to be. In short, Lynch has created something wholly unique and original that doesn't abide to the normal conventions of most television. It's abstract and many will find its pace far too slow but it helps in giving that Lynchian atmosphere that his dearest fans so love. Already, I predict that many of the images both from the iconic Red Room as well as some of the new imagery will satisfy die-hard Lynch fans and will leave an impression for years to come.

14 July 2018,wisDOM87,4," Profoundly disappointing
","There's a scene in Episode 12 of Twin Peaks: The Return (hereafter, TP3) in which Agent Alfred Rosenfield (played by Miguel Ferrer) has some important, confidential news to impart to Agent Gordon Cole (played by David Lynch himself) and visits him in his hotel room. Cole, however, is entertaining a lady friend (whom we have not seen before); he asks her to leave. What follow is an excruciatingly drawn-out farce in which - over literally 4-5 minutes - she slowly puts on her shoes, inches her way towards the door, says goodbye, giggles coquettishly etc. all in the most desultory fashion possible, with Lynch standing there smirking away to himself the whole time. To Albert's relief she eventually leaves, after which Cole makes a joke about a turnip and informs us that ""there are 6,000 languages spoken in the world today"". The scene adds nothing to the plot. It is not especially amusing or interesting, and indeed we never see this woman in TP3 again. I focus on it as it perfectly encapsulates what's so wrong with TP3 and the basically hostile attitude it has towards its viewers.",/review/rw3752359/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2017,karlericsson,1," psychological trick
","David Lynch claimed that it was a mistake to reveal the murderer in the first seasons in Twin Peaks and that he had rather left the question unanswered. This worries me when seeing this series now, when he is in total Control. There's no question that he is a very able director. Previous films has shown this (not all of them though). What worries me is that he has found out a very cheap trick and is milking it for all its Worth. Why do we find detective stories or who-done-it stories so interesting? Well, that is what nourishes our minds. Lynch found out that we can keep the interest up for a long time if we pose intriguing questions. When we then fail to deliver any sort of answer will not mean much, so Lynch seems to have thought, I'm afraid. If so, then what saved him Before were the producers that did not allow him a director's cut and insisted on some kind of answer. I hope this is not the question with the present series. Intriguing questions have been posed in abundance already and although they are also visually intriguing, I'm afraid that is not enough if that will be all. I hope this series will not end in a magnificent catastrophe, but so far I cannot tell. The real brilliance is not in the question but instead in the answer, even if it is insufficient. The answer Always shows you where you stand and where you are heading. It may be naive but it is Always honest.",/review/rw3752359/?ref_=tt_urv
