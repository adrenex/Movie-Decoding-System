","Utterly superb dramatization of the turning point battle of the Civil War. A clash so enormous in scale that whoever won, was destined to win the war. Brilliantly directed and screenwritten with top notch moving performances by all. Almost makes you understand why so many people are into those reenactment things. ",/review/rw0322020/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2004,cariart,," Long, but Powerful Epic, Filmed on Location...
","GETTYSBURG, based on Michael Shaara's bestseller, ""The Killer Angels"", is a truly remarkable film, in it's clear, if long, presentation of the Civil War's bloodiest, best-known, yet least understood battle, in it's 'humanizing' of the almost legendary characters of the period, and, most amazingly, for being filmed at the actual locations where the actions took place, in Gettysburg, itself. From Little Round Top to Seminary Ridge, you see the events where they actually occurred, 140 years ago. It is a singular achievement, and Ted Turner deserves credit for making it happen.",/review/rw0322020/?ref_=tt_urv

5 March 2002,vaughan.birbeck,," An amazing battle picture
","A film that runs longer than 'Lawrence of Arabia' and only covers three days of action sounds a long haul but it is not. As someone who is both British and interested rather than an expert on the Civil War I found 'Gettysburg' very satisfying. The prologue makes the objectives of the two armies clear and the 'updates' in the form of dialogue between the commanders mean the viewer doesn't lose sight of the course of events. The battle scenes capture the ""terrible beauty"" of combat, conveying terror, claustrophobia and violence without being too horrific.",/review/rw0322020/?ref_=tt_urv

23 November 2004,shermatz,," Gettysburg: All Time Top 10
","I've been reading all the other comments pro & con with great interest, and I just have to add my voice to the ""pro"" side for this ambitious and stirring epic. Gettysburg is indeed one of my ""all time top 10"" movies. I was especially curious to see it on initial theatrical release because of the casting of Martin Sheen as Lee; were I to cast a civil war movie, the name Martin Sheen would NEVER have entered my mind as an appropriate performer for this make-or-break role. To my astonishment, Sheen was MAGNIFICENT in his portrayal of Lee; in appearance, demeanor, and aura of command, Sheen COMPLETELY sold me. A stunning performance from an unexpected casting choice. I agree that ""Gods & Generals"" would have benefited from Sheen's re-casting, though Duvall did his best with the more limited part he was given.",/review/rw0322020/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2002,twhiteson,8," Gettysburg and Re-enactors
","I just want to respond to the criticism of this movie's use of Civil War reenactors as extras. Yes, the average reenactor is a heck of lot older and fatter than was the average Civil War soldier. Reenactors are great at dressing as Civil War soldiers, but most of them don't LOOK anything like Civil War soldiers, who were very young men reduced to sinew and bone from physical exertion and poor diet. Also, reenactors are not professional actors or stunt men which is very evident in this movie. (In some scenes you can actually see some of them staring into the camera while everyone else is looking off in another direction. Also, their embarrassing attempts to recreate hand-to-hand combat during the finale of Pickett's Charge are just pathetic to watch. Not to mention the melodramatic ""deaths"" and the guys grinning like Cheshire Cats while they're supposed to be acting as in fear of their lives.)",/review/rw0322020/?ref_=tt_urv

I would probably appreciate this movie even more if I did know more about that horrible conflict.

","With a few notable exceptions Schindler's List, Braveheart, Saving Private Ryan and Glory, history based movies usually die quick and quiet in the movie theater (The Messenger, Ride with the Devil, Cobb) History flicks cost a bundle to make with the costumes and the challenge of finding a place to shoot that's nowhere near highways, bridges, and cities, and they don't always appeal to mass audiences.",/review/rw0322020/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2005,Holly26547,10," A Woman's Perspective
","This is one of my favorite movies, and the comments of fans on this site notwithstanding, I think it was underrated. From the first time I saw it, it exemplified a personal theory that women (until very recently) rarely see men at their very finest, and that is unfortunately often (obviously not always)in battle. The courage, commitment and humanity that this movie portrays, on both sides of the conflict, moves me to tears every time, and the humanity is key. I don't know enough about the battle to point out any glaring historical inaccuracies, but the acting was exemplary across the board, with Jeff Daniels outstanding. The battle at Little Round Top is one of the finest movie scenes I've witnessed. I particularly like the expressions of respect and awe on the faces of Chamberlin's men when he tells them to ""fix bayonets"". What's striking is that there was no ""good"" choice; there was a clear and compelling objective in a much bigger picture, and this schoolteacher rose to the challenge, and his men went with him. This movie conveys a lot-through the long philosophical discourses and the action-about how people behave when they are inextricably joined with other people, for a cause that they don't fully understand, charged with a responsibility that no individual should bear, and with the desire mainly to return to the way things were before. It conveys a lot about true leadership and sacrifice. It conveys that individual choices and motivations always impact others, sometimes on huge scales. Guys, I don't know if you can convince your wives/girlfriends to cuddle up with this film, but I would make the attempt; there are obviously very ugly things that people did to each other in this and any conflict, but if I ever got a sense of the nobility of men and their push in this world, it was from this film.",/review/rw0322020/?ref_=tt_urv

5 September 2000,grahamsj3,9," Wow!
","What a film! This one grabs you right from the start and keeps you. And it needs to-it's a long film. The film is fairly accurate, historically, and was shot partially on location. The performances of Martin Sheen as General Robert E. Lee and Tom Berenger as General James Longstreet are nothing to get excited about, especially during one scene where both of them deliver their lines very woodenly. Nearly everyone else in the film is great! The most galvanizing performance is that of Jeff Daniels as Colonel Joshua Chamberlain. I'd have followed him into hell, which his men did. The battle scenes in this film are truly epic in size and the cinematography is brilliantly executed. When all those dozens of Confederate cannon fire one by one, it made me feel as if those cannonballs were headed for me. The soundtrack is spectacular, particularly if you have DTS 5.1! I gave it a 9 only because I felt that Sheen & Berenger could have done a little better. But it is truly one of the great war films of all time.",/review/rw0322020/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2001,sddavis63,6," Long, But Worth The Effort Of Watching
","A very interesting take on the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863, which is unfortunately marred by its excessive length (well over four hours), which could easily have been cut by at least an hour if unnecessary marching scenes were cut out. (I timed one point in the movie when a full six minutes went by showing nothing but troops marching. This was absolutely tedious!)",/review/rw0322020/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2004,RussianPantyHog,," Has its faults, but overall, worthy & moving
","I know the Civil War is a very 'american' thing, so i hope folks won't mind me poking my British nose onto the board. I got Gettysburg from Blockbuster on 2 video tapes & watched it in 1 go, though I gather it was made for tv in 2 instalments. Utterly watchable and, yes, very moving, especially when you consider it was actually filmed on the very ground where so many brave men fought more than 140 years ago. Just imagine what those soldiers would've made of it? I wonder if they realised their struggle would become part of history? From what I know of the Civil War the battle and command decisions were faithfully re-created with none of the banal sub-plots, ridiculous ""love interests"" and fictionalised scenes so beloved of Hollywood. It was also wonderful to see the massed infantry composed of real human beings without a hint of CGI. Pickett's Charge was incredibly poignant, especially as 'we' know what the outcome will be. I noted there isn't a single actress in the film. Apologies to all ladies out there, but that's the way it really was. ALL the actors gave fine performances; particularly the always great Tom Berenger as General Longstreet. I could feel the strain of 'command' every time he was on screen. I've always felt Robert E Lee was the finest general the USA ever produced. Such a tragic irony he ended up fighting against it. By the way, Lee was originally offered command of the Union army but declined out of loyalty to his beloved Virginia. That's the way many americans felt back then. They saw their nationality as their State. Martin Sheen gave a 1st class performance, though I personally wish the role had gone to a taller and (sorry Martin) more ""distinguised"" actor. Lee was an intellectual and a gentleman. His troops followed him from respect and love, whereas Grant's soldiers were motivated by respect and fear. A subtle difference, but important. There are faults with this film. Firstly I was slightly irritated it keeps alive the myth that the Civil War was fought to free the slaves. A nice idea, but un-true. Slavery was an obscenity, but that wasn't why the war was fought. It was fought to either preserve or end the Union, depending on which side a person was. By the way, Abraham Lincoln & US Grant both came from slave-owning families! Another fault with this film is the almost complete abscence of blood, 'gore' and real suffering. All the hundreds of extras look remarkably fit and healthy. In actual fact both sides (but particularly the Confederacy) suffered appaling squalor, hunger, disease and misery. There were no medics back then, no morphine, no helicopter casevacs, just the slim chance of an ill-trained & probably drunk ""surgeon"" turning up with a dirty saw and a bottle of whisky for anaesthetic. Vast numbers of injured men died from infected wounds, or were simply left where they fell. I wished the film had shown a bit more of the 'down side' to war. And then there were the beards. Oh God. Anyone who's seen the ""women at the stoning"" in Monty Python's Life of Brian will know what I mean. Most high scholl drama prop boxes contain more convincing false beards than the ridiculous items Berenger & Sheen were wearing. Martin Sheen looked like a mall Santa & Tom Berenger's was just surreal. Anyway. The strengths of this film far outweigh its faults. I remember seeing a US Army newsreel shot in the 1930s which filmed the Civil War 75th anniversary reunion. A small number of very elderly veterans, from both sides, gathered in friendship. It's such a shame so many fine men died in this dreadful conflict.",/review/rw0322020/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2002,twi1609372,10," Excellent
","This movie was excellent. I am amazed at all the bad reviews on it here. The writing was great, the acting superb, and 90% historically accurate. Yes it's long? So what? I admit some scenes were a bit drawn out, but so were the yoda scenes in star wars, but do people hate star wars because there are a few less than exciting scenes in the movie? No!!!!!!! We watch them once to get their jist and then fast-forward them. The casting and acting were great. ""Too many overhead shots on picket's charge""? They were trying to give people an idea of just how many people were involved in this battle, you can say 15, 000 but when you see it, it amazes you that they could all do this in such uniformity. The special effects were descent. I hate movies with so much OBVIOUSLY computer-generated graphics, some is ok, but when half the movie is computers, it takes away from it. The score was EXCELLENT. This is one of my all time favorite movies.",/review/rw0322020/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2004,jnwa3,10," My favorite movie of all time
","Gettysburg is the best civil war movie I have ever had the privilege of watching. Martin Sheen would not have been my choice as General Robert E Lee but very quickly into the movie I found myself truly believing he was the great general himself. Jeff Daniels as General Chamberlain was simply amazing in his similarity to the real person in looks and his performance brought me to tears. Once I got past the awful beard of Tom Berenger who was playing General Longstreet, I was delighted at his performance which to me was an academy award worthy performance. Ronald Maxwell is my hero for bringing this wonderful story to life and to all the extras that were needed to make this movie a complete success my hat is off to you. If you can see this movie without immediately planning a trip the the beautiful town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, I will be very surprised.

14 January 1999,louiss,7," Good film slightly flawed by Turner TV style production
","When I saw Gettysburg the weekend it opened I think around summer of 1983 I was somewhat disappointed but considering the rarity of historical epics "" my favorite film genre "" and the quality or lack of 80's & 90's films it was a refreshing change of pace and a decent film. Gettysburg was also a subject I had been waiting a lifetime to be put on film having been a Civil War buff. I was disappointed even prior to seeing the film with the knowledge Ted Turner was involved with the production. I expected and was correct in my assumptions that it would be similar to many of the TNT made for TV productions in style and pace, have some political correctness and be mild in the area of blood and graphic violence all of which were detrimental to the film. On the first point I thought the direction was lackluster and the battles did not have the intensity of the much more moving and exciting Glory.  Concerning PC I thought the speech by Jeff Daniels as Chamberlain was moving and one of the best scenes in the film however his sergeants comments about blacks was out of place and a little too much for 1863 !  I don't think its always necessary to have blood & guts all over the screen as in most current films depicting violence but I do believe that if ever graphic violence was necessary to convey a historical event it was needed most notably during Pickett's charge in which bodies were ripped to shreds by the massive fire that was inflicted upon them and was part of the great tragedy and horror of the Civil War.  I would have also liked the film to be in a wide screen format but again I think this has to do with Turner and TV. I liked all of the performances of the small star cast in the film even Martin Sheen as Lee "" I'm not sure why his performance was criticized so much "" my favorites were Jeff Daniels and Tom Berenger  with the only exception being Sam Elliott a perennial TNT movie star who was annoying with his over-acting.  On the plus side was the very fine score and for a 4+ hour film it flew by and had many moving scenes one of them was the rousing cheer of Lee's men as he came to greet them prior to the climactic battle and two great scenes involving Chamberlain "" his speech early on and leading his ammunition depleted men on a desperate bayonet charge"" . I also have to admit I watch this film every time its on Turner and my appreciation grows for it with every viewing and the shortcomings I mentioned bothered me initially but not in my repeated viewing and considering the extreme rarity of Civil War epics I now would highly recommend seeing Gettysburg.",/review/rw0322020/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2001,secordman,," Flawed but a very worthwhile picture
","It's difficult to attempt to make a historically accurate movie without turning it into a mini-series soap opera.  I commend the producers of this movie for the work they did in re-creating the Battle of Gettysburg.  When I visited the battlefield after seeing this movie I could really visualize things clearly.  Whenever I read a civil war book and read about Lee and Longstreet, I see Sheen and Berenger now.  I initially guffawed at Sheen doing a southern accent, but overall he did a fine job as General Lee. Berenger was excellent as Longstreet, and certainly his reservations about a direct assault on the 3rd day are part of the record, and emphasized in this film.  The main flaw is the emphasis on certain parts of the battle, especially the amount of time spent on Chamberlain(Jeff Daniels).  It was a pivotal stand that he made on Little Round Top without question, but in this movie there is scant mention of Cemetery and Culp's Hill, the Peach Orchard and Devil's Den, and other moments.  I would have loved to see a 10 hour production spread over 4 nights in a mini-series format, but I understand how these things work, so Gettysburg is as good as it gets for now. Pickett's Charge was very well done, it displayed the 19th century grandeur of war, and also its horror.  And yes, some of the people back then liked to make speeches and speak eloquently, that's why the Civil War has so much color.  The speeches can get a bit schmaltzy and overblown, but ride with it, because the movie as a whole is a good one for those who enjoy this type of thing.  No romantic sub-plots either, glory glory hallelujah!",/review/rw0322020/?ref_=tt_urv
