","There's a serious polarity in the reviews for this film,and I'm not surprised. If you've ever suffered depression this bleak movie will hit hard, and you'll pick up on all of the subtle messages it sends out. It's done so well it can't be anything other than achingly familiar. The despondency, and the frustration the sufferer feels at their own despondency, in particular, is well conveyed. ",/review/rw6837306/?ref_=tt_urv

27 June 2011,EijnarAmadeus,10," Welcome to his world.
","Lars Von Trier's latest film MELANCHOLIA got the media attention it needed when Von Trier, in Cannes doing a press conference, stated that he sympathized with Hitler. Now sure, one can look at this as a smart way of marketing one's own film, or one can start wondering what kind of guy Von Trier has become. As a filmmaker he's certainly interesting, and certainly self-indulging, and as a child of the late Bergman, he loves dwelling upon women in a somewhat sad state of mind. MELANCHOLIA is a dark film that doesn't have the explicitness of his controversial ANTICHRIST, but brings in just the same dark undercurrents of human beings who's lost their touch with love, compassion, faith and hope, and so we find them in the land of Trier where things will become increasingly intense and frightful. The story is told in two parts; in the first we find the deeply depressed Kirsten Dunst on her wedding day, which shot and felt much like Vinterberg's Dogme-film 'Festen', and part two interests Dunst's sister Charlotte Gainsbourg more into the story along with her husband and son, as staying at a beautiful mansion in the countryside sees the enormous planet Melancholia headed for Earth, fearing for all of humanity to end. One can certainly see this film with two different kind of goggles; Melancholia IS a planet that's headed for Earth, and it's doomsday - or, one can see the heavy symbolism of Melancholia as a state of mind, swallowing the family with its meaninglessness. Director Von Trier keeps most questions open, and by using some absolutely mesmerizing camera-work the film beholds a interesting quality and sensibility. Few if any other popular directors anno 2011 creates stuff the way Von Trier does, and the immense climax accompanied by Wagner music is sole alone worth the watch. I guess Von Trier makes personal films, and he claims himself to be the best living director in the world, and he wants a green card into everyone's lives and with MELANCHOLIA he again sows some disturbing and heavy-handed seeds - and if anything, he makes your mind wobble. Must see.",/review/rw6837306/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2012,Turfseer,2," Von Triers' 'Melancholia', aspires to Ingmar Bergman-like heights, but ends up as pretentious, pseudo art house fare
","'Melancholia' is not only the name of the condition that afflicts Danish Director Lars Von Triers' protagonist, Justine, but it's also the name of the planet that has just come out from hiding behind the sun, and is on a collision course with earth. If you're anticipating watching another sci-fi thriller, this is not the film to go and see. Like this year's other entry in the indie pseudo sci-fi category, 'Another Earth', the focus is not on that annoying other planet up in the sky, but on the conflicts between the afflicted parties down on earth.",/review/rw6837306/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2013,orchard6,7," Melancholia
","Melancholia is a 2011 film written and directed by the controversial Lars Von Trier and follows two sisters as the end of the world draws near. The film is actually more about the current lives of the two sisters than it is the end of the world; yet the impending doom does heavily influence a series of events. Presently, the film has received mostly positive reviews and was praised for the imagery used throughout the film.",/review/rw6837306/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2011,KarenYVR,10," Transform to Lars von Trier for 2 hours.
","''Melancholia'' - Lars von Trier's best work to date. The movie is  about the nature of depression and how 2 sisters go through it. Kirsten  Dunst (Justine) accepts her melancholia by the time a planet that was  hiding behind the sun threatens to collide the Earth, while other  sister (Charlotte Gainsbourg - Clair) is afraid to face the reality and  her own personal emotions.  If you have any little doubt whether you want to watch this movie or  not, you better don't, because this is not for everyone, and if you  still want to see this then prepare yourself for what you're going to  face. The movie is all about how Lars Von Trier sees the world, the  people and the dearness between them. It's beautiful, it's real, it's  disgusting, it's terrifying - it all depends on how you want to  perceive this film. The opening and the ending scenes are mesmerizing!  The music used in the film is taken from Wagner's ''Tristan and  Isolde'' opera which fits the movie perfectly. Cinematography - amazes.  Special effects, not for 3D, but are very realistic and breathtaking.  Kirsten Dunst gives us her best performance to date, forget the girl in  Spider-man, this is a new level for her. She finally proves us how good  she can be with the right movie choice. An Oscar nomination is on its  way...  I'm not a fan of Lars and his movies, but this one had me at the edge  of my seat to the last minute. 10/10",/review/rw6837306/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2011,chaos-rampant,," The sound of void washing itself empty
","No one probably working today can imbue the image of a bride pissing in the middle of a golf course with the afterglow of existential soul-searching like Trier does here - well, there was Peter Greenaway at one point but I haven't kept track. Side by side the romantic, the visceral, the transcendent, each one perversely subverting the others. But, having searched and yearned, eventually with Trier we arrive at nothing. Nothing in the predominantly Western, post-enlightenment worldview that has pushed god to the side and seated the mind in his place. Nothing is too much for Trier then, because nothing satisfies the mind; everything that is touched by humanity is shown to be randomly bubbling up from some cold, infertile void.",/review/rw6837306/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2013,TheLittleSongbird,8," Very well done
","While Melancholia is not a perfect film and I can totally understand the polarisation, I found myself very much impressed by it. Some of the dialogue is rather awkward, one or two of the characters sketchy and there are a few ideas that are were introduced and broached but could have been explored more. The pros outweigh the cons though, because it is a ravishing film to look at. The settings are breathtaking, and while the cinematography has a technique that is not going to be everybody's cup of tea Melancholia was an example of its utilisation being effective and somewhat necessary. The music is likewise amazing, Wagner's Tristan and Isolde is one of my favourite pieces and was in sync with the visuals perfectly, very like a symphony on film. The story, while slowly paced, has emotional complexity and the groom's love and affection is done very tenderly. Its hybrid of European art-house and Hollywood sci-fi is very interesting. It is not an easy movie to like and get invested in straight away and does I think need to be seen more than once, but on repeat viewings you get more out of it and is rewarding as a result. The opening sequence is truly arresting and one of the best opening sequences of any film in recent years, while the ending is similarly moving. Lars Von Trier's direction is accomplished and never amateurish, again not for all tastes(I know many people who have a wide ranging taste in film and have never warmed to Von Trier). Other than the visuals and the opening, it was the acting that made the film as good as it was. Kirsten Dunst earned best actress and deservedly for a courageous- and her most meaty, performance. Charlotte Gainsburg is more composed but is a very well-characterised and affecting contrast. John Hurt and Charlotte Rampling as the parents give droll turns, while Udo Kier is appropriately surly. In conclusion, a very well film but understandably polarising. 8/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw6837306/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2011,shizoeid,10," helplessness
","I've never seen anything so painfully familiar. Every move of Justine, her every word echoes with the heartache of a melancholiac. And the inability of the others to understand this pain, their inability to feel it and understand - it only makes it more familiar to the ones drowning in this mute slow-motion everyday despair. After watching this movie I went home without saying a word, I sat down on my chair and sat there silently for about an hour. I like Lars von Trier, I liked his movies before, but this one was a headshot. In this one film Lars von Trier succeeded to show all the ultimate emptiness of the everyday rituals, the endless longing of a melancholiac and the unbearable helplessness of this condition - like a bulletproof glass cocoon around you, muting the sounds and making the colors dim. I vote ""excellent"", 'cause this film is closer to my heart than any other I've seen before.",/review/rw6837306/?ref_=tt_urv

","Melancholia was a movie I went to see expecting it to blow me away. I thought: now here's a movie that doesn't have the mass-friendliness of the average Hollywood movie, but at the same time actually has a nice budget, and some good actors. Now don't get me wrong, I often find low- budget films with fresh talent amazing, but with Melancholia I was hoping for something that successfully molds together the Hollywood and indie movie scenes.

","This film opens with the end of the world. A large planet named Melancholia, whose path through space has been blocked from our view by the sun, smashes into the much smaller Earth, obliterating it and all on it. There are no Bruce Willis-detonated nukes and no space colony of the elite – only the end of everything. In case you're in any doubt, this film doesn't want you thinking specifically about the disaster than spends most of the film looming, or how the characters will get out it; the answer is they won't.",/review/rw6837306/?ref_=tt_urv

25 September 2011,Rockwell_Cronenberg,8," We begin at the end of the world.
","That's the basic premise of Lars von Trier's epic Melancholia, we start with the destruction of the planet and then work our way back into a character study of two sisters and their unique minds and approaches. The film is split up into two parts, one focusing on Kirsten Dunst's Justine and her wedding day and the other focusing on Charlotte Gainsbourg's Claire and the days approaching the collision of the titular planet with our own. In studying these two women, von Trier explores the fragile states of mind that can come with people suffering from depression and anxiety disorders, something that he is well known to be quite familiar with. The end of the world collision seems to be a distinct metaphor for the kind of cataclysmic affect that these kind of mental diseases can have on the human mind. Melancholia works tremendously in this way, but it also stuck out to me as a phenomenal study of these two women, even without that apocalyptic backdrop.",/review/rw6837306/?ref_=tt_urv

15 January 2012,Paranoyia,1," ""I think it's a piece of crap""
","Yes and yes, not once, but twice had the movie uttered the above phrase in some sort of a self-aware meta-cinematic ejaculation. I honestly couldn't describe it better myself. I only put a flag on the spoiler box due to the fear of being prosecuted.

21 August 2013,infinitesilence6,9," I have never wished for a collision with another planet, until I watched this film
","When we think about the end of the world, we usually think about the things we have always wanted to do, but never got the chance to. In whatever way it is that we wish to live our last hours on earth, whether it be by going out with close friends and relatives, or doing the things you never thought you'd do, the feelings of impending doom are the driving force behind our decisions. There have been many films lately that seek a comedic twist to something of this level (which isn't a bad thing), but what Lars Von Trier does with Melancholia is give us a beautifully orchestrated vision about the beauty that comes with the destruction of our planet as well as very realistic and often somber interactions between the characters in this film. One can't help but be mesmerized and terrified by the magnitude of Melancholia and the attention to detail, the science (dear lord!) was easy to understand and though it wasn't the focal point of the film, it was enough to offer the audience an idea as to how something like that was possible. (I would be lying if I said it didn't make me weep.) The film is separated by chapters that focus on the two sisters played by Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg and their lives before and after they found out about Melancholia. I believe that by taking the time to show us how the sisters were before the end of the world even became a possibility, we understand why they react the way they do to the news. Accepting what is to come instead of fearing it is what separates the sisters and the conversations/arguments that transpire speak a lot about the human condition and forces us to ask ourselves: What will I do with the time I have left? I watched this film about a month ago and I still think about it. It's captivating and absolutely worth your time.",/review/rw6837306/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2011,filmbizarro,8," In Trier's nicest movie, the world ends
","One important thing about ""Melancholia"" is that we're already told that the world WILL end in it. Lars von Trier has said it, and if you don't believe a trickster like him, then we have it in the epilogue of the film. The epilogue shows really visually stunning scenes from through out the movie we are about to watch (or rather, more artistic versions of what is going to happen). This is very reminiscent of ""Antichrist"" with the occasional artistic slow-motion shots we got in it, except everything is packed in the start of the movie here.",/review/rw6837306/?ref_=tt_urv
