6 December 2014,leonblackwood,4," Expected better from Clint! 4/10
","Review: You can tell that this movie is based on the musical, because it doesn't really go into much depth about the individual band members and I found the storyline pretty sketchy. Clint Eastwood would start an important part of the film, like when Frankie Valli met his wife and then in the next scene they are married without much explanation. That type of thing happens throughout the movie but it is stated that it is based on the musical so I can't really fault the director. I guess that he was trying to stay true to the musical, which is why he added the dance scene at the end with the whole cast but from a viewing point of view, I was left feeling pretty empty because I'm was sure that there is a deeper story to tell about there life's. Apart from that, it does show how they come up with some of there popular hits and it touches on how the group got together but it lacked emotion and intense drama. Watchable!",/review/rw3093165/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2014,LloydBayer,8," A brilliant narration on the true cost of fame and fortune and how pain and loss can conceive everlasting music.
","There's a reason why the 1960s is widely known as the ""Golden Era"" of music, specifically, the birth of what is now called Rock n Roll. Comprising of four British teenagers from Liverpool, The Beatles produced their first album (Please Please Me) in 1963 and went on to be regarded as the greatest rock and roll band of all time. But just a year earlier, in 1962, four boys from New Jersey made heads turn and girls swoon with a unique 'sound' to their music. Jersey Boys is the phenomenal true story of a 'sound' that took four boys from New Jersey's mob controlled suburbs and made them into the icons they are today – legends whose music is still celebrated more than five decades on!",/review/rw3093165/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2014,Hitchcoc,9," Captures the Spirit of the Broadway Play
","I was surprised to see how long this show has been on Broadway. Having seen the touring show, I have become a fan. I was suspicious of the movie version because my first response is nearly always, ""How will they screw this up?"" They didn't. Clint Eastwood managed to keep the rapid fire story of the four guys from New Jersey well paced an interesting throughout. It starts with the three things that happen to kids. One is to become famous, and that is pretty far out there. A doowop group manages to make a few bucks while breaking and entering and spending an occasional six months in prison. They have no spark, until Frankie Valli becomes a part of them. His falsetto elevates the rest of the group but they still are stuck in place. Enter Bob Gaudio, the true genius of the group. He, along with Bob Crewe, become the reason things begin to blossom. They take their stupid name ""The Four Lovers"" and turn it into ""The Four Seasons."" There are some cracks about this guy Vivaldi but since he's dead it doesn't matter. As things transpire we alternate between the successes of the group, culminating with their appearance on ""The Ed Sullivan Show."" Through all this we get to hear the music. The hit list is really nice and they do very good renditions of the songs. In order to get them seed money, Tommy DeVito hooks up with a loan shark from the mob and eventually drops the group into nearly seven hundred thousand dollars in debt. As big as they were, this was real money. How they deal with that and the tribulations of their day-to-day existences is what this is all about. The time zips by as we develop a real attraction for this charismatic quartet. I found it to be a wonderful film.",/review/rw3093165/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2016,Leofwine_draca,7," Musical biopic with excellent songs
","JERSEY BOYS is another winner from director Clint Eastwood and an adaptation of the popular stage musical about the life and times of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. It's a lengthy and often slow-moving biopic that takes a long time to get to the fame and fortune of the group in their heyday, yet there's something engrossing about it all the same. It helps immeasurably that Eastwood is an assured direction who brings a sheen of class and professionalism to all of his films, making this a delight to watch.",/review/rw3093165/?ref_=tt_urv

20 June 2014,patsworld,9," Sing Out Another Hit For Eastwood!
","In a theater packed with more people than I've seen attending a matinée in a long, long time, it would seem that each and every person in there enjoyed a toe-tapping, finger-snapping, head-bobbing, 'I-want-to-sing- along' experience during this dance down memory lane. And it wasn't only those who were there when all of this came down, but those too young to have been a part of that scene were having a great time. The casting and directing could not be more excellent than they are for this movie. And it isn't only the music, which is marvelous, but the look into the relationships of the people involved in this moment in time that is fascinating. A peek into their history, their character, the way their lives played out - this is a well put together film When a picture ends with people applauding, you know you've just seen a winner. When you walk out and hear folks saying, ""I'm sure going to have to buy this when it comes out."", you really can appreciate the fact that you weren't the only one in there having a fun time. There are only a few directors whose films you know you can always count on for quality – Eastwood has most certainly proved he's one.",/review/rw3093165/?ref_=tt_urv

","My wife and I were extremely and pleasantly surprised. I've never been into musicals...ever...my favorite up to this point was ""The Sound of Music,"" which inspired me to get into the film industry in the first place, yet, we found ourselves seat dancing and bopping in our seats. We really enjoyed the interpersonal approach of having the characters each expressing their takes and their understanding of each situation, which brought a lot of comedic character moments to the storyline and subplots.

27 November 2014,eddie_baggins,4," Devoid of any real life or spark
","Much like his most recent and most forgettable films J. Edgar and Hereafter, Clint Eastwood's big screen version of the Broadway smash hit musical Jersey Boys is a frustratingly hollow big screen event that squanders a ripe storyline to become a meandering movie devoid of any real pulse, purpose or cinematic flair.",/review/rw3093165/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2014,HoneyBunny_181,10," Blew me away!
","So here's the thing: Saw Jersey Boys tonight. Now I've never been interested in the stage version (I think musicals should have original music) and I didn't really trust in Clint Eastwood directing a musical; in short - I was ready to hate it (I've been called snob and pretentious more than a few times). But let me tell you, I was dead wrong.",/review/rw3093165/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2014,Mjhall_1999,8," Thoroughly entertaining
","I saw the stage play 27x in Chicago and 1x on Broadway. I was fully prepared to hate The movie. But, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's not easy to take a stage production and make a good movie. Some reviewers say it started out slow but so did the musical. Jeez, you have to get the beginning of their story! Eastwood kept the same premise by letting each member tell their story...you know there's each person's perception and then there's the real story. You can watch this movie and tap your feet and clap with the music. There was no one behind me so I got up and danced in my seat a couple times!! There was applause a few times in the theater just like at a stage production. There were a few things Clint changed that I wish he had left alone. There were a few things he expounded upon that I enjoyed. I will be going back over and over and over again. This is a good time to be had by all. I'd like to slap some professional critics who panned it. They are way off base.",/review/rw3093165/?ref_=tt_urv

I took in the 1:05 p.m., Saturday afternoon showing, and sat in a nearly full theater of baby boomers, or those not far from that generation.

12 June 2014,ssweet-26-519348,9," Makes you love their Music All over Again
","Going into the movie I knew and liked the Four Season's music, but was unsure if I would like the movie (it would not have been my first or second pick to go see). However, I was able to see an early viewing of the film and took advantage of it. I must say I LOVED it. It had all of the songs I loved. The film has the right amount of humor when needed. I have not seen the Broadway show version. If you like their music it is worth going just for that as it is a mix of recordings from the Four Seasons and also recordings from the cast. While it is rated R for language, I did not find it excessive. Erich Bergen's performance stood out for me. ",/review/rw3093165/?ref_=tt_urv

","It was not my call to see this movie but so glad I went along for the ride! It has at least a little something for everyone and a LOT for Frankie Valli fans. Granted, the narration is a little distracting at first, but you quickly get so into the story and the characters; the good times and the bad, that you adapt to it quickly. I thought I was tired of their music but I couldn't get enough of it. After several of the songs, the entire audience clapped as though we were at the performance portrayed in the movie. Eastwood knows what moves us, what makes us laugh and how to get us on our feet. He delivers it all big time. Seriously, what more do you want from a movie?",/review/rw3093165/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2014,MOscarbradley,9," Oh what a night; Eastwood does it again
","When I saw ""Jersey Boys"" on stage I thought it would make a great film, a gift for Martin Scorsese; think ""Goodfellas"" as a musical minus the killings. Now it's finally, and somewhat inevitably, reached the screen but under the guidance of Clint Eastwood, who also knows a thing or two about this sort of milieu; think a New Jersey ""Mystic River"" as a musical minus the killings, and I can safely say he has done it proud. Of course, Scorsese and Eastwood are two very different kinds of director. Scorsese, now in his seventies, is still the fly-boy, a super kinetic director of in-your-face entertainments. Eastwood, now in his eighties, has always been something of a classicist, a film-maker in the Howard Hawks mold whose films don't necessarily draw attention to themselves. I think this is why he is the most underrated of all the great American directors and it may be one reason why the critics have given ""Jersey Boys"" a rather lukewarm reception. Even I had my doubts that Eastwood still had it in him, that he could pull the rabbit out of the hat one more time. I needn't have worried, ""Jersey Boys"" is terrific; a full-blooded, thoroughly old fashioned biopic that totally transcends the term 'jukebox musical'.",/review/rw3093165/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2014,Figgy66-915-598470,10," Great Fun....loved it a love
","23 June 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - The Jersey Boys. Directed by Clint Eastwood this is the story of four boys from the wrong side of the tracks who from a band and make it big. Frankie Valli, played admirably by John Lloyd Young has the iconic voice which leads the famous Four Seasons and this is the story of the rise and fall and rise again of the kid from New Jersey. Accompanied by such iconic songs as Walk Like a Man, Sherry and Big Girls Don't Cry, this film was fun to watch, and kept my toes tapping throughout. Probably not the best dialogue in the world but with a soundtrack like that who really cares. I wasn't alive during this era but my Mum said it took her back and it certainly made you want to get up and have a good old boogie. The final scenes were great and now I want to see the stage show......will definitely be buying the soundtrack.",/review/rw3093165/?ref_=tt_urv

21 June 2014,six2561,8," Clint Eastwood scores again
","My husband and I just returned from seeing Jersey Boys. We loved it. I may be biased because I am Italian from New York and I laughed out loud at many of the unique-to-Italians dialog and inferences. Truth be told, this is the sad story of the Life and Times of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. His sound,the music are great and legendary, but unlike the musical, I believe this movie emphasizes the sad state of his life during his rise, fall and rise again. With his shyster ""friend"" Tommy De Vito tangling with the profits unchecked by anyone, and all his personal life drama and heartache, I found myself feeling sad and wondering how this could've happened. Would it ever happen today? Cast did great and always a treat to see Walken. Cameo by Billy Gardell was a surprise. Grab a tissue for Can't keep my eyes off of you, one of the only songs performed in its entirety in the film. With the horns! Even my husband got the chills! When it was over, the theater clapped! In the end, look... we are still enjoying his music and sound, going to the musical and the movie some 60 years later. And my husband just read that he's worth $60M today, so I don't feel so bad any more!",/review/rw3093165/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2014,kosmasp,9," One of the best biopics made
","Musical biopics that is. And having Clint Eastwood behind the camera is showing. He's not afraid of showing some downsides to the fame the Jersey Boys (you could also use their stage name of course). He's also very open to giving the support guys their moment. It's refreshing to see that there is more to a group than just two guys. And that the other ""characters"" actually have an opinion themselves.",/review/rw3093165/?ref_=tt_urv
