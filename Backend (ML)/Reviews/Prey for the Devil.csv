17 December 2022,paul_haakonsen,7," Surprisingly good...
","Now, I wasn't really harboring much of any high hopes or expectations for this 2022 horror movie titled ""Prey for the Devil"", as exorcism movies tend to be dubious movies. But since I hadn't already seen the movie, and had the chance to do so, of course I opted to sit down and watch it.",/review/rw8821097/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2022,neil-476,7," Not bad
","Sister Ann's mother abused her because she was possessed by a demon, she believes. As an adult, Sister Ann is granted entry to the Boston School of Exorcism even though nuns aren't allowed to conduct exorcisms because catholicism. One case involves a young girl who Ann bonds with, but all is not quite as it seems.",/review/rw8821097/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2022,UniqueParticle,6," It's at least above average
","I would agree with someone else I was expecting more but it has a few great parts the rest is just ok. Jaqualine Byers and the supernatural are defiantly the best aspects! I'm lucky I have the regal subscription cause I probably wouldn't have seen otherwise. I'm nice about my reviews I think Pray for the Devil was solid for what it is, has a great story and awesome horror moments! Nice that Virgina Madsen is still going strong in horror she was best in Candyman and Ben Cross passed away in the last couple years I don't know why there wasn't a rest in piece for him. Solid for horror fans that's for sure.",/review/rw8821097/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2022,FeastMode,2," Watch Smile instead, TRUST ME
","After the huge surprise of the awesome horror movie Smile, I'm brought right back down to earth with Prey for the Devil. Right back to where the expectation is the vast majority of horror flicks will be terrible.",/review/rw8821097/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2022,AfricanBro,8," Let... me... in!
","Slow paced with a couple jump scares, probably a few shy from being too many but most still genuinely startled me. I think that was due to the movie maintaining a constant eerie aura, it doesn't lighten up at any point. The somewhat novel story was decent, as well as the acting, but not entirely spectacular. Thought Smile was the best horror this year because it was an actual horror instead of just throwing some gore into psychological thriller; Smile was more of a fun horror to jump out of your seat with your friend and this was more of a scare you to death horror. I constantly had a chill in my tummy and had forgot what that felt like. Maybe this scares me more than Smile did because that was more reminiscent of other horrors like the Ring.",/review/rw8821097/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2022,Xstal,4," Formulaic & Feeble...
","If you're possessed by evil spirits you might go, to a place where exorcists expunge your foe, with the power of the cross, they will make you turn and toss, until the beast is forced to flee your scarred torso (or you die). Ann works in this place and she's a nun, you have to say, it doesn't look too much like fun, but her faith is firm and strong, although she has her own demon, the events of her past life, can't be undone.",/review/rw8821097/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2022,jprice-38253,1," Why did I even bother??
","Lets all be real. The trailer literally GIVES AWAY EVERYTHING IN YOUR FACE FOR 2 minutes. Every demon scene, every scare, and everything that happens to the characters. POV: You are seeing it in the movie, but your first thought is ""Oh this was in the trailer, I already know what happens."" Smh. I was expecting this to at least be somewhat ok, but holy ####...no...not at all. Sure didn't turn out to be okay when it made me walk out. There's so many things wrong with this, I can't list them all. What do I even point out? Lets see, constant shaky handheld camera movement, overdone jump scares that happen every 5 minutes, priests that don't act like priests, nuns that don't act like nuns, CGI that looks like it was made by a high school student, characters that they would expect you to care about but you don't, zero character development, sub plots that they think you would easily follow aaaaand yeah. There ya go. I've seen a lot of possession movies. Good and Bad. But THIS?! Embarrassing. Something like this should not be on a big screen, not even any streaming platform either. Maybe could pass as a little short film on YT, but other than that, no. I just don't understand why the Hollywood industry does this to us. And I'm not only talking about them making bad movies and making their money off of us, I'm talking about them making almost every movie trailer 3 minutes, just to show the entire movie. If you're already shown SO much in that span of time, then what's the point of even going to see it in the first place? You can make an amazing trailer in just 30 seconds or a minute, not giving away much and that would be it. It's not a very hard thing to do, but they act like it is. Glad I'm not Prey For The Devil. I just wanna ""Pray"" for a refund....",/review/rw8821097/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2022,chris_rowe-881-168820,3," Get your own ideas
","Honestly I'm a huge horror movie fan, from indies through to the big budget, I'll watch any but I just felt like I've seen this film a million times, done better and on budget dvd, there's nothing here that's new, fresh or interesting.",/review/rw8821097/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2022,arthurbcruzx,8," It is God who commands you, it is I who commands you...
","It has been one of the best exorcisms films I have seen in a long time. A great applause to Jaqualine Byers, who strongly carried the film in its entirety. The script rolled as equal to a more expensive film budget; the cameras had the proper response; the acting coordinated in tune with the all the events that followed. I would have liked to see more of the supernatural phenomena between religion and psychology, and interaction between a reality of good and evil that is instilled in us. This is a sorrowful story of a raped woman that that gives into the temptations of evil and not knowing the outcomes. This could happen to anyone, however, without the sorrowful consequences. Although the script should have committed more occult mysticism to balance the Christian doctrines of exorcism and the attempt of expulsion of an evil entity from a person. I appreciated the awaited twist toward the end that confirms the nuns godsent strength and makes her convictions an honest persuasion of her own perceptions but, ""Now that you know the devil, the devil knows you!""",/review/rw8821097/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2022,ykjdh,8," The Devil's Light
","In 2021, this was called The Devil's Light and I was invited to be a part of a test audience for this movie. It was pretty good and had some decent scares. I decided to check this out again and was a little disappointed. Some scares, little bit of gore, and even an entire character was missing to make this a shorter, teen friendly pg13 movie.",/review/rw8821097/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2022,benjaminskylerhill,5," Clever ideas poorly executed.
","Much to my pleasant surprise, Prey for the Devil actually does have a sufficiently unique and compelling take on the possession sub-genre. Early on, the script introduces character background and thematic depth that causes the plot to largely be driven by an emotional core.",/review/rw8821097/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2023,iceman-johnson,2," i'd rather be possessed than watch this again.

6 November 2022,Swizords,7," It was good, kept me waiting for the next scene.
","First, I have to say that I am not the best review writer. What I can say about this movie is that it kept me entertained and engaged from start to finish. It by no means had the best back story but it was enough to let you know a little more about the person you are watching. I've also never been one to delve into artist expression sides. If I am entertained and am not thinking about other things while I watch a movie then keeping my attention is a solid feat in itself. All I can say if you like these sort of movies and aren't expecting epic blockbuster results, then you will find this one entertaining.",/review/rw8821097/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2022,jayala-78334,7," Solid scares, great cast and story
","Just finished watching a screener as I'm interviewing some the cast and thought this was a solid, well-directed and performed movie. When I watch horror films at home, the scares rarely get me but this one still managed to. Possession/exorcism films are nothing new, they've been around for decades but Prey For The Devil had some great surprises and twists to keep the story moving. Jacqueline Byers gives an incredibly vulnerable performance, with Posy Taylor also giving a great performance, sweet at times and disturbing at others.",/review/rw8821097/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2022,tresm87,4," The yearly throwaway teeny exorcism Halloween film somehow even more cliche than before.
","Well here we are again. Halloween and just in time another possession film with every possible jump scare and cliche you've ever seen before. The formula is so worn out it's almost parodying itself unintentionally. Either way a new generation of horror fans will inevitably flock to it being the only other option than Halloween 37 this year. With plotting as hollow as ever and formulaic and cgi/jump scares that come Around nearly every corner, this film does nothing to separate itself. Attempts at ambitious twists fall short and end up being cheap. Actors are mtv caliber. Camerawork is rinse repeat. Just another possession film.",/review/rw8821097/?ref_=tt_urv

","Well religious stuff seduce me in movies... i've seen many good ones in the past but last years every single movie i picked was literally empty.. maybe it's my fault.. i 've seen everything about this topic falling angels,demons, possessed kids,demons, curses. I don't know... i am sicked of that storyline, a possessed girl climbing the walls, harming herself, swearing the priest or exposing his past...every time i give a it a change and i say to my self.. it might be something new, with creepy atmosphere and plot twist.. but it's the same stuff.. maybe i should give it a break.. but i have to say at least this one had descent SGI and good acting.. i 've seen some similar movies that were completely trash...",/review/rw8821097/?ref_=tt_urv

29 October 2022,darkreignn,1," Beyond boring - only watch if you suffer from severe insomnia
","Director Daniel Stamm helmed one of my favorite horror films of all time: ""The Last Exorcism."" No doubt a controversial opinion, I believe that ""The Last Exorcism"" remains a genuinely unique and expectation-subverting scary movie that breaks down the exorcism genre and builds it back up in a way that hasn't been done since. So, you can imagine my surprise when it was revealed that Mr. Stamm was back in the director's chair, once again at the helm of another supernatural flick. You can also imagine my surprise when, sitting down to watch this movie, I slowly but surely started to realize how garbage it is. I watch over 100 movies a year, and I can't remember the last time I saw something so utterly irredeemable as ""Prey for the Devil."" In fact, this movie is so generic, so boring, and so insulting to audience intelligence that I don't even want to waste time writing about it, so I'm going to do my best to give the speediest, most efficient review ever, in hopes that you do literally anything else with your time except watch this movie. So let's get started.",/review/rw8821097/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2023,Stanlee107,4," The nun-orcist?!

","Annie Kraja (Jacqueline Byers) has become a nun and is assisting at the St. Michael School of Exorcism in Boston. She is still haunted by her childhood growing up with a schizophrenic mother who she believed was possessed by a voice. Her mother claimed ""the Voice"" was after Annie, who would become a ""chosen soldier."" At the University it builds slow with whispers and then things get going about 20 minutes into the feature. Ann's interest in exorcism placed her in a group of priests as an observer. During the exorcism of a young girl named Natalie (Posy Taylor) Ann steps in and helps the priests who face danger. But the baptism by fire has just begun.",/review/rw8821097/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2022,deloudelouvain,7," Another possession movie, but worth watching.
","After reading quite a lot of negative reviews I didn't have too high expectations for Prey For The Devil, but I'm glad I gave it a chance because it turned out to be much better than those bad reviews made it sound like. Possession movies, there are just a lot of bad ones and only a few really good ones. This one is certainly worth watching if you like this genre. The possession scenes were well made, quite creepy sometimes and that's what makes these movies stand out from the rest. The story itself is obviously déjà vu so no surprise here but it's all well done. As for the acting it wasn't bad at all. Glad I watched Prey For The Devil, again a proof I shouldn't pay too much attention to very negative reviews as there are just a lot of people that are never satisfied.",/review/rw8821097/?ref_=tt_urv

23 January 2023,mmilenica87,4," Another exorcism movie..
","Well, if you've seen one exorcism movie- you've seen them all. It is that simple. I am a huge horror movies fan, but somehow I overgrown movies with exorcisms. They do not have anything new to offer to be honest. The plot is ALWAYS the same. It remains to be seen in what way the demon ""tortures"" someone's body. And how it plays with priests to ""break their will"". The narrative usually goes like this: someone's family member/or someone he(she) cares about is possesed (and it is usually a woman in order to be ""shocking"" when she starts yelling profanities at the priests). Only the main character can save her, just... Because. The main character fails the first time, but the next time it is successful. And the demon then jumps into the main character's body (the ultimate sacrifice of the protagonist) trying to kill the previous victim acting through the protagonist's body. But somehow protagonist manages to control herself/himself and ""chases away"" the demon. The end. There. Just as I mentioned: you've seen one-you've seen them all. And this is a generous 4.",/review/rw8821097/?ref_=tt_urv
