14 November 2022,arungeorge13,3," Not something you'd expect from Crowe! [+33%]
","Sorry, Mr. Crowe.. writing & directing do not seem like your forte. Poker Face has so little to do with poker.. or friendship, or betrayals, or anything meaninful for that matter. It's just a blandly written, blandly performed, blandly directed film with no takeaways. For a film branded as an action-crime-thriller, it does no favors to any of the genres. Why was Liam Hemsworth (32) cast as Crowe's (58) childhood friend? Every character is painted in broad strokes, not giving us any particular reasons to care - I simply couldn't buy into Crowe's ""virtuous, wealthy guy"" character at all (a tad too indulgent?). The action itself is surprisingly ordinary, even when a subplot regarding a heist slowly develops.",/review/rw8778530/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2022,jimbo-53-186511,3," It was hard to keep a straight face sitting through this nonsense
","Tech billionaire and seasoned gambler Jake Foley invites a group of his friends to a high-stakes poker game at his plush mansion. He offers his friends a choice; they can each take an expensive car or gamble this expensive gift for a bigger prize; namely $5 million dollars each. As the night progresses, secrets and betrayals are unearthed, but worse is to follow when thieves break in to Jake's mansion and Jake and his friends find themselves having to band together if they are all to survive the night...",/review/rw8778530/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2022,imseeg,5," Lacking true suspense...and lacking a lot more...
","The bad: this movie has got an artsy fartsy style to it, that was annoying me from the very start. Why? Because I hate it when a director starts using slowmotion photography flashbacks and supposedly spiritual monologues, that dont make sense whatsoever.",/review/rw8778530/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2022,FixedYourEnding,4," Not much action, not much crime and not very thrilling
","This movie serves you with a triple dose of Russell Crowe. Acting, directing and screenplay. Let me tell you, there are very few people that talented on earth that can do all three successfully, and Crowe is not one of them. Other than beautiful scenery, cars, architecture and art you don't get much here. If you are satisfied with just that you might be ok with this movie, but if you are looking for a good thriller, look somewhere else.",/review/rw8778530/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2022,Silicone54,3," Drama with some action sprinkled in
",I expected it to be some action/thriller movie but was pretty disappointed. Its neither a good drama nor a good thriller movie.,/review/rw8778530/?ref_=tt_urv

20 November 2022,rehmankhilji,3," A slow Death
","You will see the poster, you see some big names and nothing is bigger then when it comes to Russell Crowe, when the same is directing too, you will surely be interested. But it is very much disappointing from the very start, you will find a weak plot, with a weak and predictable story and sorry to say some top notch bad acting. The movie has everything missing and you will not find anything interesting in it. It is slow and dry from the start to the very end.",/review/rw8778530/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2022,DezmoTheMovieMan,4," Very slow start, slow beginning and kinda slow ending
","(lots of spoilers) The movies starts off slow, and its intention is to take you on a journey. You see how a few friends start off, then you wander to present time to see Jake Foley (Russel Crowe) as a filthy rich man on a mission.",/review/rw8778530/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2022,bombersflyup,3," Forgettable.
","Poker Face is directed by and starring Russell Crowe, which usually means good things. However I found this whole thing rather phony all the way through, starting from the opening sequence as kids.",/review/rw8778530/?ref_=tt_urv

","Stick to acting, Russell. This was just terrible right from the beginning.",/review/rw8778530/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2022,amufan,2," What a mess
",Russell Crowe needs to stick to acting and give up directing immediately. This movie well I'm not even sure what it was supposed to be. There's this big mysterious set up in the beginning and then we get to the middle and it pulls you in a little more and then all of a sudden the movie completely breaks apart I don't wanna say too much give it a watch yourself I'd be wary if it wasn't for Russell Crowe the actor this movie would be a one star.,/review/rw8778530/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2022,micz81,1," Absolute bonkers
","Nothing makes sense in this movie. Starting with the plot itself, then there's ridiculous overacting, even choice of music is beyond comprehension. I feel like Russell Crowe reading the script, and then writing the screenplay was intrigued by this concept of tense claustrophobic drama taking place in linear fashion told by a strong lead ultra-wise character which holds the mystery by its balls all the time, just to reveal it to the viewers by the end of the movie... And guess what - it all remained only a concept.",/review/rw8778530/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,8," I downloaded the wrong Poker Face video
","P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face by Lady Gaga this wasn't, but it was still a fun ride. Sure Russell Crowe's Aussie film had some issues, but not nearly as bad as the critics say. The main issue was the overstuffed and indecisive narrative with too many themes and subplots attempting to come together. Surprisingly, most do come together, but in the well-paced short 94 min runtime, there were many scenes that weren't needed, and others could've used more time to expand on their subplot. For example, the entire shaman camp visit could've been omitted, and more dynamics between RZA and Crowe's character's been expanded. I'm not a fan of long runtimes, but for this film, I actually wanted more allocated to better character development. Plus all the fine-art and art-gallery subplots didn't really do much for the rest of the film's themes. Nevertheless, all casting and performances were spot-on, the cinematography, landscapes and sets all outstanding, and the score was on point.",/review/rw8778530/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2022,bagpussjazz,7," Better than I thought it would be...
","Russell Crowe's acting near the start was pretty good, and left me intrigued, and I'm not a huge fan. The pacing is fine. The scenes flow pretty well without being abrupt. Some of the baddies acting is seriously over the top though, The plot is rather obvious and has been used to better effect in other films, in my opinion. Some characters were totally superfluous to the story, and since Crowe directed it, I wondered if there had been some nepotism? The conclusion is also fine, and even brought a tear to my eye.. Overall, it was much better than a lot of Sky films. Easily passes an afternoon effortlessly.",/review/rw8778530/?ref_=tt_urv

17 November 2022,trevorblunn-48457,7," Not too bad
","In fairness I only watched this cos it was ""free to me"" and the slow start nearly made us abandon ship but when it got going it was quite watchable. Sentimental, action, suspense elements were all there. Not the best but still a diverting watch. The plot's a bit convoluted and it has all the elements without necessarily stringing them together very well. As usual the antagonist lacks motivation. I think the worst part of the film was that some character development wasn't great so when issues were revealed you hadn't seen it coming - would have been nice to have been kept guessing a little longer before character flaws were finally revealed.",/review/rw8778530/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2022,speaktomenow,1," What a stinker!
","When I tuned into this, I figured I would be getting a low-grade low budget B movie. This was absolutely unwatchable. It's amazing that someone who has done as many movies as of Russell Crowe has done simply doesn't seem to know how to make a film. The voice over. The dreadful acting. The tediously obvious plot. I will say the scenery was quite nice. And it had some very good artwork. But without a doubt, this is got to be one of the worst Australian movies I've ever seen. It's almost hard to believe that Russell Crowe seems to have learned nothing about filmmaking. Old mate Russ should stick to acting and not try to write or direct.",/review/rw8778530/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2022,tkatsoufris,6," Enjoyable!!!
","I really don't get the people who did not enjoy the film. Nobody claims that it is a masterpiece. Not even that it is remarkable in any way. Nevertheless,the cast and the plot make it entertaining at least. I think,though I am far from sure the the idea belongs to him, Matthew Arnold once said that any art to be enjoyed begs for suspension of disbelief. Suspend,therefore, any disbelief and go and enjoy a non-demanding,well acted,adequately directed film without compulsively seeking compulsively more where there is not any. Or,alternatively,don't even bother attending the movie. Easily a 6-7 grading. I have seen quite a lot far worse!!!!",/review/rw8778530/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2022,Yuskuluk,3," Not value for watch
",Actually before i watch my expectations wasn't so high. I just expected a smooth and suspenseful ninty minute but it was just disappointment. There is no a meaningful story. Actually there is not even a story. The first half was so complicated and non meaningful. Did not happened anything value for watch. I did not even what is happening. In second half suddenly some people came to house and it looked a thriller but they could not even doing that. It can not be even a tv movie.,/review/rw8778530/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2022,lynglas,7," The worst problem with this film may be its marketing
