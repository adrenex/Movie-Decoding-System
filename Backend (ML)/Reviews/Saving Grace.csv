16 August 2018,Irishchatter,9," It's literally full of emotions, I mean wow I can't process this great dark anime properly!
","After watching Death Billards, I just couldn't believe what I was getting into when I watched its sequel! I tell ya, this anime would give a wide range of emotions such as shock, sadness, anger, excitement, you damn name it lol! This anime is really one of the best dark ones I've ever bumped into and like it really gives you a rollercoaster of reality and how we question ourselves - what will be death like for us?",/review/rw7880417/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2015,Tweekums,9," Where do you go when you die?
","This anime series is set in the Quindecim bar where bartender Decim judges the recently deceased to determine whether their souls will be reincarnated or cast into the void. To help his decision two recently deceased people must play a game; they don't know they are dead and have had their memories removed but they do know they are playing for their lives. The game they must play varies; some play darts, some plat air hockey and others play billiards. The games aren't quite how we know them though; as they play there are physical consequences and, although they don't know it they are judged on how they play not whether they win or lose. Decim isn't human; he is an arbiter; his sole purpose is to judge the dead unpassionately. He is meant to do that but when Chiyuki arrives he is unable to judge her and ends up making her his assistantÂ… it is only delaying the inevitable though; eventually he will have to judge her too.",/review/rw7880417/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2016,Cinematic_Bullshit,8," A Gripping Existential Thriller
","This anime will grab your full attention from the start and never let go. It begins with a couple arriving after their death in an unknown place where they are to be judged on whether they deserve to be reincarnated or sent to the void. In order to be fairly judged, they must play a game. It is during this game that their hidden darkness is brought out. At the end of the game the arbiter will make the decision on who will be reincarnated and who will be sent to the void. ",/review/rw7880417/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2015,smithnoah54,10," Amazing anime. Surprises each episode.
","I went into Death Parade thinking it would be just another anime to watch, that it would have some good qualities but not great overall. After watching the first episode I was stunned at how good it was. The setting is wonderfully imaginative even when it isn't completely shown. Their seems to be a lot of heart put into this show and that this place is much more realistic. Each episode surprised me with the careful observation of humanity and human life. It expresses our desires, our beliefs, and who we value most. Death parade is more about humanity and what we did during our life. The show is very beautiful in a way in which human nature is defined. Please give this show a chance it is very well done. ",/review/rw7880417/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2019,arishsankar,10," People do not live just so that they can someday die. It is because they are alive that they someday die.
","This is a really good anime, I would rather not say too much about it as I don't want to give too much away. If you want to see a show that gets inside peoples heads and reveals their life decisions and shows how they came to be and the ruff times they went through you should watch this!",/review/rw7880417/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2016,youssefsiher,9," I've never cried so much in my life.
","I'm not joking. This anime is something special that will always stay with me. Death is not a simple matter that can be discussed. It's something more. So is life and its meaning. I cried for at least 2 episodes. No other anime, movie or TV show made me feel all those feelings. The dialogues are not void and meaningless. They center the target of the story, and everything is connected till the end. I am very happy that, in the anime, love is the only feeling that can change everything, and that can overcome even fear. I spent a delightful time watching it, and I'm very happy. I recommend you to do so! You'll thank me later.",/review/rw7880417/?ref_=tt_urv

3 January 2022,Shilo_R_A,6," 6.4/10 - Entertaining, Yet Extremely Underdeveloped
","This is my second time watching the show (a few years after my first watch), and sadly it kinda shrunk on me. A lot. I still enjoyed it overall, but I can't help but notice a lot of issues and flaws here.",/review/rw7880417/?ref_=tt_urv

29 July 2022,verydarkmagic,," Odd and beautiful
","I really appreciated this take on afterlife as I never had seen anything like this before. The older I get the rarer it happens. Death Parade presents a curious angle on human life and its end. Even though I'm not a big fan of the whole religion-smelling heaven-hell concept but it's not very focused on. But it poses curious questions. Are people pushed to the limit - still the same people? Is darkness in the soul always there, or is it survival instinct? The series is visually beautiful, slow paced and sounds very charming. It perfectly pins that haunting atmosphere of a weird bar playing jazz when its raining outside(hope one day to visit a Death Parade themed bar if there is one). All in all I really recommend watching this.",/review/rw7880417/?ref_=tt_urv

2 March 2022,martin_merelesc,8," It was not used correctly to its full potential
","Death Parade isn't a bad show, just one that wasn't properly utilized to its full potential. It had the setup to be something thought-provoking and entertaining at the same time, but due to the humdrum cast and unexplored setting, it only passes as a nice popcorn time passer. Also, the opening, since no one seem to shut up about it. Despite my qualms, I fully recommend it to anyone since it's entertaining at the very least.",/review/rw7880417/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2019,stronger-68969,8," Recomended!
",The start of the anime is well structured. It gives your imagination some room. The quality is consistent throughout. It emphasizes on human behavior and offers some interesting twists. Give it a chance. Considering its length you won't regret taking the time,/review/rw7880417/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2020,dameon_green,10," Brilliant and unexpected premise that delivers.
","One of the best anime's I've watched to date, ""Death Parade"" hooked me with the first episode.",/review/rw7880417/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2019,imsxbrina,10," AMAAAZIIING!!
","First of all, the opening of this anime is everything. The idea of this anime is so freaking interesting and creative. Death parade is probably the darkest and deepest anime that I've ever seen and I love it. Has a beautiful ending although, I'd love it if Decim had feelings for the black haired girl cuz I sHIIIP THEEEM OOF.",/review/rw7880417/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2017,cman-cpp,10," Fresh, well executed, anime!
","I was pleasantly surprised by this anime. It has a fresh premise, that stands out among the sea of done to death (pun intended) ideas. The story is interesting, surprising, has some cool twists, and tugs at your heart strings from time to time. And the animation quality is top notch, which is one of the factors that drew me into giving it a try in the first place. The Dub is pretty good as well. Madhouse did it again. Give it a try.",/review/rw7880417/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2019,Koumiho,8," One of the best shows I have ever seen
","Death parade is so great that if I had the ability to forget that I watched it so I could watch it again, I sure as heck would. I would absolutely reccomend. It's interesting, entertaining, and really emotional as well.",/review/rw7880417/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2019,aadishah,10," Starts out entertaining, you can never expect the depth it's going to throw at you
","This is the type of anime that will play with your mind, make you question every decision you've ever made or every decision that you'll be put in a position to make. What will you do, why will you do? There's no escaping the answers and the deepest corners of the human mind are explored in a brilliant fashion. The character development is beyond fantastic and I love how they've explored each one pretty much totally in depth.
You cannot miss this heart wrenching, existential crisis inducing, fantastic, fantastic anime. Watch it and you'll know. The ending episodes got me so emotional, that brilliant OST!",/review/rw7880417/?ref_=tt_urv

14 July 2015,bmoore07,8," The Best of 2015
","When people pass away on Earth, they are immediately transported to a place called Quindecim, a fancy 90-floor hotel that serves as a waiting place between Heaven and Hell. At Quindecim, to determine where their destination is, the people have to play a game, ranging from Twister to bowling and even Old Maid, and throughout the game, they receive memories of they died and crucial moments from their lives. Overseeing the games are human-like beings known as 'arbiters' and Decim, the main character of Death Parade is one of them. A pale, white-haired bartender, Decim is cordial, courteous, and considerate, but to describe him as warm-hearted would be a huge mistake. The other main character is a woman with black hair and red eyes who doesn't remember her real name (It's revealed later in the series) so is called ""Onna"". Onna serves as Decim's assistant, providing new insight in tough situations while pointing out the flaws in the arbiter's system. Throughout the series, Onna helps Decim to realize there's a different way, a better method, of judging the deceased and, more importantly, to express his emotions, something entirely unprecedented for our super-serious young bartender. It's not obvious early on but, later in the series, Onna's acting dominates Death Parade, especially in episodes 9 and 12, and, in the end, she solidifies herself as this anime's most memorable character.",/review/rw7880417/?ref_=tt_urv
