21 January 2022,aprilsfriendorin,4," Bland remake that lacks the charm of the original
","I'll start by saying that I think the original HIMYM definitely had its flaws - while I enjoyed it, I think a lot of people here idolized it (which means no remake can meet their standards). I don't think HIMYM was perfect, so I came into this show with an open mind. In fact, there are a couple parts of this remake that I really appreciated (for instance, having more diversity than just a cab driver with an accent). But ultimately, I think it fell flat. Here are my main criticisms:",/review/rw7773954/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2022,chinandchin,5," I love Hilary Duff but she is not funny
","So far away from how I met your mother, those characters just not funny at all, a comedy with no comedian, not hard to understand why so many bad reviews.",/review/rw7773954/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2022,Harkonnen2,3," Time to retire the laugh track
","Now to be fair it is only 2 episodes in but so far its completely inferior to HIMYM, I rewatched the 1st episode of that and it was alot funny and more well put together.",/review/rw7773954/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2022,laqsheyo,5," This show might get cancelled before we find out who the father is
","Although the 1st episode was good, 2nd ep wasn't. But in comparison to how I met your mother, this show is disappointing. Yes, I will be Watching the upcoming episodes because of Hilary. I liked that they used the same theme song of HIMYM in the starting. I really want to like this show and hope they improve it!",/review/rw7773954/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2022,ddio-26092,3," Like an old friend you've lost common interest in
","Something about this show doesn't click. The first seasons of the original; the cast seemed effortless. This cast seems like they are struggling. The premise is almost too dated. The ideas too forced. Again another reboot to ask the question ""was this really needed?""",/review/rw7773954/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2022,AfricanBro,," Of course they won't like it
","Was it unnecessary? Absolutely, but this isn't bad. The moment you compare it to the original or listen to big fans of ""How I Met Your Mother"" you'll instantly dislike or be disappointed by this. It's not perfect, the problem, which unfortunately is a big one, is that it adopted its name from a fan favorite and those rarely ever live up to the name unless the fans were actually asking for it. HIMYM was a show a lot of people held close to their hearts.",/review/rw7773954/?ref_=tt_urv

",Oh No.,/review/rw7773954/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2022,grlym-46849,2," Really really B rated version of the original show
",I though I'd give it a shot. Because the original show was hilarious. But it quickly became apparent this show is very B rated. It felt like the shows a person would watch just after they were done with teenager Disney or Nickelodeon sitcom shows.,/review/rw7773954/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2022,tunakcicek,5," forced
","Could be watched as a pass-time show but other than that, the whole thing feels forced. Jokes are too flat and it's like they're forcing the audience to like the characters. When in fact, a character doesn't have to be likable in order to be funny. It felt really fake and overplayed to watch their optimism and ""millennial"" humor.",/review/rw7773954/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2022,rg79912,2," The script and acting are awful and unfunny.
","I expected to love this and am disappointed to discover that it's garbage. Everything about it seems so fake and the acting is genuinely awful. Hillary Duff is not the best actress, but can be ok in a secondary role. She cannot be a lead because no one cares enough about the whiny persona she portrays. The only somewhat realistic actor was the engaged guy, everyone else was awful. Over acting, horrible script, characters that I genuinely dislike and wouldn't want to be around in real life. Hilary Duff is way too old to play a 20 year old. Her best friend is the worst, trashy and basic character that made me want to stop watching. The British guy is ridiculous and not even his body can save the awful acting and awful lines he has to attempt to make seem realistic. The Jesse guy is so boring and they tried to make his hideous shirt like Ted's boots, but he just comes across as someone I'd never want to talk to. His sister is even worse,
is she actually an actress??? These characters are so boring. Two episodes in and there is nothing that makes me care about any of these characters and I don't care who Hillary Duff's character ends up with. The worst script and acting I've seen in a really long time. Also, the drunk Mom calling her grown son to tell him this story is just ridiculous and pathetic. This show is a big nope.",/review/rw7773954/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2022,darthsteele-39338,1," Please put it out of its misery!
",I gave the show a fair shot. I watched several episodes hoping each time that it would come closer to the original but each time I was met with disappointment. It's just another bad sitcom with really bad acting and really bad writing and really bad timing and no chemistry among the cast.... It's just bad.,/review/rw7773954/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2022,leerevell-69549,1," Cheesy Disney politically correct trash
","Its cheesy trash. Politically correct line up trying to mirror how I met your mother but it couldn't be further from that
Not funny, bad acting, bad storyline and just BAD!!",/review/rw7773954/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2022,genious-35413,2," Another Needless Spinoff Because... What Else Are We Going To DO?
","This show is clearly uninspired and just a desperate attempt to cash on a hit show. The sad thing is, it was already tried once and failed. When How I Met Your Mother was a hit and then ran its course and became played out, prducers said 'we need somethign with recocgnition and we need it to be the same as something we've already done'. So they produced 'How I Net Your Dad'. And it failed. Miserably. So back to the drawing board. And instead of trying something new, they just resorted to the same tired writing, got some different actors and changed one name in the title by using a synonym for 'Dad'.",/review/rw7773954/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2022,katharath,7," Enjoyable on its own merits
","It's not as good as HIMYM, but it's certainly not bad. And frankly Hilary Duff's Sophie is FAR more likeable than Ted ever was; it was always the supporting cast that I *really* loved about HIMYM. The 3rd episode was the best so far, so I do have hope that it will continue to improve -but even if it doesn't, it's a pleasant and easy to enjoy show, and I'd like to see where it goes.",/review/rw7773954/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2022,Marynewcomb2013,1," Why?
",Why do we need another remake of something that was a hit? Why does it have to be stupid at that? It's not at all funny! There is nothing to actually do in 2022 that we couldn't be out doing over the past how many decades now Ms Duff's character? This just need gone like 99.9% of all other remakes!!,/review/rw7773954/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2022,ChRiS-803,6," Give it a shot
",The pilot isn't that great but a lot of pilots have been awful - even the Seinfeld and Friends first episodes ain't that great. Remove the connections to its predecessor and give it a shot. It gets its groove better in the second episode. The cast gel well too. The negative reviews are based on having too high of a benchmark.,/review/rw7773954/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2022,kgborrell-34146,1," Save yourself
",Watched the first episode. Didn't laugh once. Didn't even smile. Absolute trash and an insult to the original show. Just cancel it now. Don't watch this.,/review/rw7773954/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2022,alltvlover,7," Give it a Chance
",It's brand new. It has to find it's footing. Yes it's a spin-off/reboot but it also has to stand on it's on. Let them find themselves and they are two different generations. Try to relate.,/review/rw7773954/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2022,sagetwo,3," So Boring
","Can I say this series is a huge step back from How I Met Your Mother? Totally not funny, and I couldn't concentrate for the first two episodes. And the forced laughter as background isn't helping. I watch for a shallow reason; my crushes. Leighton and Hilary.",/review/rw7773954/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2022,shalimarsubagja,6," Second chance
","First eps, meh. Feels like a Disney reboot.",/review/rw7773954/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2022,bencurrey,8," Worth a chance
","This stellar cast is full of people, aside from Hilary Duff, who you'll look at and go ""where do I know them from..."" Valentina (Francia Raisa) was in ""Grownish"" Sid (Suraj Sharma) was in ""Life of Pi,"" and Jesse (Chris Lowell) was in cult-classic ""Veronica Mars.""",/review/rw7773954/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2022,ajviele,1," Garbage
","I love the original it is one of the funniest shows of all time so of course I was looking forward to this. I watched the first 15 mins and I saw enough. This is awful, its unwatchable.",/review/rw7773954/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2022,matthewtessnear,1," Just another money grab
",Just another money grab for people who like Duff or watched How I Met Your Mother. The comedy doesn't hit. The acting is so contrived. The whole show just doesn't make any sense. The story isn't even compelling.,/review/rw7773954/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2022,mrfrane,2," A bigger fail than I expected
","There was no need for this unless Hilary Duff is broke. Hire writers with new ideas, please. Cliche characters, bad jokes and a very lame attempt to recreate the charm of the original show. Which was charming, in its time and ignoring all the creepy parts.",/review/rw7773954/?ref_=tt_urv
