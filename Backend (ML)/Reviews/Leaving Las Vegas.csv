27 May 2006,roghache,3," Unscrupulous maid of honour produces neither comedy nor romance
","This is a popcorn movie, a chick flick, that leaves a lot to be desired all around in the ethics department. Normally I am a huge fan of Julia Roberts but in this woeful tale, she fails to come across as her typical vulnerable and endearing self.",/review/rw1092179/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2014,vincentlynch-moonoi,7," ""Good"" film; Julia Roberts is downright mean-spirited here
","This was a pretty good romantic comedy, though two things bothered me about it. Our heroine is Julia Roberts. Heroine??? She's actually being quite despicable in this role -- actively deceiving everyone in an attempt to steal a man who is ""her best friend"" from his fiancé, a rather sweet person, even though she had years to marry the guy! And, to a large extent, her actions are simply out of spite. I guess her turn for the better in the climax is supposed to restore her goodness to our eyes...but it didn't quite work for me. The other issue I had about the movie was that it seemed long, although it comes in at only 105 minutes...and I'm not quite sure what I would have edited out. Maybe it was just my mood that evening.",/review/rw1092179/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2000,sue.pilgrim,," You'll either love this film or hate it!

1 February 2009,PudgyPandaMan,4," Plot is despicable, no matter how much you like the ""charming"" players
","I didn't like this film. The whole premise of a woman setting out to sabotage and destroy her best friend's wedding. Okay, so Julia Roberts plays the conniving woman - I guess that is supposed to make us fall in love with her and forget all the havoc she is wreaking. I for one didn't find it funny. In fact, most of the film annoyed me. Including, and especially, the stupid sing-along songs and those idiot twins.",/review/rw1092179/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2009,evanston_dad,4," Why Doesn't Julia Roberts Just Get Some Female Friends?

8 May 2000,Mister-6,10," The ""Wedding"" zingers....
","For a while, I was getting concerned about the direction Julia Roberts' career was taking, after misfiring in such dismal duds as ""Mary Reilly"" and ""Michael Collins"" where she seemed so shell-shocked that her radiant smile was nowhere in sight.",/review/rw1092179/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2008,Smells_Like_Cheese,6," One of the better rom com's
","I recently saw ""Made of Honor"" in the theater and everyone said that it was just a rip off of My Best Friend's Wedding, which I had never seen, never had an interest, but I figured I might as well see it. So I rented it the other day and watched it today, My Best Friend's Wedding has all the ultimate cliché's of a typical chick flick, but I think the reason I'm so gentle on this movie is because it's one of the first's to have it, so it was semi-original for the time. I mean we got the gay friend, the over perky blonde, the guy who can never take a hint, and our leading lady who is actually a horrible person, but for some odd reason we like her anyways. Julia Roberts, as horrible of a character she played, she made the movie likable and something you'd just wanna see how the story will play out until the very end.",/review/rw1092179/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2004,philip_vanderveken,6," Recognizable, but too annoying
","In a way this movie is quite recognizable to me. I also have made a deal to marry my best friend when we turn 30. She also has a boyfriend and I'm alone and yes, I do compare all girls to her. But that is as far as the similarities between the movie and my life go. No way that I would ever try to get between her and her boyfriend and certainly not when they decide to get married.

6 July 2021,ThomasDrufke,8," Charming
","Perhaps a morally questionable but undeniably sweet premise, My Best Friend's Wedding is a 90's charmer like no other. Consistently funny and one of Julia Robert's better early performances, I had a blast with this one. And for the record, the ending is the only fitting way to cap off this story.",/review/rw1092179/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2006,jboothmillard,7," My Best Friend's Wedding
","This is the film that basically relaunched ""pretty woman"", Golden Globe nominated Julia Roberts back on the star board, and quite rightfully so. Basically she plays Julianne Potter, who once had a relationship with now best friend Michael O'Neal (Dermot Mulroney). After a phone call she probably thought it could have gone further, but then she hears that he is getting married. Now she is trying everything she can to put a stop to the wedding of Micheal and fiancée Kimberly Wallace (Cameron Diaz), and maybe get her man back. Along the way she gets help from another good friend, the great gay character played by BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Rupert Everett, George Downes. In the end though, she realises that Michael loves this woman and she allows them to marry, but she still gets a nice dance with George. Originally in the story she was meant to get her man back, but I and the test audience are glad they changed it. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for James Newton Howard, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Julia Roberts was number 29 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and Rupert Everett was number 39 on The 50 Greatest British Actors. Very good!",/review/rw1092179/?ref_=tt_urv

","I think I like the movie most for Rupert Everett. His walk (which he describes as panther like) was amazing. he sticks to his friend, giving the only sensible advice possible. Say a little prayer for you was amazing, his story of his engagement with Julia was so delicious.",/review/rw1092179/?ref_=tt_urv

10 May 2012,writers_reign,7," A Groom With A Rue
","From what I've read here on IMDb this one split the vote straight down the middle, seems you either love it or loathe it. I found a lot to admire and little to dislike. It comes out of a long tradition that dates back to the earliest talkies; attractive, affluent people, living in luxurious apartments/houses, wearing expensive clothes, dining in expensive restaurants and generally being charming and romantic. We've been there with Cary Grant and Irene Dunne, Grant and Katherine Hepburn, Grant and Ingrid Bergman, Fred and Ginger, Claudette Colbert, Audrey Hepburn, Franchot Tone, Bill Holden, Doris Day, Rock Hudson and now the new generation, epitomized here by Julia Roberts. The story is relatively unimportant, all we ask is twelve reels of escapism, a set piece or two, a song or two, lots of laughter balanced by the odd tear, a soufflé' that segues into a lemon mousse and sends us out into the night with a smile on our face and warmth in our heart. This one delivers as well as any and better than most.",/review/rw1092179/?ref_=tt_urv

","Julianne Potter (Julia Roberts) is a relationship-phobic food critic. Her best friend is her ex Michael O'Neal (Dermot Mulroney). They have a pact to get married at 28 if there is no other prospects. She is about to turn 28. When he calls her, she thinks it's about their pact but it turns out that he is getting married to giddy bad-singing Kimberly Wallace (Cameron Diaz). Julianne is shocked and jealous. She starts to a scheme to separate the couple with the help of her gay editor friend George Downes (Rupert Everett).",/review/rw1092179/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 1999,helpless_dancer,9," cute romantic comedy
","I loved this show. The acting was flawless, and the story was funny, believable, and lovable. A woman goes after an old boyfriend who is about to be married. She didn't want him before the engagement, but went to all kinds of troubles to win him back before the marriage could take place. With every shananagan she pulled, she dug herself into a deeper and deeper hole. Finally, her antics were found out causing bitter feelings. The movie remained light hearted all the way through, giving me great bursts of hilarious guffaws. Diaz and Roberts were perfect together, great comedic actresses. See this one.",/review/rw1092179/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2001,raymond_chandler,8," Say a little prayer for more movies like this one.
","Julia Roberts gets a great opportunity to showcase her talent here, and she runs with it. Some of her physical comedy bits are reminiscent of Lucille Ball. She plays a character that could come off as a real jerk, but her natural charm and self-deprecating manner are endearing. She displays real acting chops, especially in the scenes on the tourboat and in the gazebo. ",/review/rw1092179/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2008,casamartinez01,5," A Frightening Comedy
","It was difficult to root for Julia Roberts. It would have been like rooting for Joan Crawford in ""Queen Bee"" or Gene Tirney in ""Leave Her To Heaven"" She's a latent nasty piece of work. A woman, we're told, intelligent, successful, but her feelings are of the lowest most ignorant kind. I didn't believe it, sorry. Not believing spoiled the whole fun for me. I though the premise was tapping into the worst in us and that in a comedy is really frightening. I'm sure the director, producers etc didn't do it on purpose but they obviously didn't think the whole thing through. The success of the film is another frightening aspect. Frightening on two counts - or audiences are blind and unaffected by the potential evil here or I'm raving mad and I'm seeing things. Whatever the case, I saw it and it frightened me. Two major saving graces, maybe three. The cuteness of Cameron Diaz's performance, the beauty of Dermot Mulroney and a smashing Cary Grantish turn by Ruperet Everrett. Go at your own peril.",/review/rw1092179/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2012,Vincentiu,," smart comedy
","nice, sweet, intelligent, seductive comedy. sure, not great but perfect for be more than a new pink story. Rupert Everett is perfect key for tale, Julia Roberts is perfect choice for ex girl friend but the axis, the top and the heart of film is Cameron Diaz in one of her best roles. it is a good film because it is excellent puzzle. love, hate, humor, vulnerability, the bitch, the innocent young woman, the naive lover and slices of meetings are directed with precise and full of grace art. so, it is a comedy and little more. picture of choices and shadows of past, subtle nuances of dialogs and a wise cast are central pieces of a build in which all is basket of crumbs from a hided Shakespeare.",/review/rw1092179/?ref_=tt_urv

14 March 2000,mayfair,5," Rupert Everett salvages an otherwise dreadful movie
","In his role as Julia Roberts' gay friend George, Rupert Everett effortlessly steals the show--he is urbane and witty, wise and caring, and of course uproariously funny and drop-dead gorgeous.  In contrast, ""leading man"" Dermot Mulroney appears crass, callow, and utterly devoid of charm or magnetism.  This movie, billed as a comedy, has an element of mystery at its core: Why on earth would two such winners as Julia Roberts and Cameron Diaz fight for the affections of such a dolt?! If not for Rupert Everett's performance, this movie would have rated a ""1"" for me!",/review/rw1092179/?ref_=tt_urv

","In the AFI Romance's montage, the image of a smiling Julia Roberts running in the airport was inserted in the 'climactic races' part, when you know it was only to meet her friend, you have an idea of how misleading the image was (although that was quite a bump when they 'met'). That's the best thing about P.J. Hogan's ""My Best Friend's Wedding"", it toys with all the expectations and actually delivers a story where you never exactly know what will happen till the end.
