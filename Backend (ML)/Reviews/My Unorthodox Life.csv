10 March 2021,grakky,10," Betty Gilpin !
","I love Betty Gilpin, this is the first time experience her acting talents and yup I want more :)
She's very good in action scenes and her facial animations are awesome.

29 July 2021,rbstern,8," Fun, action packed, and the message is both obvious and subtle
","Nobody will confuse this film with cinematic greatness. There's no grandeur. No towering monologues. The camera work, sound and special effects are all good, sometimes very good, but nothing great. The script is good, and necessarily hammy at times.",/review/rw5563822/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2020,kosmasp,9," Choosing sides
","Yes this is an analogy as someone already has written (or probably more than one) and for my money it is a pretty clever one. Not the message overall, not the simple structured story, but the layers within. This mirrors in a very bloody and violent way (it's a movie and it's heightened, but was still able to agitate some so this had to be postponed several times) what is happening in America specifically but in a way all over the world overall.",/review/rw5563822/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2021,Leofwine_draca,6," Brisk action comedy
","A familiar but efficient action comedy with an extremely brisk pacing and some good satire aimed squarely at American politics. There's an anything goes policy here with every political position a target and that makes for good humour, at least as far as I'm concerned. It's noticeably violent, kicking off with lots of shock deaths and scenes, before turning into a female-led revenge thriller towards the climax. Aside from Hilary Swank, most of the cast are unknown but they do a pretty good job here. It's not an amazing film but it did entertain me throughout.",/review/rw5563822/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2020,Neon_Gold,9," No One is Safe
","This movie is an equal opportunity offender and it's hilarious. It pokes fun at everyone and says ""don't worry you can laugh, even if it's at your own expense"".",/review/rw5563822/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2020,Coventry,7," The valuable and child-friendly life-lessons of ""The Tortoise and the Hare"". Or something like it...
","If there's one horror/thriller premise that already got turned into plenty of movies, it's the ""hunting humans for fun/sports"" idea. There are far too many titles to list, but some of my personal favorites include the 1932 original ""The Most Dangerous Game"", but also ""Blood Camp Thatcher"", ""Deadly Prey"", ""The Woman Hunt"" and ""Surviving the Game"". There's always room for anther favorite, though. In fact, there's even room for another twenty favorites, as long as they deliver suspense, gore, fresh & inventive killings and insane characters. Craig Zobel's ""The Hunt"" is definitely a new favorite!",/review/rw5563822/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2022,Tweekums,8," A fun satire as 'woke liberals' hunt 'deplorable rednecks'
","As this film opens people are having an online text conversation about hunting 'deplorables' at The Manor. In the next scene a luxury jet is transporting a group of very wealthy individuals, who display all the clich√© liberal values. They are interrupted by an incoherent man who clearly isn't from the same stratum of society... he has woken to early and is killed! We then see individuals, all gagged waking up in the countryside. They are given a crate full of weapons then come under attack; several are soon dead. A handful manage to escape to a gas station where they are told they are in Arkansas; this comes as a surprise as they are from all over the US. Not surprisingly the hunt is far from over. For most of the film we stick with Crystal May Creasey, a former marine, who is determined to survive and turn the tables on the attackers.",/review/rw5563822/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2021,DdyBd_90,7," Anyone who takes this movie seriously is exactly who this movie is making fun of
","Reading all these conflicting comments is hilarious...""It's bashing liberals, this is awesome!"" ""No! This movie is horrible because it's for liberals and makes conservatives look bad!"" ""NO, it's bad because it makes liberals look bad!!"" Well, in reality, it's a satirical movie about how people on both sides of the political spectrum can be garbage humans. The movie has liberals killing conservatives, then conservatives killing liberals. Both parties are exaggerated with all the typical dumb stereotypes, and both sides are equally made fun of with characters that act like idiots. Anyone who thinks this movie is ""sticking it to those darn liberals/conservatives!"" are the exact people this movie is making fun of.",/review/rw5563822/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2021,007Waffles,10," Funny dark comedy.
",This movie is hilarious. No one takes themselves seriously. Betty Gilpin does a great job in this film. I hope to see her in more action comedies.,/review/rw5563822/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2020,Top_Dawg_Critic,9," A deplorably liberating conservative satire executed like, wow!
","Take a hint, my title is satirical, as was this film. Anyone finding the need to pick a political side from this film needs to give their heads a shake. This was pure mindless entertainment, and writers Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof nailed it! I want/ed more! Directing by Craig Zobel was excellent. Casting was perfect, and both Gilpin and Swank delivered. Despite the awesome violence and gore, in the end, it's just a feel-good movie, comedic in nature, as one bad guy after another gets what everyone in the audience thinks they deserved. The critics got this one wrong - they either took it too politically, or had their neck-ties on too tight. A definite recommend from me, and a well deserved 9/10!",/review/rw5563822/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2020,Instant_Palmer,8," Polarizing & Mordant Satire - A Like-It or Hate-It Film. Gilpin Amazing.
","'The Hunt' tries hard to please those tired of the Left v Right debate (and pundits who populate both sides), and it succeeds at providing some very cleaver satirical moments throughout the film. For the low dollars invested, this Tarantino-ish production delivers a good ROI for the audience.",/review/rw5563822/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2021,damianphelps,10," Do It Again
","I just watched this with my teenage daughter and we both loved it (which is rare in a movie).
A fantastic underlying humour juxtaposed with a deeper social statement about essentially, fake news.",/review/rw5563822/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2020,BA_Harrison,8," The first really fun film of the decade.
","The Most Dangerous Game, Deadly Prey, Hard Target, The Condemned, Manhunt: hunting humans for sport has been done to death in the movies, but not since Turkey Shoot (AKA Escape 2000 or Blood Camp Thatcher) has it been so unashamedly gory and so much fun. In addition to providing the viewer with plenty of over-the-top violence, The Hunt delivers a healthy dose of scathing social satire, making it a hugely enjoyable way to spend 89 minutes (the perfect run-time for a film of this ilk).",/review/rw5563822/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2020,jbf-5,9," A fun satire featuring a unique super heroine who just doesn't give a damn
",Major spoilers alert.,/review/rw5563822/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2020,jaywensley2004,9," The pig in the poster is named Orwell. There's good reason for that.
",Oh boy this is fun.,/review/rw5563822/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2020,zardoz-13,8," Run for Your Life!!!
","You won't have to wait long for the blood, gore, and violence to erupt in ""Compliance"" director Craig Zobel's ""The Hunt,"" an entertaining, but derivative socio-political jeremiad about conspiracy theories in the Google age of misinformation. Disgraced cultural elitists on the Liberal Left start shooting, slashing, and slaying adherents of the populist Right without a qualm. This pretentious but polished yarn evokes memories of Richard Connell's classic short story ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" published on January 19, 1924. A mad Russian aristocrat stalks an unarmed big-game hunter for amusement on his privately-owned Caribbean island. Similarly, in ""The Hunt,"" ten men and women die gruesome deaths from bullets, boobytraps, and bows & arrows during the first thirty minutes of this 90-minute massacre. Clearly, producer & director Craig Zobel admires George Orwell's allegorical novel ""Animal Farm"" as much as ""The Most Dangerous Game."" Not only do Zobel and co-scripters Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof insert frequent ""Animal Farm"" allusions in the dialogue, but they also let a cute little pig cavort amidst all the savagery until its trigger-happy, Liberal owners ambush it by accident. Parenthetically, Cuse co-scripted the HBO mini-series remake of ""Watchmen"" (2019), while Lindelof created ""Lost"" (2004-2010).",/review/rw5563822/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2020,terrencepatrix,6," The message...stop trying to find a message in everything!
","This movie was written to basically call everyone an idiot if they base their whole lives around politically based ideological garbage. It's saying that regardless of being far right or far left you're still basically the same breed of moron and that it's the people living in the middle, who are actually trudging away just living our lives, are the actual badasses. Well not me specifically, but the general ""we"". The people who ignore the extremes of politics and just get things done. This movie portrays that in the least subtle way possible and I thought it was pretty hilarious.",/review/rw5563822/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2020,gricey_sandgrounder,7," Good fun and brave levels of dark humor
","It had similar vibes of Ready Or Not, ideas and themes of The Purge and the unpredictability of The Cabin In The Woods.
The first act is pretty strong and it really throws you off course as to who you think the main protagonist will be. That just set me up nicely for not having a clue of where it could go next.
It moves at a good pace, the violence is brutal but cartoonish in its execution, the gags are solid and go down brave but potentially dangerous routes. I was fine with them. But it wouldn't surprise if some might offend the SJW cinema-goers.
While the end was the most formulaic part of the film. The journey getting there made it a worthwhile watch.",/review/rw5563822/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2020,quinnox-1,8," A rare gem these days - an excellent horror movie
","This leans much more towards satire and black comedy style of horror.
Quite surprisingly good! A battle royale between the ""elites"" vs the ""deplorables"". I really liked how the filmmakers played around with the concepts of our current political zeitgeist, and its a lot of fun to see how they play with it, and provide a satiric commentary in the movie, targeting both sides. Both sides take hits, and also learn they have misconceptions about the other, and gain a newfound respect for their ""enemy"". A rare horror gem with wit, satire, smarts, and fun at the same time. The ending I absolutely loved, and thought it was exactly how it should have been.",/review/rw5563822/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2020,fashinrashin,9," see this flick !
","This is bloody, and bloody funny, and whip smart.
Dang why all the snowflakery, ? Both sides are made fun of so just sit back and be entertained.
Betty Gilpin ROCKS this movie and Swank is stellar (is she anything else ?)
Great fun, it must have been a blast to make.",/review/rw5563822/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2020,ferguson-6,7," it's a wild one for both extremes
","Greetings again from the darkness. Let's face it. It was a brilliant marketing strategy. In the wake of mass shootings, the release date of this film was delayed when its subject matter was deemed controversial, even scandalous The film's new marketing slogan became, ""The most talked about movie of the year is one that no one's actually seen."" Of course, it wasn't really true, as very few were actually talking about it. But that's what made it genius marketing ... they created interest amidst controversy that has since proven unnecessary. Director Craig Zobel (Z FOR ZACHARIAH, 2015) has delivered the least controversial, non-polarizing film of the year. It basically laughs at extremes on the left and right, and reminds us how laughing at something can often take away its power. And regardless of your ""side"", you'll find some laughs here.",/review/rw5563822/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2020,schadeev,8," So much better than expected
","It took me a while to watch this based on reviews and all the political nonsense, but I am so happy I changed my mind. One of the most entertaining movies I've seen in the last year. While there are political undertones and references, they're not over played and it adds to the entertainment. I highly recommend this movie. It's good for some laughs, and isn't light on the action.",/review/rw5563822/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2020,Fella_shibby,8," Fast paced thriller. Ignore the political comparisons.
