28 October 2021,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,4," Terrible writing.
","Kate Siegel is a good actress however the writing in this film is done poorly. This is a revenge thriller since there really isn't any mystery to uncover. The film uncovers exactly what's happening within the first quarter of the film. Pervvy psychologist using hypnosis. With no mystery to solve, the film becomes very boring. Feels like your typical boring Lifetime movie.",/review/rw7485980/?ref_=tt_urv

","MAN IT LITERALLY SAID ""UNKNOWN NUMBER."" STOP PICKING IT UP.",/review/rw7485980/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2021,Rachael-Harper,4," Great concept; badly executed!
","I think the reason that this movie is such a letdown is that it had the potential to be so much more!! A man who can talk you into doing anything he wants? The torment, the nightmare, the thousands of scenarios that could have come from that, but nope we never get beyond the creepy therapist. It's such a shame as this movie could have been great!!",/review/rw7485980/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2021,andrewchristianjr,7," TYPICAL THRILLER.
",A typical psychologic thriller. Interesting and entertaining. It's definitely one of those movies that can entertain you when you don't have anything else on your list or you've already finished your favorite films/series.,/review/rw7485980/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2021,nogodnomasters,5," You should be thanking me
",Jenn Tompson (Kate Siegel) attends a party where she meets Dr. Meade (Jason O'Mara). Being sad with a break up and unemployed she sees Dr. Meade who hypnotizes her. Dr. Meade is not a nice guy.,/review/rw7485980/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2021,payasoingenioso,3," A Series of Trash Decisions
",Not one good decision is made in this film.,/review/rw7485980/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2021,kuarinofu,4," More like Generic (2021)
",Another movie that you can safely include in the background when you do household chores.,/review/rw7485980/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2021,karinahatem,1," Another let down by Netflix
","Poor execution, poor performance, plot that is filled with too many wholes, predictable story, that I managed to know how it will go and end after the first 15m. I mean, even the ending was bad. Netflix, pls stop acquiring stupid silly movies.",/review/rw7485980/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2021,kosmasp,6," In your dreams
","Yes you could claim, that something like this can be written by someone in their sleep. Puns aside, the execution is quite well done though. The acting is decent. And while it is more than likely that you have seen something like this before - or even if not, you'll be able to guess where this is going ... it still can be entertaining or suspensful enough to watch.",/review/rw7485980/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2021,namstonk,1," What the fudge
",Well all the cast are better actor's than this calamity. Great acting cannot cover-up garbage direction and a woefully bad script. The only thing worse is the wig at the end and the final line.,/review/rw7485980/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2021,pigsrings,3," Poorly written
",Didn't even make it 30min into this movie. It's like it was written by high school students. Couldn't give it more of my time. I suspected I would've wasted my time if I watched the entire thing. Reading the other reviews confirmed it.,/review/rw7485980/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2021,gianmarcoronconi,5," Not that nice
","Film with a really nice background idea, it's a pity that the plot is very obvious, you immediately understand everything and in general there are a few holes. Too bad because the idea is beautiful and some scenes are also beautiful but it is too obvious.",/review/rw7485980/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2021,takato0524,1," Made it 32 minutes
","How many movies are they going to make about a depressed white woman with no job yet lives in a fancy apartment with a different race boyfriend/love interest, and had some type of trauma? Sigh. I wanted to check this out cuz I like Dule, but not enough to watch this whole thing.",/review/rw7485980/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2021,julian-640-544058,2," They got it all wrong....
","As a film viewer, I found the movie to be generally fair. The acting was not too bad. The filmography and editing was adequate; however, the plot was ridiculous which means the writing was way off.",/review/rw7485980/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2021,tukenukemi,3," Yep, it's another stinker
","Only good thing about this is the premise, but it's all downhill from there. Basically it's just a low-tier ""Black Mirror"" episode with an extended runtime. Stupid and underdeveloped on almost every possible level.",/review/rw7485980/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2021,jtindahouse,5," Doesn't do anything interesting with a fun premise
","Netflix movies get a bit of a bad rap. To be fair it does seem like a large majority of them have been pretty bad. The odd one surprises you though and those are the ones that keep us coming back. 'Hypnotic' is probably not going to do their reputation much good. It's a decent idea, but it's so bland it feels one step ahead of a Lifetime movie for a large portion of the runtime.",/review/rw7485980/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2021,suzistringeris,5," Great premise poorly executed
",What a shame. Someone had a great idea but sold it to the wrong production team. The story had such great potential. I would like to see it remade by professionals. It could be a winner in the right hands. I'd recommend a watch anyway.,/review/rw7485980/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2021,wisemanfromtowne,1," Netflix...the new Lifetime channel
","Not sure why this didn't just debut on Lifetime. Bad story telling, white chicks that look aged, one black actor and nice homes. Netflix....the new Lifetime channel.",/review/rw7485980/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2021,DarkVulcan29,6," Not thrilling enough
","This movie is not terrible, but not good enough to give it a good rating. It feels very rushed, I've seen movies short like this, I've seen better development then this. Hardly any suspence or thrills, pretends to have a twist, but in the end not really.",/review/rw7485980/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2021,Go_For_The_Jugular,3," They overdid it!
",I like the idea/story of a hypnotist abusing their powers...and getting patients to do sketchy stufff - and I wouldn't even be surprised if that's something that happens in real life.,/review/rw7485980/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2021,Littlesummer14,1," I lost words ...
","One thing i should tell you is dont waste your precious time
I watched it so u dont have to
It's nonsense
Idk how it's just that easy to hypnotize people
So so so so so easy
Sleep
She goes to sleep
Stop
She stops
Blah...
So easy to predict
Just watch something else haha.",/review/rw7485980/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2021,bshaef,4," Started Off Good
","Ended up ho hum. Netflix, you can do better than this. My review has to contain at least 150 characters to be publishable but a movie can be god awful rotten and still be on Netflix. Nof fair.",/review/rw7485980/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2021,SoumikBanerjee25,3," Everything has been kept at a bare minimum!
",Tricky subjects like Hypnosis deserves far better.,/review/rw7485980/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2022,mohinderchugh,," Please give back my 90 Minutes
","Avoid this movie it is 90 minutes waste of your time, Bad story bad acting bad setup. You keep on waiting for twist and nothing happens, I am asking Netflix to refund me for complete one month subscription fee.",/review/rw7485980/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2021,ZOR33L,2," Even a 4 years old could predict the whole plot from the start
","Honestly, Netflix really needs some quality control. From the start of this movie, it is super clear what will happen next. No surprises, no twists, nothing. A thriller usually needs to challenge the viewer, keep us on the edge of our seat, this movie is just pure cliche after cliche (which sadly, most new netflix movies suffer from).",/review/rw7485980/?ref_=tt_urv
