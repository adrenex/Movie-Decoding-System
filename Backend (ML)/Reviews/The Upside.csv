8 February 2008,Chrysanthepop,," Flawed but Gripping
","'The Client' is perhaps one of the many films that won't be enjoyed as much after one has read the book. I, having not read John Grisham's novel, quite enjoyed it. Sure the movie has its flaws in the form of plot holes, caricatures, obvious clichés etc, but it essentially manages to keep the viewer engaged. 'The Client' is further backed up by strong performances. Susan Sarandon makes full use of her powerful screen presence and easily stands out. No wonder she's an exceptional actress. Reggie Love is one of her most memorable performances (among the so many she's already given). The late Brad Renfro, as the young Sway, is very competent and does impress in several scenes. Tommy Lee Jones is funny (both intentionally and unintentionally). From the supporting cast, Mary-Louise Parker leaves a mark. William H. Macy barely has more than a few lines but has a dignified presence. The villains both look and act like caricatures. In a nutshell, it's an interesting film with a flawed but gripping plot and marvelous performances.",/review/rw0988648/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2002,Agent10,7," Dark and gripping
","Susan Sarandon should stick with the tough minded lawyer more often. Perfectly cast in the role of Reggie Love, she brings a certain charm to a role which could have lacked in that department. And to make matters even tougher on her, she was almost outshined by Brad Renfro, who made quite an impression in a film such as this. While the film was put together in a rather conventional way, with Tommy Lee Jones playing an over clichéd character, the film is still rather gripping. A decent film to have in your collection, and one of the better John Grisham book-turned-movie adaptations.",/review/rw0988648/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2012,g-bodyl,8," Very Absorbing, But Could Have Been More!
","The Client is a good film with moments of extreme greatness especially for a courtroom thriller such as this. But there are also scenes where they should have been added into the editing room. The film was excellent in the beginning, slows to a crawl in the middle, and picks up in the end. If it stayed like the beginning, this film would have been flawless.",/review/rw0988648/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2004,rmax304823,," Above Average Legal Tale.
","Wow, what a cast! And they all deliver the goods too. Susan Sarandon is an exceptional actress. Watch the scene in ""Dead Man Walking"" when she visits the family of one of the victims. She doesn't just sit quietly. She actively ""listens"" to them. And Tommy Lee Jones uncovers the comic side of his dashing political lawyer. Even the eleven-year-old kid gives a spot on performance, anything but cute, which is a relief. The smaller roles are equally well done although there is less to be done well. J. T. Walsh is always good. Mary-Louise Parker never makes a wrong move as the stressed-out mother. Ossie Davis is a monumental presence as the judge. Bill Macy is given only a few lines.",/review/rw0988648/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2020,bbewnylorac,8," A great film
","It's heavy on dialogue but The Client has an excellent plot - a trailer park boy witnesses a terrible incident involving gangsters and, while on the run from them, chooses a struggling recovering alcoholic lawyer, a woman called Reggie Love, to represent him.
As the boy, Mark Renfro is outstanding - focused, tough but vulnerable, and funny. I was sad to learn that Renfro died of substance abuse age 25 - he was really talented. As his down and out mother, Mary-Louise Parker tries hard - it's more her character and lines that are cliched. But the real stars are Susan Sarandon as the spirited lawyer Reggie Love who gets many knocks but gets back up again. And Tommy Lee Jones, as the lead detective, is just wonderful - smart and tough and a little devious in his attempts to get information oit of the kid. Like in The Fugitive, the police are actually harassing the witness and not the culprits. In this case, the witness is a child, whose rights Reggie ferociously fights for.",/review/rw0988648/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 1999,Spleen,3," Too dull to be properly irritating but too irritating to sleep through
","I don't mean to play the prig, but the kid was withholding evidence.  Are we really meant to be on his side?  Surely it's more rational to hope that the forces of law and order get the information out of that little pipsqueak in the end.",/review/rw0988648/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2003,Silverzero,," Compelling, engrossing and well acted thriller.
","""The Client"" is an enjoyable and well executed thriller overall. While the directing, script and overall product are far from amazing and sometimes quite bland, the Oscar level performances compensate for the easily over-seeable flaws. ",/review/rw0988648/?ref_=tt_urv

18 March 2014,SnoopyStyle,6," A bit of stereotypical overacting except for the great work from Susan Sarandon
","Mark Sway (Brad Renfro) and little brother Ricky run across mob lawyer Jerome Clifford trying to commit suicide in his car. Mark tries to stop him. Jerome grubs him into the car, and confesses the location where his client Barry Muldano (Anthony LaPaglia) buried a body to the boy. Mark lies to the cops saying he didn't talk to Clifford. The cops, the FBI, and the DA Roy Foltrigg (Tommy Lee Jones) do not believe him. Mark under pressure hires lawyer Reggie Love (Susan Sarandon). Meanwhile the mob sends hit men Paul Gronke (Kim Coates).",/review/rw0988648/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2001,smatysia,7," Good performances here; some plot holes
","Somehow the plot holes didn't seem so glaring in Grisham's novel. Anyway, this is one of Susan Sarandon's many excellent performances. And Tommy Lee Jones gleefully chews the scenery here. You might think he is overacting, but he is really playing a character that comes across that way. Brad Renfro was an excellent find for this part. I haven't seen him in anything else, though. I imagine his Southern accent will hurt in getting other roles. Current TV stars Bradley Whitford and Anthony Edwards were non-entities in this film. It's a good film, not great.

15 September 2000,michaelRokeefe,7," Intense thriller. A must see.
","Joel Schumacher directs an intense and enthralling catch as catch can thriller based on John Grisham's novel of the same name. A young boy(Brad Renfro) witnesses the suicide of a high dollar lawyer, who is do to represent a Mafia hitman that is accused of killing a Senator. An egotistical district attorney(Tommy Lee Jones), the FBI and the Mafia all suspect that the boy, found at the scene, knows the dead lawyer's secrets.

26 June 2003,=G=,5," No mark left unmissed
","""The Client"", another marginal film from the master of the marginal film, is a B flick trying to look like an A flick. Schumacher manages to wrest some second rate performances from an excellent cast and Renfro's debut is no exception. The sweaty Southern noir atmospherics don't work any better than the music which seems always off target in this clumsy film which only squeaks by on the sheer charisma and talent of heavyweights Sarandon and Jones. Barely watchable, eminently forgettable, and for needy couch potatoes only. (C)",/review/rw0988648/?ref_=tt_urv

8 August 2017,rdoyle29,5," Sheer crap
","I think this film is garbage. I'll be clear ... it's a competently made film with a mostly talented cast, but the story is really stupid in the laziest way possible. All the characters are one dimensional stereotypes and they inhabit a plot that strains to reach mere implausibility.",/review/rw0988648/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 1998,Cantoris-2,," Heroism very new/very old
","Mark Sway is a real hero here, although he is not only a mere child, but a disadvantaged child in the middle of adult power structures breathtaking in their deviousness and casual cruelty. The theme of youngsters forced by circumstances into adult roles and responsibilities, particularly in being more level-headed and mature than their parent(s) has become as strikingly common in contemporary literature as it was strikingly uncommon until about a generation ago.  But there are ample parallels to real life in pre-Romantic history. It is really our modern assumptions of prolonged childhood and adolescence which are abnormal in the fuller perspective of human experience.  Aren't we on the verge of these concepts' retreating from the apogees to which western culture pushed them in the 19th and early 20th centuries?",/review/rw0988648/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2022,safenoe,6," Tommy Lee Jones steals the movie
","I saw The Client in the cinema when it was all the ralge to go to the cinema. I thought The Firm was better, but still, The Client doesn't necessarily disappoint. But I expected more from a cinematic experience. The Client could have been a more than decent TV film I guess.",/review/rw0988648/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2012,bkoganbing,9," Such interesting characters come from John Grisham
",Ironically enough I saw a Perry Mason episode a few days earlier where a young kid around Brad Renfro's age comes to Raymond Burr seeking legal advice and got taken on as a client eventually.

28 September 2018,PraiseBOD,3," Waste of time
","Where to start? This is a bad film from start to finish.
1. The acting is really bad. Almost everyone is overacting. Almost every character is a bad stereotype: The scummy cop, the over the top mob gangster, the white trash single mother, the bratty child that doesn't want any help, etc. Lastly, the southern accents are just plain terrible. They are just pure cliché and add to the terrible overacting.",/review/rw0988648/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2002,bardofavon,," Pure Hollywood cliche - with a lame plot, to boot.
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** This movie is completely formulaic, melodramatic, and contrived.  Everyone but William H. Macy overacts to the point of charicature, which is appropriate, since the film is a charicature of its genre.",/review/rw0988648/?ref_=tt_urv

15 May 2000,fhabets,3," Earnest movie with idiotic plot
","This movie was my introduction to Grisham. After viewing it, I felt I would have been better off being introduced to a wad of bubble gum clogging up a rusty drain. The premise to the film plays false, and the ensuing plot has more holes in it than a junkie. That'd be forgivable, if the characters were enjoyable, but they're not. Low point of the movie: the scene where the lawyer and the brat bare their souls, talking about their lousy childhoods. Since when did surviving a lousy childhood make you some kind of special person? It's that New Age hoky victims-are-beautiful psychobabble at work here. Maybe that's why Grisham is so popular. God forbid it's because of his idiotic sense of plot.",/review/rw0988648/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2020,MOscarbradley,7," It's the cast that delivers this time round.
","""The Client"" is one of the better big-screen adaptations of a John Grisham novel and it's largely down to a terrific cast. some of who weren't even 'names' at the time. The plot is fairly typical Grisham, (a witness to a killing needs to be protected from the killers), but the twist here is that the killing was a suicide, the victim a mob lawyer who blurted out where the body was hidden before blowing his brains out and the witness, an eleven year old street-wise kid.",/review/rw0988648/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2004,Ironmas78,7," Enjoyable
","First off all, you should always read the book first. I think it is a pretty good adaption. John Grisham fans should not be disappointed by the choice of actors for the parts in the book. Especially Tommy Lee Jones, a personal favorite, plays his part well, and his scenes with Sarandon are the best part of the film. They keep testing each other and have some verbal clashes but in the end you can see Jones' character isn't as bad as he seems and he clearly respects Sarandon's efforts. Only negative comment for this movie is that it never seems to reach the suspense it is aiming for and so it becomes good entertainment for one evening but forgettable soon after.",/review/rw0988648/?ref_=tt_urv
