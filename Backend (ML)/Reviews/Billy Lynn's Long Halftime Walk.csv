13 March 2021,Bill_Rodgers,7," What to know before watching !
","Ok, I'll make this very straightforward. This is the ideal film if you are a parent looking to spend a nice evening with your kids. The story is simple, easy to follow, somewhat funny at times and very charming for young audiences. I cannot stress enough how this is a movie meant to watch with kids and is unlikely to be satisfying for teens and adults. Overall, this is an ""okay"" movie and you should not watch this film expecting anything extraordinary.",/review/rw6718420/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2021,ejarvis-90678,8," It's a FAMILY MOVIE!

14 March 2021,jrichar8-393-865922,8," It's a dumb kids movie, and it's great.
","I'm laughing at everybody upset about the contrived plot and dumb jokes. It's a family movie, intended to be silly, not something competing for a Palme d'Ore. Maybe if you're watching a Netflix movie where the premise is parents have to say yes to everything their preteen kids want to do you should dial back your expectations about the plot? Did you watch Kindergarten Cop and get upset that Ahnold didn't have a teaching certificate? It's stupid, it's fun, get together with your kids and enjoy it.",/review/rw6718420/?ref_=tt_urv

12 March 2021,trinaboice,9," Family-friendly fun
","IN A NUTSHELL:
I love the idea of a Yes Day! Parenting is full of ""no's"", so it's important to show our kids that we can be fun and spontaneous too. The family-friendly film is based on the book Yes Day! by Amy Krouse Rosenthal.",/review/rw6718420/?ref_=tt_urv

","Free spirit Allison (Jennifer Garner) marries soulmate Carlos Torres (Edgar Ram√≠rez) and they have three kids. Somewhere along the way, she becomes an over-protective mom. Her kids are not happy with her controlling ways. The school counsellor suggests giving the kids a Yes Day, a day when Allison says yes to her kids' every wish... within reason.",/review/rw6718420/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have never heard of or read the book but I enjoyed the movie adaptation. Jennifer Garner is always a joy to watch, often playing delightful and endearing characters. It was fun too to see some new faces in the dad and children and after a long day it was nice to sit down to a sweet, fun family movie.",/review/rw6718420/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2021,downthehobbitholeblog,9," A great family fun watch from Netflix, if you enjoyed...
","Based off of a children's book and a growing trend, Netflix's Yes Day is a fun family comedy starring Jennifer Garner as a mom who is struggling to both relate to and parent her kids. The movie isn't for everyone, if you are not a fan of cheesy family comedies, avoid this one. But it's also not just for parents or kids. If you enjoy comedies, have ever felt frustrated by the mundane tasks of being a kid or adult, and want a good laugh- this is a great watch! The premise is that the kids are in charge and that the parents have to say yes to everything they want to do- with some solid boundaries. A break for both the parents who have to say no 'a million times an hour' and the kids who feel like they are never in control. The main goal- a fun family day of connecting and hilarity. Will it go according to plan?? Looking for guidelines for your own yes day or a fuller parent review? Check out our full post on it at Down The Hobbit Hole Blog Yes Day. Netflix is doing a great job with the family movies. I think this will be one of our favorites, along with Animal Crackers. If you like the Pacifier or My Spy- you'll enjoy this one!",/review/rw6718420/?ref_=tt_urv

31 December 2021,deloudelouvain,3," Get your vomit bucket ready, you'll need it.
","I thought I was going to watch a comedy so I was expecting a lot of laughter. I laughed exactly three times, mild giggles, with scenes that didn't involve the family. That whole family unity thing was just cringing to watch. Those kids were very annoying to watch, can't call them actors to be honest, and the parents made me want to get my vomit bucket. It's so cheesy and predictable I get it that only parents with three kids can enjoy this piece of garbage. I'm glad I'm not the only one on here that thought this movie was bad, in fact I read much more negative reviews than positive ones, which in the end makes perfectly sense.",/review/rw6718420/?ref_=tt_urv

","Super generic family comedy is super generic. Couple decent performances offset by some massive logic leaps I just wasn't willing to make. Don't let your kids watch this, it will give them way too many awful ideas. As an aside though? I love that this was a mixed heritage household and they never once made a thing out of it. Garner is obviously a white woman and she's married to a (what's the appropriate parlance these days? Is it latino? Latin? LatinX? My apologies if I get it wrong) Latin American man who speaks Spanish and English during the movie. In so many other movies they would've done a whole thing about that and I kind've love that this wasn't even mentioned, it just was what it was and that's awesome. Movie is still super generic but I dig that.",/review/rw6718420/?ref_=tt_urv

18 March 2021,kwenchow,1," Another worst film! Full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Avoid at all cost!
","This film start with the narrator talking about Carlos, and the introduction of the Torres family scene! As turnout, this film is about Torres family need to spend the so called ""Yes Day"" together one day! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the driving scene, overuse of the singing scene, overuse of the eating scene, overuse of the drinking scene, overuse of the song playing at the background scene, overuse of the playing dumb scene, overuse of the calling names scene, overuse of the partying scene, overuse of the playing with foam scene, overuse of the shouting scene, and overuse of the arguing scene! Make the film unwatchable! Barely laughable scene is, Allison, and Carlos fighting with a woman to win the gorilla doll! At the end, after cleaning the foam, the foam still flooding the outside house of Carlos! Still have a post credit scene! The referee been throwing things by the contestant! That's it! Another disappointed film!",/review/rw6718420/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2021,classicsoncall,4," ""You should say 'yes' to a Yes Day"".
","Rating the film higher than I did would be a disservice to all the other pictures I've reviewed and rated, but if you're a young family with kids, it's not the worst thing in the world to watch together as a unit. I see a similar sentiment expressed by others on this board, so I don't think I'm being too critical. There's a lot of buffoonery and silliness going on in the story, pretty much to be expected given the premise of the film, to allow the kids in the family an opportunity to have all their fun requests allowed under the guise of a 'yes day' where anything goes within reason. I thought the 'windows open car wash' a stretch even for the most permissive of parents but what the heck, it's only a movie. A feel good moment occurs in the final segment when Mom (Jennifer Garner) finds her daughter (Jenna Ortega) at an amusement park concert she wasn't allowed to attend with her friends unsupervised, and it makes for the picture's message of families staying together by playing together. At just under an hour and a half, this could be one of your 'yes day' activities.",/review/rw6718420/?ref_=tt_urv

21 March 2021,koofasa,2," I live Jennifer Garner but...
","Don't you love it when school teachers tell parents how to raise their children? When a couple of teachers tell a set of parents that their children are complaining that their parents are strict, the teachers convince the parents to change how they parent their kids. This is one more case of the establishment diminishing the importance of parenting. Perhaps this is why our millennials are still living at home now that they are nearing middle age. A few too many yes days. Just say no, grow up, get a job and be an adult. Does anyone else remember their parents telling them that the reason they say know no is because they love them. I recall hearing 'If I didn't love you so much..."" and it always ended with a no. I ended up having a ton of respect for parents because they didn't do the easy thing but always made sure that I knew they loved me.",/review/rw6718420/?ref_=tt_urv
