9 January 2023,ab-84038,9," Good installment of the series
","Good installment (Movie #4) in the Wedding Veil movie series. The three best friends are all featured but, this is Avery and Peter's story. Avery is involved in a work drama, renovating a house and hoping/trying for a baby.",/review/rw8789848/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2023,haa4,9," After Happily Ever After
",Love that the trilogy is continuing and The Wedding Veil Expectations was a solid continuation of Peter and Avery's love story. What happens after happily ever after? This is it! I appreciated the Hallmark-style bedroom scenes as well. Not something we usually see!,/review/rw8789848/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2023,aprilskau,10," Another Engaging Installment of The Wedding Veil
","One of the reasons I enjoyed the original parts of The Wedding Veil involved the art and the history that were showcased with the story. I wasn't sure what this next installment would offer me as part of the audience, but I found it even more delightful. It let us glimpse into the new marriage of Avery and Peter, and the negotiations and frustrations that come with marriage and the adjustment to another person in most aspects of life. Because of the previews, I didn't realize how much this story would focus on the two of them and their struggles together. It turned out to be a lovely surprise. The story was great, the acting, superb, and the overall production, simply wonderful.",/review/rw8789848/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2023,pgibbons-83953,10," Kevin and Lacey were at their best!
","It took me awhile to warm up to the original Wedding Veil movies. I liked them okay, but they weren't movies I was going to run right out and rewatch. I had no idea what to expect, coming into this one, but I absolutely loved it. We were told that these movies showed what happened after the wedding, and that's exactly what this showed. Avery and Peter were still in a very loving, healthy relationship, with life's normal bumps along the way. I typically don't enjoy Hallmark's movies about married couples, because they are usually about marriages in trouble. This was not the case, with ""Expectations.""",/review/rw8789848/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2023,pilgrimrevisited,10," The Best Veil Movie Yet
","I loved this movie!!! It's so seldom (if ever) we get to see what happens after ""the happily ever after"" of a movie but we do with this one. In my opinion this film is a must see because it does show the day to day life with all its challenges... plus with the acting of the amazingly talented Kevin Mcgarry and Lacey Chabert as well as the rest of the cast, it's well worth the watch; they really made it feel real as they went through the ups and downs of day to day life. That said, I also see so many opportunities in the plot for this to become a great mini series (ahem Hallmark). Either way, though I've seen it twice already and working on watching for the third time now, I'm discovering things I missed on the first two viewings and I know I'll watch it again. Congrats Hallmark cast and crew on a job well done!",/review/rw8789848/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2023,vivdubetz,10," Loved this movie
","Loved seeing a relationship after the wedding is over. The story was engaging and there were a lot of comedic moments and dramatic moments as well. Kevin and Lacey have great chemistry, which added to the appeal of the story. The acting was well done by everyone, especially by Kevin and Lacey. The women's friendship added to the story nicely, without taking over the main storyline. I liked seeing a continuation to a story that I really liked as well. It would be great if we could visit them again next year (hint, hint to TPTB). I really enjoyed this sequel to the Wedding Veil and would reccommend it to everyone, especially if you want to see something a bit different from Hallmark.",/review/rw8789848/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2023,guardedheartie,10," Romance after marriage, real problems, such GREAT talant!
","This movie was SUCH a delight, and made me smile, laugh out loud, and be silent with a content full heart so many times.",/review/rw8789848/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2023,tbouckhuyt,10," Another winner for HM
","Kevin McGarry has wit and humor he brings to his role and so naturally, along with his range of talents and handsome good looks, and those mesmerizing blue eyes.. The tenderness for each other they give in their roles on screen is so endearing. You can tell they work well together. Lacey is a producer too and hand picked Kevin for this role. Even Autumn and Alison enjoy him on set, he is serious about his role yet keeps things light, so the whole team works well together and it shows. A delightful, in depth storyline that just keeps getting better. They now have their 1st baby, and his mother found love again, so the wedding veil has succeeded, keeps working it's legend and all are happy in the ending. Lacey's wardrobe is always outstanding. Delightful movie I've already watched multiple times ! Enchanting feel good movie ‚ù§",/review/rw8789848/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2023,margaretyong-94541,10," good storyline and acting was good
","Nice story line after the first wedding veil movie. The acting by Lacey and Kevin was good - not overdone, very natural and his expressions were good. Hope they do another sequel next year. Did not like the storyline on the new guy in charge of the museum though. The costumes was so nice. The heigh difference between Kevin and Lacey was quite funny, but Lacey is a very petite woman so she looks small even with other actors. Nice movie to start the year 2023, i hope the rest of HM movies improve as i have no seen a good HM movie for quite a while. Kevin is my favourite Hallmark actor and hope he does more movies.",/review/rw8789848/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2023,leahfreitag,10," Absolutely loved it!
",Even though I'm not happy about all the changes Hallmark is doing within their brand I really love the direction they're taking with some of their projects!,/review/rw8789848/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,shaynagreene,," Fashion and friendship
","Watched the four parts of the series shown so far. The series contains the basic hallmarks of Hallmark, i.e. Simplicity and not loaded with suspense. Most of us don't want anything too loaded right now, especially not after the past two years and the price of gas. There are two things I like about the series. The second one is the fashion, the three friends have their own individual fashion, as different as their personalities are but the styles are trendy and unique, makes you want to watch. The number one feature of the series I like is the special friendship they have. Everyone needs a friend who will always be there, who understands them, who can read their emotions on the phone. The camaraderie and authenticity of the three leading ladies is enviable.",/review/rw8789848/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,debbiech,10," Really lovely movie
","As a fan of the first three wedding veil movies, expectations were high. This did not disappoint! Usually with hallmark we get the kiss in the last 30 seconds and then happily ever after. Here - we get to see the happily ever after - after a few bumps. This movie is precious. The leads Lacey and Kevin are great..their real life friendship is so obvious. It was romantic and sweet but showing the little bumps when first married. Added story of husband's widowed mom meeting someone - and how her son had to deal with that was well done. Friendship with the girls - felt like coming home. Recommend.",/review/rw8789848/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2023,zachsrthankful,10," Thank you! This amazing movie Exceeded my Expectations!
","So looked forward to this movie because I loved the first movie and yet still blown away! The storyline was wonderful and very believable and to see their lives continue after their wedding was so fun! Kevin McGarry's talent was incredible and he and Lacey set the bar very high for this second trilogy! The range of circumstances and emotions evoked by the wide range of acting was so enjoyable and heartfelt. I could easily see a sitcom come from this 4th movie, even more than I wanted one for the first! I absolutely loved it and the nod to When Harry Met Sally outtakes were the icing on the cake!",/review/rw8789848/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,Arnie-13007,10," Great movie
","What a cool concept, to continue this trilogy, so that viewers get to see what happened after the lead couple's walk down the aisle. I absolutely loved that! Yes, the first movie was great, but for that reason, I thought this one was even better.",/review/rw8789848/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,Sar-83599,10," Loved this one. Great actors!
","I just love the two actors in this one. They play off of each other so well, and their chemistry is off the charts. I think they are my favorite couple from this trilogy.",/review/rw8789848/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2023,tncendicott,10," Beyond my expectations!
","I tuned into this continuation of the Wedding Veil trilogy with much fear and hesitation. I knew the original movie had kept my interest due to Kevin McGarry being the lead and the story involving a mystery, but I was afraid that Kevin wouldn't be in this one much due to his lack of being shown much in promos. They kept promoting this as being focused on the female friendships between the lead women and I expected the marriage to be given very little screen time due to that. WOW! Showing their marriage and life they were building together WAS the largest plot in the story. Usually in movies, marriage is shown in such a negative light that you usually finish a movie with negativity towards your marriage or marriage partner. Nope. Not in this one! I loved how they started the movie with Peter waking her up with a rose in bed. It was a reference back to their first date they had together in the first trilogy walking through the garden to smell the roses! This movie had excellent acting, chemistry between scene partners, witty banter, comedic timing, romance, positive examples of how to resolve marital conflict and how to talk through stressful situations and encourage your partner in moments of doubt. This was pure sweetness and joy to watch from start to finish. I smiled for days after viewing it and it motivated me to take the time to add some romance back into my marriage! I love the height difference between Peter and Avery and all the humorous situations that allows for in watching their relationship unfold onscreen. I loved the positive message that was sent that said you can have a career AND l desire to have children and want to be good parents! So often, parenting and raising children is mocked and treated as a life sentence and not as the true privilege it is!! The minivan jokes were hilarious. Kevin's acting choices in how he showed Peter's playfulness and flirty banner with Avery were spot on. Lacey played Avery as the perfect example of loving and encouraging partner even when she didn't get her way in various situations. I loved the acting by Sam and Lucy and also appreciated seeing a positive relationship between a mother in law and daughter in law shown onscreen! I could envision Kevin and Lacey playing a couple in their own TV series or sitcom even if the Wedding Veil Trilogy ends after this year. I love them together as much as I love seeing Lacey with Brennan Elliot.",/review/rw8789848/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2023,lillianrondanini,10," fantastic movie , incredible performances by two leads . Great moments captured on screen .
",Loved this movie . We see Avery and Peter on married life with the love and stresses of a couple newly married. The comedy and emotion and love shown on screen is a testament to a great scrip and Lacey Chabert and Kevin McGarry incredible performances. The friends and other cast members added to the plot lots of emotional moments and the Director Peter Benson gave us incredible scenes . Cinematography was just beautiful . All characters were developed with very distinct personalities and the three friends are so close and so different. It is a delight to see these friends support each other and this couple welcome a new baby with all the fear and love and expectation .,/review/rw8789848/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2023,cgvsluis,8," Call me a sap, but I love this wedding veil series and I love the collaboration of female actors!
","We return to the Italian wedding veil saga. Our three college friends and art aficionados have now all married wonderful men wearing the beautiful Italian veil. (I loved how each had their own personal style and wore the veil in a slightly different way.) We head back to Boston to catch up with Avery and Peter. These two are still madly in love with Peter waking up his romantic wife (the most romantic of the three friends) with a rose each morning. They have purchased this wonderful old home that should be on a historic registry...but in the process of doing some remodeling and updating, discover leaks, cracks in the foundation, etc. To top it off Avery is putting together a new lace exhibit at the museum and has a new boss who she doesn't see eye to eye with. Can she find the perfect unforgettable moment to tell Peter they are expecting and is veil working it's magic on someone else?",/review/rw8789848/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2023,mhuether-10998,10," Happily Ever After
","It was wonderful to see Avery and Peter living their happily ever after. As usual, happily ever after doesn't mean that everything actually goes perfectly. There are stresses in life, whether it's disappointed hopes surrounding a suspected pregnancy, work related, home renovations, or personal fears about our parents or something else. It was wonderful to see this couple meet these challenges and see them supporting each other in a loving relationship. I loved the talk about looks across the room and then actually seeing such a look at the next Veil wedding.",/review/rw8789848/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2023,mr-bedford,1," Oh dear
","One of the funniest films I've seen in years. There is no real plot at all, the editing is terrible it's almost like a sketch show with inane dialogue about nothing. Acting is terrible and the cast should be on day time soap operas from the 90s (as backup) it's not a very long film so if you are really bored give it a go, with a couple of beers.",/review/rw8789848/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2023,sallylit,1," No Chemistry Between Peter and Avery - Peter's Accent Kept Shifting
","There is no chemistry between Peter and Avery. They both came off as wooden and cold and not like two people in love. Also, the actor who played Peter wasn't professional enough to keep a Boston accent going throughout the movie. I had the same problem with the character of Peter in the first Veil movie. I was hoping his acting would improve this time around, but it didn't.",/review/rw8789848/?ref_=tt_urv

15 January 2023,bretonwoman,10," A movie that changes from the usual plots!
","Because an original story deserves a good grade! I really liked the first 3 and was afraid to expect too much from the new one but it exceeded my expectations, I really loved all those little moments of everyday life that can be linked to ours, the relationship of the lead couple is really sweet, the actors are perfect, nice chemistry and a real affection. I also appreciated that the richness of the couple is assumed but not put forward, that Avery puts too much pressure on herself to make a perfect pregnancy announcement and ends up exploding because she should have told him well before, that he makes the remark that he doesn't want any more secrets between them. I still love the friendship between the women, I found them more natural in this one. And of course the story of the mother brings us back to the main theme of the trilogy, the veil, without forgetting to explore the conflicting feelings of the son... In short, a very good film for Hallmark, well acted, well directed, well written.",/review/rw8789848/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,grammajanie-28811,7," Not a 10.
","The Veil movies are very good, mainly due to the 3 leads. But I fail to see the ""10"" ratings given here. It's good but not wonderful. Some great moments - I love Lacey Chabert and she was stellar in this one. Her joy over the pregnancy was lovely. But overall the movie was okay/good, not excellent. Kevin Mc's accent should just be put to rest. He's very engaging and just doesn't need that bit of ""authenticity"" to carry his role - we'd never miss it. Many New Englanders don't have one.",/review/rw8789848/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2023,cdnreviewer,5," Didn't meet expectations
","I loved the original Wedding Veil trilogy and in particular Lacey Chabert's movie last year, so my expectations for this first film were high. Unfortunately, I was disappointment by the first entry in this year's trilogy.",/review/rw8789848/?ref_=tt_urv
