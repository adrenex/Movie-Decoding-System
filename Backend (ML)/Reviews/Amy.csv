29 June 2010,planktonrules,10," Perhaps the funniest show I have ever seen...I do wish they'd make more
","I can understand why Rowan Atkinson doesn't make more Bean TV shows--he's probably rich as can be (based on his car collection) and the movies (which are far inferior) make a ton of money. I still wish they'd make more of these delightful shows, as they are possibly the funniest show ever made--it's THAT good.",/review/rw2102871/?ref_=tt_urv

12 June 2005,lee_eisenberg,," Thank God for English TV shows
","""Mr. Bean"" is one of those shows that you couldn't forget even if you tried (not that you'd want to try). The title character (Rowan Atkinson) is a perfectly ordinary man who either never seems to do anything right, or always finds the hardest and most inefficient way to do it. Rarely speaking, he gets himself into all sorts of wacky situations.",/review/rw2102871/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2008,Beta_Gallinger,9," An excellent comedy series, filled with visual gags that can make you laugh over and over again!
","""Mr. Bean"", starring the legendary Rowan Atkinson, was a huge hit during its run in the 1990s, and I probably first saw it when I was around ten, shortly after it ended, so I was seeing reruns. I certainly wasn't much of a fan at the time, and didn't see too many episodes. I didn't really get into the show until my late teens, just a few years ago, which was when I finally watched every episode. Unlike before, it made me laugh many times, and since then, that has always been the case during repeat viewings of episodes! ",/review/rw2102871/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2002,Big Movie Fan,," CANNOT STOP LAUGHING WHEN WATCHING THIS SERIES
",Mr. Bean is funny purely and simply because he is a total buffoon. There's not much dialogue in this film but it's enjoyable to watch Bean's facial expressions and the situations he ends up in.,/review/rw2102871/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10," A complete delight, never ceases to be hilarious and original
","Okay, Mr Bean mayn't be the most sophisticated comedy series ever, and it sure is one of the funniest. I do agree there may be the occasional gag that doesn't quite work, but an overwhelming majority of them work brilliantly. Mr Bean does have minimal dialogue so a lot of the humour comes from the visual gags and slapstick. That is not a bad thing whatsoever, because it actually works wonders.",/review/rw2102871/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2005,film-critic,," Ecce homo que est faba.
","What exciting television adventure to England wouldn't be the same without a quick glimpse of the hysterical Mr. Bean? Superbly played by comedian Rowan Atkinson, Mr. Bean takes us into the doldrums of day to day life to show us that even the smallest gesture can be the funniest. He whirlwinds us through England in the most unconventional way, either in his sporty yellow car (with lock), or in his dentist office, or his doctor's office, or around the countryside stopping at several childish playgrounds. No matter where he takes you, the laughs are sure to follow and remain with you for a very long time.",/review/rw2102871/?ref_=tt_urv

5 August 2005,British_Revolver,," Genius!
","""Mr. Bean"" is one of the funniest shows ever created. American shows need to be more like the British ones. Rowan Atkinson is a very creative actor and this is the role that he was made to do. Whenever I see a car similar to his' now, I'll just remember it as the best supporting object that's never won an Emmy (sadly). ",/review/rw2102871/?ref_=tt_urv

29 February 2004,janqb,," Mr. Bean Takes You Away
","Many reviewers here compare the Mr. Bean TV series to ""The Simpsons"", ""King of the Hill"", and other comedy shows. Though many shows at times employ slapstick, ""Mr. Bean"" is very different from the majority of these shows and their characters. The most glaring contrast is between what constitutes as humor in ""The Simpsons"" and ""Mr. Bean"". ""The Simpsons"" can sometime present gory themes in an offhanded way (eg, Itchy & Scratchy), making ethically questionable images and situations funny to the audience. The humor in part lies in the blase way in which the characters treat something like murder, torture, etc. However, I don't find that very enjoyable. That is why I applaud Rowan Atkinson for proving that slapstick humor can still be funny without turning murder and torture into light-hearted entertainment. Mr. Bean maintains an innocence that, for me, is a welcomed relief from the harshness of the TV landscape in general. From reality TV shows where participants backstab each other for money to shows like ""South Park"" and ""The Simpsons"" that fuel their comedy with questionable material, TV land can be a harsh place thesedays.",/review/rw2102871/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2009,Gunn,10," One of the Funniest Characters of the 20th Century!
","Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean ranks right up there with Laurel & Hardy, Buster Keaton, the Marx Brothers and other comedy greats. I have never seen people laugh out loud so heartily and literally fall out of their chairs as when I introduced them to Mr. Bean via my videos and now DVDs. I'll never forget the first time my brother saw him. He was over for a visit and I asked him if he'd ever seen Mr. Bean? ""Who?"" he said. So I got out my video and showed him the one where Mr. Bean is in church and starts to nod off. My brother laughed so hard he fell out of the chair and was holding his stomach from laughing so hard. He became an instant fan of Mr. Bean. We all know how hilarious these episodes are, but the fun is in sharing them with others. I have seen so many people laugh 'til it hurts! Favorite episodes are: the visit of the Queen, the Hotel room stay, late for the Dentist appointment, the Christmas episode (a classic...plus kids love it!) and the New Year Party. Rowan Atkinson is a comic genius!",/review/rw2102871/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2001,Jdc102,," A truly Hilarious Series
","This show is a classic. Rowan Atkinson is so funny in this role, and Mr. Bean is one funny character. This is one show that you can see again and again and still laugh. I only wish they made more of these because they are great.",/review/rw2102871/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2020,MR-ODIN,," A classic, funny series.
","Among the few of the classics that lives up to the hype, it may even exceed it, for eventually we all know such a person and don't wish to know more about him or her. 9 June 2019 Mr. Bean Atkinson, as confessed, has been preparing for this role since the very beginning. What started as a time-filling sketch, it is quite an elevation considering what this character; more than the series, has achieved. Rowan Atkinson, the actor and more or less the creator of this global phenomenon, has previously worked in similar arenas in stages, miming, what basically could be considered as a stand up, his appearances have always been about the performance more than the content. And with a physical language that bars no boundaries, this global outreach actually comes with a never-ending clause. Primarily, to Atkinson. Since he could always claim his throne and the blames could easily be passed upon. But filtering or criticizing themselves, the creators have only shot definite amount of these sketchy scenes, in order to maintain the quality. And so pure the material is, that even after decades later, it hasn't gotten rusty yet. And it presumably never will. Since none of these scenarios seem effortful or tedious to the audience, the depicted gags are actually a part of a common man's routine in his day-to-day life. And looking at those activities with an eye of an anarchistic 9 year old boy, Atkinson has managed to embed his name among pioneers like Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. But even something sensational as such, comes with few flaws. Lopping off the editing and execution of this series, the shift of these chapters into one typical sitcom can easily be seen. Running out of ideas and occasionally compromising to the commercial aspect of the fame (Christmas episode), the series loses the subtlety for a brief period. When the neck starts going towards the noose rather than the other way around, that is when Mr. Bean grows simpleton, in a sense that it relies upon nothing but the performer and its inspiringly absurd performance.",/review/rw2102871/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2008,sashank_kini-1,10," I love beans!
","Mr. Bean has always been my favorite. No matte how many times you watch the same thing, the show never gets monotonous or repetitive. Mr. Bean is one of the greatest comedians in the world who doesn't need to even speak to make people laugh. His gestures, his facial expressions and his face itself is so funny to watch. The situations which he faces on the show is simply hilarious and the way he handles them is even greater. There is simply no reason why this show shouldn't receive a 10 because it is fabulous. Its something that would even make the most serious or sad person in the universe laugh. Some of my all time favorites episodes from the show are: 1) When Mr. Bean lodges at a hotel 2) The one where he watches the scary film 3) Mind the baby ( The diaper scene especially). In fact, all the episodes are so good that it is really difficult to criticize the show. Mr.Bean can go to any heights to prove that he is funny, including completely stripping himself in one of the episodes. the way he handled that situation was simply mind blowing. 10 out of 10.",/review/rw2102871/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2008,Sylviastel,9," Almost Brilliant Comedy!
",Rowan Atkinson delivers an unforgettable performance as the clueless Mr. Bean who never goes far without his Teddy Bear. The appeal of Mr. Bean is largely his childish behavior and innocence. We don't know if he came from the sky or another planet. He is the kind of strange character that you can't make up quite easily. He is often alone and used to it. He has a hard time communicating through speech which might be why we only hear his grunts at times. There are other characters who speak to him and he responds. The character of Mr. Bean is a mystery and still is. He lives alone and does the unthinkable when he can do the sensible thing. Mr. Bean is rather an odd man out who does not mind it much. He rather live a simple life with his yellow car and teddy bear and hopes to get to work on time.,/review/rw2102871/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2007,Tamphex,10," I honestly can't remember...
","...the last time I laughed this much. It's a testament to the talent of Rowan Atkinson that he has managed to create a comic character with several layers and a clearly defined personality - without hardly ever speaking a word. The whole success of the program rests on Atkinson's shoulders, but he carries it with ease. Despite the fact that the show only ran for one season, anyone even vaguely in touch with pop culture recognizes the rubber-faced social 'tard, so great is the talent and effort put into the performance. At times exasperating, at times lovable, Mr Bean is an innocent, unlucky chap who also happens to be evil incarnate. The brilliance of this character cannot be put into words, you have to see for yourself.",/review/rw2102871/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2007,general-melchett,10," Bean - one of the best comedy characters ever!
","Mr. Bean has shaped the face of British TV comedy. He has proved that you do not need wicked words or wit, a massive budget, a great deal of intelligence or even any intelligence to make something brilliant. And Mr. Bean is one of those characters who you just can't forget. Some of these episodes had me in stitches - yes, they're not realistic at all and they're all pretty stupid, but to be honest, realism is one of the barriers Bean has broken on its way to greatness. Rowan Atkinson and co. always manage to cook up interesting new ideas - and hilarious new gags - remember when Mr. Bean drove his green Mini whilst sitting on a sofa on the roof? Mr. Bean is one of those things that never gets weak - the movie wasn't as good as this, but Bean has introduced a distinct new sense of humour to the world, and kids and adults alike will marvel at its immense fun factor. ""Extras"" and ""Little Britain"" can be damned - this is British comedy at its best and most original. These escapades never get old! 10/10",/review/rw2102871/?ref_=tt_urv

","When I was younger, and today, Mr. Bean is a work of genius. Three-time BAFTA nominated Rowan Atkinson stars as the almost silent (miming) human looking alien dropped onto Earth causing chaos and mischief wherever he goes. He has tried to do an exam, put his pants on in front of blind man (he didn't know he was blind), gone to church, tried to dive at a swimming pool, made lunch on a park bench, seen a scary movie, changed in his car, had a picnic with a fly intruding, spent Christmas with his girlfriend (Matilda Ziegler), looked after a baby in Portsmouth, been to Room 426 of The Queens Hotel in Portsmouth, won a pet contest with his Teddy, driven on top of his Mini on a new chair, and even met and knocked out the Queen. Guests included Rudolph Walker, Richard Briers, Angus Deayton, Nick Hancock from They Think It's All Over, Caroline Quentin, The Day Today's David Schneider, Richard Wilson, The Fast Show's Eryl Maynard and The Vicar of Dibley's Roger Lloyd-Pack. It was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Comedy (Programme or Series) and Best Light Entertainment Programme.
