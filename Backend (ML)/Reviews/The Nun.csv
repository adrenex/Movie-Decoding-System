18 June 2019,aidanratesmovies,7," Entertaining, but certainly has its issues
","Though the film may seem to be lacking the charm, creativity, and just plain depth of the originals (or at least the first and the third), Men in Black: International still proves to be a fun and entertaining ride, especially for fans of the franchise. It's clear Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson aren't nearly the match for Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, but their performances are certainly not terrible. They try their best with the material given and provide the screen with some wonderful chemistry fans of Thor will be pleased to see return. The film is needless to say, written poorly, and seems to struggle on where it wants to go and how it wants to get there. But even though the story is often a mess, the new atmosphere and call backs to the original films are wonderful and truly encapsulates us in this type of universe. Other standouts of the film include but are not limited to Emma Thompson and Liam Neeson, two actors that only a few years ago I would never have expected to be in a Men in Black film. Kumail Nanjiani's character does provide for some disappointment however, as he proves to be more of an annoyance than the comic relief type feel the script seems to be going for. All in all, the film has its issues, and plenty of them to spare, but makes up for it with its entertaining nature, lovely chemistry from its two main stars, and cool atmosphere. Though it wouldn't be the wisest decision for Sony to let us see these characters again in another film, it certainly wouldn't bug me to see them as a cameo somewhere in a possible Men in Black 4.
My Rating: 7.5/10",/review/rw5093687/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2019,kosmasp,7," The Men in Black franchise
","So two of the main Thor characters star in this and you can tell they have chemistry together. You should also be able to tell that this is a light affair. A movie that does not aim for excellence, but just is there to entertain you. Chris Hemsworth does, what Chris Hemsworth - well is known for. Being the funny and flirty guy who's good looking.",/review/rw5093687/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2019,Top_Dawg_Critic,7," Great directing and S/VFX but lousy cheesy writing
","On point directing by seasoned director F. Gary Gray, but novice writers Matt Holloway and Art Marcum showed their inexperience with lousy writing and a cheesy script that was borderline infantile. It didn't do the MIB name any justice. The performances were great, but it's a shame Tessa Thompson had her character written in so cheesy. Enjoyable, but could've been much better. It's a 7/10 from me.",/review/rw5093687/?ref_=tt_urv

","Men in Black is bolstered by its talented two leads and visuals, but ultimately it remains an occasionally underwhelming installment in the franchise. Still, there are enough entertaining action sequences and humor to satisfy general moviegoers. Fans of the MIB franchise must check this out, but preferably on a matinee.",/review/rw5093687/?ref_=tt_urv

21 July 2019,siderite,8," Entertaining, as expected
","What do you expect from a MiB movie? Weird aliens, ridiculous technology, funny comebacks, people getting hurled into stuff and then getting up like nothing ever happened and a pretty err...black and white situation where the heroes save the day. That's exactly what this is. Back in the day you got Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith on a father son vibe, now you get Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson on a sexual tension vibe and if any more movies will be made, you will probably see the same recipe of experienced but blaze agent and an enthusiastic young rookie, on a father and son sexual vibe, perhaps.",/review/rw5093687/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2019,deepakdst,8," Disappointing!!
",Though there are some funny scenes but they can't make it even interesting. The major disappointement was the story. The twists came with cusion. Even you can easily imagine that. Nothing special was there. Villians were too much weak.,/review/rw5093687/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2019,phd_travel,4," The story wasn't well written
","I couldn't follow what was going on in the story. Felt like gibberish after a while.
Chris Hemsworth doesn't have comedic timing and he rushes his dialog. Should speak slower and clearly. Can't make out what he says. Tessa and him don't have much chemistry.",/review/rw5093687/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2019,stevendbeard,7," Overall, A Good Reboot
","I saw ""Men in Black:International"", starring Chris Hemsworth-the Thor movies, Red Dawn_2012; Tessa Thompson-the Thor movies, the Creed movies; Emma Thompson-Johnny English Strikes Again, the Harry Potter movies and Liam Neeson-Ted 2, the Taken movies.
This is sort of a reboot-no Will Smith or Tommy Lee Jones, although they do make an appearance in a painting-of the M.I.B. franchise, which is based on a comic book. The first movie was in 1997, the second in 2002 and the third in 2012 so it's been about seven years since we've had an adventure of the agents that protect the world from alien menaces. Chris-Agent H-is the best agent in the organization and likes to work alone. Emma, a civilian, discovers their secret and decides she wants in on the action-she becomes Agent M. Emma-Agent O-is the head of the New York branch and sends Tessa to the London branch on a probationary trail basis, to see if she has what it takes to become a full fledged agent. Liam-Agent High T-is the head of the London office and he saddles Tessa with Chris, well, because he is their best agent, you know. They run into some alien twins-played by real life brothers and dancers of some repute, Laurent & Larry Bourgeois, aka, Les Twins. Chris & Tessa also have to deal with the fact that there just might be a mole in the M.I.B. that is trying to disrupt everything. I thought that Chris and Tessa worked well together and had good chemistry so overall, I think it is a good reboot.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for sci_fi action, language and some suggestive material and has a running time of 1 hour & 54 minutes.
I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",/review/rw5093687/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2020,Pat100,8," Good Fun!
","Comedy/thriller with nutty aliens. Good story. Great actors. Great fun.
A satisfying choice. I'd ignore the critics who seem fixated on earlier productions and just enjoy the fun.",/review/rw5093687/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2019,nogodnomasters,8," Queen's pawn takes King
","This appears to be a continuation of the series and not a reboot. Frank, the pug is in this one as what appears to be the lone returning player. As a child Molly (Tessa Thompson) had experience with the MIB and wasn't neutralized. She grew up seeking to join the MIB until she found them. Impressed with her efforts, Emma Thompson makes her an agent. As agent M she goes to London and work for agent High T (Liam Neeson) and with agent H (Chris Hemsworth). She chose him. She has that Harry Potter type reputation as being the only one ever to find MIB and they expect great things from her. And then they save the world.",/review/rw5093687/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2019,samyoung-82648,5," PC, bland and unpopular
","First off, this movie is politically correct (you've been warned). For example, there's a spiel about ""people in black"" (you mean like ""girl power"", or is that different?). There's plenty of the usual ""reverse sexism"" (but let's just call it sexism for what it is). Hemsworth seems big on these type of movies.
Ok, this is the second ""girl power"" movie from Sony (after their Ghostbusters that the mainstream media loved but nobody else did). This time around, not even the media like this movie, despite the movie being politically correct.
The real issue is that the movie is too focussed on trying to be the first MiB, but failing because its too politically correct and too focussed on sfx, so, the actors take second fiddle to social agendas and green screens.
Sadly, despite solid acting chops from Hemsworth, Neeson and Emma Thompson, their performances are mediocre and the leading actress (Tessa Thompson) just doesn't have the chops to carry a movie like this (she's no Will Smith).
Summary: Not suitable for my children to watch (due to inconsistent and heavy focus on sex politics). Not worth watching because of the mediocre performances all around.",/review/rw5093687/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2019,justin-fencsak,8," A movie that is just as good as the original trilogy
","Think of it as Men In Black: Generations as some of the original characters from the franchise help new recruits defend the earth from the scum of the universe. I saw this movie in Dolby Cinema in a cropped aspect ratio from the original matte ratio seen in the trailers despite having great audio and really liked the good pacing of the film, which is the longest in the franchise. Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson, fresh from appearing in Thor 3 and Endgame, are the new agents in town. Fun fact: all of the main young stars were born around 1983, including Rebecca Ferguson, who plays a nasty villian living in a guarded fortress island. Highly recommended if you were kinda dissapointed with the last one.",/review/rw5093687/?ref_=tt_urv

18 June 2019,abisio,9," The funniest of the MIB franchise
","I really do not understand some people opinions. All MIB movies were comedies and this one is no exception.
We do not have Tommy Lee Jones (by far the funniest thing in the series) neither Will Smith (too pedantic particularly in the last two installments) but we have the couple from THOR RAGNAROK both good comedians and bunch of additional British players that play along.
The first joke is obviously on the #MEETOO# movement and feminine inclusion.
Chris Hemsworth is the kind of great comedian that has no problem to let his partner shine. And Tessa Thomson really does it.
In terms of action there is a little less than the previous films but the comedy situations abound and some are really smart.
There are also some animated characters that complement the fun. The story itself is not too different but some ""sexy"" situations had been added making a sometimes more mature PG 13 movie. Do not be afraid; you can go with your kids .In brief; compared with every other blockbuster in theaters today; this one is the funniest and one of the best. If you want violent go to see John Wick chapter 3 but avoid all Disney related (or very soon related) franchises that look made by a computer.",/review/rw5093687/?ref_=tt_urv
