","Christopher Guest has quite the resume and reputation for his quirky, awkward satirical mockumentaries, but ""For Your Consideration"" simply doesn't measure up with the rest.",/review/rw3363601/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2006,EUyeshima,8," Skewering Oscar Buzz with Laughs and Surprising Vitriol on Guest's Non-Mockumentary Satire
","I look forward to Christopher Guest movies in the same way Ralphie did for his much beloved Red Ryder BB Gun in ""A Christmas Story"". Drenched with his deadpan wit, Guest's mockumentaries have been such well-targeted show business satires that it's hard to know when the script stops and the improvised reality begins. But that's a lot of the fun with his films, even though his newest is easily the most structured of the bunch. Along with constant co-writer and co-star Eugene Levy, Guest picks a target ripe with possibilities in this 2006 comedy, the Oscar-baiting season prior to the nominations, and surprisingly foregoes the direct interview format in favor of a more traditional narrative. I have to admit I miss some of this dynamic because the on-camera realism resulted in some of the funniest moments in the previous films.",/review/rw3363601/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2010,lor_,," Fans missed out on the central, mean-spirited ""in joke"" here
","Having just searched through 137 IMDb comments (whew!) of Guest's film I was quite surprised that nobody noticed the central in-joke at work here, one that spoiled an otherwise mildly amusing effort for me. I guess you have to be a film industry insider, or at least have a working knowledge of film history, to analyze these seemingly transparent recent movies, and everyone struck out.",/review/rw3363601/?ref_=tt_urv

26 August 2020,kosmasp,9," Consider it ... strongly
","What an amazing cast, not just the people from American Pie that made it over, but every little small role was cast excellent. Guest has a name and people in the business know him, I reckon most of the actors here knew him before the movie was made too. I may be a bit biased here or at least easily I am easily excited with the theme the movie has. Behind the scenes of movie/filmmaking. Since you have industry insiders you can guess they know what they wrote about. Even silly looking things like saying to someone they are the most important thing, just to take a phone call mid sentence and acting like the person you just declared a sort of love to, doesn't even exist. It may seem unbelievable, but I'm sure it is (or was) happening.",/review/rw3363601/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2008,film-critic,5," Wash, Rinse, Repeat doesn't always work...
","Guest seems to be pushing the envelope with Hollywood in this feature, but it isn't funny  it is random, chaotic, and emotional when it should not be. Being a fan of Guest's earlier work, I was initially excited about this outing, but upon viewing it just didn't gel together  emotionally or passionately like Guests other work. This seemed like Guest made a film to spoof the industry, but instead created a dismal look at how comedy can self destruct, even with your regulars trying to make us laugh.",/review/rw3363601/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2006,4goldners,9," Another Classic By Guest
","I'm surprised by the number of negative reviews here for what I thought was in many ways Christopher Guest's most developed movie yet. Granted, you either like his movies or not, but as someone who loved Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show and Mighty Wind equally, I was in no way disappointed by For Your Consideration.",/review/rw3363601/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2006,roland-104,7," Guest & Levy hit a snag: their penchant for delicious comedy seems diminished here. Time for a new comic formula?
","Sooner or later, it was bound to happen. In an impressive string of wonderful mockumentary farces over the past few years, guiding lights Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy, and their brilliant comedic acting ensemble, have joyfully savaged the self-important cultural ""worlds"" of small town amateur theater (""Waiting for Guffman""), dog shows (""Best in Show"") and folk music (""A Mighty Wind"").",/review/rw3363601/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2007,sbmill-1,7," a fantastic satire on acting and acting schools - the gurus and the disciples
","I'm also surprised by some of the negative commentary around 'For your Consideration'. The satire seemed to me to be to be quite precise - particularly in its analysis of the average actor's life - which is a lot more like ""For Your Consideration"" or Ricky Gervais's brilliant ""The Extras"" than anything you're likely to see on Entertainment Tonight that is for sure.",/review/rw3363601/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2007,lee_eisenberg,8," Christopher Guest does it again
","Following Christopher Guest's troika of mockumentaries ""Waiting for Guffman"", ""Best in Show"" and ""A Mighty Wind"", he had every reason to pad it with another. ""For Your Consideration"" pokes fun at Hollywood. The plot portrays the filming of ""Home for Purim"", about a Jewish family in the WWII-era South. Sure enough, once the cast members start hearing Oscar buzz - even before the movie has been completed - their already ubiquitous egos go into high gear.",/review/rw3363601/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2006,cultfilmfan,6," For Your Consideration
","For Your Consideration is a film within a film. The story focuses on a film crew making a drama called Home For Purim. After three of the main stars of the film find out that they could be nominated for Oscars for their performances in the film their worlds turn completely around and soon they are getting tons of media coverage and are preparing for the big day. The film is a satire of Hollywood and the entertainment industry. For Your Consideration is from director and co-writer Christopher Guest who has given us such great films as Waiting For Guffman, Best In Show, A Mighty Wind and he also co-wrote the cult classic This Is Spinal Tap. After being a fan of his works and all the films I just mentioned, I must admit that I was very disappointed with this movie. For one thing it never really made me laugh. There were one or two jokes that made me laugh a little, but for the most part I found the humour to be too flat and all of the jokes were not that funny or as witty as they should be. The film lacks the brilliant satire and a lot of the great improvising and dialog that usually make the Christopher Guest movies great. The acting was pretty good at times in this movie, but at other times I felt sometimes that the cast kind of overplayed their parts and got to the point where the characters didn't become believable anymore and at times even though they were overplayed they managed to become kind of boring. This film just did not work for me and for the whole I think most Guest fans will be disappointed by this film seeing as it lacks all the humour and wit of his earlier movies. This wasn't a terrible movie by any means, but it did not work for me and after awhile I just stopped caring about this film.",/review/rw3363601/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2006,mouschieinstein,," For Your Consideration - A Disappointment
","The thing most Christopher Guest movies have going for them is their humanity. I always could believe the universe the characters were operating in, and their realism (see the dog owners in Best in Show or the small town citizens of Waiting for Guffman). That humanity transcended the satire and made the movies both hysterical and moving. FYC completely lost the humanity that drives these films. Almost all of the characters were not believable. In this instance Guest's improvisational technique failed him as the actors were all over the top, playing too much to the satire. Only two actors seemed in touch with their characters - Parker Posey (who we really saw too little of to understand her) and the great Catherine O'Hara, who sold both the aging actor she was portraying and the Jewish mother in the film within the film.",/review/rw3363601/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2007,fedor8,," The pathetic movie world and its sad little inhabitants.
","Forget the fact that Guest's other mockumentaries have higher IMDb ratings: evidently, either many viewers simply aren't familiar with the typical behind-the-scenes goings on in Hollywood - or they don't want to believe that their celluloid heroes are a bunch of insecure nitwits. FYC is just as good as Guest's other movies.",/review/rw3363601/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2006,zainashirk,8," Just chill out and go have a good time
","I love this acting troupe. They are a well tuned machine. Though this movie is perhaps a little ""inside"" of the Hollywood Movie Industry, and the publicity machine on which it is driven, all of the regulars and the new faces invited into the fold give wonderful performances and play their parts with just the right amount of camp with their tongues in their cheeks. I mean after all. don't many of us WANT to know about the inside of the industry? The duo entertainment reporters ( Jane Lynch and Fred Willard) are hilarious and Catherine O'hara's performance is masterful. (do I hear Oscar Buzzzz?) But that is not to say any of the cast's performances were not noteworthy. My whole family had a great time. This is not meant to be a Great panoramic epic, this is good clean hilarity from some of our favorite actors.",/review/rw3363601/?ref_=tt_urv

26 September 2006,Gimme_Fiction,10," Guest's Best
","I truly enjoyed this film, as did most everyone else at the World Premier in Toronto. Firstly, I haven't seen Spinal Tap, but of all the rest of his films, this is my favorite. His decision to depart the mockumentary format worked wonders in his favor. He didn't change his format so dramatically that you're unaware you're watching a Guest movie, it still carries his stamp. What he's done with this format is find a way to shave off all the somewhat boring bits that his other movies had durring the middle. Every second of this film was completely entertaining and will have you on the floor with laughter. The way he pokes fun of the silliness surrounding the Academy Awards is hilarious.",/review/rw3363601/?ref_=tt_urv

8 April 2008,JoeytheBrit,," Really isn't funny enough
","After scoring a number of successes with his mockumentary style, Christopher Guest strays slightly from his trusted formula to relate a tale of a bunch of disillusioned mediocrities dreaming of better things as they ply their trade. The problem with this one though is that it's probably a little too close to home for comfort. While the film pokes fun at these people, it also pokes fun at their aspirations, as if it is laughing down at them and wants us to join in which leaves a bitter aftertaste that isn't particularly pleasant.",/review/rw3363601/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2007,gradyharp,2," An Acquired Taste
","Christopher Guest is a creative spirit who has been able to make some very funny films like 'Best In Show' where his technique of avoiding a script by giving his cast of actors an outline as matrix for a scene, letting them ad lib the idea a couple of times, then accepting the second or third take as the final product - pasting all the bits together in the edit. Sometimes it works: sometimes it flounders. Or to quote a famous advertisement 'Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't'.",/review/rw3363601/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Waiting for Guffman"" was a little bit of genius. ""Best in Show"" and ""Mighty Wind"" expanded on the same concept: focusing on a sub-culture of people who take their little world entirely too seriously. Unfortunately, ""For Your Consideration"" lacks the subtle satire of Guest's recent efforts.",/review/rw3363601/?ref_=tt_urv

21 April 2009,jonathan-577,6," missing a reel?!
","This movie has the usual Guest-company virtues: the deep sense of ensemble, the absurdism embedded in genuine nuanced characterization, the flighty unpredictability. But the usual complaint - that things don't quite feel satisfying or resolved when the lights come up - is almost fatal here. I got the distinct feeling that as Guest strove to shoehorn in all his pals and highlight all the good bits, he lost the main thread. At first there's just a bit of discomfort with the overplayed and hyperextended what's-the-internet oldster naivete, and a vague sense of not-quite-clicking about the film within a film; but then suddenly ""Home For Purim"" has morphed into ""Home For Thanksgiving"" and it's like we dropped a reel even though I'm watching on DVD. Half the characters completely disappear (including Guest's overly familiar effete director), we never get so much as a line of dialogue from Home For Thanksgiving, and Catherine O'Hara's actress undergoes a reversal that is allowed no transition whatsoever - in one scene she's Martha Graham, in the next she's Joan Van Ark. This is highly dispiriting; it's like someone gave up. I hope they find a way to keep working together that gives things a boost, because this misses the mark.",/review/rw3363601/?ref_=tt_urv

29 November 2015,Scarecrow-88,8," For Your Consideration
","Christopher Guest just does it time and time again. His comedy this go-around abandons the documentary-stylized ""interview the actors"" format that had defined the approach so often associated to Guest. The sound of Oscar starts to take over the production of a low-rent Jewish period melodrama, with a title that is hard to pronounce, consisting of a cast of wannabe Hollywood A-listers (Catherine O'Hara, Harry Shearer, Christopher Moynihan, Parker Posey, and Rachael Harris) who get it in their heads that some of them might be nominatedbut just how realistic are these expectations?",/review/rw3363601/?ref_=tt_urv
