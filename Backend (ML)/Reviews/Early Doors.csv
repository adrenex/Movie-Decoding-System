25 July 2002,minavagante,," Wow, it grows on you!
","BH is broadcast in Italy by a second-class network that airs every episode three times a day (at breakfast, lunch and in the night) to make the most of it, and which recently made news because of the high ratings of their ""Bonanza"" repeats (go figure!!).",/review/rw8646342/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2002,ashleywincer,," I miss the show a lot..
","I was born and raised in Melbourne.  Only recently have I moved to the US to get an education and find work.  One thing I have missed as a result of moving away is Blue Heelers.  I have heard rumours that it is playing on some US Cable companies, but I do not know which ones and where.  Anyway if anyone stumbles across the television show, just sit down, have a beer and relax while you watch it.  I think it is a little off the realistic track when it comes to police violence, corruption, etc.  But it does cover a lot of the boring mundane tasks that police often have to put up with, such as cold burgs, etc.  Or perhaps I just miss it because it is Australian??",/review/rw8646342/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2020,mhoward-78295,5," Unfortunate changes
","Pretty good police procedural until it went down the tubes after the bobbing of the police station and the killings.
After that it seemed the writing went down hill. All the characters started acting like idiots.",/review/rw8646342/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2000,DvdJervs,," One of the best series in Australia, but how much longer can it last?
","The fact that it was until recently the highest rating TV series in Australia (only brought down lately by 'Seachange' after a strong fight that lasted a couple of years) should speak volumes about the quality.  Based in the small town of Mt. Thomas the Heelers must constantly solve crimes and keep the peace whilst at the same time deal with each other in their small, cooped up police station.  The regular addition of new cast members has also helped keep the series fresh as well as add the interesting relationshiops that develop.",/review/rw8646342/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 1998,Pythius,," Well-crafted and intriguing
","Genuinely intriguing long-running series about a police station in a small country town. Consistently good writing and acting helped to make ""Blue Heelers"" one of the best and most-watched homegrown dramas on Australian television, arguably spawning other admirable programs such as ""water Rats"" and ""Murder Call"" (all three were and are made by Hal McElroy (spelling?) productions). ""Blue Heelers"" utilised the careers of well-established actors (John Woods and Martin Sachs) at the same time as providing a head start for less well-known but still talented actors (Grant Bowler, Lisa McCune, Tasma Walton etc.). Genuinely three dimensional character writing helped avoid the cliche saccharine nature too common to the genre, all of the characters can be seen to be realistic, they all have their faults and personal obstacles. Although it can be quite often seen to be a little unrealistic, why should a town as small as Mt. Thomas have so much crime and intrigue??, this is easily forgivable as the viewer gets immersed in the storyline. ""Blue Heelers"" utilises the continually evolving sub-plot to further distance itself from the routine one-case-an-episode formula. Will PJ and Maggie ever get together? What about Dash and her fight against breast cancer etc. The characters have also established themselves with the Australian public as a source of concern. The higher rating episodes have been those involving major life changes for the main characters, recently Maggie's struggle with her heroin addicted brother and Nick Schultz's departure from the show. I would argue, that, had the series not been so well-constructed, this phenomenon would not be in evidence.",/review/rw8646342/?ref_=tt_urv

27 August 2021,b_clerkin,8," Love this show, Want to slap Jo
","I've been binging on cop shows from all over the world and found this show after watching all of Water Rats, City Homicide, Rush, etc. This has the most episodes and I watch a season at time, enjoying the events in Mount Thomas, learning about Australia and growing fond of all the characters- except Jo.",/review/rw8646342/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2006,bradles_01,," Blue Heelers has run it's course
","Blue Heelers, is truly one of Australia's most successful television programs. However i feel that the current series is really de-grading to the previous series. What i mean is that it's is just not as good as it once was. I feel that now the show has been axed, it is just too over due. Blue Heelers has definitely run it's course and in my opinion should have ended with the death of Maggie Doyle (Lisa McCune). The reasons for this is because Magggie was Blue Heelers, she was indisputably the most successful cast memeber and really captured the audience and was the 'golden girl' in Mount Thomas. Her sudden death was devastating and should have resulted in the show being canceled.",/review/rw8646342/?ref_=tt_urv

30 August 2019,morn1960,2," I dont get it
","As I have only seen the last few seasons this is a review of what I have seen.
You have a police station with a homicidal leader who is a bully, a bad tempered cowboy, corruption at a big level, a misanderous detective who will never admit shes wrong.
Between jumping in and out of bed with one another, the staff dates other people and always wind up back together.
Really unlikable characters. I dont get the popularity",/review/rw8646342/?ref_=tt_urv

20 February 2022,collectorofsorts,," Seems Like a Good Watch!
",I found this online earlier this week and have only worked my way thru a few episodes so far. But I'm really enjoying it. I'm not sure what time period it's supposed to be set in. I understand that it ran from 1994-2006. But the vehicles seem a little older than that and it seems like women have a tough go of it there which kind of makes me wonder if it's supposed to be set a decade or two earlier in time.,/review/rw8646342/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2021,nbrice18,5," Changed my rating from 10 to 5 stars...
","...due to Season 11. We were able to watch the first 4 seasons on Prime via IMDB and then had to pick up at Season 11 on Tubi. I can't believe the change in the show. What was once an enjoyable hour with some drama mixed with a little comedy and romance has become a dark and depressing show with too many new characters, and a change in a few long time characters.",/review/rw8646342/?ref_=tt_urv

6 July 2019,chriskoczka-64473,8," Started off great and then got formulaic.
","Blue Heelers is for the most part a well written, well directed, and well acted crime drama. Of course in the later series it gets too formulaic: Add one part very likable crime drama, and dump a crap load of overly emotional and unprofessional behavior into the mix and the viewer if not Aussie, may feel they would be better off in a land where the police are more professional. When they add the character of Joss Peroni, they should have just chucked the series in. He's a liar, cheat, open to favors in the way of gambling tips and he will look the other way... If a partner risks their life to save an accident victim, don't worry, Joss will stand back, until it is time to take the credit. Lies to hi mother that he is so well off to spend thousands on her vacation from gambling money he doesn't even possess yet... So unprofessional that it make the whole station seem incompetent to keep him on. The series started off great and then got formulaic, and that was sad.",/review/rw8646342/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2023,kylecurry,8," Excellent show in the first season

3 September 2019,morn1960,2," The more I watch
","The more I cant understand why people would think these female characters are good. A man hating, evil detective, a silly young constable who constantly makes extremely bad decisions and judgments. Another constable who associates with drug dealers and makes the same bad decisions when shes old enough to know better.
The males aren't much better, egotistical, violent, judgmental and unintelligent.
My opinion keeps dropping the more I watch.",/review/rw8646342/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2012,docterryc,9," It reminds me of Heartbeat
","If you enjoyed the UK show, Heartbeat, you will probably enjoy Blue Heelers. The storyline is similar; a small police force in a small town. The senior office is a Seargeant. He doesn't have Blaketon's sharp edge, but he is believable and likable.",/review/rw8646342/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2006,TPearcey,," Blue Heelers
",I love the show Blue Heelers and it is a shame that it has to come to an end after so many years. Why does the series have to end it is such a good series. I like Constaple Jo the best so it was annoying when she had to dye. All the actors play their characters really well except Sarget Jacobs who was a bit comical for his part. Jossepi and Kelly are really good beguines with the series. Most of the plots for the episodes are really good and they capture my attention all the time which is another reason why I watch the series. The setting of Mt. St. Thomas is a really nice place for the shooting the show. It is a lovely place. The Title of Blue Heelers is a good one for the show and suites the show.,/review/rw8646342/?ref_=tt_urv

","Found this show on Prime. I was totally hooked from the start. Loved the chemistry of all the characters. The original cast worked great together. I loved Nick's snappy comments. The love between Magg's and PJ was beautiful. I wish they would have gotten together sooner. Jo got on my nerves thinking she always knew what was best. Tess was annoying but softened the longer she was there. Ben could never catch a break until just before he left. Hated Rusty!! Tom and Chris had a wonderful lifelong friendship and always had each others back. That was great to see. Was nice to see the coppers doing paperwork, etc and not just out catching crooks. Definitely worth the watching.",/review/rw8646342/?ref_=tt_urv
