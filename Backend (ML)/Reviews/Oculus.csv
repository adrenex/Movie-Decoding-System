17 January 2019,TheVictoriousV,9," Those who end up liking it will REALLY like it.
","Finally released in my neck of the woods, A24's Under the Silver Lake starts off 2019 with a bang; an ambitious, labyrinthine, and transporting treat for all human senses. Its colors exquisite, its music delightfully old-school, and its story wonderfully bizarre and original, I've a feeling I already have one of my entries on my 2019 list set.",/review/rw5849555/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2019,kosmasp,9," Diving
","Some may feel like the title is misleading. Then again, what title would fit this movie? I didn't really think too much on that, since I quite liked the movie. Now I can understand what people don't like about it (it seems without a point or goal, main character is not that likeable, some may feel sexist tendencies poking through).",/review/rw5849555/?ref_=tt_urv

","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. The DVD box doesn't give away much, ""A delirious fever dream about one man's search for the truth behind mysterious crimes, murders, and disappearances in his East L.A. neighborhood.""",/review/rw5849555/?ref_=tt_urv

5 December 2018,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,5," If Mulholland Drive were written by a 9th grader
","Let me preface this by saying I was very excited for this movie. I'm into mysteries, I'm into noir, I'm into giallo, I'm into people making things that are ambitious and unpredictable, I'm a sucker for Riley Keough, and I was a pretty big fan of IT FOLLOWS. But, I never could have imagined this...",/review/rw5849555/?ref_=tt_urv

15 October 2021,davidfitzhugh,8," The MuSiC is unbelievable...
","Absolutely incredible music and visuals. Every time it comes on cable I find myself watching through to the end, just to take in the aesthetics. The plot is pretty obscure, but the film is a feast for the eyes and ears.",/review/rw5849555/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2021,christopher-underwood,8," just enjoy the moments
","There is much here to enjoy in this likeable neo-noirish/dreamlike offering from David Robert Mitchell. It looks good throughout, has plenty of surprises, some surreal touches and generally a good feeling. At some point after halfway in begins to dawn on the viewer that it is going to be some achievement to resolve all the various and varied elements that have unfolded. Unfortunately (or just maybe fortunately) this does not seem the intention of Mitchell and even more bizarre and unresolved issues are brought up in the file stages. It is perhaps advisable then to not go into this expecting the 'detective' to solve the mystery of the missing girl or the dead dogs or the fantastic caves or the secret code, but to just enjoy the moments.",/review/rw5849555/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2019,nogodnomasters,8," Beware the dog killer
","Sam (Andrew Garfield) lives in Hollywood for no particular reason or purpose. He is obsessed with a local author who writes a conspiracy book, ""Under the Silver Lake."" He believes in vast conspiracies including a nude owl woman succubus who seduces and kills people at night. The secret map in the cereal box is the key.",/review/rw5849555/?ref_=tt_urv

","Quite a different experience, which is hard to say about films in recent years. Takes a while to get going but worth the wait",/review/rw5849555/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2019,Bertaut,3," Just like Mulholland Drive. Except really, really, really awful
","Under the Silver Lake is a pretentious, self-indulgent, convoluted, overlong mess. Positioning itself as equal parts neo-noir and genre subversion, it is essentially a cross between ",/review/rw5849555/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2020,IamROCKAS,9," Life is kind of pointless and you should pick and choose your battles appropriately
","The directing and overall style of the movie is like nothing I've ever seen before. The cinematography and the way the movie is incredibly stylized. Like I was watching the movie and whispering ""wow, this shot is cool"" in five-minute intervals if not more often. There are so many close-up face shots and long one-take shots, far shots that zoom-in on characters or give us a better look at the cityscape and the surrounding areas. It's all done in this 60's noir style that I kind I appreciated, even though I forgot that this was a modern neo-noir during the first quarter of the film, with a blend of surrealism and symbolism. Everything was shot and framed so perfectly to the point that every shot seemed like it had a hidden meaning behind it, an unknown purpose and at the same time, looked surreal, imaginative and raising a lot of questions about our sanity of understanding different views of certain media.",/review/rw5849555/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2020,UniqueParticle,10," Wonderful bizarre adventure
",I absolutely love the cinematography/style throughout! David Robert Mitchell makes such incredible and well written crafty films that tend to have a thought provoking substance to it. Even It Follows had stalkerish esq. so I appreciate the peculiar aspects in this. Under the Silver Lake reminds me a lot of They Live; so much brilliance I'll probably buy this when I get a chance!,/review/rw5849555/?ref_=tt_urv

24 July 2018,DawnOfCreation,7," Not perfect, but I really enjoyed this movie!
","I was kind of surprised by this movie experience. I just came back from sneak preview and the movie still lingers in my mind. I love Andrew Garfield, his performance was believable and I think he's one one of the best rising stars of Hollywood. I also loved his work in ""Breathe"", great movie, make sure you check it out.

25 July 2019,drownsoda90,8," A treat for film buffs and conspiracy connoisseurs, but that's about it
","I am a major fan of David Robert Mitchell's last film, ""It Follows,"" which struck a fine balance between reality and the uncanny that we rarely see in films anymore. This film is less concerned with the uncanny (though it is still present to some degree) and more concerned with the paranoid, using popular conspiracy theories as plot devices that propel the lead character, Sam-a thirtysomething burnout-through a series of encounters and occurrences as he tries to find a woman who has abruptly vanished from his apartment building.",/review/rw5849555/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2019,nooshie-33142,9," A weird dramedy that's strangely engaging!
","After the brilliant sleeper horror movie, ""It Follows"" - this quaint homage to neo noir is the director's next offering. Mitchell is an auteur with a distinctive style which comes across strongly in this movie. Garfield is very engaging as the rather unpleasant 30 something slacker, Sam. A bit of a waster who somehow gets embroiled in a weird and wonderful mystery after his sexy blonde neighbour disappears. The cast is large, the locations in LA are strange and dreamlike and it plays like a wacko dramedy with neo noir overtones. It's an homage to Hitchcock and Lynch and you can see the influence of these two greats in this movie but it's also a very original ramble through one man's particular obsession. It's a very long movie but doesn't feel like it. Garfield is in every scene and is brilliant. He plays world weary and scuzzy very well! Riley Keogh plays the femme fatale whose vanishing act gets Sam started on his quest, and she doesn't have to do much but look gorgeous. The rest of the large cast play their parts well, but its Garfield's movie. The plot is surreal and ridiculous and ends with as many questions as answers. The scene where Sam gets his hand stuck to a copy of a Spiderman comic book is hilarious and a nod to Garfield's role as the web slinger! Quite a few Easter eggs and in jokes if you look for them. This strange offering won't be everyone's cup of tea but I loved it!",/review/rw5849555/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2018,deloudelouvain,5," Didn't do it for me.
","Weird is an understatement to describe Under The Silver Lake. I don't have anything against weird if it is a good story but in this case it just goes a bit too far for me. I'm not saying Under The Silver Lake wasn't interesting to watch, as I continued watching it because I wanted to know what the hell was going on, but in the end it's just too weird and most of the time it just didn't make any sense at all. The cinematography and the acting were okay though, so nothing bad to say about that. It's just that these kind of unlogical stories don't do it for me. Maybe for others it will but I have serious doubts there will be alot of amateurs for this kind of movie.",/review/rw5849555/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2018,aliases-53334,1," Can I have my time and money back?
","This is one of the most pretentious, pointless, boring movies in recent years. I am sure some people will rave about it but let me tell you from the avarage movie lover person, this was a two and half hours torture. It tells the story of an unlikable guy who is very annoying and somewhat violent, obsessed with his neighbor to the point that she disappears and he is obssessed with finding her. All the while there are strange dreams, cult story, subliminal messages in songs and boring, not even innovative, conspiracies. Yawn. The ending too will not save this hot mess of a script, since no reaolution will be delieved. The only good thing about this film was the filmographie, beautiful and masterfully shot. Sadly, not remotely enough to provide redemption.",/review/rw5849555/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2019,tequila3434,7," Interesting, requires several viewings to really get it.
","This movie was actually pretty interesting and kept me engrossed from the beginning. However there was a lot of stuff that wasn't explained and was left up for interpretation. Just gave me an uneasy feeling the whole time, but I think that was the point. I'd imagine that you'd need multiple viewings to ""get"" it, which I have not done yet. If you like creepy, weird, nutty thrillers then this is for you.",/review/rw5849555/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2018,alberto-928-249754,10," Brilliant film, but many people are not going to like it. I'll tell you why.
","I saw this movie by accident. Literally. I was in Madrid and I had two hours to kill (the movie premiered in Spain before it did in the US so I knew nothing about it). It could be one of the happiest accidents I've had in a long time.
As the elements of the plot grew thicker and weirder, I kept asking myself -how the hell is the writer going to make sense of all this information? Shockingly, he does. I walked out of the film feeling exhilarated. As a screenwriter I thought it had some issues but it wasn't until I woke up the next morning that I finally understood how everything fell into place.
This is a movie about a young and handsome Hollywood wannabe on the verge of eviction, who embarks on a mysterious adventure to discover the fate of young and beautiful women who -just like him- dream big, but can't afford to live in Hollywood.
The film is filled with smart references to Hitchcock, de Palma and other masters of suspense, The music is amazing. The surreal mystery of the story is grounded in the real drama of young and beautiful people who soon realize that there's no gold pot waiting for them in Hollywood-and they can't even afford living in San Jose.
Thinking back about the film, the lines I found most memorable have nothing to do with the mystery, but with the real drama of the main character who is losing everything -his job, his home, his car, his status, his youth-, all buried in this weird magical adventure where almost every string -maybe all- are nicely tied at the end. The ending is beautiful and tragic: the main character ends up buried in the same place where the object of his desire is. That is the only possible happy ending for him-and for her.
I see many negative reviews here, but unfortunately they all seem to come from people who expect films to be purely entertaining, movie fans who are unfamiliar with the brilliant movie references the film presents. Can you call yourself a ""movie fan"" if you've never seen ""Rear Window"", really?
""Under the Silver Lake"" ends up been an indictment of the entertainment industry and its mesmerizing and devastating effect. If you look carefully, the real danger is not the mystery killer- is your own landlord.
This is not only a great movie, it's an important movie.",/review/rw5849555/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2018,jadavix,7," Very good but too long
","""Under the Silver Lake"" is a superbly strange, interesting, clever, witty kind of slacker suspense story which is undercut by the New Millennium Curse (NMC).",/review/rw5849555/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2018,Jamie_Seaton,10," I Loved It!

23 June 2020,banelekunene-77917,7," A Bold Garfield Performance
","This movie is in a few words: strange, intriguing, dull, intimate, and dare I say addictive. The plot is seems pretty simple enough yet as you watch you can get lost at the movies direction- it's at times realistic and other times feels like the next scene will have something outer worldly happen. Regardless the protagonist (Andrew Garfield) whose almost a viewer himself just along for the ride except in real time is one of the movies real gems. It is definitely not for everyone rather it's not for most I believe , as some may really find it boring and/or stupid however if you're looking for something different and that will get your conspiracy senses tingling definitely one to watch.",/review/rw5849555/?ref_=tt_urv
