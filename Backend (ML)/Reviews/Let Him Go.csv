13 January 2023,DiCaprioFan13,9," Solid Sci-fi Series
","I'm blown away by how much I enjoyed Sense8! It's fantastic! You can tell it was an expensive show to make by the production. It was so expensive that they had to end it a season earlier than they wanted to but the fans were so loud about wanted an appropriate ending that they made a movie to close the story out. It's about a group of people from around the world that are all of a sudden linked mentally and have to come together to get away from people that are hunting them because they think they're too powerful and a threat to the world. If you're a fan of sci-fi then give this a try, you will not be disappointed! I do have to warm you that once you start watching it you won't want to stop so give yourself some time to binge it.",/review/rw3606278/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2022,Supermanfan-13,8," Entertaining Sci-fi Series!
",Sense8 is one of those shows where you truly start to care about all the characters and what happens to them. That's because they actually take the time to develop all of these characters and build this world very carefully. They had to end the series because it started to become ridiculously expensive and I get it. At least there were enough fans that they didn't leave it with a cliffhanger and gave us a movie to end the story! It really is a good sci-fi series!,/review/rw3606278/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2022,Nostrama,9," a step away from greatness
","Loved the show, you really got to see into the different characters and their backgrounds and how they came together to unite and use their differences as skills to help each other overcome both their personal battles handling real life themed issues, and against the main villains who were out to get them all, this is the kind of message people at large need to hear",/review/rw3606278/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2015,electrobird,10," Gorgeous! Best Series of 2015!
","Netflix does it again. After House of Cards, Orange is the New Black and Daredevil, they now release one of the best series ever. Well directed and written, gorgeously shot and editedÂ… From the opening sequence, you know you are watching something very special. Sense8 has the human element that Matrix lacked. It reminds me of The X-Files, but better. It is fantasy and science fiction, but not far-fetched. Not even for a single moment. It feels alive, real and very, very exciting and suspenseful.",/review/rw3606278/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2022,IslandMyst,8," Great Premise - Some Inconsistencies - Sexually Explicit
",The series and premise itself is original and refeshing. The scenery is beautiful and it's shot in many different locations. I think it's a shame that it became too expensive to keep the series going.,/review/rw3606278/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2018,TheDonaldofDoom,3," Strives for profundity but ends up saying nothing
","Sense8 is maddening. So many times it shows glimmers of greatness, hints that the pace might speed up a little bit, then it continues with same bland soppy mediocrity. The Wachowskis are the best at glitzy action scenes and mind-blowing sci-fi concepts. Looking at this mess, it's clear that's what they should have stuck to, because characters and dialogue are blatantly not their strong point.",/review/rw3606278/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2022,djak-43049,10," Love it, love it, love it.
","I watched part of the first season but got distracted. I recently revisited and plowed through both seasons with absolute absorption. I want, no *need* more.",/review/rw3606278/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2015,maliapac,10," Great series, but it requires patience and understanding.
",It isn't 9 but I will give it one just in spite of all the haters. I just watched four episodes of the show and it isn't bad at all. Just the contrary. It is one of the best SF shows in the last few years. I will try to explain why. ,/review/rw3606278/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2015,Perse_phone,9," Intriguing, well-done new Sci-fi drama. Loving it.
","I very rarely write reviews here on IMDb, but after reading some of the other reviews of this amazingly diverse, colourful and new show I actually feel the need to do so.",/review/rw3606278/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2015,tronba,9," Interesting series
",This series is riveting. watched the first six episodes back to back.,/review/rw3606278/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2018,grantss,2," Slow and unengaging
","Eight people live across the world, have never met and don't even know of one another's existence. Yet they start to sense each other, even becoming each other at times, and channel their individual skills.",/review/rw3606278/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2015,csharpforevermore,9," An incredibly original idea with some seriously thrilling stories
",There are few people who can make good and bad films quite as polar opposite as the Wachowski's. They made the Matrix but almost destroyed their genius reputation with the follow-up films. Now they produce a series Sens8 which I must admit crept up on me. I don't like watching or reading previews because the wait kills me when I see something I really like. Such a film is Sens8. ,/review/rw3606278/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2015,sarahferraro,10," Even better than I hoped it would be
","I had very, very high expectations for this show. I've never been so anxious for a new show to come out. From start to finish and at every point along the way this show more than met those expectations, it blew them away. The transitions from one person to the next, one scene to the next were exquisitely done every time. The way each sensate connected with the others, what they were able to help each other with emotionally and physically was masterfully done. Nothing felt inevitable, at each point there felt like there was genuine risk to each of them. I love this show. I literally stayed up from midnight until noon watching each episode one after the other. And tonight, when I get home from shopping, I'm gonna do it again but with friends. This satisfied me on so many levels. Genre, plot, gender, race, sexuality. I care so much for each of the eight and I love how they all complement each other. They are amazing. This show is amazing. The editing, the directing, the writing, the acting, the chemistry between the eight....just perfect. I can't wait to watch it again and again and again.",/review/rw3606278/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2020,jgrapejiang,8," Revised Thoughts - Not a 10
","When I first watched the show, I rated it a 10. I found it unique, beautifully filmed, and so...human. You witness all these different people learning about each other and aiding in each other's struggles using their individual strengths. The sense of empathy amidst the topical struggles they faced was inspiring. Even into Season 2, which took a long time to come out, I deeply cared about these characters.",/review/rw3606278/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2016,kythia,4," Interesting concept ruined by forced-in sex scenes
",This show is a roller-coaster for its audience.,/review/rw3606278/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2022,marcnealer,10," Best EVER, but for the open minded only
",Quick note. If your looking for a mindless sci-fi then this is not it. There are many truths here you will not be able to handle.,/review/rw3606278/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2015,LouieInLove,4," Sense-Less
",Sometimes lack of accessibility (which comes from poor writing) makes me want to scrape my urethra out with a discarded rust-ridden hypodermic.,/review/rw3606278/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2021,the_real_smile,1," It's forbidden to give a fair warning about this movie
","This movie made me feel mislead, this is not a supernatural series but some sort of sex education series. Strapons are flying around, kissing, boring 'parades', yeah, that's about 90% of the series, the other 10% is the 8 persons who 'feel' each other. I was hoping to see a good action packed supernatural/heroes series, but this series is far from that.",/review/rw3606278/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2020,flopezgraziano,1," Pretencious
","Sense8 is one of the most pretentious series I've ever seen. It's full of insipid protagonists who come straight from a low quality airline magazine. If you're 12 years old with low brain activity, you might like it, but seriously, people, it's not even for a hangover Sunday. The only thing that is minimally funny is that the producers make fun of a Latin soap opera that one of the main characters is doing, in which he is an actor. The irony is very evident, the quality of the actors in that telenovela is better than the slop that is the series itself.",/review/rw3606278/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2018,jtkirk161,10," Awesomely fun
",I am a straight white male and I just loved this show. Open your mind and enjoy the ride.,/review/rw3606278/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2022,igudduhanspal,8," Good show but as an Indian I am disappointed.
",I am currently watching episode 5 I must tell the makers who the hell designs Indian costumes they are horrible. You show such a rich family but their costumes are pathetically cheap and out dated. The dress bride wore during the groom's performance was so old fashioned like 15-2o years back. Netflix needs to hire better Indian designers who know what we actually wear it is not always so glittery and shimmery. The makeup is so bad kajal smudging in her eyes all the time. Even on the wedding day bride's look was so horrible.,/review/rw3606278/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2015,jeroen-106,4," Nonsense8
","A movie about people who can feel and visit each other doesn't have to be realistic, but it still requires an internal logic to make its impossible conceit work on its own terms. ",/review/rw3606278/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2015,carvalh_3,1," Stereotyped and pointless.
","You can tell they put tons of money into this, and technically it is very appealing. But I don't understand why it has a rating of 8,4!!!! I had to fast fwd the episodes just to get through some of it. Why would they show 8 different cities in the world and then not do any research about the cultures they are portraying? So you get Korean billionaires making jokes that only USA people would make. And the entire population of Mexico City speaking English the way Americans think immigrants at the border would. I guess that's too many corporate decisions influencing the directing of the show (everyone speaking English because little kid viewers won't have interest otherwise?).",/review/rw3606278/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2015,morcego,10," The Hill Street Blues of Science Fiction
","On an interview for Indiewire, J. Michael Straczynski mentions that while Startrek and BattleStar Galactica were to SciFi what Dragnet was to police shows, SciFi never had its Hill Street Blues, and that he hoped Sense8 would be it.",/review/rw3606278/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2016,TxMike,," Not the kind of TV series my wife and I enjoy watching.
","This of course is a Netflix original and it is widely advertised as ""brought to you by the team that brought you 'The Matrix.'"" What used to be the Wachowski Brothers is now the Wachowski Sisters, and as would be expected the series contains a heavy focus on the issues that are important to them.
