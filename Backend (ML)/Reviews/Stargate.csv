20 April 2016,Kirpianuscus,," beautiful
","sport. love. innocence. a simple story. and splendid images. one of films who are touching and spectacular for its profound simplicity. because nothing is new, nothing is great - except, maybe, the last scene- but the science to present the expressions of an age, the pieces of sport as frame of special friendship, the emotion and desire and shy reactions and courage, family crisis and fight to be the image of the others about you are the virtues of a film who real impress. the young lead actors, the stories around the boys, the scenes of joy, the beauty of age and the nature, all only parts of an ordinary expressions of youth are the ingredients who transforms in a kind of experience the film.",/review/rw3212848/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2020,rivertam26,8," A beautiful love story
",This coming of age drama is about a boy named Sieger who has a sexual awakening with an older member of his high school track team named Marc. At first there is confusion and some resentment but as the movie unfolds Sieger comes to terms with who he is and what he has with Marc. There's nothing really new here but it's a beautifully made coming of age love story. Unlike most films of it's kind it never really falls into despair. Clocking in at a little under 80 mins. The film is shot gorgeously and is emotionally engaging and poignant. A definite must see for people looking for a love story.,/review/rw3212848/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2015,somebody_else,10," Top 5 LGBT films for me.
","Despite my longstanding love for the genre, I did not expect to be so moved by this film. In the same vein as movies like Shelter, Just A Question Of Love, Beautiful Thing, Jongens is about a boys struggle with sexuality, family obligations, growing up. There are plenty of plot points that are similar, admittedly, but Jongens had something the others didn't. Or perhaps it steered clear of things the others didn't.",/review/rw3212848/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2014,boyshyshy,8," A very nice and touching film!
","I totally agree with the other reviewer. This is really a beautiful and wonderful film. Like what he/she has said, the cinematography and music are good, and the key point about "" Loving someone and not being able to show it, ....................., driving you to do things that disgust and hurt you inside."" is the most significant message of this movie that need to be told to the whole world no matter we are gay or not gay.",/review/rw3212848/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2014,itsvivek4u,," You must watch this
",Gosh! Its been a while since I saw a really well made good gay film that so well balances the core theme (in this case sports) and the emotional ones. I wasn't sure what to really expect but am I glad or what to have seen this beautiful film. Specially worth mentioning is the fact that the director of the film is a female and making a film on a Dutch teenager who is trudging with his sexuality while balancing his dreams as an athlete and be there for his family.,/review/rw3212848/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2014,sandover,10," Simply luminous
","I am in a state of rapt thankfulness, if I may say so, after having just watched this film: it was tone-perfect! For once, and a first, we can enjoy a film which is also an advance in gay representation: not a touch of rancorous self-blame, or an undercurrent of political agendas, over-dramatic kitchen sink weights, silly gayness or tragic turn of events. Not since the danish film ""You are not alone"" do we have such a unapologetic stance, or since ""A natural thing"" a sense of the possibility of paradise.",/review/rw3212848/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2014,silveradofurman,10," Brilliant Dutch movie on teenage gay love
","Theme: ""Jongens"" is a coming of age drama. It's about accepting one's own homosexuality, and the struggle that comes along. The love story is pure and natural, set to the background of an all male sports team for teenagers.",/review/rw3212848/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2017,henridelger,10," A healing movie, must see
","Healing? Yes, if a situation develops that will make you think about yourself, because this film is all about L-O-V-E. Two males together? Watch such a movie? Hated the thought. Until I watched THIS film.",/review/rw3212848/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2014,derrickluciano,10," Beautiful Love Story Between Young Runners
","The story focused mainly on Sieger's internal struggles of being gay as he gets attracted to one of his teammates, the more open-minded Marc. His fear is shown when he tries to have a girlfriend and be like one of his straight peers. The movie was able to capture the special friendship between the two boys quite naturally. Love that backward run smiles of Marc at the start. The scenes where the two boys exchange glances, kiss, train and play together are easy to understand by anyone who has experienced young love. No graphic sex scenes are shown in the film so even teenagers can safely watch it. The film also shows Sieg's relationship with his dad, his best friend Stef and his brother Ed.",/review/rw3212848/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2014,jimmy-pahn95,10," Excellent Movie
","This is a great movie. I watched it in dutch, with dutch subtitles and my native language is Spanish and I didn't even need to understand them because their performances were so good that it wasn't necessary. This is the kind of gay themed movie I was looking for all this time. It's not explicit and shows the real feelings of the principal character. It shows the love and the pain he suffers. It's like the last users said: it's the kind of movie that everyone can see. This movie can change the mentality of a lot of people. It's great and I'm happy that IMDb gave it such a good qualification, because almost an 8 is very difficult in this web site.",/review/rw3212848/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2015,Irishchatter,8," A cute little movie!
","Seriously I think the guy who did his character Sieg so well, he really knows how to play the shy guy really good!He even looks like the little boy in sixth sense. Very good actor, I hope I see him in more movies!",/review/rw3212848/?ref_=tt_urv

11 January 2021,robinhio84_,9," It's hard not to like this film ;-)
","This movie is sooo good, it's positive, and the acting is alright. Some great editing with close up shots mixed with a perfect pace makes this movie a pleasure to watch. Top that off with realistic characters and you have a nice flick!",/review/rw3212848/?ref_=tt_urv

9 March 2015,rjhouston,," Jongens (Boys) is a wonderfully innocent coming of age film.
","Boys is a 2014 Dutch (with English subtitles) made for TV film, starring Gijs Blom in the lead as Sieger and Ko Zandvllet as his love interest, Marc. It is set in the countryside and the cinematography is beautifully done. The storyline maybe tame by American standards but is solid and believable. Sieger is discovering his sexuality amidst dealing with the loss of his mother, over protective father and a rebellious older brother. Marc, confident and free spirited, is comfortable with his gayness and pursues a friendship with Sieger. The two are in training for the big upcoming track relay race. As the story unfolds we see the romance develop between the youths. This is a wholesome, romantic, first love story that will be enjoyed by most. Mischa Kamp's work succeeds without resorting to the typical and tired formula of sex and drugs. This is a great film, for teens and their parents to watch together.",/review/rw3212848/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2017,Coralknight,9," One of the Best
","On par with ""Beautiful Thing"", ""Boys"" is a sincere yet updated version of the age-old ""coming out"" story. The script is as sincere as it is direct, which makes the dialogue 100% believable. Whereas many films of this genre are predatory and exploitative, ""Boys"" is incredibly adept at telling the entire story without the need for anything graphic or obscene. The cinematography and pace are outstanding. The music is an absolute complement to the story, and nothing comes off as a vehicle to capitalize on a particular actor/artist/performer (as is so often the case). I would highly recommend this film to anyone seeking an honest look at the ""new"" generation that deals with family, school, friends, sports and above all, finding what one really wants in life.",/review/rw3212848/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2015,BeneCumb,7," Warmhearted film about ""forbidden"" feelings
","Although The Netherlands is regarded as a free and open country as for sexual orientation, it is seldom easy and ""natural"" to disclose your feeling, especially if you are minor and/or you might hurt the feelings of someone from the opposite sex... These and other related issues are delicately approached in Jongens, through friendship and affection developing via sports activities. True, the main characters - performed by Gijs Blom and Ko Zandvliet - are so elaborated and intense that the role and place of others remains perfunctory at times, plus the fact that profundity would diminish the pace and variety; this 1 hour 15 minutes film includes the limited number of localities, but, on the other hand, gives a pleasant overview of atypical Holland - of places where is lots of nature and little of people.",/review/rw3212848/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2015,meaninglessbark,7," Nice, But Not A Must See
","Boys is a well crafted, good looking film (full of good looking boys...Surprise!) that takes a realistic look at first love. ",/review/rw3212848/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2014,andrepessoa,9," Classical narrative about coming out
","What a cute movie, huh? Very well written script, great performances from all the actors, and extreme care with the production. There not seems made for TV. I found the director creative, especially in the use of the blur to highlight certain scenes. I also loved the way he inserts the incidental music in the film. The kissing scene (which has on the movie poster), where he films without showing the faces of the actors, is a very beautiful thing. On the other hand, it is also a very conventional way, and just why I do not give a 10 for the film. It's a film with classic narrative to the extreme, and that's exactly why appeals to almost everyone. The story is that classic about ""coming out"": a boy discovers different and fight against yourself, before you accept as is.",/review/rw3212848/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2017,brighton_dude,8," Beautifully filmed and enjoyable to watch
","This so well filmed, it is a delight to watch. This is very well acted coming out and a coming of age story. The drama is very well handled. This film has a very efficient script. Quite a lot is communicated in a simple manner.",/review/rw3212848/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2014,leftbanker,10," The surprise of love
","I agree with all the previous reviewers. This film is not spectacular or raw or groundbreaking, it is simply real and wonderful. In it's brief span it touches on the family dynamics of loss and love - two boys dealing in different ways with the death of their mother. A father trying to guide his sons while coping with his own loss. The surprise of first love and the devastating fear that forces you to deny it. The film is filled with magical but truthful moments, sometimes heartwarming, sometimes heartbreaking, sometimes both at once. A glance that goes straight to the heart. A gaze into the mirror (too true to ever be trite). A moment when a friend knows how to be a friend. ""Marc and you, you make a good team . . . really good."" The moment I lost it - at the end when the ""family"" is eating takeout on the patio and Sieg goes to the empty kitchen to make his peace and his decision. Bravo to an extraordinary cast, crew and filmmaker - and thanks.﻿",/review/rw3212848/?ref_=tt_urv

2 April 2015,lmull198,9," Magical Coming Out Film
","Hi Guys, please try and see ""Jongens"" / Boys, one of the best ""coming out"" films ever, please do not be put off by the subtitles! The direction, acting and music are superb, enjoy every minute and be happy.. The story is simple, but the two lead actors are amazing, cannot believe I have not seen them in previous films, they have such great futures ahead of them!!! What a relieve to see that it is not just another ""sub-par, sordid, waiting for the ever elusive sex scene to arrive"" movie This movie makes u forget all that nonsense, you are drawn in from the first second, and it never lets go, only complaint is the short running time, at 80 minutes only you will be crying for some more I can go on and on, but watching the scene 30 minutes into the film makes life worth living...",/review/rw3212848/?ref_=tt_urv
