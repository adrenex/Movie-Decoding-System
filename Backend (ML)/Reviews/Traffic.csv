17 October 2018,Top_Dawg_Critic,9," Much better than I was expecting - thus far (+EDITS)
","At first I thought ""no please, not another cop show"" and I wasn't sure about Nathan Fillion as a cop. But I must say, the directing is spot on, and the writing is refreshing - especially the relationships of the rookies and their T.O's, their relationship with each other, the conflicts they have to deal with, and the use/views of the body cams. Also surprisingly, Fillion is perfect for this part and nails his role, and all other actors were perfectly cast and also are great in their roles. I especially appreciate seeing the various parts of L.A. and the different people/conflicts the LAPD has to deal with - outside and within the force. So far so good, let's hope the writing progresses as good at the pilot was throughout the season. A well deserved 8/10 from me.",/review/rw7091515/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2022,kythia,4," S1 perfect, S2 okay, S3 uhm, S4 bye!
","I really liked this show at first. Huge Nathan Fillion fan since I first saw him on Buffy, and he never disappoints. His support cast is also mostly excellent, leading mid-40's LAPD recruit John Nolan through his personal crucible.",/review/rw7091515/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2022,jaubert-43688,6," Really liked the first three seasons...
","I stopped watching The Rookie after I finished season 3 and just decided to get to it again. From what I remember, the show was pretty serious... Especially in season 1, which was the most realistic and grounded season. Season 2 got a little out there but had more action. And season 3 tried to balance some stuff out. (This was when real-life issues bled in the show more, and they had to do a little social commentary. I honestly thought the show handled the topics well enough.)
I got back to watching The Rookie partly because I just watched the first two episodes of The Rookie: Feds and that was so campy-corny-bad. And what do you know, season 4 and 5 are exactly like The Rookie: Feds. The plotlines are so outlandish! It also started to have a whole lot more romance too, like wtf. It felt like an 80s soap opera. Actually, everything about The Rookie feels 80s, except for season 3, but still. Man, I guess it's still good to watch for some people? If you like crazy and GoT.",/review/rw7091515/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2023,DiCaprioFan13,8," Pretty Good
","The Rookie is one of the better cop shows on tv right now. Nathan Fillon leads a really good cast who all do a good job making this a show worth watching. Anyone who's seen Fillon in a show knows he never disappoints. This show does good job balancing drama, action, suspense and humor. It also shows how tough it is to be a police officer both at work and at home. Some of the negative reviews are from people that don't like that they take real world problems of today and apply them to the show. Everyone knows there are a thousand police shows to choose from but if you're looking for an exciting and original show then give The Rookie a try.",/review/rw7091515/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2022,Supermanfan-13,8," I actually enjoy it more than I expected!
","I have to say I've really enjoyed The Rookie even more than I though I would. I've been a Nathan Fillan fan since Castle and he really shines here. He stars as John Nolan, a 40-something year rookie for the LAPD. After a life altering incident he chooses to pursue his dream of becoming a police officer. As the oldest rookie he has to persuade skeptics that he's cut out for the job and that this isn't some mid life crisis. These are several supporting characters in this and they all bring a sense of entertainment to the show. It's a really easy show to sit back and watch and even have on as background viewing. It's one of the better cop shows of the last few years.",/review/rw7091515/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2021,mark-dawley,8," Season 3 is a mess
",This series started off strong but the writers of season 3 seems to want shove every PC issue into every episode. There's just too much baggage to make you care about any of it.,/review/rw7091515/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2021,jquartemont-242-751784,5," Mildly entertaing
",How did Nathan ever get involved with this series? Firefly and Castle were much better.,/review/rw7091515/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2018,jjpscott01,10," This should be a winner
",Just finished the first episode. I wasn't sure at first but about midway through I realized how much I was already enjoying these characters. Nathan Fillion is great in everything he does and the rest of the cast seems real strong so far. Im excited to see where this goes.,/review/rw7091515/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2021,dgktk,5," Season 3
","Just watched the second episode of season 3, and it feels weird that they have to make the girl say thanks to the man sitting in her car... And this episode keeps underemphasizing crimes... It made it sounded like people don't have to be responsible for their own behaviors...",/review/rw7091515/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2021,mrsazz,3," Season 3 is a big disappointment
","Loved season 1 and 2, but I find the writing of Season 3 to be very bad. The writers seem more interested in pandering towards certain political agendas than creating interesting storylines and good TV.",/review/rw7091515/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2022,ser813,," So far so good
","I'm in the middle of season 2 and planning to continue. Not a 10 because I keep it for my all time favorite, but a strong 9. I have no complaints about the show.",/review/rw7091515/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2021,joecnh,3," Nathan, Nathan, Nathan....I expected better from you...
","What was a decent (8 star) show went all PC and woke.
Such a shame. This will be it's last season.",/review/rw7091515/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2022,criscal,7," Great and fun cast, taking itself not too seriously, suffers from bad writing
","That is basically the gist of it. Like in any police series, way too many things happen in one episode and the rookies experience more shootings and heavy crime than most police in many life times.",/review/rw7091515/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2018,mwen001-2,8," Better then expected
","Good pilot! Well excecuted first episode. Feels sometimes like an episode of SOUTHLAND which is good thing. Good acting, good designed action and interesting characters.",/review/rw7091515/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2021,goodtime-336-74081,2," The Rookie jumps the Shark
","Two seasons of a pretty good cop show then came the Season 3 slide down hill until rock bottom episode 7 when they jumped the the Shark.
Absolute crap, especially when judged against the first two seasons.
The writers, directors, actors, in fact everyone associated with this episode should hang their heads in shame.
Do everyone a favour and pull the plug on this show NOW as there is no coming back from this crap.
I would rate the show a solid 7 for the first two seasons. I gave it a 2 here based on season 3 episode 7 as nobody reads 1 star reviews, or 9 and 10 for that matter.",/review/rw7091515/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2021,deanbean317,1," You could hear the gears turning!
","This series officially jumped the shark one season later than Heroes and I'm not at all surprised. I can almost hear the show runners, before the first episode was filmed, sitting at a long conference table saying ""We have to start strong...make the first couple seasons entertaining. Then, we get people invested in our characters, then...BOOM! We set the hook and start spoon-feeding them the agenda!"" Well, I'm spitting out the spoon AND the hook!",/review/rw7091515/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2021,sj-68579,3," I used to love this show - not anymore
",Rookie was one of my favourite shows. I loved how it was well written and light-hearted. It focussed on the characters within the series and how they developed and cops and how they handled the odd situations they came across.,/review/rw7091515/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2021,jesseglover-84848,2," I miss when shows were meant for entertainment
",I heard this would focus on BLM but all the guy in the second episode did was piss me off. Blaming cops for trying to help his community and not getting his own community together to stop drug dealers and vandals from ruining it.,/review/rw7091515/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2021,bingvarstand,3," Was good cop fun, wokeness incoming.
",Its been infected by BLM. Drags down the fun factor considerably. Hopefully they can turn this around or else its dead Jim.,/review/rw7091515/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2019,nugebb,9," Not a bad episode yet
","I'm amazed that, even in season 2, there still hasn't been an episode that I would consider below par. Every episode delivers stellar acting, a great story and a believable amount of thrill. I will admit that I tuned in for Nathan Fillion but I've become attached to all the characters and their story lines.",/review/rw7091515/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2021,ReapersGrunt,1," Started off great...,
","Season 1 and 2 were very enjoyable...then once again Hollywood tries to become ""woke"" and mixes in ""political"" agendas with dashes ""social justice"". As a result the show takes a huge dive and a complete waste of season 3. At what point will Hollywood realize if we the people wanted their ""Woke"" political views, we would turn on Entertainment Tonight or CNN...? Shame...",/review/rw7091515/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2021,chrsstout,1," Yeah, police!
",You ever have someone act more dramatic than a situation requires to try and emphasize their self-imposed seriousness?,/review/rw7091515/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2021,marcberger,4," Agenda TV......again.....boring !!!!
","I really liked the first two seasons but season three is only agenda tv. I'm a groven adult and i don't need, again and again political teachings in a tv show.",/review/rw7091515/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2021,gabecostello-06352,1," Just like This is Us, down the toilet. Wow. Such a massive PC race baiting downfall
","The show was a surprise. Good characters, well acted. Enjoyable. The fact that there were only two white characters, was in no way an issue. America is a land of immigrants. We are all mixed.",/review/rw7091515/?ref_=tt_urv
