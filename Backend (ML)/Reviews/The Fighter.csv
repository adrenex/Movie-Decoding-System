23 December 2010,Matt_Layden,8," The Fighter is a winner.
","The story of Micky ""Irish"" Ward and his boxing career with his crack addicted brother at his side. Apparently Marky Mark was so hell bent on getting this film made that he stayed in ""shape"" for years and years just in case the film went into production. That's dedication and passion for you, yet the man still manages to be the weak link. ",/review/rw2435697/?ref_=tt_urv

28 December 2010,littlemartinarocena,9," Wahlberg's Corner
","In many ways, ""The Fighter"" is the film of 2011. A family drama with a pugilistic background. The punches, physical and emotional in and out of the ring took me completely by surprise. What didn't surprise me was Mark Wahlberg's signature all over the place. Let me explain: Many years ago I was at a lecture by director Martin Donovan when during the Q&A somebody made fun of the fact that Calvin Klein underwear model Marky Mark had played a part (his first acting role) in Donovan's made for TV ""The Substitute"" Donovan with elegance, wit and firmness destroyed the guy asking the question, describing Wahlberg's strengths and ended up saying ""Mark Wahlberg will be one of the top actors around and he will probably be running Hollywood within a decade"" I had Donovan's words buzzing in my ears when I sat speechless watching ""Boogie Nights"". Wahlberg also produced ""Entourage"" and the startling ""In Treatment"". He now produced ""The Fighter"" and his performance, interior and powerful, dominates the film allowing other members of the cast, to shine in truly showy roles, Christian Bale for instance - really good. Melissa Leo is a stand out as the mother/manager. Superb. So I won't be surprised to see Mark Wahlberg receiving the top honors at the next Academy Awards, as an actor and producer. He certainly deserves it. Bravo!",/review/rw2435697/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2011,Red_Identity,," Great direction and performances make this an excellent film
",Do we have a lot of sport films where the underdog ends up winning and overcoming many obstacles along the way until the end? Definitely. Does The Fighter succeed? Very much so...,/review/rw2435697/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2010,Movie_Muse_Reviews,9," Excellent cast focuses boxing drama on family dynamics not usual themes
","When it comes to winning awards, boxing films seem to always be contenders; as such, the thought of watching ""another boxing film"" can be off-putting. But ""The Fighter"" hangs in and fends off those labels, earning every bit of its critical praise. That's because most of the fighting in this film takes place out of the ring; ""Irish"" Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) spars with the troublesome brother who trains him and his mother who manages him and these superb supporting characters have their own challengers to overcome.",/review/rw2435697/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2011,Chrysanthepop,," A Winner On Multiple Levels
","Does David O. Russell's 'The Fighter' follow the formula of underdog surpassing all obstacles and winning in the end (as is the case with this genre)? The answer is yes but 'The Fighter' still manages to maintain a unique quality. First of all, the four principle characters: Micky, Dicky, Charlene and Alice are unlike anyone one has seen in this kind of film.",/review/rw2435697/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2010,Monotreme02,8," Conventional script elevated by great direction and fantastic performances
","After Rocky, Raging Bull, Ali, Million Dollar Baby, Cinderella man, and many others, one begins to wonder how many more boxing movies we really need in the world, and what a new one can bring to the table. Indeed, watching The Fighter, one can't help but wonder what the film can do to renew the genre and bring something new to the table. Unfortunately, the answer is ""nothing much"". The script is a pretty conventional rags-to-riches story, whose most interesting element is the relationship between Micky Ward and his brother, Dickie Eklund. Luckily, Russell and company recognized that this was the strongest aspect of what is otherwise a good but ordinary and somewhat flawed script, with some problems with flat characterizations and unnatural-sounding dialogue. However, everyone involved in the film tries their best to transcend the script, and for the most part, they succeed.",/review/rw2435697/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2013,Theo Robertson,6," Well Acted Seen It All Before Boxing Bio-Pic
","When I worked in a kitchen one of my colleagues - Scott - was obsessed with films who seemed to spend every spare moment either in a cinema or at home with a pile of DVDs . I should point that he was someone who had no interest in anything art house . Everything Scott watched had to be either American , feature a big name or feature an action sequence so our tastes weren't very similar . Regardless of this one film Scott felt the need to rave about was THE FIGHTER . I'd seen the trailers and vaguely knew the story of Micky Ward and felt it was going to be clich√©d true story bio-pic with embellishment and a happy ending . In other words it was going to be a seen it all before sports movie .",/review/rw2435697/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2010,ferguson-6,8," The Pride of Lowell
","Greetings again from the darkness. Don't let the hype or the fear of just another ""boxing"" movie keep you from this one. Yes, it is based on the true story of ""Irish"" Micky Ward, a boxer from Lowell, Massachusetts, but this is every bit as much a story of family and commitment and tenacity as any story you know.",/review/rw2435697/?ref_=tt_urv

15 March 2018,CarpeDiem12,7," Supporting Roles stole the limelight
","This a great American family drama movie. Shows the ups and downs of a big crazy family with 2 boxers in the family. The big ''legend'' Bale and his young brother Wahlberg. This story is about how the younger brother who looks up to his crack addicted older ''legend' brother for guidance and advice, has to turn away from him and his toxic family to succeed in his boxing career.

17 December 2010,Derek237,10," Fighting in and out of the ring
","Wow, what a movie. It's an inspirational true story of a boxer finally getting his break. It's also a story of addiction, and how it can affect loved ones. And above all, it's about family. There are some great boxing scenes in THE FIGHTER, they feel authentic and brutal, but the true fight is really outside the ring. Which is not to say this is an overbearing melodrama, no, far from it. It handles the subject matter gracefully. It has a lot of heart and can be quite funny, and there are some humorously absurd moments, something director David O. Russell has proved to be very good at providing.",/review/rw2435697/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2011,sddavis63,4," The Story Of Mickey Ward
","As any movie of this type has to do, it finally draws you into the protagonist's situation and gets you rooting for him. In this case the protagonist is real-life boxer Mickey Ward (Mark Wahlberg) who has to overcome big odds - not the least of which is an extremely dysfunctional family headed up by his controlling mother Alice (Melissa Leo) and his drug addict brother Dicky (Christian Bale) who used to be a boxer and who's claim to fame was knocking down Sugar Ray Leonard (or did Sugar Ray slip?) and who now wants to live his dream through his brother. I appreciated the fact that Sugar Ray appeared as himself in a couple of brief scenes. By the time Mickey gets his title shot you are rooting for him, and you do admire his strength in overcoming the challenges he's faced. The actual title shot, mind you, struck me as a bit anti- climactic to be honest. It was pretty quickly portrayed and frankly the whole thing ultimately left me a bit empty, although I was satisfied to see Mickey become the champ.",/review/rw2435697/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2021,view_and_review,5," Bale Makes it Bearable
","""The Fighter,"" which is the Micky Ward (played by Mark Wahlberg) story, is about an underdog fighter from the poor town of Lowell, Massachusetts. He came from a toxic family which hindered him from realizing his fullest potential. When he finally broke free of the clutches of his mother Alice (Melissa Leo) and brother Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale) he was finally able to excel as a boxer.",/review/rw2435697/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2010,aharmas,8," Knockout Performances
","There has been a trend this year to show the darker side of nature in movies, both on TV and on the movie screens, and ""The Fighter"" continues to expose those festering qualities that prevent us from bonding with each other and might end up having some very toxic results. However, ""The Fighter"" shows an interesting point of view, as it balances the negative with some redemptive moments; some of which shine because of a very outstanding group of actors.",/review/rw2435697/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2015,SnoopyStyle,8," A couple of incredible performances
","A documentary crew is following Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale) and his half-brother Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg). Dicky is a crack-addicted shadow of himself still living off of his fight with Sugar Ray Leonard. Micky is a punching bag for better fighters on their way up. He's trained by Dicky and managed by their mother Alice Ward (Melissa Leo). Micky is taken by bartender Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams). When Micky's opponent drops out, he's paired with a fighter with 20 lbs on him. Micky is resistant but Alice and Dicky pushes him into the fight.",/review/rw2435697/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2010,MaralynSpeaking,10," Everyone involved in this film just made a fan of me
","Such a fully satisfying film is a rarity. A story of family, struggle, and love told with great humor, intelligence and heart. I've already seen it twice and am telling everyone I meet to be sure to catch it. I was blown away by Amy Adams' touching performance in JUNE BUG and by the raw beauty of Melissa Leo's work in FROZEN RIVER, but have been slow to distinguish among the crop of young male stars and directors who deserve to be household names. Christian BALE, MARK WAHLBERG, and David O. RUSSELL are names now branded in my consciousness. This season I've been stunned by the creative forces at work in films including SOCIAL NETWORK and JACK GOES BOATING, but for its overall achievement, this amazing film based on the true story of two boxers from Lowell, Massachusetts earns a championship. It is much more than just a fight film or a biopic though it certainly sweeps us into the drama of the boxing ring and quivers with the diamond gleam of truth. Bale's finely etched creation of Dicky and Wahlberg's extraordinary dual turn as producer and star in the role of Dicky's brother Micky should place both men front and center for Oscar nominations along with Russell who shaped the film with a keen sensitivity. Russel's team of artists including cinematographer, costume and sound design were all spot on in their respective contributions. Tho Leo and her gaggle of daughters struck me at first as verging on caricature, I quickly saw that they perfectly captured the family culture while providing a delicious comic motif.",/review/rw2435697/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2017,jcaesar-01251,7," The Fighter driven only by flawless performances.
","Look, i like the film, I think it's awesome but I also think were the characters were played by less effective actors, this wouldn't be as awesome as it is. The biggest fault for me, is that the main character has less personality than most sports characters in sport films. Mickey Ward (Mark Wahlberg) has a crackhead brother, former boxing great played flawlessly by Christian Bale, and he has manager-mom played by brilliant Melissa Leo. Mark Wahlberg has range, he is a good actor, but Mickey just fell flat for me. I wasn't invested much in Mickey so when the boxing matches came on, I didn't care much. But the performances by the backup cast are fantastic. If anything, that's worth the concession price.",/review/rw2435697/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2017,zkonedog,8," Bale (and Adams) Steal the Show
","Ostensibly, The Fighter is a film based on the career of real-life pugilist Mickey Ward. For better or worse, however, the viewing experience is often hijacked by the acting of the supporting cast.",/review/rw2435697/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2010,johnceallach,10," Wicked outstanding film
","This is the film that David O'Russell and the cast and crew have outdone themselves on. the best way to say it is WIcked outstanding. It not only told the story of ""Irish"" Micky Ward, Dickie Eklund and the family aspect but was a credit to the real internal and external struggle of never giving up. ""the fighter "" does proper justice to the hardworking ways and the People of Mass and Boston areas. ",/review/rw2435697/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2010,howard.schumann,8," Never had much invested in the outcome
","David O. Russell's The Fighter is about Mickey Ward, a personality-free junior welterweight fighter (Mark Wahlberg) the working class town of Lowell, Massachusetts whose struggles are as much outside of the ring as inside. Based on a true story, the film revolves around Mick's s relationship with his dysfunctional family that includes his half-brother Dickie Eklund (Christian Bale), an ex-fighter called ""The Pride of Lowell"" because he survived ten rounds with Sugar Ray Leonard, his overbearing trash-talking mother, Alice (Melissa Leo) and his repellent seven sisters who are little more than caricatures. Mick worships Dickie who insists he once floored Sugar Ray Leonard, but Dickie has become a crack addict who is unfit for the ring except to act as his brother's trainer.",/review/rw2435697/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2011,bob the moo,," Just a great piece of story telling
","I have been burnt so many times around Oscar time of year ‚Äì films that come out with a lot of fanfare and glory, films that seem very ""worthy"" but ones that ultimately don't deliver on the screen where it matters. Daniel Craig's Defiance comes to mind but there have been others. Anyway, for this reason I stayed out of the crowds for The Fighter and only got round to watching it recently. I was very pleased to find that, although not a classic, The Fighter is just a solidly great film that satisfies across the board even if it isn't the classic that some would have you believe.",/review/rw2435697/?ref_=tt_urv
