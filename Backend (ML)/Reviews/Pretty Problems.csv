5 June 2004,dbborroughs,10," You Either Love it or Hate it
",This is a film that in no way reflects the real world. Nothing in this film makes any real world sense or has any real world logic. It operates entirely in its own little world and your ability to accept it or not  will determine your love or hate for this film.,/review/rw7494614/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 1999,Bob-45,," MORE than a GREAT action film
","Having read some of the criticisms of THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT, I am beginning to wonder if we all saw the same movie.  There is NOTHING in this film, NOTHING more implausible than anything in even the BEST James Bond film. WHY would Daedalus (David Morse) be alone, when he is the head of a terrorist syndicate?  The answer is CLEARLY revealed in the movie.  Why doesn't Samuel Jackson bleed to death when he's shot?  It's COLD and SNOWING, blood pressure drops and blood coagulates easier. My gosh, you could have a similar criticism about Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in TITANIC! I've watched TLKG  FOUR times and I am still LOOKING for the ""plotholes"" I keep hearing about, and I have marketed scripts in Hollywood. I believe TLKG is the BEST action film ever made; the only thing which comes close is DIE HARD!  TLKG, while never dull, builds slowly to a virtual nonstop crescendo of action.  The music is both powerful and incredibly touching. The film has memorable performances, most notably, Geena Davis and Craig Bierko. Bierko creates one of the screens most memorable villians.  One would have to go back to Russell Crowe in VIRTUOSITY, or Alan Rickman in ROBIN HOOD or DIE HARD! to find another as memorable (JAMES BOND producers take note!)  But more than this, the film transcends the genre of action film by it's underlying themes of duality and femininity (not feminism).  Samantha Caine (Geena Davis) is a pretty typical 90s woman; a single parent, a school teacher, a homeowner, and engaged to a pleasant, if bland, fellow school teacher.  Only one thing keeps Samantha's life from being perfectly ""normal.""  Eight years earlier Samantha woke up on a beach, pregnant, suffering from a head wound and amnesia.  For eight years, Samantha has been trying to rediscover her past; she lives to regret that decision.  For Samantha is actually Charlie Baltimore, an assassin for the Central Intelligence Agency; and the people who left her on that beach eight years before want her dead. Samantha begins a horrendous journey in which she risks not MORE than her life. Samantha Caine risks losing her identity forever in the person of Charlie Baltimore. And Charlie? What a piece of work! Charlie Baltimore is the most cold-blooded antihero I've ever seen in a movie. After all, what other ""hero"" ever plotted to kill her own child to cover her tracks? Charlie, short blond hair, angular figure, sexual predator, could have easily have been a man.  The ""masculine"" Charlie holds the ""feminine"" Samantha in contempt.  Yet, it is only by integrating ""Samantha"" and ""Charlie"" that enables Samantha/Charlie to prevail.  This is more than the equivalent of ""Jekyl"" needing ""Hyde"" or ""Superman"" needing ""Clark Kent.""   This is about the integration of the ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" sides in each of us to create a ""whole"" identity.  No where is this integration more apparent than when ""Charlie"" wrecks the truck containing the chemical bomb.  ""He/She"" says ""Well s***k my d**k!"" IMMEDIATELY after that line, ""Charlie"" submerges into ""Samantha.""  But not the wimpy domestic of the early film. A strong, self-reliant, but ultimately humanistic Samantha.  One simply has to experience THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT to understand this.  This is one excellent film, the only movie I've ever given a ""10"".",/review/rw7494614/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2020,view_and_review,8," Where is ""The Long Kiss Goodnight 2""????
","Before Jason Bourne was an assassin who lost his memory there was Charlie Baltimore and she has no sequels. The way I see it, Geena Davis was ahead of her time. Yes, we'd had ""La Femme Nikita"" and maybe a few others, but ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" was the first female kickass assassin movie I'd ever seen.",/review/rw7494614/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2008,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,9," The Anti-Formula Formula
","There is a serious scene in this movie. A scene that lets you know that his film won't be pulling many cheap punches. It takes place in a crowded train station and the protagonists are ambushed by assassins with automatic weapons. They make a break for it and just manage to get out in a hail of gunfire. The main hall of the train station is now filled with corpses of innocent people that were caught in the crossfire. Some would call that too sad and/or grim to put into what is supposed to be an enjoyable action flick. I call it honesty. Most action movies tend to lean toward the ""safe side"" of showing violence and plot elements. This mostly means that in spite massive shootouts innocent people tend not to die or at least we don't see them die. The violence is all purely the good guys versus the bad guys with mainly the bad guys dying. A bit of common sense clearly shows this to be absurd.",/review/rw7494614/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2003,Silverzero,8," High octane, bug budget action thriller. Very entertaining nonetheless.
","""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" is an enjoyable and very cool action thriller, and a career breakthrough for Geena Davis. The plot is very familiar to that of The Bourne Identity but so what. The fight scenes are a real treat for the eyes and the plotline is strong enough to keep you engaged for the 2 hours.",/review/rw7494614/?ref_=tt_urv

13 September 2004,RetroRoger,9," A Ballistic Buddy Movie
",This is by far my favorite action movie. But what makes it work is not the elaborate Renny Harlin explosions and shoot-em-ups. It's the Shane Black script and its deft delivery by Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson.,/review/rw7494614/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2020,UniqueParticle,10," Stylized Renny Harlin brutal entertainment
","Samantha Cain (Geena Davis) teacher turns expert assassin when danger comes to her home, has to protect her daughter and survive with her new best friend Samuel L. Jackson in this wild 2 hour action blockbuster. I absolutely love the way this movie was made such a different 90's vibe that is so exciting! I'm surprised it's not more talked about or at least not from what I've heard. I need to buy The Long Kiss Goodnight it's damn enjoyable!",/review/rw7494614/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2000,Spleen,8," MUCH better than you'd expect
","Not a box office success; no-one really knows why.  It may have failed simply because of its title.  It looks as though you need a two-word tough-guy title to attract a sufficient proportion of the idiot crowd - ""Die Hard"", ""Lethal Weapon"", ""Hard Weapon"", ""Die Lethal"", etc. - talking about ""the long kiss goodnight"" will get you nowhere.  But for once Renny Harlin has made a GOOD action movie.  A large part of the reason for this lies in the fact that the central character, Samantha, earns our affection and interest early on.  As she becomes Charly again, we're torn: we certainly want Charly to thwart the bad guys, and all that; but we don't want her to lose touch with Samantha in order to do so - even though we like Charly, too.  Geena Davis bestows all of her considerable charm on both halves of the central character.  Samuel L. Jackson plays second fiddle for a change. It turns out he's good at it.  That was a compliment.",/review/rw7494614/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2005,miken-3,9," Geena rocks!
","I had never heard of this film till it popped up on cable TV and I can't understand why. Geena outdoes Arnold as an action hero in this film! Geena is an ex-CIA assassin who is brainwashed and given an identity as a schoolteacher with a quiet family life in a rural town. She continues that life for 8 years with a husband and daughter. Clues start coming to her that she may have been someone else, especially when someone tries to kill her. It seems that her former employers have discovered that she never died and want to make sure that she does. She hires Samuel L. Jackson, who is a former police officer. Together they form a pair that is as entertaining as Mel Gibson & Danny Glover. When Geena finally regains her memory she undergoes a transformation into the killing machine she once was with the song ""She's Not There"" playing in the background. What follows is Geena and Samuel have to go after the bad guys and hopefully stay alive. All through the rest of the film Geena has to decide who she really is. The killing unfeeling machine? The mother/schoolteacher with the quiet family life? Or a combination of both? Especially, since the bad guys grab Geena's daughter. Great action scenes that rank up with any of the Die Hard movies!",/review/rw7494614/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2001,White Dolphin,," Enjoyable Thriller
","I was about to go to sleep while I flicked through the channels one last time and happened to catch the beginning of ""The Long Kiss Goodnight""- perhaps I missed the first minute or two. But I remembered I had marked the movie to watch and thought what the heck- I'll watch. I can honestly say that I really enjoyed those two hours. The scene with the truck was definitely fun, and at the same time terrifying (as you know the purpose of the truck and who's in it, I won't spoil it for anyone). The humor was great too, and the acting of the four leads (Davis, Jackson, Zima and Bierko) was quite enjoyable- as is this entire film.",/review/rw7494614/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2013,A_Different_Drummer,10," History will be much kinder to this film...
","Incredible elements. A Renny Harlin film, which essentially means that, after the film is in the can, either the director or the audience will be a candidate for a rubber room, one or the other. Geena Davis in what (unfortunately) seems to have been her attempt to get back in the game by betting it all on a wacky High Concept script with a wacky director (Sharon Stone did the same with her she-man Italian western, also in my IMDb reviews). And Samuel L. Jackson doing what he did best by this stage in his career -- essentially playing himself. (Cinephiles in the future may argue to whether his character was even needed in the story, but no matter). The film is uneven. But to steal a line from early in the last century, even when it is bad, it is very very good. Davis, a trooper if ever there was one, put everything she has into this project and it shows. There are ""bits"" here which rank with the very best of the iconic films of old -- such as the set piece in the kitchen where amnesiac Davis does things with a knife not even Ronco ever imagined, and then concludes with the unforgettable line, ""Chefs do that!"" And the scene where a former student of Davis' accidentally bumps into her when she is in her alternate persona, and reprimands her for smoking .. well, the word ""brilliant"" does not come close. Highly recommended, warts and all, more fun than a barrel of hammers.",/review/rw7494614/?ref_=tt_urv

8 June 2006,harlanlovestone,10," So Underrated Yet So Great
","I have seen this film probably a dozen times since it was originally released theatrically. Anyone who calls this movie trash or horrible just doesn't understand action films or recognize a good one. Perhaps to some the incidents and outcomes may seem far fetched, but in my opinion screenwriter Shane Black ( Lethal Weapon/ Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) crafted one of the most well thought out action adventures you will ever come across. Over the top or not this film flows like clockwork and the action just keeps coming. The final action sequence is one of the best I have ever seen in any film. The cast in this film crackles. Genna Davis gave a tremendous performance and its a damn shame there was never a ""LKG"" sequel. Samuel L. Jackson is hilarious as her sidekick Mitch a down on his luck private eye trying to help her discover her lost past and make a few bucks. If Baffles me how anyone could not like this film. It packs so many thrills and its so funny. The wisecracks in this film still make me laugh just as hard 10 years later. In my mind the first Matrix film and the Long Kiss Goodnight were easily 2 of the best and most original action flicks of the 90's. Incidentally Shane Black made a fortune when he sold this script. At the time it was the highest selling screenplay and its worth every penny. It's so sad that audiences never gave this movie a chance, cause they would have witnessed Renny Harlins best film and Genna Davis like you have never seen her before. Long live ""The Long Kiss Goodnight""!!",/review/rw7494614/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2010,Tweekums,8," Under rated action thriller
","Given that this film has some great action and plenty of funny lines it is a surprise that it isn't more popular. Geena Davis plays teacher Samantha Caine who has a good life in small town America despite having no memories of her life before she was found on a beach eight years before. Something happens however when she is involved in a serious car crash; she quickly dispatches the injured deer she hit and once home appears to have developed an unusual skill with a knife. She thinks that this is an indication that she might have been a chef... however when a prisoner sees her on television, escapes from prison and tries to kill her it becomes clear that she isn't a chef, chefs don't snap the necks of attackers as though its no big deal. Around the same time the sleazy detective Mitch Henessey, played by Samuel L. Jackson, has found a lead as to who she might be. As the two of them pursue the leads it becomes apparent that she was a CIA assassin who went missing during an operation and was believed dead. Unfortunately for her her old target is now working with her former employers and both want her out of the way so they can carry out a terrorist attack which will be used to justify more funding for CIA operations. The more she finds out about her past and struggles to survive the more the personality of Samantha is replaced by that of her former self Charly Baltimore... the change is quite a shock for Mitch. If losing her memory and being unsure who is a friend and who is an enemy wasn't enough for her to contend with terrorist Timothy kidnaps her daughter; now Charly must both rescue her daughter and prevent a major terrorist attack in Niagara Falls.",/review/rw7494614/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2002,ajw4,," Greatest female action actor -ever- bar none
","I have always liked a good action movie with a woman lead, Linda Hamilton comes to mind in the Terminator series, of course Sigourney Weaver in the Alien series, and Laura Linney in The Congo,(another one of the Micheal Crichton renditions) was an excellent strong female in an action movie. But none can even come close to Geena Davis in ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"". She quite simply blew me away ( as well as an incredible amount of bad guys) with the way she ""handled her business"" in this flick. I gotta tell ya- I will love this woman forever as the result of scenes from this movie-like when jumping from what? six-seven flights up, simultaneously firing an automatic weapon in a circular pattern in order to break a hole through a frozen lake surface-at the same time dragging an incredulous Sam Jackson out the window with her. Yo, this woman, this movie is the Boom Diggie!! I could probably go on extolling this movie for at least 25 to 30 thousand words, but you know, I'd rather look at this movie than write about it, so I'm off. My advice to you is go rent Stuart Little, in case you're one of those weirdos that don't have your own personal copy at home, then follow it up with Cutthroat Island and then finish your evening with ""Long Kiss Goodnight"" and I guarantee you it will take every bit of will you've got in ya to keep from stalking this woman-not to mention I only found out today she was born on the exact same date as my own, 1/21/56-an Aquarius on top of everything. (Getting a little weird on ya but I had to find some way to throw that in)Don't worry Geena I am happily married with a houseful of happy Geena fans at home right now watching Mr Little! To anyone who hasn't had the pleasure, get out there and rent this film today- you will not be disappointed-to say the least! Finally-you match up Arnold vs Geena based on this movie-and you gotta go with Geena Davis-hands down- This babe is bad!This flick is sweet!",/review/rw7494614/?ref_=tt_urv

","Christmas Eve? The wrong place at the right time? Sound familiar? ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" could quite easily have been a third sequel in the action series ""Die Hard"".

","This movie was one of the bridges to the contemporary action movie that has no plot at all and is unabashed about that fact. It is the melding between the 90s attempt at plot and the ever-increasing tendency for all violence all the time with some hot babe shots thrown in. Viewed from the perspective of today's movies with their plasticine-looking heroes and heroines, Davis and Jackson come off as nostalgically genuine and charming.",/review/rw7494614/?ref_=tt_urv

30 October 2021,kevin_robbins,9," This movie isn't perfect but it's a helluva lot of fun
","The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently watched on Tubi. The storyline follows a regular every day housewife that's married, has a little girl and seems perfectly normal. In her history she suffered amnesia and shortly after waking up she started this storybook life. One day her past starts coming back to her and she starts becoming mean and ruthless. She decides to take a break from mommy life and work with a private investigator to uncover her past which may stir some unexpected demons. This movie is directed by Renny Harlin (Devil's Pass) and stars Geena Davis (Beetlejuice), Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction), Brian Cox (Troy) and David Morse (Green Mile). The storyline for this picture is fun to watch unfold and is presented in a clever and stylish fashion. The acting is out of this world as Davis and Jackson really nail their performances. The script is also clever and contains a nice blend of humor and intensity and also helps you relate to the characters. The action scenes, shootouts, torture scenes, car chases and explosions are excellent. The soundtrack is also great. This movie isn't perfect but it's a helluva lot of fun. I'd score this an 8.5/10 and strongly recommend it.",/review/rw7494614/?ref_=tt_urv
