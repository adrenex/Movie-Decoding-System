7 August 2021,maximovlE,10," Impossible to explain how good!
","Simply impossible to explain this show. Nothing I write will do it justice. I've been around since The Magic Roundabout, The Flumps, Captain Pugwash, Tom and Jerry, Scooby Doo... Nothing from that era, or today's attempts like Peppa Pig, or anything in-between, come anywhere near to the standards of Bluey.",/review/rw7294446/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2019,BoxwoodExpress,10," Disney Junior is Back In Business
","I'm one of the few Americans in this review section, since this particular cartoon, which originates from Australia, didn't premiere in the USA until 9 September 2019 on the Disney Junior. I've been hearing rave reviews for the series, so I was excited for it to premiere. It went way beyond my expectations.",/review/rw7294446/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2020,Kirpianuscus,," charming
","It seems an animated serie first for adults. For the many provocative stories, for the fresh and refreshing perspective about family and, especially, for the relations between parents and kids, for humor - the fine irony is a great virtue. Short, just charming in its mixture of chaos and not ordinary forms of wisdom",/review/rw7294446/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2021,safenoe,10," Mom...Dad...Bingo...Bluey!!
","I discovered Bluey recently, and it's quite sublime with quite the reveal at the end, e.g. Handstand. It's more than a kid's show, and it's more than a series for the parents. It's one for everyone to enjoy. I remember the moment I discovered The Simpsons all those years ago. Now it's Bluey.",/review/rw7294446/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2020,coasterdude44,10," Perfect Australian Kids Cartoon, can't get enough of this beautiful program
","Finally, Australia gets itself an animated show that is warranted of all the praise it's currently getting. The animation is beautiful looking and charming with great character such as Bluey, Bingo as well as her Mum and Dad. It's a very relatable family which any Australian can identify with as well as many more around the world.",/review/rw7294446/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2019,stabbybob,10," Profoundly Good
","It is rare that any program, let alone a kids tv show, makes you want to be a better parent, and then shows you how. But this family of dogs does just that. Mum works and Dad does everything he can to be a loving carer who fosters imagination and play. The lessons are subtle, cased in layers of imagination and humour and end up hitting you right in the heart. I consider myself a pretty good parent, but Bluey shows me how to be a better one. And dare I say it, it has fostered a closer relationship to my daughter as a result. Yep. It is that good.",/review/rw7294446/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2021,bulgerpaul,10," Nothing else in this age group compares
","There is literally nothing in all off children's media targeting the age group of 2-5 years old that even remotely compares to just how adorable, hilarious, imaginative, original, and emotionally mature as Bluey is.",/review/rw7294446/?ref_=tt_urv

",Simply perfect. Everything about Bluey is fantastic.,/review/rw7294446/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2020,LTPHarry,9," Not just for children, it's for everyone
","Back in 2004, a british animated show called Peppa Pig premiered. Forward to 2018, and we have this Australian series, which is called Bluey.",/review/rw7294446/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2021,alexkzapf,10," Best kids show.
",This show manages to tackle parenthood and what it is to bring kids up the way no other show can manage. It's funny. It's serious when needed and teaches important lesson. And it does it in a way that your kids can watch it. It also is fun to watch for adults.,/review/rw7294446/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2021,maymckay,9," Is there a more realistic show on parenting?
","It was a casual listen, I happened to catch a two minute snippet of conversation of two Austrailian dogs, talking to their puppies. And I laughed out loud. I took two steps back and before I knew it, I'd watched four episodes. Granted each episode is only 7 minutes long, but it is more fun then I've had with any Disney cartoon show in ages. It took me back to the days of Chip & Dale Rescue Rangers, Talespin, and suddenly I was anxious to watch this show (with my child of course... cough cough) again and again. Great writing, phenomenal voice acting. It ranks with some of my favorite shows I've seen. Excited for Season two to go on Disney+!",/review/rw7294446/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2021,cmwhite28,10," This show makes me a better parent
","Funny, relatable, and so enjoyable for the whole family. Our kids love it, but we the adults love it as well. It shows the magic of childhood but also shows what engaged parenting looks like. This show makes my husband and I want to be better parents and also showcases the universal themes of parenthood. This is hands down the best kids show. The hype is worth it.",/review/rw7294446/?ref_=tt_urv

28 October 2018,arielle-bennett,10," Best kids show yet
",I watch this with my 2 year old everyday and it's our new favorite. It's such a great show. We love it!,/review/rw7294446/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2021,linear-descent,10," We even listen to the soundtrack on the way to school
","I don't ever remember sitting and watching a kids show by myself after the kids go to sleep, but here I am. My youngest was watching this show one day and I happened to just walk in the playroom and sit down and watch the ""Sleepytime"" episode with her and everything the parents were going through in that episode regarding when one of your kids crawl in bed with you were exactly what my wife and I have experienced with our own kids. I found myself laughing and identifying with the parents, and then stayed and watched the remaining few episodes for the half hour on Disney Jr.",/review/rw7294446/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2018,charliebungle,10," About time, Australia...
","Massive kudos to the makers and cast. Who needs kids as an excuse to watch this? Brilliant stuff and long overdue for this country to be producing something of this calibre. Whoever voices Bluey and Bingo deserve individual recognition too. Clever, entertaining and hugely amusing. If this doesn't rank up there with Peppa Pig and the plethora of other great British kids' shows, there really is no justice.",/review/rw7294446/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2018,mszeedee,10," Great Aussie cartoon.
","""Bluey's Dad, Bandit, is an Archaeologist (who loves to dig for bones) and is voiced by award-winning musician and song writer, Dave McCormack (frontman of rock band Custard). Bluey's Mum, Chilli (who works part-time in airport security), is voiced by actress Melanie Zanetti (Tidelands, The Bureau of Magical Things, The Family Law). Bluey, Bingo and some of their friends are voiced by children of the production crew, making this series truly a family affair, on and off the screen.""",/review/rw7294446/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2019,natasha-r-mcgrath,10," I trusted the great reviews and they were right!!
","This is a great little show to watch! I don't even have any kids, well human kids anyway...I do have a Cattle Dog haha. Lately I have just heard people raving about it and it also got a great write up on the ABC so I thought I'd see what all the fuss was about and before I knew it, I was hooked!! My boyfriend and I have found ourselves chuckling at the jokes and find it very relatable to growing up as a kid in Australia! Bring on more Bluey!!!",/review/rw7294446/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2021,Tak005,8," A great kids show with an Australian flavour.
",The is a fantastic kids show. Each episode contains a moral combined with humour. The children love it. Also Australia has been devoid of children's shows with a local flavour. The majority are made overseas. This show addresses that problem. It also contains snippets of humour which adults will enjoy.,/review/rw7294446/?ref_=tt_urv

10 August 2019,tomassalazartrivino,10," Trust me. This will be an international HIT.
","Bluey is the best toddlers show I've ever seen and I enjoy it so much even being a teenager- My favorite thing? Well, Bluey has a lot of positive messages. Bluey has definitely helped me to believe more in myself. You know, if you are parent, I'd recommend you watching the show as well, you may also learn so many positive messages, just like I did!",/review/rw7294446/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2018,bmeers-883-50483,10," Move over Peppa Pig
","Endlessly creative, clever, heart warming, topical, this is one of the best shows for little ones on TV. The animation is gorgeous, the writing is brilliant. I find myself watching episodes even when the kids aren't there. The voice acting is incredible with special mention going to the actors who do Bluey and the dad (someone needs to update their IMDB page). The relationship between the dad and his kids is inspiring. The games the kids play together and with their parents are so clever. I now re-enact them with my own kids. This show could be huge, both here and overseas. I feel strangely proud that it's made by Australia. Well done, bravo, keep up the good work.
