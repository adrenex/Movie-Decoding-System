","I have never watched a show that is as consistently genuine and engaging as Breaking Bad. This is undoubtedly one of the greatest shows ever, and it consistently improves as it progresses.",/review/rw8672131/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2021,Supermanfan-13,10," Damn near perfect!
","Breaking Bad is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the greatest tv shows ever created...it's damn near perfect! I know that people say that about a ton of different shows but Breaking Bad really is universally thought of as one of the greatest shows of all-time. All you have to do is go google ""greatest tv shows of all-time"" and I guarantee you that it's at or near the top of every list you'll find and there's a reason for that...because it is! Every season is just as brilliant as the others, which everyone knows is almost impossible for a show to do but one which Breaking Bad absolutely pulls off!! If you're one of the few people who still haven't seen this amazing show then do yourself a favor and go watch this immediately...you will not be disappointed!",/review/rw8672131/?ref_=tt_urv

","'Breaking Bad' is one of the most popular rated shows on IMDb, is one of those rarities where every season has either been very positively received or near-universally acclaimed critically and where all of my friends have said nothing but great things about.",/review/rw8672131/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2021,KinoKoopaKid,10," 99.1% pure
","One of the greatest shows ever, the pacing is excellent. The characters are well developed and entertaining. The show ties everything together very neatly. It's honestly a show that get's better each time you view it. It's cathartic to see Walter break bad and how the story unravels is the best way it could have. Very good storytelling, well done to Vince Gilligan.",/review/rw8672131/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2022,DiCaprioFan13,10," Absolutely Brilliant!!
",Breaking Bad is every bit as good as everyone says it is. It's easily one of my favorites shows of all-time and one of the best shows in the history of television. Just read through the reviews and look at the 9.5 rating to see how loved this show really is. The writing and acting is what makes this show so special. I love this show so much that I've already watched it all the way through twice already and plan on doing so again sometime in the near future. There's nothing more I can say about this incredible show that hasn't already been said so just go watch it. But plan ahead to give yourself enough time because you're going to want to binge this as quickly as you can. It's addicting once you start!,/review/rw8672131/?ref_=tt_urv

12 January 2014,gogoschka-1,10," If you mix Scarface, Robin Hood and maybe Tyler Durden with enough meth - you'll get a mean cocktail called 'Heisenberg'
","If you are among the few who haven't seen it yet: believe the hype, it really is THAT good. Breaking Bad may not depict reality the way 'Generation Kill' or 'The Wire' did - but then it's not about that, either. From an artistic point of view - performances, writing, direction, camera, music - this show is every bit as good as the other two mentioned above, but unlike those, 'Breaking Bad' just wants to entertain and therefore enjoys a lot more creative freedom.",/review/rw8672131/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2022,anthonymichael-93585,10," The greatest TV show of all time.
","Breaking Bad is the greatest TV show of all time, and you can tell very easily because it's lowest rated episode has a score of 7.8. There are few other shows that can come close to the level of Breaking Bad, and one of them is it's own spin-off show, Better Call Saul. No other show in television history has had as long as a powerful and lasting impact on human culture, not even the longest running shows of all time, not The Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, Law & Order, SpongeBob SquarePants.",/review/rw8672131/?ref_=tt_urv

21 November 2022,GDNachoo,10," An onion that tastes really good
","Just like an onion there's many, many layers to this show. You're gonna have re-watches in which you will notice something you didn't notice before, perhaps you can go in with a different mindset and end up seeing the show in a completely different & new perspective.",/review/rw8672131/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2021,Leofwine_draca,10," Every bit as good as you've heard
","I'd put off watching BREAKING BAD for years and years, not being particularly interested in a contemporary story about a couple of drug dealers, but I needn't have worried. This is a series that lives up to all the accolades, just as involving and gripping as I'd hoped. About half a dozen actors give career best performances as characters that evolve slowly and realistically over five seasons, and the depth is incredible, along with the refusal to paint a single person in black and white. Humour, suspense, action and the depths of the human existence being frequently explored; there's really nothing better.",/review/rw8672131/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2022,lerrom,10," If I could rate it 20/10, I would.
","Where do I even begin? The writing is near perfect, the actors and characters are all amazing, the over-arching story just gets only better and better. This show is just a bullet train, this just goes and refuses to stop. It pulls no punches, everything that happens has all the impact. And honestly, there isn't a single bad episode. Every episode, yes even ""Fly"", serves a purpose, and honestly, shouldn't be skipped over upon first viewing. And for a show that ended in 2013, it's still relatively popular and beloved among people. Everyone I know still loves the show and loves it to death.",/review/rw8672131/?ref_=tt_urv

9 November 2021,FishDrowned,10," By far the greatest show I've ever watched
","Breaking Bad feels like fever dream. A really REALLY good fever dream. The directing is absolutely perfect. The characters bounce off each other in this really well done way. I can really feel the true emotion and pure character coming from each one. I can feel the greed, lust, money hunger animals each of these characters are. There are no true heroes in this story (except hank I love u).",/review/rw8672131/?ref_=tt_urv

","I finally got around to watching breaking bad in 2022, more than 10 years after the show first premiered. This is at the top of the list for best rated shows and it's a series that has been recommended to me a lot of times and... wow.

11 November 2022,p-57286,10," The most cinematic television show of all time
","Breaking Bad is a perfect series. This is a fact. In the past, there were movies and series. They lived in a very different universe from each other. Nowadays there are cinematographic television series. In the 70s, 80s and 90s, series such as Full House, Seinfield and Family Ties with the formula of Sitcom and Miami Vice, 21 Jump Street and Starsky and Hutch with the formula of detective fiction appeared. In 1992, Twin Peaks appeared, a series with episodes of almost an hour long, with a cinematic style, including having been created by a film director, David Lynch. Other series emerged with a cinematic style, such as The Wire, Oz, Mad Men and The Sopranos. Breaking Bad is the most cinematic of them all. Walter White is the most complex and best-developed character in the history of world television. There are dozens and dozens of memorable and memorable scenes in Breaking Bad. The series holds up great over five seasons, which is no easy feat. It's also impressive how the series managed to build a sensational episode in which more than 30 minutes of episode take place inside a laboratory. The episode ""The Fly"", serves to develop the relationship between Walt and Jessie. The figure of Walt\Heisenberg is a very emblematic figure. He is the personification of the anti-hero. The series remains one of the best series of all time or perhaps the best.",/review/rw8672131/?ref_=tt_urv

26 February 2009,valis1949,10," Mind Blowing
","BREAKING BAD:Season One explodes like a sucker punch to the gut, and is nothing short of mind-blowing. The pilot for this series is a definite ""Must See"", and stands with the greats of Action/Adventure Television and Cinema. This segment begins at such a giddy peak, that you think the only way forward would be to tell the tale as a long flashback. However, through a marvelous piece of editing and writing, the plot miraculously moves forward from that point. Bryon Cranston's idiosyncratic performance is a joy to behold. He embodies a man who is against a rock, and an even harder place, who has no other option but to throttle his higher aspirations and grimly carry on. His solace and validation in middle-class morality and virtuous conduct is long gone. I eagerly look forward to more of this ambitious, entertaining series.",/review/rw8672131/?ref_=tt_urv

8 February 2015,Quinoa1984,10," arguably the greatest dramatic series... ever?
","It's hard for me to be super objective about this show. Over the course of 62 episodes, right from the start, for me, Vince Gilligan and his team of writers and directors crafted a piece of neo-noir-western American tragedy that almost never, if ever, lost its footing. In its story of the rise and fall of Walter White (or his fun alias Heisenberg) and how he becomes a Meth ""Emperor"" in Albuquerque during his run of lung cancer, we get all kinds of dramaturgy here. There's conflict, conflict, conflict going on in this show, always, from the familial (what do I tell my wife, Skylar, or not tell her, what doesn't she tell me, how far do the lies and deceit and horrors go?) to the more genre-leaning (how much criminals go in their crazy s***, which is established early on with the throw of the particular chemical and the ""This... is not Meth"" explosion) to the dark comedy that gives the Coens a run for their money (Better Call Saul!) - not to mention how it made Aaron Paul just as much as star as Bryan Cranston, both working actors along with Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, Betsy Brandt and Bob Odenkirk. It all... fits.",/review/rw8672131/?ref_=tt_urv
