31 March 2020,Uriah43,7," A Satisfactory Adaptation of the Book
","This mini-series begins at a secret government lab in California that accidently releases an extremely lethal modification of the flu into the air which quickly infects everybody within the vicinity. Realizing the danger that this virus poses to his family, a security guard by the name of ""Charlie Campion"" (Ray McKinnon) hurries out of the compound and--with his wife and small child--drives as fast as he can in order to put distance between them and this horrific contagion. Unfortunately, despite his best efforts the virus takes hold and in a state of complete exhaustion he eventually succumbs to the disease and crashes into a gas pump at a grocery store in East Texas. Naturally, this sudden development brings out all of those inside the building-which then exposes all of them to the virus as well. So, with containment no longer possible, the virus soon spreads to all parts of the country leaving most of the population dead within weeks. The small number of people who do survive become split up into two factions with the main characteristic being a specific vision that each of them have. Those who are essentially good dream of an old black lady by the name of ""Abigail Freemantle"" (Ruby Dee) who beckons them to join her in Nebraska. The other dream involves a sinister man named ""Randall Flagg"" (Jamie Sheridan) who urges his followers to come to Las Vegas and join him. And it's this split that results in the horrors yet to come. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, having read the book by Stephen King a couple of years prior to this film, I have to say that I was a somewhat disappointed overall in that it didn't quite capture the dark horror to its fullest extent. But then, more often than not, that's typically the case for films based on novels anyway. In any case, this movie still managed to combine enough of the original suspense with some decent acting all around and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",/review/rw1249246/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2000,mattkratz,," M-O-O-N, that spells good!
","I enjoyed this one. If you can make it through the several hours and four tapes, you'll like it too. It has some truly scary moments, and Jamey Sheridan makes a terrific Flagg. The cast gets an A(Gary Sinise especially), and you'll like it. Comparisons between this and the book wouldn't be fair (as with most Stephen King works), but you'll like both. I did. If anything, it is definitely worth a look. *** out of ****",/review/rw1249246/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2001,GirlwonderReturns,," Pretty good, but not quite up to the novel
","The Stand is perhaps my favorite novel of all time, and I always knew that translating it to the screen - big or small - would be a pretty heavy task. Still, I followed the progress of the making of the miniseries from casting through production, up to release. One of the things that amazed me was the fact that some of the casting was so dead-on and some so far off. Nick Andros was my most favorite character in the book, and I can tell you that he was in no way, shape or form Rob Lowe - period. Molly Ringwald took on the role of Frannie Goldsmith - a strong, opinionated, outspoken, and conscientious woman - and turned her into a selfish, whiny little girl. And I do mean that every line she spoke seemed to come out as a whine. And it wasn't the dialogue, but her delivery.",/review/rw1249246/?ref_=tt_urv

11 July 2022,tindfoting,6," As good as it gets...?
","I admit being biased. After 2 episodes of the new Stand, I gave up. This was utter crap. Then again, I hadnt seen the original for about 20 years. I remember it being pretty faithful to the book, and wanted to see how it hold together. In other words; has The Stand stood the test of time? What's it's strongest side compared to the new version, is the cast. The new kids on the block has no chance against Gary Senise, Ruby Dee, Miguel Ferrer, Ossie Davis, Rob Lowe, Molly Ringwald. BUT it has that feeling.... like watching the original IT again, everything feels dated. And I actually blame Stephen King himself for this. Being executive producer, he is the guy who desides what stays in the movie (besides playing in it, himself). And it feels troughout. A book and a movie is two different animals, and sometimes things just look redicilous on screen. The insane ending with ""the hand of God"" is laughable, just like Randal Flagg's real face. And that's why The Stand now is a mediocre experience. Stephen King might be the most productive author (63 books per 2022), but he is NOT someone who should have control over a movie adaptation.",/review/rw1249246/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 1999,Andybh3,," Awe-inspiring
","Prior to the release of It, The Stand was my favourite King novel. It's a gargantuan effort which weaves a huge cast of disparate characters into an epic tale of the struggle between good and evil on the eve of Armageddon. I used to think about what kind of a movie could be constructed from the novel, even going so far as to pick a cast, but I always knew in my heart that the sheer magnitude of the undertaking would undoubtedly make an effective translation to screen impossible.",/review/rw1249246/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2002,jcholguin,10," A stand of good and evil
","I don't know if Stephen King is a religious man or not but this movie is the greatest example of good vs evil that I have seen in a movie. There is so much taken from the bible about the final battle of God and Satan and what leads up to it is what makes this movie a true classic. The characters are displayed as humans with many problems but because of the time spent building up who they are, when a number of them die, a pain is felt for their loss. This film contains no superheroes who use their strengths of martial arts, guns or wits to fight Randall Flagg, the person of satan, just the trusting of a God that has a use for them. Dreams and visions inspire them to search for Mother Abigail Freemantle, who is 106 years old, and is used by God to encourage them to travel to Colorado. God can use anybody (mentally retarded Tom Cullen, old man Glen Bateman, old farmboy Ralph Brentner and even a deaf and mute non-believer of God, Nick Andros) in His battle against evil. Satan himself has his chosen ones (crazed trashcan man, secret spies in the camp Harold Lauder and Nadine Cross) to bring destruction to God's chosen ones. The final part as God's two witnesses stand against all of Flagg's evil henchmen, standing ""in the name of God"" is what makes a final battle a true final battle. Two men against hundreds, an impossibility to win but with God on your side, all things are possible. Perfect casting and perfect writing makes this the greatest of all the Stephen's Kings mini-movies. A must see, especially if the odds are against you right now!",/review/rw1249246/?ref_=tt_urv

21 March 2006,lee_eisenberg,10," Miniseries can be good after all. And you must watch this, whether sitting or ""stand""ing.
","Usually, when we hear about a TV miniseries, we probably think ""Oh God! Another product placement adaptation of a classic novel! Why does Hollywood do this to us?! I'll watch that as soon as there's a snowstorm in Rio de Janeiro!"" And since Stephen King's novels are so great, any adaptation of them is suspect, but surely a TV adaptation would have to be the sort of thing that would make ""Ishtar"" look like a cross between ""Gone with the Wind"" and ""Citizen Kane"".",/review/rw1249246/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 1998,kalmal,," read the book
","Someone originally made me watch this mini-series that he had on tape.  I was very impressed with it even though it was a television movie.  The whole time I was watching it my friend was raving about how much better the book was.  I like the movie so much (8/10) that I broke down and bought the unabridged edition of it.  It took a painstaking 3 months to read the book. It was tiresome at first, but at the end I didn't want the story to end. I also told myself that I would not watch the movie again until I finished the book.  I went back and re-watch the movie.  I couldn't believe how much they left out of the book that I had grown to love.  I struggled watching it and have a much different look at the movie (5/10)",/review/rw1249246/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2001,SCHAGELA,," Don't judge a movie by it's length or whatever happened to Rita Blakemoor

12 October 2002,lostintwinpeaks,," Make your stand...
","If you watch this not long after reading the book, you will not like it. Hardly surprising as most TV/Film adaptions of books are inferior to the original written word. Not that this TV series/movie isn't true to King's novel. In fact, as much of the huge book that could be filmed is indeed shown on screen, and the teleplay/screenplay is by King himself. However, if you've read the book, no doubt it was a large part of your life for sometime (the book is extremely long), and seeing the characters on the screen etc. may seem cheesey. I read the book in 1995 and watched some of this not long after; and didn't like it. Recently I bought it on video and me and a couple of friends (Hi Jenny and Mags) spent 6 hours watching, almost 7 years after I read the book. I enjoyed it more. I still remembered the book, but not in detail, and this movie/TV show was enjoyable.",/review/rw1249246/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2002,fiona-21,8," Not the hack job I was afraid it might be.
","I sat down to watch this with real trepidation as I have read the novel so many times that it has become incredibly real to me. Like so many other fans of the book, I had created the characters in my mind and could actually visualise them. After the hack job that was the TV adaptation of 'It' I could not imagine that I could be anything other than sorely disappointed.",/review/rw1249246/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2003,sweetkanake,10," Great adaptation
","Great job adapting a really long and complex book.  The characters are often very good (Bill Fagerbakke as Tom Cullen and Ray Walston as Glen Bateman, for example), and the storyline follows along that of the book.  Of course, there are some things left out or changed, but that was needed to make the movie only 8 hours.",/review/rw1249246/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2008,Solnichka,3," Terrible
","Seriously, why can't they make Stephen King adaptations like ""Shawshank"" or ""The Green Mile"" all the time? Oh yeah, they can - they just choose not to. Just like ""It"", the TV presentation of ""The Stand"" is laughably bad. The acting is terrible, despite the presence of some pretty decent talent. It's almost as if they forgot how to act and decided to become brain-dead, soap opera fodder.",/review/rw1249246/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2020,bjelleybean-364-553679,9," A great adaptation of Stephen King's finest
","I'm not sure what people were looking for with this but I can assure you it wasn't an adaptation of the novel because that's what this is. If you question the changes made and liberties taken remember that the teleplay here was written by Stephen King himself, who also appears in the film. Mick Garris has done an impressive job with one of the most difficult pieces of literature from the past 40 years and brought it to life with a fine cast.",/review/rw1249246/?ref_=tt_urv

16 September 2015,utgard14,6," There's nothing more evil than a mullet
","TV mini-series adapted from Stephen King's epic apocalyptic novel about a plague that wipes out most of the world's population. A group of walking clichés survive, some joining the forces of good (led by Ruby Dee) and some joining the forces of evil (led by Jamey Sheridan, sporting a hilarious mullet). ""The Stand"" was never my favorite King novel, although I did enjoy it when I read it probably twenty years ago or so. This mini-series was almost doomed to failure from the start for trying to accomplish a story with such grand scope on a TV budget. It's directed by Mick Garris, who has directed many Stephen King adaptations (most of which are garbage). I'm not a fan of Garris but I will say this is definitely him putting forth his A effort. He's limited by his budget and lack of talent so he does remarkably well considering. Most of the Love Boat-style cast are adequate, with some standing out for good performances (Gary Sinise, Rob Lowe, Miguel Ferrer) and others standing out for how hammy they are (Ruby Dee, Jamey Sheridan, Matt Frewer). Others are just plain awful (Laura San Giacomo, Parker Lewis). On the whole, it's very watchable for its length but never reaches its potential, TV excuse notwithstanding. At times it is extremely campy and even corny. There's some entertainment in that, of course, but it hurts the film more than it helps because the story really needs you to take it seriously for it to work.",/review/rw1249246/?ref_=tt_urv

","For those who are familiar with the works of Stephen King, then you know that a great deal of his work has been adapted for the screen, both big and small. Some of his adaptations have been great (Original version of Carrie, Misery, The Shining, It and Cujo), some are interesting (Cat's Eye, Firestarter, Christine and Storm of The Century), and some are downright disasters (The television version of Carrie, The Tommyknockers and Rose Red). Sometimes, it takes a good director to make a King book into an acceptable screen adaptation.",/review/rw1249246/?ref_=tt_urv
