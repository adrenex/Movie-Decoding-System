16 October 2020,majidy_pam,6," definitely a early 2000's movie
","I watched it last night ( October 15th 2020) as I was in the mood for something light and funny. The movie was that but definitely a early 2000's film. It was fun but awkward to watch today. It also made me realize just how many movies around that time were centered around middle school students acting and doing things much older than they should be ( hooking up!?, aren't they supposed to be playing 13- 15 year olds?) kinda like every show on disney today.",/review/rw6166558/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2015,anaconda-40658,2," Sleep Through This Film.
","Sleepover (2004): Dir: Joe Nussbaum / Cast: Alexa Vega, Mika Boorem, Kallie Flynn Childress, Scout Taylor-Compton, Sara Paxton: Another mindless teen comedy worth sleeping through. It suggests adventure when entering that next stage of growth but it mainly plays as an encore for vulgar sexual humour where these girls get away with behaviour that perhaps they should not. Four girls about to enter high school are talked into participating in a risky scavenger hunt. The catch being that the mother of one of the girls believes that they are having a slumber party. Lame concept deteriorates into numerous situations to get a guy's boxer shorts and the crown at the dance, etc. Director Joe Nussbaum has little sense of timing and relies mainly on flashy locations. Alexa Vega of Spy Kids fame heads the cast as the girl initially challenged with this nonsense. Mika Boorem plays her best friend proving that if one person walks into stupidity then another must follow as a rule of friendship. Sara Paxton makes an appearance and it is about as bad as her mermaid film where she is basically cast to look good. Kallie Flynn Childress and Scout Taylor-Compton round out the girls and between them all they have the combined personality of a pair of dirty underwear. None of this is funny as it plays as the latest sex teen romp worth the sleeping pills to get through. Score: 2 / 10",/review/rw6166558/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2004,colettesplace,5," There's a lot worse out there, but only go for Sleepover if you're a tween, the parent of a tween, or perhaps just nostalgic.
","Kids are running out of classrooms, shrieking and throwing papers in the air. A pop track pumps while the ubiquitous slow-mo panning camera follows the wannabes watching the popular girls strutting the corridor. That's right, school's out for summer in yet another John Hughes-inspired teen-flick.",/review/rw6166558/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2006,wendy_williams39,5," good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
",this movie is very cool and funny in way but not to enjoyable not the best movie i had ever seen but is cool. All the actors were very good especially Alexa Vega And Kallie as Yancy the typical loser type girl who managed to find friends at a sleepover. The story is about a group of friends who join in at a scavenger hunt against popular Queens. They get things wrong at first but they make way Alexa Vega gets to dance with her prince in the end at the dance. This movie is ideal for teen girls who live in a fantasy.i also love to watch the prince and me and comedies so try the prince and me it is a bit soppy but if you like other things watch like this movie i like stuck in the suburbs i love it!,/review/rw6166558/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2006,littleknight27,8," Cute and Corny
","It took me a long time to see this movie, but I finally did when my sister got it as a gift. Although the movie had its incredibly corny moments, and the plot was obviously written to entertain a preteen audience, I did find the movie enjoyable. There will be times during this movie when you will just have to laugh, and there will be times that you nod as you remember similar antics of your own. The characters are lovable and realistic, even if some of the messes they get into may not be. Granted, there will also be times when you just have to roll your eyes at the cheesiness. Overall, I found the movie very cute and very entertaining;just don't send your boys to watch it.",/review/rw6166558/?ref_=tt_urv

10 July 2004,gromit-14,6," About what you'd expect
","I thought this movie was quite enjoyable. It's a bit like a female version of Ferris Bueller, without the destructive male testosterone (the worst thing the girls can expect if caught is not to be able to go on a trip to Hawaii with the family). Even though everything is predictable (the dorky guys who save the day ... more than once, the popular girl getting her comeuppance, the ""fat"" girl learning to love herself, etc.) you don't seem to mind because the characters are well-developed and so, well, likable. It's not going to challenge you to use your brain much, but for a few hours of fun, this isn't bad. Will appeal especially to pre-teen and teen girls.",/review/rw6166558/?ref_=tt_urv

","Junior high is over and Julie Corky (Alexa Vega) is having a sleepover. Popular girl and former best friend Staci Blake (Sara Paxton) declines and is going to a high school dance instead. Her best friend Hannah (Mika Boorem) is moving and won't be attending high school with her. She invites Farrah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and then chubby Yancy (Kallie Flynn Childress) out of pity when Staci's friend Liz (Brie Larson) bullies her. She's infatuated with high school guy Steve Phillips (Sean Faris) but he doesn't know her. Her brother Ren (Sam Huntington) is a college dropout loser. Her mother (Jane Lynch) is out with a friend. Her father (Jeff Garlin) is at the house. Todd won't take Staci to the high school dance and they break up. Security patrolman Sherman (Steve Carell) is a nosy oddball. Staci comes over with a scavenger hunt challenge and Hannah comes up with the stakes of high school first year lunch spot. Russell ""SpongeBob"" Hayes (Evan Peters) and his 2 friends raid the party but the girls are gone. They followed the girls on their scavenger hunt while Ren covers for everybody.",/review/rw6166558/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2014,paul_haakonsen,5," Ferris Bueller light, oh, and for the girls...
","With ""Sleepover"" you know exactly what you will get. This is a fairly typical teenage and coming-of-age comedy. Sort of in the likes of ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" just not as classic or iconic. And bear in mind that this is a girl's movie.",/review/rw6166558/?ref_=tt_urv

9 July 2004,mack3175-1,," Sleepover was amusing, but that is not saying much.
","Think of Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Adventures In Babysitting mixed together and you got Sleepover. Young kids may want to see this because of Alexa Vega of Spy Kids fame. But this is not for young kids under 14. Alexa Vega is going quite well from quite kid to beautiful teenager. She is up there with Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Bynes, and Hilary Duff. This story starts out with Julie(Alexa Vega) and her friends, have a sleepover in a celebration of there last day Junior High. While there are having the time of there life. They all getting a sudden visit by the school mean girl named Staci(Sara Paxton) who presents them with a little scavenger hunt. With Staci and her gang. And thus begins a night of moments of misadventures. Enjoyable to say the least. It is basically up there with Mean Girls and New York Minute. This movie is just for pure enjoyment. But it is not still not for kids under 14.",/review/rw6166558/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2006,wheremyhustlasat,3," ""Sarcastically Hilarious!""
","This movie is a complete load of ""enchanting"" unrealistic crap. I get a wild kick out of bad movies and this one takes the cake for 2004. First of all the fat girl who they had to name ""Yancy"" to match her unattractive character (Kallie Flynn Childress), is not featured on the cover of the box because somehow American 14 year old girls won't relate with other chubby girls? Plus, when they sneak into the club while fatty waits outside, she's approached by a sweet heavy set charmer who is working on a gig there that night. Clearly in order for him to work in a bar, he has to be at least 21, which is of course is a perfectly acceptable age to hit on a 14 YEAR OLD GIRL! And while Joe Nussbaum is advocating pedophilia, why not condone the high school senior to fall in like with Julie (Alexa Vega), before she even attends his school. I remember in MY high school, only the coolest and most popular guys would court girls 4 years younger than them, as apposed to dating attractive mature girls their own age. Why stop at middle school Steve Faris, when there is plenty of kindergarten girls with your head shot tacked above they're bed surrounded by glittered hearts? If you're ready to play your home version of Mystery Science Theater 3K I HIGHLY recommend ""Sleepover"".",/review/rw6166558/?ref_=tt_urv

","I wasn't expecting much from ""sleepover"", other than Alexa Vega, so good in the ""Spy Kids"" movies for Robert Rodriguez, I didn't know anyone in the cast. So i found my self smiling, laughing and even nervous to see if Julie Corky (Vega) and her friends would win out.",/review/rw6166558/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2005,GreenRayEnt,8," A fun ""Tween"" movie....
","So many movies nowadays either have young kids acting too old, or old people pretending to be young. Sleepover is just an above average teenie-bopper movie with some really fun moments and nice performances by a talented young cast. This target audience doesn't have a lot of movies to be proud of, but Sleepover can definitely be considered a fun one. All of the performances seemed on the money. Alex Vega (Julie) and Scout Taylor-Compton (Farrah) seemed to shine. There are a couple of very funny scenes from Steve Carell who plays an over-the-top security guard looking to break up the girl's fun. I commend director Joe Nussbaum for tackling a difficult genre and age group, and doing a commendable job with it. Don't rent it expecting anything deep, but it certainly is a good time.",/review/rw6166558/?ref_=tt_urv

14 November 2007,Smells_Like_Cheese,5," I felt like I was watching a cheesy teen show on the Disney Channel
","I was bored one night and decided to go ahead and see what Sleepover was, it was on TV, figured it might not be so bad. Well, while it did live up to my expectations, I have to say for teens, this movie wasn't so bad. First off, the first time I saw Steve Carrel on the screen, I was like ""Is that Steve... no, it can't be. Why would he be in a movie like this?"", and it was him. But I guess we all have to start somewhere. He was an interesting person in the cast, but it's all good. Even though I didn't really like the film, it was worth the watch, I thought it was a good idea for the ""tweens"" as most people are calling this genre. I suppose who doesn't dream of a sleepover like this one? I mean it had everything, the girls had a date with their teacher(sounds sick, I know), messed with authority and got away with it, and got the guys.",/review/rw6166558/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2009,annevejb,10," A gun to blow my head off, so why rate it as 8 or 9 or 10? v1.02
","First impressions can be misleading. This seemed a fun romp, the sort of thing that gets labelled as girlie and which I tend to find addictive to the point of wanting to rate it as 10 or 9 or, in this case 8. This does not appear to have anything like the depth of Heathers or Clueless or Practical Magic, etc, so 10 felt wrong. It did not seem to be at the level of addictive sugar of lesser depth, so 9 felt wrong. Yet it is still addictive, to those who like this sort of girlie romp? ",/review/rw6166558/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2005,hockeyfreak101,1," Absolutely horrible.
","Wow. I must say, Sleepover is one of the absolute worst films I've ever seen in my whole life. Being a huge movie buff (I have a home theater system and I rent movies every Saturday night and go to one in the theaters every Friday night). Want to know why the film is so bad? Let's start off with the characters. Every single one of them is so shallow and one-dimensional. Julie, the main character, bitches about her perfect life, is self-absorbed and selfish, and is mean to her parents who just want to make her life better. Same with all the rest of the characters. The acting is just so bad it makes me sick. Alexa Vega has got as much acting ability as a Barbie doll, and the usually good Mika Boorem is awful as well. Sleepover also encourages bad behavior (the girls sneaking out of the house, sneaking into a bar, causing havoc in an Old Navy store). The plot has as much redeeming quality as a paper bag. Do 14/15 year old girls still listen to Spice Girls and go on scavenger hunts? Does it really matter that all this was to sit at the ""popular fountain""? And yes, you guessed it, the ending is that Julie gets the guy and wins a spot at the popular people's fountain. And, what's slightly disturbing is that the guy Julie gets is like, 18 or 17 while she is still like 14/15. In conclusion, AVOID Sleepover like the black plague.",/review/rw6166558/?ref_=tt_urv

5 March 2005,SpansonCrackle24,1," terrible
","Sleepover is by far the single most insulting movie I have seen since I stupidly rented Terror Toons from my local Blockbuster. I ordered Sleepover just to laugh at how bad it was, but this movie is no laughing matter. No, this movie isn't intended for the age group it is about. The truth is, no self-respecting fourteen year old would ever watch this movie for anything other than masochistic reasons. This stupid movie was just a get rich quick scam by the studio to cash in on the tween craze, a la other crap like the Lizzy Maguire Movie and Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen. These movies are an effort to sell, not to entertain. I can just imagine 8 year old girls watching this movie and thinking their so mature because they're watching a movie about girls in their early teens. This movie feeds them the same social stereotypes that they will no doubt feel the need to live up to, like the terrible rich blonde girl and the fat girl with the heart of gold. And no, in real life, no one would ever say ""Oh, for the love of carbs."" I only wish I could've given this movie a 0 instead of a 1. If you see this movie at a Blockbuster or at someone house, burn it, stomp on it, and eat the remains. You'll be doing the world a favor.",/review/rw6166558/?ref_=tt_urv
