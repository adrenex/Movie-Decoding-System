","For most of CODA's running time, I was enjoying it very much while at the same time thinking that it had a very safe, made for television movie vibe that was keeping it from greatness. But then there was that audition scene. If you've seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about. And from that moment forward, I was a mess. I'm obsessed with Emilia Jones's version of ""Both Sides Now"" on Spotify, and I'm already dreading the day I have to send my son off to college (he's 12, by the way).",/review/rw7227739/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2021,andrewchristianjr,9," I WASN'T GOING TO CRY, BUT THEN THEY DEPLOYED THE JONI MITCHELL.
","A captivating and heart-warming coming of age story, with a perfect, powerful and earnest performance from Emilia Jones. It does a fantastic job of expressing its themes of family and chasing your dreams, whilst balancing it with some hilarious comedic moments. A definitely must see.",/review/rw7227739/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2021,Xstal,9," Not Just Another Coming of Age Story...
","A hearing girl in a deaf family, restricted by her dynamic, silenced by her surroundings with potential and passion attenuated, battles to be heard, but oh what a song she finally sings - absolutely outstanding, with some of the finest, most sincere and most genuine performances you'll find. Take it to your heart and let it dwell.",/review/rw7227739/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2021,Gordon-11,," Beautiful
",This is a beautiful and heart warming film about a teenage girl in a marginalised family. I am very happy that someone made a film about the challenges of a marginalised and forgotten group.,/review/rw7227739/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2021,ThomasDrufke,9," Formulaic Yet Heartwarming
","There's nothing wrong with making a predictable and formulaic film, as long as you succeed in producing the emotion and reaction out of your audience. You can see where CODA is going, but it's so effective at what it does. There's a few laugh out loud moments (which I didn't expect) and the 3rd act is just as moving as films like Almost Famous and Sing Street, both movies with similar music/dream themes. There's something about those types of stories that appeal to me more than most people.",/review/rw7227739/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2022,lee_eisenberg,10," those with disabilities deserve our respect
","So far it's been rare to see deaf characters portrayed onscreen, let alone played by deaf actors. That makes Sian Heder's Academy Award-nominated ""CODA"" all the more important. Showing the challenges that a hearing daughter in a deaf family faces, it hits all the right notes (pun not intended).",/review/rw7227739/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2021,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,10," Best film I have seen this summer! (2021)
",This film has it all. It is hilariously funny. I hadn't laugh this much all summer long and this film really help my brain release the endorphins. My ribs hurt from laughing. The film has a tremendous amount of heart. This was a tear jerker by the end. All of the characters are so lovable and reliable. Watching Frank Rossi describe how to put a condom on in sign language to Miles was just ...agghhh amazing.,/review/rw7227739/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2021,sweidman-28016,8," A Delightful Movie For All
","As the opening for Sundance, CODA gave us a delightful story of a hearing child in a deaf family. She finds herself torn between pursuing her love of music and her family's reliance on her to be their connection to the outside world. I would like to say how much of a crowd pleaser this is. All of the reviews have come back positive saying this is the best opener since Whiplash. The performances are good all around. What got to me most is the family dynamic. It's something really heart-warming to watch that put a smile on my face the whole time. The comedy landed well throughout. The same goes for the drama. Sian Heder is a good director and we see the heart put into the movie. The story is where some of my issues came from. It follows a typical storyline that we've seen before in movies geared toward teens. It became predictable along the way and some of the scenes felt too good to be true. But I understand this isn't meant to be something to breakdown and analyze. All in all, this is meant to make us feel good and that's exactly what it did. I look forward to rewatching this again in the future.",/review/rw7227739/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2021,ferguson-6,8," dream a little dream
","Greetings again from the darkness. Ruby Rossi is a high school student. She is also a CODA - Child of Deaf Adults. Her older brother is deaf too, meaning Ruby's life has been spent as an interpreter for her family, while also working on the family fishing boat in Gloucester, Massachusetts, where they are treated as outcasts and viewed as oddities by others. Ruby also loves to sing and listen to music, activities she can't share with her family. This is no coming-of-age tale, as Ruby has long been wise beyond her years. It is, however, a story of a young person finding their true self and breaking from the ties that bind to the only life she's known.",/review/rw7227739/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2021,deloudelouvain,7," Ifyou liked La Famille Bélier you will like this one as well.
","The story of Coda is a bit cliché. Just by reading the ingredients you can already see where this movie is going. So no real surprises in Coda, you will exactly know the outcome way long before the ending. That said it's still an enjoyable movie to watch. A little bit emotional sometimes, which is almost normal as you feel compassion for the deaf people and certainly for the daughter that has a lot on her plate. Maybe a bit too much singing in my opinion but that's just because I'm not a big fan of singing in movies unless it's the music that I like but that's not likely to happen given my taste of music. Coda is predictable but it doesn't really matter as the acting is really good and that from the whole cast. Certainly worth a watch.",/review/rw7227739/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2022,info-90701,10," What a lovely, well crafted film!
","Every single fairly positive human emotion that could be called up in life, showed up in this film. It presented hope, frustration, ignorance, healthy responses to envy, love, support, family bonding and so much more. It truly was a delight to watch and feel a part of the growth of the main character. Her journey is truly one of courage as she finds her way through life.",/review/rw7227739/?ref_=tt_urv

24 March 2022,jdesando,," A worthy Oscar nominee. Powerful.
","Because CODA is an acronym for children of deaf adults, you'd expect the Oscar-nominated film of the same name to be about deafness. I'm here to tell you it is not, for it is above all about family challenges, teenage trials, and the power of education. While the central family of this romance is deaf, played mostly by deaf actors, with one exception, using ASL communication, the film's title is a metaphor for a story whose many layers reveal truths about life that transcend deafness.",/review/rw7227739/?ref_=tt_urv

27 June 2021,arizonaangels,," La Famille Bélier but American
","I could complain about how they felt the need to adapt a French movie from years ago... but I am just happy that this story gets to be shared with more people. Lovely story, coming off age, family relations. The resulting movie is a great feat, showing people a world they are not familiar with.",/review/rw7227739/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2022,SnoopyStyle,8," sweet and funny
","Ruby Rossi (Emilia Jones) is a Child of Deaf Adults. Her father Frank (Troy Kotsur), older brother Leo (Daniel Durant), and mother Jackie (Marlee Matlin) are all deaf. She is their interpreter and tries to protect them from the hearing world. She wakes up at 3 every morning to join the family fishing boat as the only hearing crew member. At school, she joins the choir and her teacher, Bernardo ""Mr. V"" Villalobos (Eugenio Derbez), takes an interest in her. She finds herself torn between helping her family at home or setting off into the world on her own.",/review/rw7227739/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2022,Tweetienator,4," Just Another Solid Remake
","The best movie of the year? CODA is in my opinion a solid movie, rather formulaic and slightly sleep inducing. Not the acting nor the story, really nothing makes CODA in my opinion special - don't get me wrong, CODA is no bad movie, a solid one, yes, but special? No. CODA is one of those coming of age feelgood movies you expect to watch on TV. The French-Belgian movie La Famille Bélier is not a masterpiece but the in my opinion the stronger one - so the best movie (according to the Academy) of 2022 is a remake produced for a streaming service. Nothing more to say.",/review/rw7227739/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2021,gshickler,10," The movie we need
",A window into a life most people do not know through the eyes of a wholesome girl trying to find herself. All the acting was very good but I was especially moved by the father and brother characters. Quarantine has numbed alot of feelings and this movie invites you to really feel. Thank you CODA!,/review/rw7227739/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2022,CubsandCulture,10," Might be my favorite film of this year-a film of great humanity and humor
","While the film leans a little too heavily into the (inaccurate) trope of Deaf people not understanding music how its story is executed with grace and humor results in a moving wonderful film. This is a universal story of a young woman learning to develop her own passions and chart her own course. It is also the story of family meeting the challenges of the world head on and how that can impact interpersonal relationships. It is *not* a film about how Deaf people are just so helpless or disadvantaged by society. This is a flesh and blood family-they fight, they deal with sexuality, they deal with friendships.",/review/rw7227739/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2022,Kirpianuscus,," inspired remake
","The first temptation is to define it as beautiful. Or touching. Or a manifesto, no ignoring the prize for Troy Kotsur. And it is it. But, more important, it is, behind comercial/ sentimental cliches, true in profound sense.",/review/rw7227739/?ref_=tt_urv

28 March 2022,dorMancyx,7," Really?
","I actually watched this film two months ago, but decided to not write a review because I felt it's not worth my time. Surprisingly, Coda was nominated for Oscar's best picture, and even more surprisingly, it freaking won - I legitimately thought that they had the wrong envelope again. The movie does have a detailed depiction of the hearing-impaired family's struggle in prejudice and inconvenience, shown in the great scene of the soundless concert. Additionally, Troy Kotsur and Marlee Matlin's performance of the sanguine but sentimental couple is exquisite and evocative. Besides that, I see no creativity anyhow in the main storyline. Typical high school girl who strives for a better life; male character who does nothing but dalliance; classic stern mentor with a soft heart. Protagonist explores her talent, she practices, she gets hindered, she overcomes, she experiences happy, she experiences sadness, she grows, end of story. I thought La La Land set standard for future movies about music and development, encouraging unique messages instead of cliche. Compared to all other nominated films, Coda feels just right, but from whence does the academy see it better than its fellow contenders?",/review/rw7227739/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2021,JasonMcFiggins,10," I loved every minute of this movie!
","CODA is hilarious and awkward and touching. Part coming of age story about finding your voice, part family drama, and all incredibly moving and effective. So rich and authentic, every scene will either make you laugh or make you cry. I felt my heart start to race about 30 minutes in, knowing I was experiencing something great. CODA is simply as beautiful as movies get. Emilia Jones will capture your heart, and it's remarkable how effortlessly she carries this movie. Keep an eye on her, she's about to break out.",/review/rw7227739/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2021,SleepingMorpheus,9," Endearing and Delightful
","This movie on the surface looks like any other coming of age movie about a girl from a troubled family. But I assure you, its anything but that. CODA follows Ruby as the only hearing person in the deaf family with a beautiful singing voice. We follow along as she struggles with the decision to stay and help her poor family's business or follow her singing dreams.",/review/rw7227739/?ref_=tt_urv
