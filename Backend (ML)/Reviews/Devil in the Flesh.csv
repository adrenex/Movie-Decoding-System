8 December 2002,dromasca,9," Original, Brilliant Richard
","This is one of the movies you remember for a long time - and for all the good reasons. Transplanting Shakespeare in a different time and giving his historical plots a modern political sense is not such a new idea. What is really strong and works well here is the perfect fit between the characters as Shakespeare intended them and the background which is so different from the original historical one. Each one of the characters is both shakespearian as intended, a perfect citizen of the fictional time created by the director - a fascist England in the 30s - and more than everything else a human being: sensual, hating and loving as only humans do.",/review/rw0369864/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2000,alfa-16,," Brilliantly thought out, superbly played and totally gripping
","I'm not always comfortable with Shakespeare in modern dress, nor with Ian McKellen's apparent assumption of the mantle of Olivier and Gielgud. Neither did I think that anything could top the experience of seeing Antony Sher play the role on the 500th anniversary of the Battle of Bosworth.",/review/rw0369864/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2006,OttoVonB,10," Justice made to Richard III
","""Richard III"" may not have the all-encompassing understanding of uman nature seen in ""Hamlet"" or the grace and mastery of ""The Tempest"", but for my money is one of the greatest plays ever written and certainly Shakespeare's most entertaining. ",/review/rw0369864/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2006,mstomaso,7," Shakespearean tragedy in 1940s Europe
","This film sets Shakespeare's Richard III in an alternative to WWII era England, where fascists and royalists maintain their own militias and play power games with kings and thrones. The first scene sets the tone for the entire film. A young officer is settling down to dinner with his dog chewing on a bone nearby. The building begins to shake and a low rumbling is heard. Soon enough, a tank erupts through the fireplace and stormtroopers charge in automatic rifles ablaze. Ian McKellan removes his gas mask and spouts a few lines of Shakespearean dialog.",/review/rw0369864/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2000,JMartin-2,," An unfairly maligned interpretation
","From the very first Shakespeare film (a silent version of ""King John,"" of all things), filmmakers have sought to impose their own unique visions on Shakespeare; in the case of ""King John,"" it was fairly simple (a scene of John signing the Magna Carta, which isn't in Shakespeare's play). Ever since, Shakespeare adaptations have faced the difficulty of remaining true to the greatest writer in the history of the English language while bringing something new to the table; filmed plays, after all, belong on PBS, not in the cinema.",/review/rw0369864/?ref_=tt_urv

20 June 2005,vfrickey,9," See Olivier's ""Richard III,"" then this one
","There are two definitive film productions of Richard III: - Sir Laurence Olivier's 1955 film version, which he directed and in which he plays the title role, supported by Sir Cedric Hardwicke as King Edward, Sir John Gielgud as Clarence, the delectable Claire Bloom as the Lady Anne and a host of other brilliant performers - and Ian McKellen's 1995 version, screenwritten by McKellen and director Richard Loncraine, in which McKellen also plays the title role.",/review/rw0369864/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2005,pekinman,8," The update to WW2 era works well
","I think updating Shakespeare's plays to more modern eras can be a good idea, but attempts quite often fail due to ""modernizing"" of the original text into the current vernacular, adding modern slang terms and modern pop-political slants and such things. Happily, Richard Loncraine's version of 'Richard III' works very well, being set in a surreal WW2 era setting, more reminiscent of Terry Gilliam's 'Brazil' than London as it actually was at that time; an alternative world is suggested which adds a touch of nightmare-fantasy to the film.",/review/rw0369864/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 1999,Doctor_Bombay,," Delightful contemporary turn of a classic piece of literature.
","When I see how wonderful this Richard III is, it immediately makes me question what in the world has Kenneth Branagh been doing all these years? Certainly nothing as imaginative, as provocative as this.",/review/rw0369864/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2006,timdalton007,10," A Modern Classic
","When it comes to updates of the plays by William Shakespeare, Richard III is probably the best of the lot. While it might seem like an unusual concept to take the classic play of deceit, betrayal, seduction, and cold-blooded murder out of the 1400's and into an alternate history 1930's version of England, the cast and production designs make that concept seem not only believable but so realistic you might find yourself wondering if this could really have happened if events had played out like they do in the film.",/review/rw0369864/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2005,ib011f9545i,9," wonderful,great looking
","I am surprised how many people seem to hate this film. I am not a Shakespeare expert,but I love history and the 1930s and 1940s are my favourite period,so I love the way the our odd Royal Family is shown in this film,we know that members of the royal family were pro fascist in the 1930s so why not update the original story. The locations and the production design are great and the acting is impressive throughout. As for the comment about the murder in bed,it seems like a good plan to me,if you were busy with a flight attendant you are not going to notice an assassin under the bed. If you have not seen this I urge you to do so,you can watch it as a war movie or as a version of the play.",/review/rw0369864/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2005,TheNorthernMonkee,8," superb modern translation
","SPOILERS Every year the Royal Shakespeare Company produces some wonderful performances of the bards plays. With an entire catalogue of actors, the company has produced some of (if not all) of Britain's best actors for decades now. One of these actors is Sir Ian McKellen, and one year while touring as Richard III, Sir Ian had the idea to write a modern twist on the tale. Relocating the story of the evil, disfigured king to a fictional 1930's Fascist Britain, McKellen has produced a sublime piece of cinema with top notch acting and some great cinematography.",/review/rw0369864/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2012,TheLittleSongbird,9," I thought it was excellent...
","Granted, this Richard III is not for everybody due to the updated setting. However, I am not one of those who says that any adaptation that doesn't stick to the original setting and such is immediately rubbish. I do find that approach unfair, and have always thought considering that we are talking about different mediums here that adaptations should be judged on their own terms. Because on its own terms, this Richard III is excellent, not as good as Olivier's film but then again it is always a tough act to come up with something equal to film as amazing as Olivier's.",/review/rw0369864/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2016,SnoopyStyle,7," classic play in new settings
","The classic William Shakespeare play is reimagined with the world of WWII marrying a British monarchy. The rebel York family fights to put eldest son Edward (John Wood) onto the throne. His army is led by his youngest brother Richard (Ian McKellen) of Gloucester. After winning the war, Richard maneuvers his older brother Clarence into the Tower. Then he woos Lady Anne (Kristin Scott Thomas) after killing her husband and her father during the war. Edward is ill and Richard spreads the rumor that Queen Elizabeth (Annette Bening) is the one who had Clarence killed. He schemes to take out anyone on his quest for the throne.",/review/rw0369864/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2018,lee_eisenberg,10," Ian McKellen gets the role of his life
","Ian McKellen has been one of the most versatile actors for many years. One of his most pronounced roles was in this adaptation of William Shakespeare's ""Richard III"". Taking place in a fictional version of 1930s England, it depicts Richard as a fascist wannabe dictator. His flags and rallies look like something right out of Nazi Germany.",/review/rw0369864/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2017,rmax304823,6," He Can Murder While He Smiles.
","I've avoided Shakespeare in modern settings. Before this I'd only watched Olivier's version and read the play. And, I regret to say that all the way through this film the setting -- 1930s ""Germany"" -- was a bit of a distraction. You have never seen so many people smoking cigarettes. What saved the movie was the performances. Ian McKellen is far more a rude lump of foul deformity than Olivier ever even suggested and his performance as the central figure is superb, all squinched up, skinny and ugly. Richard the Turd, some have called him.",/review/rw0369864/?ref_=tt_urv

21 September 2011,classicalsteve,5," Despite Compelling Aspects and Amazing Acting, It's Not Shakespeare
","King Richard III didn't live in the 1930's, and William Shakespeare didn't write in the 20th century. This historical figure lived in the the late Middle Ages, and Shakespeare wrote in the very late 16th and early 17th centuries near the end of the Renaissance. To snatch an historical figure 600 years out of his historical context and a corresponding play 450 years out of its theatrical and artistic context I believe loses the entire point of Shakespeare's original play. Taking bona fide masterpieces of theater and setting them down into another period is certainly in vogue these days, and victims have included other masterworks, including those by Wolfgang Mozart/da Ponte and even Richard Wagner. It is a practice I question, if only to say they simply are not the original works as intended by the artist-creators. They may be compelling and interesting but exist as a new work with elements of the original but they are NOT equivalent to the original. In this case, Richard III is set in the early 20th century during the period when the Nazis ruled Germany.",/review/rw0369864/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2015,GusF,," A brilliant film which offers fresh insight into both the play and some of the worst moments of the 20th Century
","As I said in my review of Laurence Olivier's 1955 film version, ""Richard III"" is my least favourite of the Shakespearean plays with which I am familiar as I don't think that its language and exploration of themes are on the same level as his best work such as ""Hamlet"" or ""Macbeth"". When it came to the Olivier film, I think that he forgot that he was a great actor and director while he was making it as his performance is too over the top and hammy and his direction is pedestrian. He failed to live up to the high standards that he set for himself on both fronts in ""Henry V"" and ""Hamlet"". Thankfully, this is a far, far superior version which has served to increase my appreciation for the play. As with most Shakespearean films, it makes changes to the play, the Bard's longest after ""Hamlet"". It only incorporates about half of the text, conflates several characters, cuts out others and reorders some of the events. At only 100 minutes, it's a very fast paced film.",/review/rw0369864/?ref_=tt_urv

5 September 2010,crooow-2,7," Not as good as the Olivier version
","First the good: the movement to modern neo-fascism was interesting, the twist on many of the speeches was fascinating (which is one of the pleasures of re-doing Shakespeare - viz. the interpretation), McKellen is great, and most of the supporting cast is solid.",/review/rw0369864/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2000,tedg,," An Uninteresting Failure
","I am appreciative of film and Shakespeare both. The problems of transporting the plays, essentially minimal and cerebral, to moving images are daunting and I appreciate a novel attempt. Even if it fails, it is likely to fail interestingly. Of Shakespeare's plays, the comedies are about situations, the tragedies about ideas. Neither of those translates well to film. But the histories, lesser plays in my opinion, are about characters. Now, character exploration is inherently cinematic, a natural for the screen. especially with as many speeches to the camera, confidences with the audience, this play provides.",/review/rw0369864/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 1999,scout-15,," Brilliant!!! But traditionalists be warned...
","I just rented this again for the 4th time.  Maybe I should just buy myself a copy. It's among my top five movies of all time and perhaps my favorite Shakespeare adaptation.  It's stunning, brilliant, and beautiful. If you like your Shakespeare with every forsooth and thee and thou spoken by actors poncing around in doublets, you'll want to avoid it.  If you're a bit more daring, rent it.  For the unbelievably gorgeous costumes and sets.  For the modern fascist spin that gives the whole thing disturbing contemporary relevance.  But most of all for the performances--from McKellan's mesmerizing turn as Richard to Nigel Hawthorne's sweet and simple Duke of Clarence.  Even the smaller roles are perfectly cast. I enjoyed Adrian Dunbar's sadistic assassin, Domenic West's dashing Richmond, and Robert Downey Jr. as the playboy Earl Rivers.  Annette Bening, I must say, is terrible as Queen Elizabeth.  Completely unconvincing down to her wandering pseudo-aristocratic accent.  I keep imagining her betters tittering with embarrassment every time the lesser-light Bening exited the ""stage.""  A minor flaw, however, in a stunning movie.  Rent it.  Again and again!",/review/rw0369864/?ref_=tt_urv
