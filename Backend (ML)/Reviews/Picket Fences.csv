3 August 2008,Sleepin_Dragon,10," The best comedy of recent Years!!!!
","This has to be the most underrated and forgotten about 'MASTERPIECE' that has ever come out of the BBC, writers Craig Cash and Phil Mealey crerated something absolutely wonderful here with this one. Why on Earth did this not get more coverage and no further series, Criminal, the characters were all thoroughly believable and lovable!!! Jean and Winnie's dailogues are just the most funny thing I have ever seen, incredible. But the line of Eddie and Tommy speaking about Joan's driving test, wot sign would you expect to see on a narrow country lane answer 'fresh farm eggs for sale' absolute genius. I can see the same fate happening to the current series 'The Visit' very similar and again wonderfully fantastic, why aren't these on bbc on prime spots instead of rubbish like 'after you've gone and green green grass!!! Please someone read this and take note. To the regiment!!! I wish i was there, a real gem of comedy, with a hint of heart warming drama running through it as well",/review/rw0923100/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2008,Dodger-9,10," An outstanding piece of work
","This is easily one of the best sitcoms of the 21st century. Penned by Craig Cash and Phil Mealey, the ensemble cast do wonders with the script, and even though Eddie (Mark Benton) hammers a gag home to the point of annoyance, the effect doesn't detract from the series. The first run was beautifully handled by director Adrian Shergold, and while the second didn't boast the same gorgeous photography, Craig Cash ensured it was as rib tickling and as poignant. The rest of the cast are wonderful. Christine Bottomley is a ray of sunshine, while John Henshaw gives a sublime performance as her adoptive dad. Although there was no Christmas special or a third series, at least fans were left wanting more instead of wishing cast and crew hadn't milked the format dry. To the regiment! You'll wish you were there.",/review/rw0923100/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2016,MUFCOK,9," A hidden gem that is vastly overlooked and underrated.
","Set solely in a Northern Boozer in Manchester, Early Doors is a sitcom with a small selection of witty characters. It is a fly on the wall type show which is packed full with realism, witty dialogue and lovable, complete characters who all add something special to the show. It is one of the most relaxing shows I have ever seen and at 3 hours per season, time will fly by without you noticing whatsoever.",/review/rw0923100/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2006,hywel_davies_1,," Another criminally ignored gem
","Why is it that every comedy now has to either have some ""incredibly original"" gimmick, or be extremely vulgar, or both, to hit it big? This consigns near-masterpieces like Early Doors to the slops bucket of TV history. Yes, as many observe, little happens in the course of the half hour, but you certainly don't even think about that when you're watching it. Cash and Mealey's genius is to realise that everybody's lives are generally repetitive, and so they are likely to have the same discussion in the same refuge every day. This is never treated with a hint of irony, but genuine warmth for the old school pubs that Ken and his lost bretheren run. Lacklustre shows like The Smoking Room and Little Britain, so pleased with themselves and determined to run down the losers, halfwits and layabouts of this world, would do well to learn from this and find that happiness is in whatever routine you, not society, carves out for you.",/review/rw0923100/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2007,he312,10," Just like to mirror what's been said...
","I watched both series on the BBC and now own the DVD's. A well crafted comedy with what I would consider instantly likable characters. To pick out one character, would be a dis-service, as all shine. I believe the key to good comedy is the relationship on and off camera between the actors and it's a delight to watch the out-takes on the DVD, must have been a joy to go to work everyday.",/review/rw0923100/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2003,glen the lad,," a gem
","I had the fortune of catching season one before I returned to the states. I told my friends about it ""oh it's the uk version of cheers then?"" well no, I don't remember sam talking a pee with the door open or norm and cliff talking about having bit on the side. Some might find it a bit boring but me I could have watched until closing time. 10/10 pure (working) class",/review/rw0923100/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2004,lamps,10," Ken is the King
",This show is just about as good as TV gets. To watch it and suddenly realize 30 minutes have elapsed invariably surprises me. It is just about the most relaxing TV I have ever seen.,/review/rw0923100/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2004,missmarmite,," Even great for non-Britons!
","The other day I went to my special little video shop again to get some nice DVD for the evening in and found Early Doors sitting on the shelf. I had never heard about it, I didn't know the actors and feared I wouldn't be able to understand the northern dialect. But I rented it nevertheless (there were subtitles, they convinced me, because the mere sound of a Yorkshire dialect is beautiful, but I also want to know what they say) and was interest what Early Doors would be.",/review/rw0923100/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2006,Tudor_rose,10," Brilliant! A must-see!
","Early Doors is laugh-out-loud funny, tender, heartwarming, exasperating, fascinating, at times even a little disgusting, this television series has everything anybody could want, and more. From the very first episode of the first series you take the cast to your hearts and want to know more about what the community, collectively and individually, get up to next. The main takes place in Ken's pub (the landlord) and the comings and goings of this 'small world' (the theme tune taken from Roddy Frame's debut album Surf) are not to be missed. The characters are all so very real and this snapshot of working class northern life is a real gem...you can't fail to fall in love with it! Enjoy! :)",/review/rw0923100/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2006,chrismoconnor,10," It's far from fiction!
","Caught this by chance when first on BBC2 ages ago and now have become Eddiesque with my non stop quotes. The beauty is its simplicity, a pub full of half wits and cretins talking rubbish about things of no consequence i.e exactly what a good pub should be! Ken topping the branded spirits up with cheap tat, Duffy with his Polaroids, Eddie and his jury service and perhaps my favourite Tommy during Melanies 21st birthday with his table in the toilets, Ken; Are you coming out when she cuts the cake, or do you want her to bring it in here? Tommy; P*** off!Possibly only modern comedy (Gervais being a possible exception) that can make me cry laughing. Heard rumours of a third series with the second being shown on BBC1 in August 06, I wait for more tales of temporary traffic lights at the junction of Burdall Lane, by McVities. Sheer 100% genius",/review/rw0923100/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2006,tings72,," I want more!
","I love Early Doors! Every character is so complete and every one of them each have their moment of the comic genius. Some of my favourites are of the cleaner, Winnie, winding up Jean - especially the scene where she's winding Jean up about her husband going to court for 'allegedly' being too familiar with the barmaids.",/review/rw0923100/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2006,wingedeel,10," To the regiment!
","I caught up with this series late in the day, it was not promoted too heavily by the BBC, quite obviously. However, I have both DVDs and can honestly say this is one of the best situation comedies ever. I suppose the easiest way to describe it is to say, take The Royle Family and set it in a pub. But this show surpasses its predecessor by a mile. There are so many deft touches with the characters and the comedy. All of the players are superb (and many have now gone on to mainstream roles in other TV programmes presumably because of their performances here). And you would find it hard to find sharper writing anywhere else on TV. As with many shows, the formula is to have themes that develop over the series. There is the bitter-sweet story of Melanie finding her biological father. Ken's romancing of Tania. The two dodgy coppers, Phil and Nige. Duffy's marital problems. Whenever Eddie and Joan embark on one of their stories you know you are in for a treat. Some of the best TV comedies do not get the attention they deserve (Seinfeld, Larry Sanders) in the UK. Do yourself a favour and borrow, buy or rent the first series. You will be buying the second and giving them as gifts to your friends for Christmas!",/review/rw0923100/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2023,adruggan,10," Marvelous show
","Given this is back on the BBC Iplayer I thought it worth a review. TBF it's always been worth a review. Firstly it's amazing to think there were only 12 episodes of this show. It seems much more however that has to go down the the great writing and acting. Set in a tiny English pub the stories of the various characters intermingle to great comic effect. Every character has their part to play however the interplay between Ken the bar owner and his Mum is comedy gold. There is also a great deal of pathos in the human situations displayed in this setting. So much to bring a ""tear tae a gless ee"" as the saying goes. It really is an undiscovered gem and great to see the BBC giving some recognition to one of their best products in the last 25 years. To the Regiment! I wish I was there.",/review/rw0923100/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2021,peterrichboy,10," The best sitcom that no one has seen
",Written by Phil Medley and Craig Cash of the Royle family. Early Doors is very much in the same vein a look at drool northern humour this time in a pub as opposed to the front room. The main difference being Royle Family was never this good. The pub setting gives a wider scope for different character's each with there own individual trait.,/review/rw0923100/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2005,Sulla-2,," ""To the Regiment !!""
","For some reason which is not really explained the Licencee Ken, who is an excellent character, shouts this in every episode and anyone withing hearing replies, "" I wish I was there "" Unfortunately this class comedy has only been shown on BBC 2, a minor terrestrial channel. It deserves showing on the main BBC 1 channel so that the British public can fully appreciate it. It will then get the credit it so richly deserves. Others have accurately described the programme so I think i should comment on the two Policemen who scive in the back room of the pub. I don't know what the Police Force is like these days but a few years ago these two officers, although a little OTT, would be more representative of normal Policemen than in all specialist Police programmes.",/review/rw0923100/?ref_=tt_urv

19 January 2022,gazharperphotos,10," A wonderfully understated piece of televisual genius!
","The most underrated comedy ever written. I loved the coppers in this, especially their line ""I ain't going up that end of town, Ken. It's bloody dangerous up there!""",/review/rw0923100/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2021,sam_muleadams,9," A bona-fide classic
","This show epitomises the calculated use of British restraint. Not one moment is wasted. Each character, in almost a sentence is drawn with detail and care. Quite rightly this has 'cult classic' written all over it. But it deserves full masterpiece. Like pulling on your favourite old overcoat. The comfort. You'll wish you were there.",/review/rw0923100/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2021,garyjamesford,10," Slow burning genius comedy
","This has to be one of the greatest comedies ever written. Sharp northern English wit tied in with flawed but beautiful characters, gives this series (of which there are 2) a charm above most. In a similar style to the Royle family and written by part of the same team it takes a couple of episodes to get into - but is well worth the watch. You can hear or spot something new every time you watch it. Coming from Stockport many of the points that the comedy touches on as well as the character styles resonate so close to home.",/review/rw0923100/?ref_=tt_urv

22 July 2003,paul sloan,," Time, Gentlemen Please
","I really wanted to like this. Much of it is good and the cast are all very able and convincing as the characters that they play.John Henshaw who plays Ken the landlord was fantastic as Roy in The Cops and here he seizes the part with both hands and shines throughout.However, much of this series was boring and repetitive. From Episode 1 we know Tommy is mean and miserable,the lazy cops always call, Eddie is obsessed with temporary traffic lights,Ken's mother is insane and a total gossip  and so on.There was a kind of sub plot running through the series about Ken's daughter meeting her natural father but this threatened to get all emotional and out of step with the humour.The last episode where the pub regulars have a lad's day out was hilarious.Not in the same league as the Royle Family which Craig Cash also co-wrote but despite its failings it is still streets ahead of much of the guff that claim to be sitcoms on UK TV.",/review/rw0923100/?ref_=tt_urv
