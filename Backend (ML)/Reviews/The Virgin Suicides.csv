","I'll start by stating that I'm a 62 year old white male. I did not grow up in the South - but I did live for a year in Louisiana in the early 70's. I lived through every news event that was portrayed in the movie - that is, I saw and read about them in the actual news when these things happened. Many posters on the boards say that the movie is inaccurate. Then they go on to say things like: His name was changed, he didn't have 2 sons, he didn't look anything like Forest Whitaker, Nixon was miscast, etc. True, the details of The Butler's family life have been dramatized. That is called movie making. The movie was historically accurate in every important way. I don't say that every single detail was true, nor am I saying the portrayal of these historical events was 100% exactly as portrayed. But it is far more accurate (and important) than your average popcorn POS that pervades the theaters these days. I want to state that I have rarely, if ever, been as emotionally affected by any movie. It is brilliant, provocative, artistic, and has a social purpose. Like it or not, persons of African descent have been victimized, downtrodden, brutalized, persecuted, tortured, lynched, raped, and murdered - and only because of their skin color. HOORAY to Lee Daniels for making this movie! Hooray to Forest for being a sensitive, intelligent, highly gifted actor. Hooray to Oprah, whose performance is beyond stellar. Hooray to anyone involved with this movie. Not to say that ALL movies have to take you to the places that this movie does. I guess there is a place for Pacific Rim and Wolverine. So if you think that movies have no business delving into our racist and brutal history, then see one of those movies. But to say that this movie is irrelevant or inaccurate - well, as I said I lived through it all. It is not. What it is, is an exceptional, mature movie for those that want a little more than monsters (the fictional kind). My wife and I went through a whole packet of tissues - we were blubbering like fools. BRAVO!!!!! 9 (rather than 10) stars only because the 10 star reviews are often discounted as over- the-top hero worship. But if Ironman, The Avengers, etc are 10 stars (and I liked those), this movie rates 100 stars - because it is 10X better, more important, more relevant, and more thought provoking.",/review/rw2859197/?ref_=tt_urv

","Some years ago a television mini-series was made from Lillian Rogers Parks' memoir Backstairs At The White House where Leslie Uggams as the White House maid and author of the book chronicled here years from Taft to Eisenhower serving the various first families. The Butler kind of continues the saga as we see life in the White House from Eisenhower through Reagan from the perspective of Cecil Gains, a White House butler. We also get a view of the history of the times as it effects the Gains family. ",/review/rw2859197/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2014,g-bodyl,9," The Civil Rights Movement!
","Lee Daniel's The Butler is an excellent, powerful film about a black man who served his country in times of racial trouble. The film is about the tension between blacks and whites and how the Civil Rights Movement changed the world for the better as equality is promoted. The film is strikingly powerful in every way and my only complaint is regarding the choppy editing. But the large ensemble cast is fantastic and so is the screenplay. People may perceive this film as propaganda, and I believe it is. But this is propaganda telling the world that everyone is equal, not just the white folks.",/review/rw2859197/?ref_=tt_urv

","Greetings again from the darkness. So many personalities! Yes, there are a staggering number of characters played by a who's who of actors, but it's the movie itself that flashes the most personalities.

17 August 2013,herbqedi,8," The Butler has two faces and excellent acting
","In the first 15 minutes spanning 30 years, the title character learns the hard way how to cope in white man's world by having two faces and being quietly competent and otherwise invisible. He does this so well he lands in the White House. He is successful at building functional but not fully honest relationships. This goes for his work relationships and for his home relationships. Unsaid is that he never has had an honest relationship with himself and his own feelings. That leaves his wife needing more and not knowing what or why, so she turns to alcohol. That is the underlying story that Lee Daniels tells by not telling it explicitly just as The Butler never could communicate explicitly even to himself what really has meaning to him or who he is - he just copes and dutifully does his jobs and raises his own family the best ways he knows how. His son Louis is the opposite and expresses loudly and at great personal consequence, his thoughts, feelings, pains, and emotions. The Butler's internal defense network and coping mechanisms preclude his ability to accept Louis in this way. Charles, on the other hand, is the dutiful son who loves his country and dies serving it in Vietnam. At the same tine the Butler is a dutiful and responsible but aloof observer in his own life, he is doing the same at the White House. He observes remarkable things but is always cognizant that he must not show it - he is invisible and competent. Period. ",/review/rw2859197/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2013,B24,7," Ho-hum
","A great and talented cast is largely thrown away on a script that starts and stops relentlessly. As one who has lived through all the historical periods portrayed, I was regrettably bored by large segments of the narrative, which seemed didactic in the extreme. That is not to diminish its important social and cultural significance to a younger audience, only that I personally found all the Presidents as played much smaller than in life than I remember them. Robin Williams as Eisenhower and Alan Rickman as Reagan seemed oddly miscast, though John Cusack as Nixon caught the essence of the man nicely. The parts showing home life among the main characters was a highlight, however.",/review/rw2859197/?ref_=tt_urv

16 August 2013,nancy45,4," Title Is Misleading
","I was hoping to see a movie about the butler and his experiences in The White House. I'm sure he had a lot of interesting stories to tell and a lot of very interesting experiences in his many years in The White House. Yes, the movie was about a butler to some degree, but it was more about the civil rights movement and the evil white man. I would love to know more about the butler. I would love to have seen his experiences with the presidents the movie skipped over. I think in real life he must have been more interesting than he was portrayed. I also did not like the liberties the movie took with the real butler's life. He spoke of no horrible event on the cotton fields as a child. He had one son, not two. His son, who is still alive, was not a militant. His wife did not have a drinking problem, nor did she have an affair. Why add unnecessary drama? This movie will win awards because of its self righteousness, but not because it's that deserving.",/review/rw2859197/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'd first like to say that Forest Whitaker is a brilliant actor. Had it not been for his artful presence and emotion, this would have been a flop. He deserves 10 stars; the film does not. I'd like to say first that this is not a biopic. There is no Cecil Gaines that worked at the White House. None. This story is loosely (very loosely) based on Eugene Allen who worked at the White House for 34 years. He was from Virginia, never worked in a field, never saw his mother violated nor his father murdered, and did not have a son killed in Vietnam.

19 August 2013,cultfilmfan,8," Lee Daniels' The Butler
","When, I first walked out of the theatre for Lee Daniels' The Butler, I have to say that I was overall very impressed with the film and was thinking of how, when I eventually went to review the film, that I would give it a perfect, if not very high rating for my reviews on this site. I didn't write my review immediately after I saw the film and that was probably a good thing. I say this because as I thought of the film over a course of a couple of days, I found myself having some major problems with the film and some things with it just did not sit comfortably with me. The film which claims is based on a true story is only very loosely based on a true story with a lot of the events in the film being embellished, if not totally made up by the film's screenwriter Danny Strong. I think the main problem I had with the film was it's bias which screamed out blatantly clear after I saw the film and thought about it for awhile. The main character of Cecil Gaines, serves under many presidents while being the butler at the White House. He goes from Eisenhower all the way to Reagan. It shows Cecil's different interactions with the many different presidents, but one thing that I picked up was that all the democratic presidents such as Kennedy, are really portrayed in a very good way. They are shown as caring, empathetic and really wanting what is best for the country. However all the republican presidents are shown in a much harsher if not critical way. They are often shown as irritable, coarse and rough along the edges as well as the film subtly shows that some of their responses and decisions on how to deal with world events at that time were foolish and that more or less, they did not always know what was best for America, and perhaps maybe they did not know what they were doing. There did seem to be a favouring bias towards the democratic presidents. Then we get to the last ten to fifteen minutes of the film, where I thought what I was watching was almost pure propaganda and a huge endorsement by everyone involved with the making of The Butler. It involves the 2008 presidential election and it's star candidate who eventually won that election, but also was re-elected for a second term last November. Now, I am not trying to take political sides here, but just in the last several minutes how the film idolizes this president and makes it look like all the oppression and hurdles that the African American people struggled with over the years has now come to an end because America has just elected it's first African American president. Please don't take my words out of context, or think that what I am saying is racially motivated, or based on hate, because it is not. I understand how many difficulties the African Americans went through over the years with slavery, segregation, racism and terror and violence based on hatred from others on something as foolish as how someone looks. I totally and completely get that. I also get that in the eyes of many, having an African American being elected president of the United States of America, is a big deal and in a way it shows that America has come a long way as a country and hopefully with this decision it means more tolerance towards African Americans, but everyone else as well. I completely grasp and comprehend that this was an important and history defining moment. To comment on whether I am a supporter of Barack Obama, is neither here nor there and it is not relevant and has nothing to do with this review. What, I am saying is while I can totally see how this event seems to have made up for all the injustices and wrongs, I felt that it did not work in this film and it felt overly sentimental and like a political endorsement, especially seeing as he is still in office. In the film Cecil Gaines, is not a political person and he does not take sides with any of the presidents, or their decisions, but for a film about a person who is apolitical, how did the final product become so political and endorse our current president as well as toot the democratic parties horn with support? This was my main problem with the film because it felt like a commercial and a paid endorsement by the cast and crew and the film unfortunately suffers for it. However there is still a lot of good in The Butler as well. The cast and crew all do phenomenal acting jobs, the script while it does have it's problems which I mentioned above, is for the most part compelling and extremely entertaining. The film has tragic and hard to watch moments, but also moments of lightness and humour and they are balanced well. The direction and attention to detail for the time is all credible here as well. Lee Daniel's The Butler is still a very good film, but if it hadn't decided to shoot it's mouth off as a political endorsement it would have been much better and my rating of it much higher.",/review/rw2859197/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2013,aharmas,3," The World is Not Black and White
","When I first heard about this film, I was excited because of the premise of being an eye witness inside the most powerful site in the Western world, a silent observant who was part of a group undergoing a multitude of social and psychological changes. His interaction with the various leaders during the period he worked there couldn't have been more interesting or relevant, and when you heard who was being cast, you waited anxiously for a classic to be created. It was an inspired plan. The reality is that ""The Butler"" comes across as something very simplistic, with very few shades between two different worlds. It turns out to be a bit of a disappointment, with a few, very small diamonds thrown in there.",/review/rw2859197/?ref_=tt_urv
