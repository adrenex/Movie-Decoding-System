13 October 2021,hughjman,10," 10 for the old series, 1 for the reboot
","The old series was excellent. Groundbreaking for its time, not just because 2 lead characters were gay, but for its intelligent wit. Like Cheers before it, it raised the bar for sitcoms.",/review/rw1706964/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2005,nycritic,," Classic Sit-Com Who Broke Grounds,but Lost its Touch Along the Way.
","Who would have thought that a show with not one, but two gay leads would hit the TVs across America and ensure its place among must-see TV Thursdays (albeit being shown Tuesdays in its first season and eventually displacing FRASIER) while also garnering critical reviews and numerous Emmys? WILL AND GRACE came and un-intentionally filled the void that ELLEN and her gay oriented sitcom left, keeping the sexuality quietly placed in the background while focusing on the quartet's dysfunctional and often crazy antics (except for some truly clever in-jokes that only gay men and women could catch). Fast moving dialogue, truly innovative slapstick and a balanced out cast created one of the best shows in the last five years, one that had an interesting DICK VAN DYKE SHOW feel, and even if the first season was a little bit clunky at times and some of the comedic situations seemed clearly forced for laughs, it worked.",/review/rw1706964/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2003,emily_16,," Good show!
","I like this show and do you know what?  I'm reading some of these comments and they are being way too picky, because though Jack's character is stereotypical, and Will never has a boyfriend, I think it's a show that makes you laugh, and that's what it has set out to do.  Don't analyze it. It's a comedy with a great script and great actors.  Karen and Jack are great, but Debra Messing and Eric McCormack do a wonderful job too, and what I like about Debra is that she is her, and probably won't change that.  Most stars who are flat would have huge plastic knockers by now, but she takes pride in her chest!  Good for her!  Watch it.  It's funny, and you'll find yourself wrapped up in the friendships, romances and Jack.  Just Jack!",/review/rw1706964/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2010,applenia88,10," I've grown up with this show!
","Will & Grace represents the essence of my teens. I've been watching that show over and over and I've never got bored. Even now I can see the same episode like fifteen times it will make me laugh as if it was the first. The subject was very delicate when they first aired on TV. Homosexuality wasn't and still, alas, isn't something to talk about in television...of course I'm talking about my country. I hope that in America things are becoming different. Anyway.....The writing is exceptional and the cast is flawless. Sean Hayes (simply spectacular) sometimes brings me to tears for laughing and Mullally's performances are beyond acting...I can't even look at her anymore without seeing Karen Walker! Eric McCormack is the perfect Will. It's such a difficult character...the thread of the story actually, always keeping everything together. And my total admiration goes to Debra Messing. I knew her in other series (prey was great!) and movies, and she's a very good actress...but Grace is just a masterpiece! All messy and sooo gross! But still tender and full of love and true... I highly recommend this sitcom to those who accidentally didn't get the chance to see it....It's part of television history now! Two thumbs up!",/review/rw1706964/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2002,metalgoth,," Great show, great cast, great writing
","Will & Grace is a great show and will continue to be so even after its gay theme loses its novelty.  The writing is usually great, sometimes exceptional, the hour long flashback episode was the best thing I saw in the 2000/2001 TV season.  But I would credit the cast most of all.  Eric McCormack is (comparatively) subtle and nuanced as Will, Megan Mullally bizarre and sharp as Karen, but I reserve my highest praise for Debra Messing and Sean Hayes.  Hayes' Jack is endlessly energetic, always plotting, and watching Hayes' performance is like watching a Van Halen guitar solo, almost too fast to follow but every note perfect.  Debra Messing's Grace seems to be the character that everything happens to, and you can see every bit of it on her face.  Her bio tells of her extensive arts education, and it shows.  If there's ever been another Lucille Ball, it would have to be Debra Messing.  Will & Grace has all the necessary sitcom ingredients: interesting situations, hilarious comedy, and characters you care about.",/review/rw1706964/?ref_=tt_urv

1 November 2004,JohnnyOldSoul,," Funny, but needs a bit of a facelift.
","OK, I feel like a bit of a traitor not totally gushing over every aspect of the show, as it has brought me a LOT of laughs over the years, but something seems to have gone amiss, but it's not too late to turn around.",/review/rw1706964/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2020,scootampa,10," DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE COMEDY. THESE ARE INCREDIBLY INTELLIGENT AND TALENTED ACTORS AT THE TOP OF THEIR GAMES!
","First of all, James Burrows directed EVERY SINGLE EPISODE. Yes, you read that right. He's a comedic genius with a long history and resume to prove it. I've seen every episode of this show numerous times. I am a Gay Man and am not at ALL offended by the content or the representation of the characters. It's a fictional comedy so get a life if offended. Seriously though the timing, the acting, the physicality and the pacing of the four main characters is SUBLIME. I have sung with Meghan Mullally and she is surprisingly shy in real life until she gets to know you. Once on stage and or in front of a camera she literally transforms into the multi talented person she is and she fires with all cylinders. She can SING and move and draw you in. She won 2 Emmys for this show and it is proof she's a PROFESSIONAL. Sean Hayes is MULTI talented as a classical pianist, Tony Nominated Actor and singer as well. Again, AMAZING physicality and range in this show. People think he's one note or annoying but they may not be paying attention to his subtle nuances and HUGE range of lightning fast reactions. Debra Messing? I mean COME ON. Closest to Lucille Ball. Amazing DRAMATIC actress as well however, in this show she is at the top of her game because anyone who knows acting, comedy is the more difficult Genre to pull off successfully. Her physicality and vocal range is probably the most varied of the entire cast. Last but not least, Will McCormick as a straight man playing a gay character is S. M. O. O. T. H. I love his representation because Gays come in all shapes, sizes and personalities and he's such a terrific opposite to Sean Hayes and the balance is refreshing. John Barrowman was in the running to play Will and interestingly enough he is gay in real life. However, I personally believe that Eric playing Will was an incredible move by the Executive team at NBC. He was the more conservative of the two and many viewers who weren't comfortable with over the top effeminate Jack could TOLERATE Will and I believe this did an unbelievable job of creating acceptance from many viewers in all parts of the country/world who may not have had any exposure to Gays at all and might have been uncomfortable with Jacks over the top more stereotypical performance. BRILLIANT.
Lastly but never least, THE WRITING is spectacular! Hysterical, relevant, and lightning fast. The only other comedy to come close in my humble opinion was another NBC show, FRASIER. Take all of this glorious comedy in. You won't regret it.",/review/rw1706964/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2017,jsaus63304,2," Not the old Will and Grace
","I was a fan of the original Will and Grace. This review will be short because I turned it off after less then 10 minutes. It soon becomes evident that the show is just a platform to bash Trump and the administration. The ""acting"" seemed forced as they seemed to all try to be caricatures of the original characters. The ""jokes"" fell flat as they were nothing that we have not heard before. I was looking forward to this show, but the network ruined it. Pass on this one.",/review/rw1706964/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2001,stamper,," Good comedy
","This is really one of the best shows that is on the TV right now. The cast is incredible, the jokes are really great and al the characters are in one way or another adorable, whether it is the always boozed up Karen, the oh soooo queer Jack, the career man Will or the no luck in love Grace. The latter one actually works for Will sometimes too. OK I must admit that sometimes Jack and Karen get really weird and kind of stupid, but hey it is comedy and people do crazy things sometimes. One to watch.",/review/rw1706964/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2018,catschasemice9594,3," Leftovers
",I was't a fan of the show. I tried but I don't find characters who troll other characters funny. Why this show needed a reboot when there are talented writers out there who should be given a chance to do something original is beyond me. These characters are older and not wiser. I want fresh meat not a left over cheeseburger.,/review/rw1706964/?ref_=tt_urv

30 April 2009,TheLittleSongbird,9," Very funny, with a very talented cast!
","I don't think Will and Grace is quite as good as Frasier, but it is a great sitcom nonetheless. The writing is actually funny, though in Frasier, I can't count the number of times I've fallen off my chair laughing. Will and Grace does do that, but not all the time. The characters are memorable and engaging. Eric McCormack is great and perfectly nuanced as Will, who happens to be gay, yet he is best friends with a woman named Grace, played by Debra Messing. Both stars are great, but the most laughs goes to Megan Mullally as Karen, and Sean Hayes has his moments as Jack, who is a very weird character you are never too sure whether you love or hate him. There have also been guest stars like Minnie Driver, Tim Curry, Harry Connick Jnr, Bernadete Peters, Demi Moore, Alec Baldwin,Jack Black, Lesley Ann Warren and my favourite John Cleese as Lyle,who have brought a pleasing shine to the show. And actually the Las Vegas wedding episodes were actually the most memorable highlights of Season 6(of which I have the box set). In conclusion, a great comedy, a little in the shadow of Frasier, but well worth watching for entertainment value. 9/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw1706964/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 1999,EmptyLeo,," It's getting better
","I'm starting to like the Will & Grace characters better, the writing's getting better and the laughs are coming more often than when I first started watching 4-5 weeks ago. I still love Megan Mullally (Karen) the best.",/review/rw1706964/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2006,bigwig_thalyi,," truly odd couple
","Once a perfect couple,will and grace, shared a flat and they had two best friends,neurotic Jack and filthy rich Karen,but this perfect couple have one problem,Grace is straight and will is gay. This is the premise for what i think is the funniest US to Uk sitcom import on our TV screens at the moment. This is basically a comedy about a search for love and the complications involved. Personally i think the main laughs come from my two favourite character,jack,Sean Hayes,and Karen,Megan Mullally.The two characters have perfect chemistry.Sean Hayes may play his gay character stereotypically but that makes him very funny and Megan mull ally has her rich character down to a tee. The series has a lot of big guest stars including Matt Damon who plays a straight man pretending to be gay so he can join jacks gay choir. The only slight problem is that some of the jokes are about American themes and may not be understood by a British audience but apart from that this is a cracker of a comedy. for this reason,American themes, i give this sitcom 9/10",/review/rw1706964/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2020,RoboGarrett,," From Unfunny to Terrible and Unfunny
","I never got the love for this show and thought the jokes were terrible, but at least it used to have some value, I guess... but the new episodes or Will and Grace are probably the absolute worst television episodes of any show I have ever seen in my life. Less funny than anything. Truly terrible.",/review/rw1706964/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2001,Willow192,," Wonderful all around
","This is one of the best comedy sitcoms ever made.  When I first heard about this show I just knew that it was going to get canceled.  Because of the fact that it is about homosexuality.  But I was wrong, and I'm so glad that I was!  This is the most funny show that I have ever seen.  Debra Messing and Eric McCormack are great.  But the stars of the show are really Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally.  They both won well deserved Emmy Awards for their roles as Jack and Karen.  IMO, they make the show, and w/o them, the show probably would have been canceled.  A question people have is...are Sean and Eric gay?  My answer: Who cares?  They're still funny and that's all that matters!",/review/rw1706964/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is a shame. It's like going to a friends second wedding and you were at her first wedding. Where she came down the aisle in a big white dress and veil and was beautiful. Cut to twenty years later. And a new man, and damned if she doesn't come down the aisle in the same dress. Only this time her face is 20 years older.

","Why did they ever bring this back? Is it that Hollywood is running out of ideas? Jeez, what used to be an ... alright, mildly amusing sitcom a decade or so ago, has become a creaky dinosaur of outdated and, just plain, unfunny jibs and jabs. The old ""Three's Company"" was light years ahead of this ... 'stuff', that's for sure! It was also a lot better to look at Suzanne Somers and Joyce DeWitt, not to mention to laugh at the antics of the great John Ritter with them. Debra, Eric, and Sean really could've done better.
