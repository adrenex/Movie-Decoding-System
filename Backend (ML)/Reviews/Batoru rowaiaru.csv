5 August 2020,skintone-38600,10," Yes, Norwegians do have a great sense of humor
","This is so surprising and funny in a quirky and original way.
The Norwegian actors with the their interesting English accents is part of the humor for me.
The way they use English is surprising and always so funny.
The acting is just fantastic too.
It's a stroke of genius to have Vikings talking like modern politically correct office workers. Just cracks you up.
Can't praise this enough.
As long as you don't mind lots of sexual innuendo and naughty type of humor, this show is wonderful.",/review/rw3802481/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Really Funny!
","I heard such great things about Norsemen for awhile now but still put off watching it for some reason. I'm so glad that I finally gave it a chance because it's hilarious! It's a Viking comedy that's equally funny and violent. It's a sendup of Game of Thrones. It just has such a tongue in cheek, nonchalant approach to everything they do and where the entire cast gets a chance to shine. It will have you laughing throughout the entire series. Each season is as funny as the others. The writers of this show are genius. I've never seen Monty Python but I've seen this get compared to that a lot. At least as far as the humor goes. Don't be like me and go watch this incredibly funny show immediately!",/review/rw3802481/?ref_=tt_urv

","Good cast.
good sets.
good direction.
great English dialogues from non anglophone .
sometime cheesy humor,gruesome scenes, over acting.
its awesome and not many episodes so far so didn't overstay is welcome like many series do.",/review/rw3802481/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2020,the_headspace,10," Season 3 is the best so far
","I didn't know how they would do season 3, since many of the best characters were killed off in season 2. But they took the comedy and turned it on its head by setting it in the past, with hilarious jokes that look forward to the ""future"" (the map to the west, the chief's murder, and more). Truly hilarious, and Jarl Varg totally steals the show this time.",/review/rw3802481/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2018,qui_j,10," Really very good!
","If you like tongue in cheek humor, Scandinavian style, then this series will not disappoint you. It does help if you understand Norwegian humor as much of it is geared towards a certain amount of political correctness, delivered with a healthy dose of sarcasm. The second series kind of fades a bit in comparison to the first but is still quite funny. Hopefully, if there's a third season, they will pick up again.",/review/rw3802481/?ref_=tt_urv

24 February 2022,broggoethe,10," Underrated
",After I watched Vikings I found this little gem which is just a spoof of Vikings. Whenever I am looking for a laugh I watch an episode or two of Norsemen.,/review/rw3802481/?ref_=tt_urv

","As a huge fan of Monty Python, I couldn't help but notice the stylistic resemblance, and if you like their approach, this comedy is a must see.",/review/rw3802481/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2018,timigsfan,9," Who thought pillaging could be so much fun
","Norsemen is a dark and hilarious comedy about Vikings. The humor ranges from subtle and witty to over the top pythonesque silliness. One of the cleverest, best written comedies I've come across in a while. The production values are high, the Norway locations are beautiful and the acting is great. If you are looking for a comedy with some quirky twists check this out.",/review/rw3802481/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2020,bshaef,8," Silly but Funny
","Have laughed throughout al episodes. The bald headed guy and the muscular girl in season 2 are two of my favorite characters. Netflix played this just right - a few episodes and none longer than 31 minutes. Thank you Netflix, The scrotum whipping was particularly funny. OUch, ouch, ouch.",/review/rw3802481/?ref_=tt_urv

9 April 2022,Roma73,10," 12 out of 10 for me
","If you you're a fan of Monty Python, The Office and This Is Spinal Tap you'll probably love this too, with Monty Python in my opinion being the closest match. Absurdist and dark and incredibly funny, in both understated and over the top ways. It's also a brilliant parody on the Vikings series. I've watched all three seasons over and over and am really hoping they'll make more. So many great moments and hilarious dialogues come to mind I could write a three page review, but I think I've made my point. This is one of my absolute favourites. I love it!",/review/rw3802481/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2018,TheTruthofItIs,9," Fun, cute series
","""Norsemen"" (6 eps/season, 30-mins, Netflix) is a fun little romp of a series. As others have noted there's definitely some Monty Python DNA here. The series plays upon social awkwardness so it recalls ""The Office"", too. There's a thread of emasculation throughout, too, along with latent male homosexuality so the male characters take it on the chin here but it's still pretty funny. Another entertaining element is its anachronistic references, for instance, you'll hear ""Let's make ... great again"", ""Winter is coming"", and lamentations that it's only the year 791 as an excuse for the state of their technology. You'll also enjoy how they deal with the viking propensity for the ""rape and pillaging"" of villages, yes they found a way. The cast is excellent, too. Silje Torp as ""Froya"" could be a sister of Tricia Helfer so she was fun to watch, and Jon Oigarden relished his role as the decadent sociopath ""Jarl Varg"". These two are standouts and justify watching the series on their own. And good news for those of us who find this the rare comedy treasure, there will be a third season! :-) *** Season 3 *** The third season comes as a prequel which I'm not a big fan of, but it was alright, still has the socially awkward magic that's made it fun to watch. It does provide us the evolution of Jarl Varg from nice family man to maniacal dictator, much as you might remember the journey of Anakin Skywalker to Darth Vader. Let's hope for a fourth season where they attempt to conquer England!",/review/rw3802481/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2022,tindfoting,8," Vikings just wanna have fun
","Firstly; I'm biased here. I've known Øystein Martinsen, who plays Kark, for 35 years. He is the shows breakout star as the ever opthimist thrall (spoke to him after it aired, they ripped alot from Monty Python). Second; I stopped watching after ep 1 of the 3rd season. It was aired on Netflix by then with NO Norwegian language. For those who don't know, every scene was directed 2 times, one in native Norwegian, the same after in English. And the jokes just fall flat in English. Besides that, this is NOT a parody on more famous Vikings. It's more a tribute to the creators heroes, the Pythons. I enjoyed the first 2 seasons alot, with some of the best actors we have in Norway towing it. Actually surprised that a show this bloody could get a mass appeal, but it did. Kark rules!",/review/rw3802481/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2020,Sonofamoviegeek,9," Flintstones for Adults
","Having met Norwegians in Norway and in the diaspora, my conclusion was that this must be the most serious, task-oriented nation on earth. After watching Norsemen/Vikingane, I must revise this conclusion. This comedy series proves that, under that mask of sobriety, Norwegians have a wicked sense of humour. Others have summarized the unique premise of this show. The only comparison I can think of is if the Flintstones were transplanted to an X-rated Viking environment. This is definitely not children's entertainment with reference to Norse gods, looting, pillaging and raping. The English dialogue alternates between potty-mouth and psychobabble. The looting, pillaging and raping is graphically shown, which makes the humour too dark for children and the overly sensitive.",/review/rw3802481/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2018,bshaef,8," Great Job NetFlix
",Wears a little thin if you binge watch but was quite entertaining nevertheless. Looking forward to season 2. Love hearing the Norwegian accent. I wish I could talk like that. Close captions are one of the great 21st century inventions. It has opened a whole new world of entertainment for me. The brother and sister in the Mexican soccer series are my favorite. I don't understand a word of Spanish but I could listen to them talk all day long in their mother tongue.,/review/rw3802481/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2020,ivko,9," brilliant
","I came across this on Netflix and by the end of the first episode I was completely hooked. My jaw actually ached from smiling for so long. The subject matter can get a little adult (discussion of, not depiction, generally speaking) so it's maybe not for the kids, but for everyone else it's a real treat.",/review/rw3802481/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2020,EvanKevelson,9," A semi Lilyhammer reunion and 1000 year's earlier
","This had me laughing to be able to mock the general concepts of perceived Viking culture and what little we know about them.
I think society overall has a better knowledge of Norse Mythology than culture (maybe thank marvel).
At the same time the ""Barbarian"" characters make the ones seeking enlightenment and poetry look even more ridiculous.
This is a great combination of of color and dark humor. Refreshing as well. If they would have filmed it in Norwegian I don't know if many jokes based on idioms and sayings would have made sense.
Very underrated show for a comedy which is hard to find these days.",/review/rw3802481/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2020,colinkhenry,10," Fantastic
",I'm on S1E4 ..... I haven't stopped laughing. The humour is fantastic. Dark in places but wow! It's like Vikings meets Monty Python 👍🏻 Love it. Norwegian humour very similar to British humour. I guess some English speaking countries just wouldn't get it! (Sorry America Hahahaha),/review/rw3802481/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2022,phignett@hotmail.com,8," Dry humour like a desert, but funny
",I watched this not knowing what to expect and it took a couple of episodes to get into it. After getting to know the characters they are actually well developed and very unique. The scenarios and the joke ms and are a really dry humour like nothing that I have watched before but I did find it really quite funny. The boundaries that are pushed are pushing to the limits of my comfort level but still it's funny to see such boundaries pushed. The final series as a prequel was actually quite smart and I was hoping for a fourth season but unfortunately it's not going to happen but the first 3 seasons are excellent anyway. Not for everyone's liking but a fun comedy.,/review/rw3802481/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2020,pasmanni,8," Modern problems in viking setting

24 August 2017,jamhayesshopping,9," Very well made, acted, scripted and produced Viking comedy from Norway.
","This came as something of a surprise as it's unbelievably well rounded for a first season. Great characters, very funny in places but also with some very dark humour and a lot of incidental violence (so this is absolutely not general family viewing!).",/review/rw3802481/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2020,jaybizman,9," A Star Is Born ...
","After watching Episode One of the first series, I didn't know whether to laugh, cry - or have something liquid and strong. This has to be the craziest (in a good way) show that I've ever seen. Imagine (if you can) a village full of badass Vikings, who love to rape and pillage (as usual) then it can turn in to almost a Monty Python type of humor and deadpan comedy in an instant. IF you get it - you get it, and will binge-watch till your eyes fall out. I just finished Series three. Amazing. Wonderful. I can't give this enough superlatives. Two stand outs 'Orm', who plays an effeminate Viking (who likes to knit!); and Ms. Silje Torp, who at close to 6 feet tall and with more muscles than most of the guys is a real find and Star. Watch out for her 'interesting'... necklace. So go for it, and just have a rollicking, great time. Highly recommended. It's in English, with no subs.",/review/rw3802481/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2017,ketztx,10," Excellent
","Incredibly non-pc, gross, scatological and shocking, this is also one of the best written and truly hysterical comedies I have seen in forever; A refreshing bit of dark dark comedy that leaves me in tears when I am not gasping ""did they really say that??!!"". It's a gem. watch it and savor.",/review/rw3802481/?ref_=tt_urv
