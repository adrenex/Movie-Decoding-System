25 November 2020,midnitepantera,9," Love this show! Always CRACKS ME UP! :D
","Watch reruns at night before bed to help me laugh so I can get to sleep and survive the STRESSFUL NIGHTMARE that is our lives in 2020. Hilarious show, with good chemistry among the actors, and you gotta love little Jim the Dog (such a serious, worried face that pup has) This show is not really meant for kids, as it touches on a lot of jokes about sex, drugs, and love and hate relationships. I noticed a few reviewers bashing this show because of this, but no one wants every TV show to be rated G for God sake. :o Top 3 Favorite episodes:
1. Sex and Death S-4 Ep- 3
2. Vince Takes a Bath S-3 Ep-2
3. Poker in the Front, Looker in the Back S-4 Ep-5",/review/rw2547040/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2018,Top_Dawg_Critic,9," One of the few sitcoms out there where you are guaranteed to laugh for the majority of every episode!
",One of the few sitcoms out there where you are guaranteed to laugh for the majority of every episode! The writing and the acting (by all) makes this a non-stop laughing affair. Very few sitcoms offer such non stop humor. All actors were cast perfectly - another rarity. A very enjoyable show that deserves a 9/10 from me!,/review/rw2547040/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2015,Shopaholic35,8," Really funny.
","Come on people, this show is super funny. It is actually very plausible that this could be many people's lives. I don't think there's anybody out there who cannot relate to Mike & Molly in someway or another. It may be a little exaggerated but overall it represents a normal chaotic life with embarrassment, insecurities, problems and lots of love.",/review/rw2547040/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2010,atangey,8," An enjoyable comedy with non traditional leads
","I enjoyed watching ""Mike and Molly"" very much. Billy Gardell and Melissa McCarthy lead a superb cast while delving into a rather touchy subject. Let me say uncandidly my wife and I both deal with weight problems, and for the first time I felt the issues were centered without being insulting. The jokes are ""laugh with me"" style rather then ""laugh at me"". Needless to say, dealing with these issues can make a person self conscious, and we see that portrayed in Mike as he is smitten with Molly (and I can certainly see why) but hesitates to make the move to ask her out.",/review/rw2547040/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2014,SanteeFats,6," Fairly good
","When this show started I really liked it. It was funny and entertaining. I liked the banter between Mike, Carl, and Samuel. Samuel's dry, witty comments are a real laugh. This has continued through out the series to my delight. Molly's character has changed as the show progressed. When she quit her teaching job to become a writer it seemed like she was taking over the series over several episodes. I did not care for that at all. Things have again balanced out and I am happier. Swoosie Kurtz plays Molly's mother whose house they all live in. She is a very funny booze hound with a bit of a sarcastic wit. Along with Molly's sister who is the hot pot head working as the make up artist at a funeral home and after a few episodes, Vince who becomes Swoosie's husband they all live together is blissful disharmony. I like Vince's character as he lends a certain earthiness to the whole show. Then there is Carl's Grandmother who I find to be extremely funny. She lays it down like it is. Mike's mother is played well but her character is a very bitter, unloving (on the surface) person who loves her scruffy dog more than anyone else. I hope this show stays on the air for a few more years, as long as it stays funny.",/review/rw2547040/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2010,hfan77,8," And Chuck Lorre Gets the Hat Trick
","As a long time PA announcer for hockey, soccer and girls lacrosse, when someone scores three goals, I usually say ""And (name) gets the Hat Trick!"" That's true with Chuck Lorre, who has another hit show in Mike & Molly, which follows his biggest hit Two and a Half Men. With another hit The Big Bang Theory, he joins Paul Henning and Susan Harris as the only producers to have three sitcoms in prime time. ",/review/rw2547040/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2015,taylorkingston,8," A light-hearted comedy...
","I really love this TV show. When it first came out, and I watched the Series Premiere, I wasn't that impressed. It was only recently that I decided to re-watch it, and give it another chance. Make sure you watch past the first episode, because it gets way better. The only thing I don't like about this show is that at the beginning of Season 4, everything has changed, without explanation. For example, someone, I won't say who, was pregnant in the Season 3 Finale, but in the Season 4 Premiere, she wasn't pregnant, was drinking beer, and there was no mention of what had happened. Can you say confusing? And Molly's character changed completely. She would do something, and I'd go, ""That's not something Molly would do.""",/review/rw2547040/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2021,estathena2,8," Heartwarming
","From pilot to finale this show will make you chuckle, laugh out loud, and wipe away a tear or two - or three. Having watched the show in its entirety when it was first broadcast on network television & now marathoning it thanks to HBO Max, I enjoyed it just as much & so curse the Network that didn't jump at the chance at continuing the series with 13 episode seasons.",/review/rw2547040/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2015,pefrss,9," Great black and white cast
","I stumbled on this show watching reruns on a channel which shows only reruns and I caught the first two episodes and thought they were extremely funny. What especially attracted me to the show is the fact that the cast is more or less half white and half black . I did not grow up in the States and before I came here , that is how I always imagined it to be. All races living happily together and being friends. Not the reality unfortunately.

18 March 2014,Mike-DD,7," Enjoyable, but a lot of recycled ideas
","This is an enjoyable series, but the initial blurb made me think overeating would be a major plot point, but besides being the reason why Mike and Molly met and being a topic in a couple of earlier episodes, it doesn't feature much any more.",/review/rw2547040/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2014,PartialMovieViewer,2," It was Good - No it Wasn't - It Was Always Bad
","Was there a plan in the works for, 'Mike and Molly,' to fail? If there was – one word – success. The show started out very funny and got un-funny real quick. Mike and Milly seemed like a likable couple bumbling through life - like all of us. At least that was at first, (and actually Billy Gardell still seems like a amiable kind of dude.) What the heck happened to Molly? It's like she has become the devil's spawn. She is horrible. It is sad that such a promising show found the edge of the toilet and decided to dive in head-first. All of this almost seemed like it was by design. I can only assume that the writers were told to tank the program. They have done such a good job, I doubt we will have to suffer through a reunion show - phew. Anyways – I hope the network can come up with something funny – I don't care if it is original or not, I just want something funny, that is all.",/review/rw2547040/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2021,vintagegeek,9," Funnier These Days
",We never really watched these much during original showings. But now we find the characters hysterically funny most times. Especially Carlton's Nana. She is delightful. The empty headed sister is terrific. Priceless stories come out of her mouth.,/review/rw2547040/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2021,etober,9," Deserved a 10 year run!
","Officially my favorite sitcom. I adore Friends and Will and Grace, but this series holds a special place in my heart. Funny, raunchy, heartfelt; and you love every character. But the best characters are the stars Mike and Molly. Great chemistry and a hilarious duo. I always found myself laughing out loud, especially after season 4. It's a tragic crime they ended at only 6 seasons! For that I have 9 stars instead of 10. Bring back this wonderful show, and THEN I'll give you my 10th star!",/review/rw2547040/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2017,Kirpianuscus,," fine job
","a try to give a different form of comedy series. more realistic. more familiar in a serious manner. and a decent result. because the humor has a precise target and the series has the good intention to give a realistic perspective for a not so small community. and, surprising, it does a nice job. because it is not only a series about physical appearances, love, family, friends, job and...temptations but all in the right package. and this does it...special. and, maybe, useful.",/review/rw2547040/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2010,he88,5," Same Old Lame
","I watched episodes 3 & 4. I really tried to like it because I like some of the people in it, but it comes across as a re-wash of the same old sitcoms of days past. The kind of humor that practically says, ""Here's a joke...Laugh."" instead of being clever and surprising. In fact I really think the jokes themselves are basically re-hashed from other sitcoms....Or at least the set up to them is. I guess there's an audience for this same old sitcom format, but it's not for me.",/review/rw2547040/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2021,cboling86,10," Slow start, strong finish!
","First 3 seasons had to of had different writers. It was either season 3 or 4 that just completely changed things for me. The first few seasons are just ok. Sweet with some funny lines, but by season 3 or 4 (which ever one where Molly decides to quit her job) is when her character absolutely flourished! It was almost like a completely different person. I laughed so much from then on. Glad I didn't give up before the change. Good cast too. Once everyone establishes reoccurring roles, you fall in love with them all.",/review/rw2547040/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2010,Sylviastel,8," Bring Back Rondi Regularly!
","I saw a preview of Mike & Molly while in Las Vegas over my vacation. It's a cute little sitcom with good plus sized actors like Billy Gardell and Melissa McCarthy who play the title roles of Mike and Molly. The couple meet at an over-eaters support group. Their supporting cast includes the excellent Swoosie Kurtz as Molly's brassy mother. They should utilize her talents more on the show. Molly's sister isn't one of my favorites. She's slimmer and a shady character. Molly teaches fourth grade in Chicago. Mike lives alone in his apartment and works as a police officer with his sidekick played by Cleo King. The show's writing and character development need improvement but the show is getting there and it's a hit. The best part was seeing Tony Award winner, Steppenwolf veteran actress Rondi Reed cast as Mike's mom. She's perfect and deserves more airtime over the season. She's the reason why I picked this show over it's competition.",/review/rw2547040/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2016,jéwé,8," Very good and believable
","The problem with most shows about married couples is that these couples bicker so much. And it is hard to believe that they are actually a couple. The King of Queens was very funny. But never for one moment did I see the two leads as partners with romantic feelings for each other. Let alone have such a history together. With this show that problem does not occur. Yes, they argue like normal people do. But the verbal fights are mostly done with the supporting characters: parents, colleagues, friends. That works very well. The dialogue is sometimes hilarious, especially when Mike and his police partner are in the car or visiting the restaurant.",/review/rw2547040/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2020,burgercolleen,10," LOVE THIS SHOW

20 May 2020,rjal-1,8," Funny, at first
","The first few seasons of this show was so funny that I almost hurt from laughing so much. In the last seasons, it changed direction a little too much for me and I kinda feel that it lost its groove. Howver, the writing is witty and quick and sharp and very enjoyable. It's not predictable either, which happens with so many sitcoms.",/review/rw2547040/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2013,kathy12366,3," We used to look forward to hitting ""play"" on the DVR to watch this show
","My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this show the first few seasons. All of the characters were well developed and each brought a uniquely funny and quirky personality to the show. Molly was the most sane female in her family, yet she was likable and incredibly funny. This season (beginning Fall, 2013) Molly has turned into a completely different character, and unfortunately, at least as far as my boyfriend and I are concerned, she isn't at all likable and is most definitely not funny. We still watch the show each week, and hope that she'll go back to being the old Molly from seasons past. Luckily, the other characters maintained their original personalities and we still have some good laughs when they get some dialogue. A woman who was stable and teaching children for the first few seasons and all of the sudden turns into a woman who jumps out of her classroom window in front of her students because she wants to be a writer is not at all the type of woman Molly used to be. She was witty and smart; now it seems she's lost her intelligence. The show used to have stories for all of the characters...now it just focuses on Molly and what sort of mess she'll get into and out of within the 30 minute time slot. It seems as though she's aiming to be a modern Lucille Ball. Sadly, she really misses the mark and we miss the old Molly.",/review/rw2547040/?ref_=tt_urv

18 November 2013,abavard_22,3," Jumped the Shark
","What started out as a nice RomCom jumped the shark. Not sure who decided to do the ""NEW Mike & Molly"" but the new stinks. It used to be an enjoyable show about a couple who just happen to be overweight and their quirky friends and relatives. Now it's about a angry fat woman who just keeps doing more outrageous things in her desire for attention. Hey, writers did you notice how NONE of Melissa's movies have been anywhere near blockbusters? Might be a clue.",/review/rw2547040/?ref_=tt_urv
