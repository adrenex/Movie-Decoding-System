","When people watch the Oscars, they don't usually care about the Best Foreign Film nominees. Incendies provides so many reasons why people should actually get to see those nominees at all costs. Incendies is the kind of film that one walks away from feeling emotionally drained, one where it stays in the viewer's mind for days on end. Like an intense personal experience, it takes a lot to come to grips with the film's story, a moving plot full of twists and catharsis. At the New Directors/New Films Festival in New York, at which I saw this last night, Denis Villeneuve explained that he has made four films in Canada, but this is the first one to be released in America. Right now, I see no reason why Villeneuve, or any of the actors for that matter, shouldn't have a great future ahead of them.",/review/rw2383349/?ref_=tt_urv

","A bona fide masterpiece. As simple as that. It is ironic that one of the best films about the Middle East conflict, and specifically the tragic civil war in Lebanon, should be made by a Canadian film maker. Incendies is based on a play but it feels as though it has been adapted from a great literary work. In fact there is no specific mention of any country in the film but no one can be in any doubt that the unnamed country is Lebanon.",/review/rw2383349/?ref_=tt_urv

","The film begins in sweeping slow motion, centered around a harsh cemented premises with a bunch of boys undergoing the shaving of their hair ala military fashion, with the camera centered on one boy possessing this crazed looking eyes, before cutting to Canada where twins Jeanne and Simon Marwan (Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin and Maxim Gaudette respectively) arrive at a notary's office to accept the will of their recently deceased mother Nawal (Lubna Azabal), where they are left with letters to deliver to a father and brother that they do not know.

5 November 2017,classicsoncall,10," ""Death is never the end of the story. It always leaves tracks.""
","I don't know if I've ever seen a more heartbreaking and shocking story. Check that, ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" was another film that served a solid punch to the gut that remains with you a long time. I have to credit some other reviewers for this film to identify the location of the story and place it in context of the Lebanese civil war. I might have considered it myself if I hadn't been so absorbed by the story and the intricately detailed revelations regarding Nawal Marwan (Lubna Azabal) and her twins, son Simon (Maxim Gaudette) and daughter Jeanne (Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin). One must pay attention though, to the non-linear story telling style of director Denis Villeneuve, as well as the identity of the Christian and Muslim factions involved in war time brutality and atrocity. Apart from the principal story, the scene that will stay with you for a long time involves a Christian militia attack on a busload of Muslims attempting to flee their war torn and devastated city. A noble sacrifice on Marwan's part turns into a horror spectacle when a young child is gunned down by the militants. The picture exemplifies the terror of war and it's heartbreaking effect on those fortunate to survive.",/review/rw2383349/?ref_=tt_urv

7 September 2019,andrewroy-04316,7," The build is tense and well crafted, but the twist is more shock value than adding depth to the story
","There's no doubting Villeneuve's skill in building tension and emotional stakes through his characters and shots. While it's in a very different way, like in Enemy the shocking twist ending doesn't really add to the story and feels forced. The difference is while in Enemy the ending was insane and left the meaning and plot completely up in the air, in Incendies what happened is entirely clear and just isn't that satisfying. The most cogent point Villeneuve makes in the film is how the atrocities of war can shape people and turn them into monsters. The alternation between the past and present put into focus how war can ravage a region and a family for decades and was very effective in gradually unspooling the plot threads. The performances were all very good, particularly those playing Nawal and her daughter.",/review/rw2383349/?ref_=tt_urv

","Some viewers may regard the climax of 'Incendies' as the most effective part of the film, but I must wholeheartedly disagree . If one really wants to single out the most effective and compelling scene, that would be the massacre on the bus and subsequent shooting of the young child. It works because Director Denis Villenueve compounds the horror exponentially: the bus is stopped by terrorists, the passengers react confused and frightened, the bus driver is murdered, the terrorists strafe the bus with machine gun fire killing most of the passengers, Nawal (the protagonist) and a young mother and her young daughter move to the back as the terrorists pour gasoline on top of the roof of the bus, Nawal escapes and takes the young girl with her only to see the terrorists set the bus on fire killing the mother and finally the child running back to the bus to be with her mother, only to be shot in the back by the terrorists as Nawal watches in horror.",/review/rw2383349/?ref_=tt_urv

25 November 2020,latinmelkor,6," A touching film that depends on coincidences all the way up to ridiculous
","I have written this review as a response to all those who find in this film a perfect jewel and label it as underrated (although in many sites it is highly rated and has more than 100,000 views). It is true that it is a very entertaining and interesting film, and I think that, for many viewers, the obvious weaknesses of the film are not so obvious.
Something that I liked and called attention to is the narrative structure. Some twins (female and male) find out from their mother's will that they have a brother and that their father is alive. The mother commands them to find them both. During the first part of the film, only the daughter decides to carry out her mother's wishes, and to do so she travels to a Middle Eastern country (which is never specified) where, as she travels through places that played an important role in her mother's life, we are presented with her biography through flashbacks. It is easy to feel confused at first with the factions (Christian and Muslim), because they do not correspond to a historical reality, but rather were made in the service of fiction. However, little by little, the viewer is able to put the puzzle back together and discover the hard life that the woman led in the midst of violence and intolerance.
The film has a lot of plot-twists that manage to arouse the interest of their audience and, to a certain extent, are presented in such a way that it is possible to glimpse them when they approach. Unfortunately, the film depends too much on coincidences of sudden and unexplained developments. About this, in many occasions I found elements that, although they should seem natural, were not very well explained and, of course, for the final outcome to happen the scriptwriters took the coincidences to the last consequences.
Although Nawal Marwan seems to live in a rural environment, she is able to move to a relative who works at a university. Despite the fact that at first she cannot read or write (at around 21 years of age), she soon manages to work at a newspaper writing articles. The screenwriters made Marwan a prodigious mind: even though she began receiving education as an adult, within a few years she is able to infiltrate as a tutor to the son of an extremist Christian leader she was tasked to kill, teaching him French and English. After killing this leader, she is finally captured and taken to a prison where she is tortured for no less than 15 years. After being raped by one of her captors and becoming pregnant, she is released (instead of executed) and, with the help of the warlord who benefited from the Christian leader's death, she's exiled to Canada.
The same pattern is repeated in the son's story. He is left in an orphanage where, ultimately, is recruited by an extremist Muslim group. There he is trained as a militia officer, a sniper. He is not just any sniper, of course, he is the most skilled and recognized of all. Eventually, the enemy faction, the Christians, manage to capture him, but, because of his ability, they decide not to execute him but to recruit him themselves (wasn't it supposed to be a holy war?) and, moreover, they do not train him as a sniper (there is no justification for it), but as a torturer. In his new job he ends up working in the prison where, by chance, his mother is. He unknowingly rapes her, she gets her pregnant and thus he becomes the twins' father and brother at the same time.
This is shocking and, I admit, makes one reflect on the way in which war separates people who, in peace, would live together happily. It is a sad and painful story, incisive and critical of the senselessness of war, but it is weakened by its dependence on so many unjustified elements. And, without a doubt, what put me most against the film was how the mother came to know that the one who raped her was her own son. In a swimming pool, the woman sees a man who, on his foot, has the tattoo with which she marked her son to identify him. Then, upon discovering his face, she is horrified that her son is the father of the twins, the rapist. The pain of the scene is diluted by the coincidences: her son emigrated from the country where he was originally and precisely that country is Canada and, besides, she finds him in a pool, where she can see his foot and recognize the mark. Finally, the son is unable to recognize her as his victim, so the man does not run away, fearing that he will be denounced for his past crimes. By leaving her will, the mother entrusts her children with the torturous task of discovering that they are their own brother's children, a task that would be impossible were it not for the fact that they are ""lucky"" enough to correlate the records and find the people who could lead them to the truth.
Although I have vilified the film, in reality it is a very beautiful film visually, with an impeccable performance and a catchy plot, but it depends on coincidences that become ridiculous and take it away from a perfect rating.",/review/rw2383349/?ref_=tt_urv

8 October 2011,pc95,6," Very Good Until Becoming Too Contrived
","""Incendies"" is one of these movies that really disappoints - The ones that for a good portion of the movie are highly enthralling, but then comes crashing down. (Major Spoiler) I had an inkling that the filmmakers might pull what they ended up trying to smear on the viewer, and it was so, so disappointing. Suffice it to say to twist the plot around and pretzel it like they did, the filmmakers stooped to utter contrivance. They blew up logic and believability for the sake of sensationalism. How probable could all of this actually take place in such a sequence (?), quite improbable. Additionally I had a hard time understanding what exactly transformed the mother into a killer(?) The ending became marginal and a continuation of the contrivance. Too bad - it had a great story going up until the last quarter of it's run-time.",/review/rw2383349/?ref_=tt_urv

10 February 2011,cultfilmfan,10," Incendies
","Incendies is based on the play by Wajdi Mouawad. The film is a Canadian film in French and Arabic with English subtitles. Going into the theatre to see Incendies, I really knew nothing about it. I had not read any of the reviews that came out, but I had heard from the television news shows that it was supposed to be very good and now with a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, I assumed that it was going to be a really good film. I decided not to read anything about the plot before I saw the film because these days I find that so many critics gave away too much crucial information of the films in their reviews that when you finally do see the film it does not have the same affect on you. So having known nothing about Incendies and then watching the story unfold before my eyes was quite an experience and I would recommend you do the same if you are at all inclined to go see it. Other than the film's director Denis Villeneuve, I was not familiar with anybody else who appeared in the film, or worked on the sides, but I must say that they all did a fantastic job. This is the type of film that when you are watching it, you are not quite sure what will happen, or how the climax, or the ending will come, but when it does, it makes sense to you and leaves you with a multitude of feelings. At times Incendies was not always the most easy film to watch, not because it was overly violent, or graphic because I thought everything was handled in a very tastefully done way, but it still sucks so much emotion out of us and we get to care so much for the characters and what they are going through as we watch it before our eyes, that we can not help but feel sad, enraged, or even physically ill watching it at times. I should clarify that the film does deal with some of the goings on with the Middle East and the wars, tension and prejudices that came out of some of those wars and moments of terror that people at that time and still are going through. I also liked how when dealing with such a tricky and controversial subject matter such as this that as I mentioned it was all very tastefully done and none of it felt like you were watching a Hollywood movie. I think if this had been a big budget, big name star movie extravaganza, then it probably would not have worked. The reason it works so well as it is, is because the fact that it is so character driven and deals with events that have gone on in the past and in some similar and different ways are still going on today. The film felt personal to me. It felt like the people involved with the film had something to say and instead of sugar coating everything and making it an easily watchable film with a feel good portion of it, it instead goes for all your emotions and in a sense almost takes you on the journey and the personal trials and tribulations that the characters in the movie have gone on and understandably we can almost feel their pain, exhaustion and hurt because the performances have this sense of believability and authenticity to them, that everything we see them go through feels like the real thing and the way they handle each situation is believable and not far fetched at all. The characters in the film give us something to believe in because they are searching for the truth and will go to many lengths to find it, even if at times it is difficult, or even dangerous and the amount of honour and pride they carry with them to set out someone's wishes is truly remarkable. This is an incredibly powerful film that as I mentioned, does put you through an array of different emotions, but I did not mind that because I felt I could connect with the characters more because of this. The look and feel of the film is not big budget or fake looking, which makes all the interior and exterior shots look real and further enhancing the emotions, or moods we are supposed to feel in each scene. The acting by everyone involved is all terrific here as well and this is just a really well put together film with a great cast and director and wonderful material to work and mold into this brave, haunting and yet life changing experience. I have not seen any of the other Best Foreign Language Film Oscar nominees, but having just seen Incendies now, I would say that it has a good chance of winning because of how masterful and great it is. Do not just take my word for it, go and see it when it opens in a theatre near you. This is certainly one of the best films of 2010.",/review/rw2383349/?ref_=tt_urv
