31 January 2011,poicop,7," Since Exorcist, there's maybe one or two movies of this subject that have been good...half decent...and this is one of them.
","Sometimes you read reviews, but want to see the film so bad, you go, and because your expectations are so low. You enjoy the movie. Reviews seems to be on the good side, with earlier reviews being very bad.",/review/rw2422002/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2011,michaelRokeefe,7," The making of an exorcist.
","The devil is alive and very active. Michael Kovak(Colin O'Donoghue) has second thoughts about staying with the family tradition. He has spent his life thus far helping his father at the family funeral home. He has been taught that preparing the body deserves respect and actually is akin to a piece of art. Michael has made his mind up to enter seminary school to become a priest. Despite his feelings that demonic possession is a pile of malarkey , the priest-in-making is recommended for an elite and special exorcism class in Rome. For the next several months Michael is under the guidance of Father Lucas(Anthony Hopkins), who introduces him to the devil's power and wrath up close and personal. The young cleric will attend exorcisms conducted by Father Lucas, who himself may know the devil more than he wants. Michael still isn't totally convinced an exorcism is ever needed instead of psychological therapy.",/review/rw2422002/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2021,kuarinofu,8," Underrated (and carried by Hopkins)

31 January 2011,petit76,8," Survival of Exorcism sub-genre with the phenomenon acting by a giant actor
","The Rite looked like it would be a mixed bag right from the start. The film seemed to suffer the same fate many other films before it fell victim to and that's giving away too much of the storyline in the trailers. On top of that, it was a film that revolved around exorcism which is a subject that usually leads to disappointing results. Expectations would lead one to believe that The Rite would have enough momentum to reel you in only to drop the ball during its finale similar to last year's The Last Exorcism (except hopefully without the appearance of a neon red, glow in the dark fetus). Luckily, the film has a few surprises up its sleeve.",/review/rw2422002/?ref_=tt_urv

5 October 2014,Dr_Sagan,," Atmospheric supernatural drama...
","This is a movie that deals with the ""delicate"" theme of exorcism (i.e. the practice of evicting a demon from a person they are believed to be possessed). I describe it as delicate because it seems very difficult to distinguish a person with a mental illness from someone who is possessed, IF such thing exists at all in real life.",/review/rw2422002/?ref_=tt_urv

31 January 2011,hyprsleepy,," Inspired by true events story that is interesting but not exciting
","While I was always waiting to see what happened next and interested in how the good guys would overcome the challenges they faced I felt completely detached from the main character, Michael Kovak. I don't need to like the main character but I still need to connect. Unfortunately, Michael was very emotionally inaccessible and therefore I never really cared for him.",/review/rw2422002/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2011,yawar_hameed_jan,9," The Rite saves the dying exorcism sub-genres
","After losing faith in the exorcism sub-genres and my sister telling me how average this movie was, i didn't expect much from The Rite. Honestly, the only reason i watched it was because of Anthony Hopkins, and i am glad i did. This movie has everything that fans want in an exorcism movie. Some people may find it a bit slow paced but the movie does not steer off course, every minute is relevant to the storyline. ",/review/rw2422002/?ref_=tt_urv

25 May 2011,gradyharp,8," 'First you must believe'
","Matt Baglio's book THE RITE: MAKING OF A MODERN EXORCIST is described as 'In 2007, the Vatican's chief exorcist revealed an initiative to install an exorcist in every diocese worldwide. Three days later, the Vatican denied the story. Father Gary Thomas was working as a parish priest in California when church leaders asked him to travel to Rome for training in the rite of exorcism. In Rome, as an apprentice to a veteran Italian exorcist, his eyes were opened to a darker side of the Catholic faith he had never known, and he came to see the battle between good and evil as never before. Journalist Matt Baglio had full access to Father Gary over the course of his training, and the astonishing story he found reveals that the phenomena of possession, demons, the Devil, and exorcism are not merely a remnant of the archaic past, but remain a fearsome power in many people's lives even today. The inspiration for the movie The Rite, starring Anthony Hopkins, this book provides a uniquely intimate glimpse into the chilling world of a real-life Roman Catholic exorcist.'

","The atheist American Michael Kovak (Colin O'Donoghue) works as a mortician in the Funeral Home of his father Istvan Kovak (Rutger Hauer). Michael sees the chance to leave home as a seminary student in the Vatican, and he travels to Italy. After a period, Michael decides to quit due to his lack of faith, and tells Father Xavier (Ciar√°n Hinds) about his decision. However, Father Matthew (Toby Jones) tells him that he will be charged for the course and offers him to have an exorcism training, where he meets the journalist Angelina Vargas (Alice Braga).",/review/rw2422002/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2016,Leofwine_draca,4," Seen it all before, this one
","I know THE RITE has garnered some decent reviews here on the IMDb, but for the life of me I don't see why. It's an entirely predictable (i.e., Hollywood style) exorcism thriller that wastes the talents of an excellent cast in a story that's both plodding and predictable. We're off to Italy, of course, where a young priest is suffering a crisis of faith (of course) until he hooks up with an experienced exorcist and the pair embark on some gruelling adventures.",/review/rw2422002/?ref_=tt_urv

29 January 2011,edwbur,10," has a rite to be called a great film
",this i believe is one of Anthony Hopkins best horror movies. i know he has been trying to get back into horror and he tried with the wolf man which was bad. horrible. but this was very good. in fact it was so good after the movie i was afraid to go to sleep. thats never happened to me before. even more scary that it was inspired by true events. also it had its funny moments to. like when Hopkins was giving an exorcism to a woman and speaking a prayer in a different language. of course because they are in Rome anyway his phone rang as he was trying to get a demon out of her body and then he asked the person with him that was a priest and turned atheist to finish as he talked on the phone. funny moment. great acting by Anthony Hopkins. he spoke roman language fluently. what i didn't get about the film was the kid who was to become a priest but turned atheist Michael was targeted by the demon. however they went after Hopkins character father Lucas. i thin i know why but i don't want to spoil that for you. so my recommendation. see it.,/review/rw2422002/?ref_=tt_urv

","I must say that it is nice to finally have an exorcism movie available that is worth watching. There has been some really lousy exorcism movies on the market in the past, not to hang any movie out in particular, but nothing worth watching or mentioning.

26 September 2019,RatedVforVinny,7," A decent and semi scary, entry to the possessed genre.
","A very powerful possession movie, with Anthony Hopkins playing the most experienced priest in the field but ultimately he falls prey to a powerful demon that even he cannot control. Another pretty scary possession movie and although in recent years there has been a few insipid ones, 'The Rite' is certainly worth seeking out (even though it was a bit low key on release). As expected Hopkins dominates every scene but the rest of the movie is strong enough to hold the audience captivated.",/review/rw2422002/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2011,siderite,8," One of the better movies of the subgenre
","What one first notices about the film is the visuals. Nicely crafted scenes, good images, appropriate music, constant rhythm. That alone lifts the movie above the usual half-assed job done in the field. Then there is the acting. Anthony Hopkins does a great role, as does the lead, Colin O'Donoghue. Too bad Rutger Hauer has such a small role in the film.",/review/rw2422002/?ref_=tt_urv
