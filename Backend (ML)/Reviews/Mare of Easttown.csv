11 September 2000,FlickJunkie-2,9," A powerful story and two inspired performances
","Films as intelligent and well crafted as this are hard to come by.  `Hilary and Jackie' is an exceptionally well done character study of two real life sisters.  Jackie (Emily Watson) is a world-class cellist and Hilary (Rachel Griffiths) lives a normal middle class life.  The story is rich in character development depicting the sisters starting from their childhood when both were musical prodigies.  Now that they are adults, they envy each other's life.  The story follows Jackie's career and explores the sisters' relationship, including the deep resentment and enduring love they have for one another.  Director Anand Tucker does a wonderful job of presenting the story.  He induces great feeling from each scene and lays the raw emotions on the screen without embellishment whether pure or turbulent.",/review/rw3235168/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 1999,cinemel,8," Entertaining and moving story of two real-life sisters.
","It is a pleasure to see a film that has believable characters and an engrossing story which both entertains and enlightens. ""Hilary and Jackie"" tells the story of two sisters, Hilary and Jacqueline Du Pre, from their early years as devoted sisters and fledgling musicians, through their divergent life choices as professional soloist and housewife.",/review/rw3235168/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2000,gbheron,8," Strange Sisterhood
","Hilary and Jackie is a biographical film about two contemporary English sisters, Hilary and Jacqueline du Pré. Both are musical prodigies as children, but as they mature into women, it is Jackie, the cellist, who moves on to international fame, while Hilary opts for husband and family on an English farm.

2 July 2006,paul2001sw-1,9," Troubling and compelling
","Jacqueline du Pre is remembered as the beautiful, genius cellist who tragically died of multiple sclerosis at a young age. But this film, though a biopic, avoids the easy conventions of the tear-jerker. Instead, it portrays a talented but capricious young woman who found her rise to fame as difficult to handle, in some ways, as her subsequent decline. Three things lift it out of the ordinary: fine acting from the entire cast; a concerted attempt, in the construction of both plot and soundtrack, to genuinely convey the importance of music in her life; and an intelligent screenplay that uses the viewpoint of her sister Hilary, along with that of Jackie herself, to show her behaviour in two different lights. The veracity of the events has been disputed; but this is a complex, and ultimately moving, film.",/review/rw3235168/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2006,bob the moo,," Well-structured and engaging character piece
","As a child Hilary was the talented musician on the flute and the younger Jacqueline was encouraged to keep up if she wanted to accompany her sister on trips to musical events. So Jackie practiced hard on her cello to do so, gradually becoming better than her sister. As adults Hilary is now very much in the shadow of her brilliant sister Jackie, who is booked solid for shows. However where Hilary finds happiness and support from her partner and husband Kiffer, Jackie grows increasingly isolated from others. The pair's relationship drifts apart but comes together again to produce one traumatic moment in their relationship.",/review/rw3235168/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2001,mikehamilton,8," Wow - Heavy subject, but worth it!
","This heavy subject matter is so well done, it left me wanting more!  The acting is superb. I have always loved Rachel Griffiths and she doesn't let the viewer down in this one either.  She pulls this one off fantastically and IS Hilary du Pré!  Emily Watson's performance is unbelievable and should have been recognized with a multitude of awards.  It is amazing how well she acts in this.  One truly believes that SHE has Multiple Sclorosis.  I was amazed at how well she played the scenes.  I just can't say enough about this film.  I highly recommend that if you want quality writing and acting and are prepared for some realistic yet somewhat disturbing subject matter about life, RENT this film!",/review/rw3235168/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2001,=G=,8," An elegant production but not without its eccentricities.
","""Hilary and Jackie"" tells of two sisters who share a love of classical music and each other but take contrasting paths through adult life. A much lauded film worthy of its critical acclaim, ""H&J"" does have a peculiar twice-told tale approach to its presentation which tends to make it interesting but so complex as to dilute its effectiveness. Nonetheless, this British film with a typically ""stiff upper lip"" approach to its sentimentality, is well shot, scripted, and acted. A good watch which will be a little ""over the top"" for many.",/review/rw3235168/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2000,mjbarkl,10," Musical genius, destroyed by multiple sclerosis
","I've read the 54 reviews here, and agree with most, both positive and negative, but I have a different perspective.  Of all instruments, cello speaks to me most deeply.  I do not play, I sing (deep bass, centered below the bottom of the bass staff, presently studying music in college after retirement), but still the cello resonates within my soul.  I grieve that I never got the chance to see Jacqueline in her prime.  But more so, that MS brought her down and killed her.",/review/rw3235168/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2018,claudio_carvalho,6," Technically Beautiful with Great Performances
","""Hilary and Jackie"" is a film technically beautiful, with magnificent cinematography and music score and top-notch performances, highlighting the lead actresses Emily Watson and Rachel Griffiths. However the screenplay telling the personal life of Jacqueline du Pré from the perpectives of each sister does not work well. Jacqueline du Pré is depicted as a selfish and spoiled woman and it is impossible to the viewer to care to the character shown in the film. Consequently the film has no feelings despite the performance of Emily Watson and looks like a tragic soap-opera. My vote is six.",/review/rw3235168/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 1999,T-10,9," an interesting study of a sibling relationship
","Hilary and Jackie is a film that can be appreciated on many levels.  The performances of Ms. Griffith and Ms. Watson as the title characters were superb, but so were the actors that played the parents and husbands, and the two young actresses playing them as girls were terrific.  All the people in the film were interesting.  The film gives insight into the life of a musical genius with its rewards and triumphs as well as conflicts and sacrifices.  There is also a psychological aspect at the heart of this film. From the beginning the two sisters have a bond, almost a symbiotic relationship, yet there is also intense competition.  To make the presentation even more interesting the relationship is presented in two ""acts"", the first told from Hilary's perspective and the second from Jackie's.  Whose is more real?  Does it make a difference?  The final scenes as MS is taking its toll on Jackie are gripping.  Both actresses were deserving of their nominations.  This was great entertainment!  Three and half stars!!!",/review/rw3235168/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 1999,Philby-3,," Love the music, pass on the players
","Music biopics, at least those concerned with classical music, tend to be pallid things; the lives of composers and performers are often uneventful compared those of politicians, generals, artists and even actors. ""Amadeus"" made a drama out of aspects of Mozart's brief life and Ken Russell had fun with Tchaikovsky in ""The Music Lovers"" but with most musicians the drama is in their performance. This movie uncovers the rather sad relationship between Jacqueline Du Pre, the brilliant cellist, and her older sister Hilary, also a musician (flautist) of talent. After acquiring public acclaim as a child prodigy, Jackie married another prodigy, the pianist and conductor Daniel Barenboim, with whom she frequently performed. At the pinnacle of her success, in her mid-twenties, she started to show signs of multiple sclerosis and was soon forced to retire. Her last 15 years were a decline ""in fits and starts"" to a vegetative state.",/review/rw3235168/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2015,SnoopyStyle,8," fascinating characters, unique relationship and top acting talents
","The du Pré sisters are exceedingly close and musical child prodigies. Younger sister Jacqueline (Emily Watson) becomes a famous globe-traveling cellist. On the other hand, Hilary (Rachel Griffiths) struggles under a strict demeaning teacher and loses all of her confidence. She marries the charming Kiffer Finzi (David Morrissey) and lives an ordinary live. Jacqueline marries Jewish pianist Daniel Barenboim (James Frain).",/review/rw3235168/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2013,JohnLeeT,10," Emily Watson is Nothing Less than Stunning
","One can not help but be overwhelmed by the power, the stunning brilliance, and incredibly amazing performance by Ms. Emily Watson that assuredly deserved an Academy Award and which shames the Oscars forever because a Paltrow, Berry, or other flunky has received a statue and Watson has been brutally robbed. This is acting at its absolute finest and a role so perfectly realized by Watson that it can never be forgotten by anyone who has seen it. Never in the history of cinema has any actress so completely captured the very soul of a character and transferred it so expertly to film. It is indeed a film for the ages because of what Watson brings to it, the fire and passion she ignites the screen with, and the unbridled superbness of craft she puts forth. One is almost blinded by such brilliance and I was not the only member of the audience to stagger from the theatre upon first viewing of this film, breathless with astonishment and trembling with emotion as I tried to find words to express the depth of my feelings to my evening's companion. I could barely speak the word ""Emily"" and could see from my companion's eyes she was equally affected by what she had just witnessed and we shared the awe in silence as the dazed audience around us wandered as if numbed into the night. Rarely has a performance touched me in this way and yet with Emily Watson it is par for the course due to an unequaled talent that few if any other actor can begin to approach. I felt pummeled by her work, bruised by her electric might, and singed by her passion. That night was one I will never forget. I have never seen an audience literally struck dumb by a performance in a cinema. Since seeing this film I have found Watson routinely splendid and spectacularly superb in role after role. There is no doubt she is the single greatest living actor working in the English language today and this film serves as a perfect showcase for her magnificent genius.",/review/rw3235168/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2006,khatcher-2,3," The biographical book is not up to much and the film is up to even less
","I have before me a 1965 vinyl LP record with a beautiful portrait of the then twenty-year-old Jacqueline du Pré and her cello. On it she plays the Elgar and Delius Cello Concertos, classics in her repertoire which have never been bettered. Indeed, years later, the ""gran maestro"" Mstislav Rostropovich on being asked why was it that he had never made a recording of the Elgar Concerto, said that a young English woman had already made the definitive version to which he had nothing to add. I also have various remastered CD recordings - with or without her then husband, Daniel Barenboim as accompanying pianist or orchestra conductor, ranging from Paradis and Saint-Saëns to Fauré, Franck and Dvorák, as well as Sir Edward Elgar's beautiful ""Enigma Variations"".",/review/rw3235168/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2008,ianlouisiana,2," Sibling Rivalry meets Rashomon meets disease of the month....
","....a simplification perhaps,but not an absurdity.""Hilary and Jackie"" presents a version of the life of Miss Jacqueline Du Pre,an extravagantly gifted English cellist whose career and, ultimately, whose life was cut tragically short by M.S.It could have been a moving tribute to a considerable musical talent but it turned out as an exploitative sensationalist hatchet - job worthy of the sleaziest tabloid newspaper. The dreadful signs and symptoms of the final stages of Miss Du Pre's disease are graphically portrayed with the same glee as beggars once used to display their sores and deformities for the delectation of the public. In much the same way that ""Lady Sings The Blues"" salaciously bared Miss Billie Holiday's very private demons,so this movie is happy to desecrate the memory of a much - loved musician in the name of profit. No matter how good Miss Watson and Miss Griffiths are,they are still participating in a film whose only purpose can be to smear the memory of young woman who was revered by a generation of concert - goers. No amount of subsequent declarations of undying love from Miss Du Pre's guilt - ridden siblings can change that. All we are left with is some cello music that the unwary might think is played by Miss Du Pre.Don't be fooled - it isn't.",/review/rw3235168/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2000,AKS-6,6," A good film
","""Hilary and Jackie"" is a good film based upon the famous cellist Jacqueline Du Pré's (and her sister's) life. In the beginning it is a very fascinating story, and Jackie's life is definitely interesting. However, the director/editor makes the mistake of leaving the linear structure of the story telling, by leaving the story at the most interesting point, just to go back and re-tell it from Jackie's point of view (we saw it from Hilary's point of view first). Some people might say that this is good -- I do not agree. Sure, there are facts in Jackie's story that are absolutely crucial in explaining her very odd behaviour in the film, but that could still have been told linear. A bad choice, really, but the film is still rather engrossing and both Emily Watson and Rachel Griffiths are wonderful. (6/10)",/review/rw3235168/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2001,Anonymous_Maxine,9," Hillary and Jackie deals with the negative affects of fame and stardom, especially when you have been driven relentlessly to that stardom.
","The movie starts off with a few shots of Hillary and Jackie, the two sisters after whom the film has been named, playing on the beach as young girls, which demonstrates the closeness that was felt between the two sisters. This is also a myth that is demonstrated throughout the film; that siblings are extremely loving and caring towards each other. Obviously, this is ideal, but it is rarely ever true, especially to the extent that Hillary and Jackie are.",/review/rw3235168/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2008,planktonrules,9," I have no idea how much of this film is true--but it is still excellent film making
","When this film debuted, there was a bit of controversy because some friends and family swore that the life of Jacqueline du Pré had been misrepresented and twisted in this movie. Considering that the story was written by her sister, Hilary, and her brother, it is certain that there is a lot of subjectivity to it--but this still didn't make this a bad film. However, as several people looked rather bad in the film (such as Jacqueline du Pré herself and her famous husband) and others looked more innocent (such as Hilary's husband--who is apparently NOT quite the nice guy he seems to be in the film), it's not surprising that the film ruffled a few feathers. This really is a shame, as I'd love to know the true facts behind the story (from a totally neutral source) although despite possible flaws, the film style and acting are marvelous and this film is exceptional.",/review/rw3235168/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2009,moonspinner55,4," An insightful (if overstated) beginning completely bottoms out in the second-half...
","In 1950s London, the real-life du Pré sisters--Hilary, a promising flautist, and Jacqueline, an animated, intense cellist--share an ordinary/extraordinary closeness. They are practically telepathic in their thoughts, yet a rivalry over their musical talents is always bubbling under the surface. This extends to their adult lives, as Hilary becomes a devoted wife and mother while Jackie flails away, alternately in contempt of the cello and yet attached to it as if by force. Jackie's neediness, which parlays into an off-putting promiscuousness, nearly breaks the sisterly bond, with Jackie desiring to 'share' Hilary's good-hearted husband. It is at this point in the picture that ""Hilary and Jackie"" becomes an unfortunate muddle of different melodramatic themes, yet the psychotic undercurrents of Jackie's behavior don't seem to set off any alarms on the screen. As flaky Jackie, Emily Watson (who resembles a young Susannah York) is focused and brave, but she is unable to help us reach this troubled soul (the built-in tragic story-arch doesn't help much, either). Rachel Griffiths has a far less showy role, however her character is one we can relate to (the grounded sister with a firm sense of responsibility). The film is extremely well-produced but, despite some dialogue or situations which ring false, the earliest scenes in the movie are best. It loses its way in the third act, becoming a tangled mess of sad episodes. ** from ****",/review/rw3235168/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2014,JamesHitchcock,9," Of Genius, of Love, of Loss, of Sisterhood, of Understanding
","The death of the cellist Jacqueline du Pré in 1987 was the cause of an unusually large amount of public grief and attention in Britain; the passing of a classical musician is normally marked by little more than an obituary in the broadsheet papers and possibly a brief item on the news. Du Pré, however, was someone the British had taken to their hearts. Part of the reason was her special relationship with the Elgar cello concerto, a work which has always played an important part in British cultural life; there may be room for disagreement with all three parts of the analysis, but at the time of her death I remember her being described as the greatest interpreter of the greatest work by the nation's greatest composer.",/review/rw3235168/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2013,pc95,7," Involving Memoir
","Directed by Anand Tucker, ""Hilary and Jackie"" released in 1998, is an involving film reportedly derived from the older sister, Hilary's memoir of her life with her younger sister from the 50's through the 80's. Right away the movie succeeds pulling in interest with great scenes of the characters as children, and the dynamics and feelings involved with the mother pushing her talented girls toward their instruments and talents. These were good foundation scenes for the 2 actresses, Emily Watson and Rachel Griffths to continue and build. Without going too much going into detail the story effectively looks at several forces which evolve and morph childhood into adulthood, and the pressures involved with adulthood. (spoiler) The movie is certainly interesting, however the pacing slows a bit and as the sisters become more distant, so too does the movie. Nevertheless, there were deserved nominations for the actresses. 7/10 Recommended.",/review/rw3235168/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2000,rps-2,9," Outstanding!
","This is a compellingly human, intensely deep and agonizingly sad film. Seldom has the close and loving relationship between sisters, with the inevitable conflicts and jealousies, been so well portrayed. This would be a story worth telling even if it had been done poorly. But the photography and editing are exceptional; beautifully composed and hauntingly lit shots, sweeping panoramas of sand and sea, busy  moving takes, each wedded to the strong emotions of the particular moment. This is the cinema's equivalent to a haunting concerto, an epic poem or a delicate watercolour. When so many bad films are made, it is a joy to experience one which is truly superb!",/review/rw3235168/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2009,moviesleuth2,6," Goes from bad to good
","""Hilary and Jackie"" gets off to a weak start, but by the end of the film it has become quite engaging. In fact, the last hour or so of the film is good enough to almost warrant a recommendation, but the first 30 minutes are too rough for me to do so with a good conscience, and the middle hour simply isn't engaging enough.",/review/rw3235168/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2015,jlthornb51,9," A Moving Story and A Stunning Performance
","Emily Watson is nothing less than astonishing in this film and what she does is nothing less than the performance of a lifetime. Nominated for an Academy Award (and outrageously not awarded it), Watson IS the character of Hillary Dupree and no one in the audience can deny that fact as she disappears completely into the soul of the cellist. In fact, she mastered the cello totally to play this role and throws herself into the passion of playing with a fire and realism unsurpassed in the history of cinema. While the story is interesting and quite moving, it is Miss Emily Watson who shines like a Supernova here and captures the hearts of audience members. She creates a complex character of flesh and blood and passion that lights up the screen every time the camera focuses on her lovely image. A performance of incredible power that is cinematically historic and artistically magnificent. This is true talent that goes far beyond that to which simple words can ever do justice.",/review/rw3235168/?ref_=tt_urv
