",The Avatar is back and this time she is a teenager who is far from calm and peaceful.,/review/rw3768715/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2020,Animany94,7," The writers had a lot on their minds.
","Avatar: The Legend of Korra is by no means as good as the phenomenal The Last Airbender, but you can tell that the team behind it had a lot on their minds regarding the Avatar universe. And that may be its biggest flaw.",/review/rw3768715/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2013,MissSimonetta,4," Gorgeous animation cannot mask weak writing
","...Or at least it shouldn't. I was shocked at the 8.6 rating this show has. Now before we get to the review let me say this: I WATCHED THE FIRST SEASON OF KORRA BEFORE I EVEN TOUCHED THE LAST AIRBENDER SERIES. I had no bias, no expectations. I was drawn to Korra by its beautiful animation, the dark plot, and the 1920s-inspired setting. I had heard of ATLA and had friends who were fans but I myself was never interested until I watched this show. At first, it was looking to be one of the best animated programs on television, perfect for kids and adults alike, but as the season wandered on, the quality plummeted.",/review/rw3768715/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2020,KingCritic,4," A very weak Show
","Considering it solely on its own merits, The Legend of Korra is shoddily written and poorly executed.",/review/rw3768715/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2012,haris_manda,9," Not as good as the prequel, but still the best Animation in awhile
","Legend of Korra appeals to be way more mature than its prequel: The Last Airbender. Whilst that gives an edge to Korra, it also removes that childish and innocent humor enveloped in rather serious conflict. ",/review/rw3768715/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2021,miaalike,4," Avoid it if you think Avatar was perfect
","Korra in no way matches the roundedness of Avatar, nor does it do justice to the characters it takes over from the Avatar series. Can't say about the overall story and twists, if any, because I could not stand watching it. It began by being crowded, fuzzy and too heavy and aggressive, and it seemed to lead nowhere. Certainly it does not continue Avatar properly, and from the episodes watched it did not have what it takes to be attractive on its own. Better forget about it and keep the pleasant memories about the Avatar story.",/review/rw3768715/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2018,joshkej-84077,4," Barely a sequel
","The reason why Avatar: The Last Airbender was so great was because it took a fairly simple good vs evil conflict, and as the story progressed, it became more nuanced and morally gray by exploring the ambitions of the heroes and villains.",/review/rw3768715/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2016,petra_ste,8," Flirting with greatness
","An animated series set in the same narrative world of the excellent Avatar: The Last Airbender (and a sequel to it, although knowledge of the previous story is recommended but not imperative), The Legend of Korra is an action/fantasy/adventure influenced by both Wuxia and steampunk.",/review/rw3768715/?ref_=tt_urv

24 June 2012,wibi_blue,10," This is for kids?
","When I first watched the series, I thought to myself. The creators of this show must be mad. The amount of Nazi references and injecting political views and ideals into this Nickelodeon show is astounding. This has to be one of the most mature children shows out there. It teaches them to deal with decision making, dealing with loss, sacrifice and how to deal with another Hitler in case one pops up in the future.",/review/rw3768715/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2012,thommy741,10," Can't believe I'm saying this, but ...
","The Legend of Korra seriously takes some steps into the right direction by throwing in some more or less ""new"" concepts (new as new for Avatar) such as love stories and relationships from the get go and a more ""modern"" world. If you watched the original Avatar (if you didn't go right to it) you may appreciate that, although Korra really has some of Avatar's good old content such as fast-paced element-bender battles, it also feels new and fresh and in no way ""forced"" to be a sequel on it's own. If it really will be as entertaining and as good as the prequel only time can tell but for now (seen 6 episodes so far) the story is more promising than I ever could have imagined it to be. Last but not least I really want to point out the storytelling: If you pay attention you'll notice that the script for this series is much more than just a foolish attempt to catch the fame of ""Avatar"": Many old characters can be ""found"" here, revived as new roles. Great humor and action awaits.",/review/rw3768715/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2019,lukeloganvladimir,10," A Pleasant Surprise
","Going into this series after having finally watched Avatar: The Last Airbender, I was expecting it to be a classic sequel-case with excessive fan-service and more one-dimensional plot lines and characters.",/review/rw3768715/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2012,mtcousins,9," Just as good, but harder to watch (emotionally)
","To those uncertain about The Legend of Korra: watch it. It is every bit as good as the original Avatar series was. Set in a more modern world, the new avatar is faced with struggles of a different kind, struggles that relate more to our modern world. Technology is booming, crime is rising, and a revolution is awakening. This is much more real than the last series was.",/review/rw3768715/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2013,dee.reid,10," What can I say about ""The Legend of Korra"" - I love it!
","Now here is what a sequel to the amazing Nickelodeon animated fantasy series ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" should be like. It would be extremely difficult to follow up such an amazing animated series like ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" and do so without terrible results, but ""The Legend of Korra"" succeeds. In fact, it supersedes many of the most cynical expectations of failure and thoroughly holds its own ground against its predecessor.",/review/rw3768715/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2012,Rectangular_businessman,10," One amazing sequel series
","The best thing that could be said about ""The Legend of Korra"" is that it shares all the virtues from the previous series, Avatar: The Last Airbender, being a high-quality production which is also incredibly enjoyable to watch.",/review/rw3768715/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2018,chelseajmbelehar,1," Does Not Teach Us Anything but Good Drawing Techniques
",I loved growing up with Avatar the last Airbender but it had some problems of its own. That does not mean continue it! The reason we remember the classics is because they were made only to be made once and they were to be not only enjoyed but to help learn something from them. I just hated the Legend of Korra because it didn't have any or the life lessons or morals that Avatar the Last Airbender had. It was just a poorly sequel with people just in it for action with no real story and important characters that really do anything more than just go with the good and evil story line. Then go on to contradict themselves and behave in a completely unprofessional matter that used bad judgement and not real moral compass for they're actions like after damaging a window. The first season was alright at best on the story line and honestly it was very beautifully done but that does not make up for teaching our child bad habits and not learning that there are consequences for your actions.,/review/rw3768715/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2019,aarongnr,10," The negative reviews are ridiculous...
","This show is arguably animated better than ATLA.
This show targets adults just like it does kids (unlike ATLA).
This show's writing is excellent.
This universe is one of the best fantasy universes out there, and Korra expands upon it in a great and fascinating way.
This show does all of the diehard Avatar fans justice.
This show does alotof thing better than ATLA. (Though ATLA is perfect for what it was. Korra has it's villain for each season, and it works.)",/review/rw3768715/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2018,twh-00286,4," Good/Bad/Ugly
","Having watched the whole series (and seeing how many people did not watch past the first two seasons) I can break it down into 3 simple categories.
1. The Good: relatively fast paced, engaging character struggling with physical and psychological issues. More ""hands on"" Avatar and beautiful animation. Does a fair job of backstory and also tying stories and plots up.Good growth points and struggles, even climatic scenes are tied up nicely.
2.The Bad: Some new abilities defy even more logic then before (lava, really. Air, earth, even metal makes sense- but superheating earth?- but okay) Really, it is gender portrayal. Seemed very ""21st century PC."" Most men are either evil, or bumbling idiots with little backbone. Constantly needing to be saved, or saved from themselves, the men, with the exception of one seem almost hopeless. Until the end of course, but they experience little growth while the female characters dominate not just the series, but character development, depth, and overall aptitude.
3.The Bad: Honestly, this all could have been overlooked except for the final scene. Post almost apocalyptic war. A heroine's father being squashed like a bug- but everything is cool... Not buying it. But ending the series, one of emotion and actions, on such a ""moment"" seemed just so contrived and just unneeded.
It was like the writers took everyone on a journey just to ""shock them"" at the end. The """"moment"" seemed forced, unneeded, and really detracted from an otherwise great series.",/review/rw3768715/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2014,scronan2000,3," A lackluster series that fails on so many levels...
","I've waited patiently until the conclusion of TLOK to finally write this review. I am huge fan of ATLAin fact I feel it is one of the best animated series out there and give it a solid 10/10. From the very first episode you are drawn into a world where the story telling and character development are top notch along with some well balanced humor and even a splash of romance. We were able to not only see but also feel the struggles the characters faced and how it changed them. It was a unique series that despite being made for children, appealed greatly to adults as well. Now, let's get back to TLOK.",/review/rw3768715/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2018,Trixie_reviews,1," Depressing. Don't watch if you loved Avatar: The Last Airbender
","While watching ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" left me with a warm feeling in my heart, ""The Legend of Korra"" took that and crushed it. Hard. I couldn't get past few episodes, so maybe I'm not doing it justice. However, these are just a few of the things that bothered me:",/review/rw3768715/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2020,salinaqvi,9," This Is Not The LTA Part 2
","LOK takes place 70 years after the TLA, with a new Avatar emerging in an ever changing world. Let me start by saying this is not the TLA part 2, while it exists in the same world, this is a brand new story filled with new characters. The show is very good in that sense, as while keeps the charm and environment of the TLA, it makes sure to change the world so we don't have a complete rehash of the same story. While the characters are good, especially the development of Korea herself as it becomes a true joy watching her change into a respectable Avatar. With the story Itself (with the exception of 1 or 2 things) is excellent and truly shows a new take on the Avatar. This is a series that you must watch if you liked TLA, and admittedly season 1 isn't where the series shines the brightest, but the coming seasons show why this is worthy of the Avatar name.",/review/rw3768715/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2017,Purple-Dragoon,3," Avatar, what have you become...
","I really have no words to justify 'The Legend of Korra', only that it is just a huge waste of your precious time. This is mostly a hate comment by the way and therefore it has only some MINOR SPOILERS. For more depth I recommend to watch the video's of E;R on YouTube, because I have pretty much the same opinion as well and I think he explains his very accurate. You probably wasting your time reading this review, so I like to start with the conclusion first. ",/review/rw3768715/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2016,Reviewer746,5," Unfortunate Way to End a Great Series
","Legend of Korra is a great case study of the divide between true fans and what we would call ""fanboys"". By fanboy, I'm referring to someone who harbors an irrational, biased, and overly positive opinion of some content typically because of their nostalgia for prequels or related content. Fanboyism is distinct from the true fan base. The true fan cares more deeply for the quality of the content. The true fan is disappointed with a marked drop in quality, poor writing and over-the-top gimmicks. Rather than blindly worshiping anything the content creators put out, the true fan criticizes bad decisions out of love for something they see in decline.",/review/rw3768715/?ref_=tt_urv

31 July 2017,janjeltes,5," Pales in comparison to its predecessor
","My partner and I both feel The Last Airbender was the best animated children's series made. It was spiritual and had sincere, lovable characters. The dialog was mostly excellent and the imagery was amazing. We also felt there was a flow to the male and female characters who balanced and complimented each other.",/review/rw3768715/?ref_=tt_urv
