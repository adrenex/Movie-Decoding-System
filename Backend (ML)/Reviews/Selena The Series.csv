18 October 2015,ivo-cobra8,10," Defending a very underrated Entertained solid action flick sequel
","2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) is highly underrated Entertained solid decent action flick for a sequel. I am a Paul Walker Fan and I just love him and his character Brian O'Conner former L.A. Police Officer. So I don't care what anyone says because absence without Vin Diesel was terrible. Well is not! Paul Walker plays all alone so he is awesome star. Leave this film alone it is pretty good and in my opinion is pretty much better than The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) and Furious Seven (2015). You have Tyrese Gibson, Chris Bridges, James Remar, Cole Hauser, Eva Mendes and Thom Barry as Agent Bilkins who reprise his role from the first installment in here. I love this film not as much as I love Fast & Furious 6 (2013), Fast Five (2011), The Fast & The Furious (2001) and Fast & Furious (2009). John Singleton did an excellent job directing this action packed sequel flick.",/review/rw4957909/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2020,UniqueParticle,10," To me this is the best one
","So much greatness in this film I'm shocked it's got a 5.9 rating! John Singleton directed such a wild ride of fun entertainment with the cars, music, neon lights, cinematography, popcorn lines that are loved and engaging story. The characters have the perfect energy; I get such a jolly vibe from 2 Fast 2 Furious every time I see it!",/review/rw4957909/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2014,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,6," Almost as equally entertaining as the first film
","With the help of Paul Walker and Vin Diesel's chemistry and some intense racing scenes, Rob Cohen's The Fast and the Furious (2001) was an instant hit among racing fans. And like most franchises with critical financial success, a sequel started to be put into the works. Similar to many other sequels, it was distributed two years later and it's difficult to say whether it pleased fans as much as the first one did. According to this site, this is lowest score the franchise has. It wasn't bad at all but it was missing a few elements of the first movie, which left a more entertaining feeling.",/review/rw4957909/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2015,Hollywood_Yoda,8," 2 Fast is 2 Cool
","The absence of Vin Diesel is felt greatly in this film, as he and Paul Walker were a great team in the original film. I wasn't sure if I would like this film the first time I saw it, but Paul Walker was still great, as was Tyrese Gibson, playing Roman.",/review/rw4957909/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2008,departed07,7," Despite Vin Diesel's absence, the sequel's still solid.
","What made the first ""The Fast and the Furious"" movie attracted fans besides the bad ass cars and competition on the streets was Vin Diesel's appearance as Dominic Toretta, a hotshot race driver who makes his money racing others in the streets; he was a rising star on the fame after doing such flicks such as ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""The Iron Giant"" and later doing ""XXX"".",/review/rw4957909/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2013,Bruce722,8," Not as good as the first but still entertaining.
","2 Fast 2 Furious isn't quite as good as the first film but it's still a really good movie in its own right. The cast was great once again with Paul Walker returning to his role as Brian O'Connor and Tyrese Gibson and Eva Mendes adding new character dynamics. Tyrese in particular was great. If there's one thing the first film lacked it's that there wasn't much humor. It was a very serious film and while that's great, Tyrese's character, Roman Pearce, added some great laughs at some unexpected moments. The cinematic effects were much better in this film also. The only negatives were that some of the action sequences were a little overboard (Dukes of Hazard jump for example) and the dialogue had too much street car jargon to the extent that some of it felt forced. ""That Yenko will snap a speedo in 5 seconds"" is an example of the type of dialogue that doesn't actually feel genuine in its placement in the film. Nonetheless, a really good movie with solid acting and great action.",/review/rw4957909/?ref_=tt_urv

","Without the assistance of a fugitive on the run Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel, who is AWOL here), Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) who's still a marked man with the FBI leaves Los Angeles and travels around the USA to compete in drag races and making new friends along the way as well as a substantial amount of money. It wasn't before long that the cops found his car and now he has to travels by foot. Until a lady drops him off at a car lot and his money he purchases a blue car and paints it silver. O'Connor ventures off to Miami where he reunites with ex-con Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) as they join forces with the FBI to track down a shady dealer named Carter Verone (Cole Hauser), but only in exchange if they erase his criminal records. They are also joined by Secret Agent Monica Fuentes to bring this sleazy miscreant to justice.",/review/rw4957909/?ref_=tt_urv

",It's not as good as the first and repeats the first film's plot but 2 Fast 2 Furious is still fun due to great performances from Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson and their great chemistry. The enjoyable and over the top action helps as well.,/review/rw4957909/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2013,BearGlove,7," 2 Fast but not so Furious
","Before I start about anything. I was little disappointed with this movie. So second movie of The Fast and the Furious franchise didn't full my expectations. Brian is the only one of the main characters who stays in this film from the last film crew. The plot get little bit more action then the last movie so they filled up that part. They put the bad guy, so it gets some action. You still got some badass cars, but it is not about tuning this time. Races from 1/4 of a mile sprint now evolve into circuit races and highway chasing and running from police. The film is mainly about undercover mission to catch that bad guys similar to the last movie, but I miss that there is no one else from the old crew. Still this movie deserve 7, and current rate is underrated. Watch this movie, it won't have much roll into plot in later movie, don't have high expectations and you will like it. It is still worth seeing.",/review/rw4957909/?ref_=tt_urv

6 July 2015,hoxjennifer,7," The cars are better than the first...
","The cars, the stunts and the eye candy (Eva Mendes) are better than the first. But unlike the first, 2 Fast 2 Furious still boasts a lacklustre plot. Nevertheless, it's a great ""bro"" movie for the guys. The partnership between Roman Pierce (Tyrese Gibson) and Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) is amusing and works well as they team up and do next to impossible driving stunts with each other. The slight romance between Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes) and Brian O'Connor is predictable, but it's not to the same extent as the first one - just a bit of flirtation but not to the extent of a full fledged relationship. The Miami backdrop adds to the ""upgrade"" feel of the second movie in the Fast & Furious franchise. Flashy and full of action is 2 Fast, 2 Furious.",/review/rw4957909/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2005,lordsaves777,7," Is this a sequel ?
","I don't think this movie deserves to be called a sequel to ""The Fast and the Furious"",not because it is a bad movie,it is great and it does not fail to entertain most of the public,but for those who really liked the first one,this one is not a sequel.The first was very original,its conflicts were original,the movie was really about cars,and driving,and street racing,this one,in the other hand,presents us conflicts that we have seen for the last decades,the police couple that don't like each other,and at the end of the movie they finish kissing and hugging each other,the guy that falls in love with a woman that could make him fail his mission,the guy that has a drug empire in Miami,and pretends to become more powerful,the police that's trying to stop him,this are most of the conflicts we see in this movie,and we have seen in other movies,so it's not original.The Fast and the Furious was very original with great conflicts,it wasn't as fun as ""its sequel"",but it was awesome as well.But I think that this is the reason why this movie was released in the summer,to make critics say ""well,is not original it has some cars stunts that are hard to believe,but is a summer movie,what the hell"".I also did not like the decision of the director of making the movie in Miami because usually the backgrounds of street racing are nocturnes,Miami is usually more popular on daylight,street racing is usually on high ways in big cities like New York or Los Angeles,but it is clear that the director was just trying to make the movie more attractive to the summer-movie lovers because a lot of people identifies Miami with summer.This movie is more like a cop movie than a street racing movie,you can notice how hard is for the writers to make a space for races,and how easy is for the writers to find space for those things that usually a cop has to deal with.Is not a bad movie,but it is not original,and it cant be called a sequel.",/review/rw4957909/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2013,daniel_velker,," 2 times the fast 2 times the furious but still not better than the original.
","This film brings back more of what we loved from the first film with all the cars, girls, and action and multiplies it. However it is still inferior to the first film but that dosen't mean it isn't awesome. This movie has gotten a lot of criticism and i don't understand why there is so much hate for this movie. Some people complained about the lack of plot and the casts acting skills but I don't care about that. I watch these Fast films to be entertained and I was throughly entertained with this one. Even though it dosen't match up to the original it still excels in excitement. I mean how could you go wrong with taking the series to Miami were our eyes will be blessed with dozens of beautiful beach girls. And the races in this movie are also very exciting to. And let's not forget the awesome chase sequence in the film as well. Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson make a great team and show us why this movie is so cool. I still love this movie despite the many negative reviews I've seen and to all the haters I say forget about the plot and just enjoy the perks. This movie is made for entertainment not Oscar awards and as far as entertainment goes It was grade A popcorn style.",/review/rw4957909/?ref_=tt_urv

","2 Fast 2 Furious is the second film in the long running car-based action series (if you look very carefully, you'll see that the number '2' replaces the word 'Too' in the title! Clever that!). It's essentially the same cocktail of hot motors, hot girls, hot guys and hot locations as before, but with no Vin Diesel, his character having driven over the horizon at the end of the first film (only to return later in the series, once the actor had lowered his asking price).",/review/rw4957909/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2014,heatherwthurman,8," A good Action Movie
","This movie has been getting real mixed reviews .... personally, I like this movie. I thought 2 Fast 2 Furious was a damn good movie. I thought the storyline was pretty cool it is about fast cars, hot women, cool guys, and tells us what happens to Brian O'Connor (Paul walker) after the 'open' ending of the first movie. There are absolutely awesome action shots and much movement in the plot to make it interesting to watch. To those of you who thought it was not really good, maybe you should watch it again and give it a another shot, it really is a good movie. The only thing i personally didn't like is that Vin Diesel was not in this movie. But he comes back in the new movies so thats good.",/review/rw4957909/?ref_=tt_urv

","I love this movie, but honestly speaking, the title amuses me a bit. It looks a like an email/text message. Anyway, I guess it's a creative way to insert the ""2"" in the title. Haha! But anyway, this is a great sequel to its predecessor, even though I find it weird that Dominic (Vin Diesel) is absent in this movie.",/review/rw4957909/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2006,necronomicon_seeker,6," A really fun enjoyable action flick!
","This film is more of an action comedy then an action which the first film was. This film is about Brian O' Conner who goes back to fighting crime with his buddy Roman Pearce and secret agent Monica Fuentes to bring down the notorious criminal Carter Verone. What I think people don't get about this film is unlike the first, this film is just plain out in good 'ol fun. This is definitely not meant not to be serious at any level. I would think people could tell just by how the actors play their characters. The acting is very good because you can see that the actors are having fun doing this flick to make it an actual fun movie. Even though it is a fun film, the action scenes are great. Like when the car flies onto that boat; I thought that was awesome!!",/review/rw4957909/?ref_=tt_urv

","Lordy Lord! Another crap sequel from the Hollywood stable of rubbish rehashes. I had low expectations of this movie....it doesn't have Vin Diesel in it for a start. But what I got was a collection of wooden actors and cheesy lines, interspersed with ""race"" sequences that made me laugh a lot. I should have realised it was going to be dire literally from the get-go. The Universal logo mutates into a chrome-plated wheel in the most irritatingly ludicrous manner.

","2 Fast 2 Furious is the sequel of The Fast and Furious, but everyone knows that. The races are very cool and exciting, looking like Need for Speed Underground.The nitrous boosts, the escape from the cops and the jump across the bridge were extremely cool. In the story, Brian O'Connor slept out the police and now he was living only for racing drags and things like that.But he was caught by a cop at the end of a race and had a proposal.He would help the cops investigate a drug seller or he would be arrested.Then the story flows.I will not tell everything about the story, if you want to know more go see the movie. The car parts are great, but some parts like the fight next Brian's boat was really boring. 8/10",/review/rw4957909/?ref_=tt_urv

","I've read some excellent, incisive comments, mostly critical of ""2Fast 2Furious"" on the pages of IMDb. These comments are much more artistically, technically and culturally incisive than what shows up on the pages of our commercial media. They all happen to be wrong, I believe, because I was here the last time major motion picture cultural earth changes came through, and I knew it that time, when most were still dismissing what were called ""spaghetti"" westerns and ""chopsocky,"" martial arts films. The great films that emerged from these two cultural upheavals are now considered part of our mainstream culture. So will, the ""cosmo/octane films,"" which combine elements of ""Miami Vice,"" ""Beach Party,"" auto racing movies and the black/white buddy picture. I read complaints about the element of ""Asian Techno"" being supplanted by ""American metal"". Guess what? The ""hemi"" is back, and I DO see a real challenge coming between ""muscle"" and ""pocket rockets"". Director John Singleton and his talented crew have made the most of the glamor possible through this ""multicultural engineering"". Thus we have hot men and women of all races and colors running around in ""2Fast 2Furious"". As Sergio Leone and his cohorts taught us ""Faces can create a landscape,"" so here we have one of the most fascinating faces I've seen recently in the person of Devon Aoki. Devon doesn't get much to do, but she's there for the look and she DOES make the most of it. Eva Mendes has just the right mix of brains, class and lustiness to keep you guessing. Tyrese also has that look, kind of a Jamie Foxx with a lot more dangerousness. I wish Singleton had some way to give Tyrese more, 'cause he always seems to be coming out second place to Paul Walker in storyline. The plot of ""2Fast, 2Furious"", admittedly, does seem sort sort of like a bad CHiPs episode with Erik Estrada upstaging Larry Wilcox (AGAIN!!!). Styles, what count, though, and great driving.",/review/rw4957909/?ref_=tt_urv
