10 October 2009,TheLittleSongbird,7," 5.1??? As bad as all that? I don't think so!
","I really liked Beethoven. Of course it isn't perfect, it does have a silly ending, the plot does have its low points and the script was a tad weak in places. However, it is a charming, fun and entertaining family movie. I myself am mortified at the 5.1 IMDb rating. I seriously don't think it is as bad as all that. It isn't perfect, but it has a sense of fun. The cinematography is lush and very beautifully handled, and the direction was secure. Charles Grodin is an enormously talented actor, and I enjoyed his performance here, and Dean Jones seems to be having fun too. The child actors are appealing, and the music is lovely. I think the real star is Beethoven himself, whoever trained that dog should be told he/she did a wonderful job. With Beethoven, the film is fun, charming and very entertaining. And there are many memorable moments here. All in all, a very pleasant family film, I recommend it. It is not perfect, but it is one of the better family films out there. 7/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw4451325/?ref_=tt_urv

31 October 2003,rossrobinson,10," It's a dog's life
","Beethoven was made in 1992, i thought that this movie was fantastic to watch. It gets you going when there is humour in the movie. This is rated U which is suitable for people all ages. I give this movie a fantastic score 10 out of 10 because it is such a great children's movie.",/review/rw4451325/?ref_=tt_urv

31 March 2014,Geeky Randy,10," Geeky Randy's summary
","Classic '90s family comedy that is a little bit cookie-cutter, but too charming to pry too much. The Newtons, an upper-middle class Californian family, take in a stray St. Bernard puppy that escaped kidnapping for cruel experimentation. Conflict involves the gentle-giant dog winning the heart of the family's strict and materialistic father (played terrifically by Grodin), topped with staying a step ahead of the evil vet (played by a clean-cut Dean Jones) who is trying to track down his escaped canine. Platt and Tucci are funny as Jones' henchmen, but their effeminacy doesn't seem fittingâ€”would have worked better if maybe they paid a little more homage to Jasper and Horace Badun from ONE HUNRED AND ONE DALMATIONS. Bonnie Hunt couples great with Grodin, but is perhaps slightly underused. All three children are intolerable. Still enjoyable despite its flaws; its replay value can be attributed to Grodin and Dean's performances, plus the story's pet-is-a-member-of-the-family philosophy.",/review/rw4451325/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2005,rholton2,10," Great Family Film
","If you love funny animal films, you will laugh till you cry at the antics of Beethoven and his human companions. The scene where the children are trying to find a name for the dog is cute and if you like classical music you will appreciate the humor behind how the name is finally derived. I was rather surprised to see Good Guy Dean Jones, star of many Disney films, in his portrayal of the dastardly and evil Vet. I almost did not recognize him with the thick ""soda bottle-bottom"" glasses, but as always Mr. Jones gave a stellar performance. X-Files star David Duchovney plays the part of a company representative who wants to try to take over the family's business, and only Beethoven sees him and his female partner for what they are and takes them on the ride of their lives (one of the funniest scenes of the film). I generally find sequels are not as good as the first, but in this case the humor of Beethoven's 2nd and Beethoven's 3rd hold true to first and are also worth viewing.",/review/rw4451325/?ref_=tt_urv

5 March 2015,Hey_Sweden,7," Watching it does make me want to give my dogs a great big hug.
","The title canine is an adorable Saint Bernard puppy who escapes when bumbling, idiotic criminals Harvey and Vernon (Oliver Platt and Stanley Tucci) rob a pet store of their inventory. Beethoven makes his way into the house of the Newton family, immediately endearing himself to the children (Nicholle Tom, Christopher Castile, Sarah Rose Karr) and wife / mother (Bonnie Hunt). The dad (Charles Grodin) is another story. He's not a real dog person, but reluctantly agrees to take on the pup as a pet. In your typical Hollywood fashion, havoc ensues, as the puppy grows into the destructive, messy (but also very loving) big brute that Grodin knew would result. The main plot concerns a thoroughly evil veterinarian (Dean Jones, in a hilarious performance) who collects dogs for test purposes.",/review/rw4451325/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2009,Atreyu_II,7," Sympathetic family movie
","For those who have no idea what this movie is about, they may think this is a movie about the famous classical music artist. Well, it has absolutely nothing to do with it. ""Beethoven"" is not even a biographical or a musical, it's a family movie about a St. Bernard named Beethoven after a portion of Ludwig van Beethoven's ""Fifth Symphony"" is played and the puppy barks at the same time, as if he was telling how he wishes to be named.",/review/rw4451325/?ref_=tt_urv

","After a St. Bernard puppy is abducted from a pet shop by animal abductors, the puppy escapes and finds its way to the home of the Newton family. Mother Alice (Bonnie Hunt) and children Emily(Sarah Rose Karr), Ted (Christopher Castile), and Ryce (Nicholle Tom) all immediately take to the puppy whom they name Beethoven, however father George Newton (Charles Grodin) is less enthused by the idea. While Beethoven enjoys the comforts of living with the Newtons, the animal abduction ring, run by sinister vet/black market animal tester Dr. Herman Varnick (Dean Jones) sets his sights on Beethoven as a test candidate for testing a new type of ammunition.",/review/rw4451325/?ref_=tt_urv

8 July 2005,jboothmillard,7," Beethoven
","I had seen this family favourite many times when I was younger, but growing up it had perhaps faded a little in my memory, I was very much looking to watching it all over again, written by John Hughes (The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Home Alone, 101 Dalmatians), from director Brian Levant (The Flintstones, Jingle All the Way, Snow Dogs, Are We There Yet?). Basically a large number of puppies are stolen from a pet shop by thieves Harvey (Oliver Platt) and Vernon (Stanley Tucci), but a St. Bernard puppy manages to escape, and the following morning he sneaks into the house of the Newton family. Workaholic father George Newton (Charles Grodin) does not like dogs or the responsibility they bring, but he is convinced to keep the puppy by wife Alice (Bonnie Hunt) and their three children, youngest daughter Emily (Sarah Rose Karr), teenage daughter Ryce (Nicholle Tom) and son Ted (Christopher Castile). They find the name for their new St. Bernard dog from a portion of Ludwig van Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, they therefore name him ""Beethoven"", and as time goes the dog grows up quickly with filthy habits, including drooling in places, eating heavily and sloshing water and mud everywhere, these negatives George focuses on, but the rest of the family embrace him. Beethoven may be trouble, but he also proves to be a good addition to the family as he helps the children overcome problems, including Ryce trying to talk to her crush, he scares off bullies picking on Ted, and he saves Emily from drowning in an irresponsible babysitter's swimming pool, George is becoming increasingly jealous of the affection Beethoven is receiving. An incident pushes George close to the edge, when Beethoven spoils a barbecue where George is almost unknowingly swindled by venture capitalists Brad (The X-Files's David Duchovny) and Brie (Patricia Heaton), and then the dog is taken for a routine medical check, Dr. Herman Varnick (Dean Jones) is secretly experimenting on animals, and Harvey and Vernon work for him, he wants to use the St. Bernard for an ammunition test. The next day Dr. Herman visits the Newtons pretending to follow up on the medical exam, with some fake blood and hitting Beethoven he convinces George he was attacked, only Emily saw that the attack was faked, fearing the family's safety George decides that he should take him to Varnick's office to be put down. George realises his own affection for Beethoven, and he knows that the family will hate him for having the dog put down, he is convinced to go with the family to find out what really happened, the doctor claims the dog has already been destroyed, but George notices his arm is not injured, before leaving George punches the doctor in the face. The family notice Varnick getting into a van and decide to follow him, they are lead to a warehouse where Beethoven and many other dogs are being held captive for experimentation, all the family end up inside the building and following various wacky incidents the bad guys are defeated, and all the dogs are freed from their cages, and in the end George finally accepts to liking Beethoven. Also starring Laurel Cronin as Devonia Peet and O-Lan Jones as Biker Woman. The human characters obviously help the story flow, Grodin being the frustrated father who is easily maddened and despises the dog for most of the film, Jones is a good sinister villain too, but the St. Bernard dog is the undoubted star, as he slobbers, eats and shakes his way into the hearts of the viewers, the majority of laughs come from his messy behaviour and the bad reactions from it, and there is the heart to the story as well with the dog bringing everyone together, all in all it is a funny and adorable family comedy. Very good!",/review/rw4451325/?ref_=tt_urv

17 November 2005,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,9," Cute movie
","BEETHOVEN, in my opinion, is a cute movie. I thought that George (Charles Grodin) was a little cold-hearted, but Alice (Bonnie Hunt) and the children (Sarah Rose Karr, Christopher Castile, Nicholle Tom) were very nice people. Beethoven was a sweet dog, though. He even saved the Newtons in times of trouble. Way to go, Beethoven! Dr. Varnick (Dean Jones) was a little scary to me, but I thought he gave a smashing performance. I thought that Emily (Sarah Rose Karr), Ted (Christopher Castile), and Ryce (Nicholle Tom) looked nice in the clothing they wore when they served George his breakfast. In conclusion, I highly recommend this movie to all you dog lovers or Charles Grodin fans who have not seen it.",/review/rw4451325/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2005,sas6789,10," A GREAT movie
","This is a fantastic movie and is one of my all time favarotes. Although i am not a dog person i love Beethoven who is a lovable dog who has nothing but love for his family though the father of the family George Newton played buy Charles Grodin for some reason hates him, sure he made a mess every where but i guess all dogs can be a hand fall. In the movie he helps one of the kids to meet this boy who she's in love with, then he saves one of the kids from bullies, then he saves the sweet little girl from drowning, and at the end he and his family save other dogs from an evil vet. If you ask me he is the perfect pet.",/review/rw4451325/?ref_=tt_urv

11 November 2018,billingshannah,10," We all love this film!
","I don't really understand why some people have given this film such low ratings. I loved it when I was young and enjoyed watching it with my 5 year old. I can see why it's a PG as my son was a bit unsure at the start when he saw the men being mean to the dogs but I was able to reassure him that it all works out in the end and they get what they deserve. There's a great sense of justice in the film with Beethoven becoming part of the family and everyone working together to ruin the bad guys plan. As dog lovers ourselves we loved it. The dad, George, is a bit annoying at times but likeable and he comes through for the kids and the dog at the end. It also reinforces the idea that you can't help but love dogs, even though they're hard work, as Beethoven works his way into George's heart. My son particularly liked the ending when all the dogs are snuggled up safe. My son proclaimed ""no one should ever be mean to dogs, you should always love them and treat them nice"" so if that's the lesson he got for it then I'm happy.",/review/rw4451325/?ref_=tt_urv
