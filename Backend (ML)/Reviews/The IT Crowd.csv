21 January 2004,george.schmidt,," The other Ben & Jen
","ALONG CAME POLLY (2004) *** Ben Stiller, Jennifer Aniston, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Debra Messing, Bryan Brown, Hank Azaria, Michele Lee, Bob Dishy, Alec Baldwin, Missi Pyle. Stiller gives another of his patented hapless schmuck romantics turns as newlywed risk management assessor whose marriage is on the rocks when his wife (Messing) has an affair on their honeymoon, sending him back to NYC to assess his life and runs into former junior high friend Aniston who knocks him for a loop despite her flaky demeanor. Frequently funny and evenly paced by writer and first-time director John Hamburg the laughs come often and no thanks to Hoffman as Stiller's sloven has-been actor buddy and Baldwin as his vulgar boss. Despite the toilet humor (surprisingly in somewhat good taste if you can call it that) the film does have a heart and Stiller and Aniston make for a cute couple.",/review/rw1822730/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2019,cardsrock,5," Along Came a Mediocre Rom Com
","Ben and Jen do their best to overcome an unengaging story and a lack of forward momentum in Along Came Polly. There are some decent laughs throughout, but nothing that stuck with me after the credits. It's not awful by any means, but it's pretty forgettable.",/review/rw1822730/?ref_=tt_urv

",Wedding preparations are underway and Reuben is excited to marry his bride. The bride wears a sparkling headband and has a beautiful smile. Two women at the front of the crowd wear fully sparkly dresses. The best man awkwardly tells Reuben and the bride a joke about not losing energy on the honeymoon. He makes a sex gesture by putting a finger in a hole.,/review/rw1822730/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2008,insomniac_rod,7," Overall funny and tries to teach a lesson.

27 June 2004,brooke-25,6," Along Came a Good Laugh
","The story's not overly engaging, but for some reason Along Came Polly is fun. Ben Stiller just has that knack of being able to embarass himself and we love him for it. You can't help but laugh. But the film is worth a look for Philip Seymour Hoffman, too, as the child actor still looking for recognition -- and work. The basketball court scene is great, but the best is his performance with a community theatre's production of Jesus Christ Superstar. If you've ever been in community theatre, or you've hung out with actors, you'll appreciate this.",/review/rw1822730/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2006,Pookyiscute,6," Funny, but not the funniest...
","Once again, Ben Stiller gives us yet another comedy, about love, life and being an adult nerd. Yet, this sadly doesn't hold a candle to 'Something About Mary', which may have been his best movie of his career.",/review/rw1822730/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2005,christian123,5," No comedy masterpiece but still delivers the laughs
","Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston lead a talented cast and for the most part deliver the laughs. Reuben Feffer {Ben Stiller} is looking for a new relationship after walking in on his wife {Debra Messing} with a scuba diving instructor {Hank Azaria}. While at a party he sees Polly {Jennifer Aniston} this girl he used to go to school with, they start dating and Reuben is trying to act more loose for Polly since Polly is very loose. The plot is very similar to There's Something About Mary and it even steals from an episode of Friends. The film is not very original so that's one strike against it lucky for the film it has a funny cast. What really makes this movie work is Philip Seymour Hoffman, he is hilarious as Sandy and he is the best part about this movie. The rest of the supporting cast is funny including Hank Azaria as the scuba instructor and Alex Baldwin as Reuben's boss. Ben Stiller is funny but its getting tiring to see him in the same role. Jennifer Aniston pretty much plays her Rachel character and she's enjoyable. The problem though is that Ben and Jen don't make a realistic couple. We have also seen it all before so there's no reason to rush out and see this film. Rating 7/10, a funny movie that's worth a look",/review/rw1822730/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2004,biggusdickus76,9," Harmless and funny
","I heard this movie was a hard sell, which is probably why I ended up enjoying it so thoroughly. The movie is far from perfect  the talented cast is somewhat misdirected - but it's their talent, along with the hilarious circumstances that unfold throughout the film's neat 90 min running time, which keeps the film moving and the laughter rolling. Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston strike a nice contrast as the fated couple united by a hysterical comedy of errors. Philip Seymour Hoffman is wonderful as Stiller's pitiful (and only) friend and confidant. And Alec Baldwin steals every scene in which he appears (would love to see him do more comedy).",/review/rw1822730/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2005,moviemanMA,7," ""Raindance!""
","Ben Stiller is known for wacky characters such as White Goodman from Dodgeball, Tony Perkis in Heavy Weights, and the male model known as Derek Zoolander in Zoolander. But his other roles have been the quiet yet hysterical characters like Gaylord 'Greg' Focker in Meet the Parents and Meet the Focker's. This type of character is perfect for Stiller.",/review/rw1822730/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2008,Dingataca,," A funny and cute comedy with 'Ben and Jen'
","Along Came Polly is not a masterpiece in the rom-com genre, but I did enjoy it, and although the humour is sometimes gross, it does make you laugh. However I would not consider this to be one of those movies to watch again and again. A one time watch, or just once every so often is good enough.",/review/rw1822730/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2004,Morganella,10," A very funny movie!
","I am surprised at the comments that I have read so far that suggest this is a boring or mediocre movie.  All that I know is that I am a 46 year old married mother, and I just spent 90 minutes laughing out loud (too loud sometimes) and smiling. I can imagine that if you are easily offended by fart ( or ""shart"") jokes or the shiny hiney's of Ben Stiller or Hank Azaria, you may not like this movie.  But really, then, why would you go in the first place?  I was definitely not bored.  The characters were all so much fun- the kind of creepy boss, the obnoxious but extremely lovable best friend, the risk expert who finds something to worry about in any situation, the goofy, scatterbrained ferret- owning waitress/creepy children's book author, the australian who likes to free fall off of tall buildings, the priceless scuba instructor, and the very cute salsa dancer.  Anyway, I loved it , and I'll probably even go see it again.",/review/rw1822730/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2004,oscarbreath,," Along came an Aniston rom-com
","Add me to the list of folks who saw this film under duress, since some friends were going and I decided to tag along just to see them.  I was pleasantly surprised at this film, since I'm no big Stiller fan and can take or leave Aniston (having just seen one of her previous rom-coms Picture Perfect).",/review/rw1822730/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2004,caspian1978,5," Same Old Same Old
","How many times can you watch a Stiller / Aniston comedy with the same weak plot over and over again until you finally lost feeling in your legs and start to wonder how movies like this get made? Jennifer Aniston had filmed this movie while also filming Bruce Almighty and her television show Friends. Ben Stiller's character is something between his role in Meet the Parents and Something About Mary. So when it comes to a labor of love, both actors were in this film to make a nice paycheck. At moments the movie is funny because you are forced to laugh. At other times, an entire scene is being held up with a single joke. Is it just me or is Jennifer Aniston always the same character she plays? At first, I thought Aniston was playing the same role that she was i Bruce Almighty. Besides for her role in The Good Girl, Aniston has successfully acted in a number of movies as the same person. As for Stiller, when he is not being a character actor, he too is the same person in all his films.",/review/rw1822730/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2005,michelerealini,4," Predictable and vulgar
","The film belongs to the demential genre, it's a comedy like ""There's something about Mary"" -actually there's the same actor, and the same screenwriter of recent Ben Stiller movies as well.",/review/rw1822730/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2004,Buddy-51,," unspeakably bad comedy
",If Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston cared anything at all for their fans  let alone their own careers  they would move heaven and earth to make sure every single copy of `Along Came Polly' were somehow removed from public display.  This pluperfectly awful romantic comedy hits a new low for both these talented performers.  ,/review/rw1822730/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2005,tedg,," Safe
","The story in this movie revolves around the choice between safety and richness. Because it assumes we are stupid, it has two story lines to hammer the point home, the point that safety is the wrong choice.",/review/rw1822730/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2004,MovieAddict2016,," Along Came Cliches
","Ben Stiller had better be careful. He's wearing his comedy shtick into the ground. It worked in ""There's Something About Mary,"" ""Meet the Parents,"" and ""Keeping the Faith."" Now it's getting a bit old. His comedy usually relies on monkey gestures and crazy facial features, such as when he baby-talks to Puffy the dog in ""Mary"" or when he insults a picture of Robert De Niro during the closing credits of ""Parents.""  Stiller is very distinct in his comedy but now he's passed over the line into stereotyping himself. Whereas his comedy counter piece, Owen Wilson (""Zoolander,"" ""Starsky and Hutch""), came to public attention with terrific performances and has grown (career-wise) ever since, Stiller is typecasting himself. They're both brilliant sorts of comedians in my book, perhaps the modern day equivalent of the bickering Lemmon and Matthau. But Stiller's whole approach to comedy is, unfortunately, becoming repetitive. He's a funny man (and I thought he directed ""The Cable Guy"" very well much to the disagreement of most cinemagoers and critics) but I'd love to see him tackle a truly daring role sometime in the near future.",/review/rw1822730/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2004,jchampne,10," 95 minutes of laughters!
","I went to see this movie with an open mind, thinking another silly comedy, no it is not that. ""Along came Polly"" is just plain funny from beginning to end. It has been a long time since a movie makes me laugh so much. I needed that! may be, we do not get emotionally involved with the main characters, but it is as well, we all went through the kind of experiences that Reuben lives, and I don't have the need to feel them again, I know ... and, this is what makes the movie hilarious. Alec Baldwin is totally surprising, I won't say more...The movie theatre was jammed packed, at the end, the audience erupted with a huge bravo and cheers. A movie not to miss : ""Along came Polly"" is a 10+!",/review/rw1822730/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2005,thedivas-1,7," This movie is hilarious
","I thought this was about a silly romance, so I didn't see it when it first came out. I rented the DVD and I liked it so much I watched it again with my daughter two nights later. I should have known Ben Stiller wouldn't do a totally ""straight"" movie, but the comedy wasn't so over the top either. It was a perfect blend of comedy and sincerity. One of the stand-out performances came from Hank Azaria. His portrayal of the French scuba instructor, Claude, was a scene-stealer. One of the funniest characters I've seen in a long time. I recommend this as a perfect date movie, or if you're just sitting at home and want to LOL! Be sure to check out the gag reel.",/review/rw1822730/?ref_=tt_urv

","While in his honeymoon in a paradisaical beach, the conservative risk analyst of an insurance company Reuben Feffer (Ben Stiller) finds his wife Lisa Kramer (Debra Messing) having intercourse with her scuba instructor Claude (Hank Azaria) in his boat. The cuckold Reuben immediately returns to New York and his friend Sandy Lyle (Philip Seymour Hoffman) invites him to go to a party. There he meets his former high school friend Polly Prince (Jennifer Aniston), who is a very independent woman that lives in the edge with her blind ferret in a cozy but simple apartment. Although having very different behaviors, they date and fell a great attraction for each other. When Lisa returns, Reuben has to decide if he wants to live his life in the suburb with his unfaithful wife, or have a risky relationship with Polly.",/review/rw1822730/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2007,bob the moo,," Derivative, uninspired and contrived romantic comedy that shows contempt for its audience throughout
","Reuben Feffer is an uptight risk analyst who is happy as Larry to have married his sweetheart Lisa. On their honeymoon though, Ruben finds Lisa up to her knees in French scuba instructor Claude and returns home broken. Forced to a party by friend Sandy, Reuben meets old school friend Polly and asks her out for dinner. From here they, oh, I actually don't care. Close your eyes reader and imagine how the relationship between the free-spirited Polly and uptight Reuben ends up. Then imagine lots of contrived scenarios and physical comedy occurring as we drag our way towards that conclusion. Done it? If you laughed once then you probably have done a better job with it than Hamburg did.",/review/rw1822730/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2004,mm-39,5," Ben and Owen need each other
","Ben and Owen need each other.  They make ok comedies when apart, but together they have an unexplained magic.  The film has some funny moments. Just another run of the mill comedy.  Ben, does his usually physical humor, and the out of place trying to get it humor.  Facial expressions are Ben's best asset.  Jennifer plays an ok supporting role, nothing special here. Alec Baldwin has a surprising funny bit part.  Too many comedies follow the ""Weekend at Bernies"" format.  Comedies try to use the ""American Pie"" gross or cheap laughs now.  There has to be a new direction for comedies.  Real life comedy would be an idea.  We need new ideas; movie's like ""The party"" had a zing to them.  Maybe even a remake movie of the Party with Wilson as the waiter, and Ben as Sellers would be fun to watch.  I give this film a 5 or 6 out of a 10. Nothing special.",/review/rw1822730/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2008,blanbrn,7," Good and funny romantic comedy of a past relationship that develops into an unlikely love match!
","Over the years of all the comedies I've saw this one ""Along Came Polly"" has to be one of the better ones, and it's probably one of the better films of 2004. It's filled with plenty of laughs, humor, and the search and trying of finding a new love from an old friend is nice and neat. Funny guy Ben Stiller plays Reuben Feffer a hard working insurance adjuster who's just recently married his elegant and attractive sweetheart Lisa(Debra Messing)and upon their honeymoon Reuben finds out that he's been cheated on right away! So now that all seems lost it's back to his job with gruff and tough boss Stan(Alec Baldwin)then one day when his washed up actor turned Broadway star friend Snady(Philip Seymour Hoffman) introduces him to an old friend at a party a renewed spirit is introduced! Upon meeting Polly Prince(Jennifer Aniston) who's an old high school friend who's back in town after moving around from many jobs she's now trying her go at being a party and cocktail waitress. And the old saying is true opposites attract as both attitudes are different with Reuben being nervous and neurotic and very cautious of the world while Polly is a liberal and a very free spirited person. Yet as both get to know each other it proves opposites attract and love and happiness is possible! Overall this is a nice and cute little comedy made watchable by Ben and Jen.",/review/rw1822730/?ref_=tt_urv
