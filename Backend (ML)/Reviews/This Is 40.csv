29 January 2023,DiCaprioFan13,8," It was pretty entertaining
","Interview with the Vampire was actually even better than I was expecting. It's based on Anne Rice's popular novel about a family of vampires through the years. This is made with mostly unknown actors who all do a great job in their roles. There was also a popular movie about this made in 1994 with Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and Kirsten Dunst. Obviously most people will compare the two and even though I liked the movie a little more this more than holds up and stands in its own. I never read the books but I've read that this show is a lot closer to it than the movie was. You can tell they try to respect the source material as much as possible and even had Anne Rice help create the show and have her on as an executive producer before her death last year. After reading through the reviews I'm glad that most people seem to agree with me that this is a good show.",/review/rw8780596/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2022,pazu7,8," I had no reason to worry.
","I was very hesitant to start this series. There have been so many lackluster and just bad revisions of earlier works as of late. The remake of King's ""The Stand"" I would just count as lackluster. The revision of Tolkien in ""Rings Of Power"" I would just count as bad. And I didn't get past episode two of ""House Of The Dragon"", though I know many enjoyed it. But it turns out I had no reason to worry about the revision of ""Interview..."". I read Anne Rice's classic novel when it first came out, more than once actually, and I followed all her works until many volumes later when her novels, Taltos and Memnoc the Devil stuck me as lackluster rehashings of old ideas. It didn't even seem like her writing. But her masterwork ""Interview..."" has remained unrivaled in Vampire lore. It was as impactful on the genre' as Tolkien was to fantasy. When the first film came out I was amazingly surprised by Tom Cruise's performace as Lestat. So was Anne Rice, who had objected to his casting at first. And young Kurstin Dunst as Claudia was truly frightening and acted the part like someone well above her years. A great adapation which I still enjoy to this day. And though it is an updated story, this new revision of Rice's tale has the breadth of history, the beauty of language, the romance and the horror of her novel. It is also true to the books in its own peculiar way. Truer than the first foilm in some counts, as in the nature of vampire tears and the depiction of Armand, although not totally accurate, is much closer to that of the novel. It is not a retelling but a revision and imo stands wonderfully on it's own merits. I was surprised and pleased and am looking forward to season two.",/review/rw8780596/?ref_=tt_urv

","I wasn't going to write a review until I saw all the negative ones, so just had to chime in and give my 2 cents worth. And give it 9 stars to make up for the low blows from others. I think it's really a solid 8 stars. Well. 8.5.",/review/rw8780596/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2023,erimerdi,8," Please watch it without prejudice
","I'm a big fan of Mrs. Rice's work especially the Vampire Chronicles. When I first saw the interview with Vampire the first time I was astonished. That movie made me read Rice's books and I fell in love with the stories and characters. Although the 1994 movie was somewhat a poor adaptation of the book, since I had seen it before reading the book, I fell in love with it too. The Queen of the Damned was even a worst adaptation but I guess Rice's imagination was so great and she managed to create her beloved vampire characters so good it was watchable. At first, I convinced myself as if I was watching a vampire movie not related with Rice's work so in time I have learned to appreciate it but never actually have learned to like it.",/review/rw8780596/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2022,shailosweetkittycat,9," Outstanding Lestat!
","Although in the beginning I was put off a bit about a more modern day story that was only loosely based on Anne's novel... I have now come LOVE Sam's version of Lestat... His stature, his voice, his walk, his ruthlessness,his delivery... OUTSTANDING! He blows me away, absolutely love.",/review/rw8780596/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2023,Supermanfan-13,8," I actually enjoyed it!
","I actually enjoyed Interview with the Vampire even more than I thought I would. I liked the movie so thought this would be a disappointment but it wasn't. Far from it. This one takes place in the current year of 2022. Vampire Louie de Pointe du Lac is currently living in Dubai and is telling his live story to a journalist. The story starts in New Orleans in the 20th century and shows how he met vampire Lestat du Lioncourt and how they started their family with the two of them and teen vampire Claudia. It's much like the movie where the story follows the Louie telling his story to the journalist. It's also different in many ways to the movie, not bad just different. I'm not even sure what I like more the movie or this show. I liked it enough that I binged the the whole first season in just a couple days.",/review/rw8780596/?ref_=tt_urv

29 December 2022,sgracedillon,8," Beautiful
","I read the books and loved them. If you're looking for a book to movie experience I would say the 90s movie is a more literal telling. The series changed a lot of details and time lines that didn't necessarily need to be changed which was off putting to the existing fan base. Truthfully I loved the show too but I need to take off two stars for some of the changes not being conducive to the new riffs. However, the concept of retelling the story decades later after self reflection is beautiful. The series reads between the lines and pulls details that were left understated in books. The relationship between Lestat and Louis in the show is gritty, tumultuous and true to the spirit of the books mixed with an unapologetically queerness that couldn't be told when the book was written. I'm excited to see where they go with the second season.",/review/rw8780596/?ref_=tt_urv

23 January 2023,tamarareid-17591,10," LOVED IT SO MUCH! SO POETIC WERE THE DIALOGUES AND SCENES AND EVEN THE MUSIC IT WILL FOREVER BE ETCHED IN MY HEART AND BRAIN
","I ABSOLUTEY LOVED first and foremost the performances by all the cast, and I applaud the accent and accurate diction by the two lead actors who both have a different accent of their own so mastering these accents and delivering them with so much accuracy, with such a poetic flare was just so superb to experience as an audience. I cannot for the life of me even imagine anyone else being able to do these roles justice as Jacob and Sam have. So poetic were the lines, the delivery, the storytelling and the soundtrack that I fell in love with Anne Rice's writing all over again! I'd forgotten just how much I loved it so now I'm going back to the books and devouring everything all over again just for the love of her writing, which so much of it has been directly quoted from the books. I loved that the romantic take which let's be honest we all knew it was the main overlying theme even in the original movie and books, so I'm glad Anne Rice was able to work on the initial episodes and give this story the life it always was meant to have, and also for us as audience to enjoy a new journey with the same characters we love so much. I absolutely enjoyed experiencing this story again but this new take. Wish Anne was alive to see this beauty :(",/review/rw8780596/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2022,muchblunt-534-683983,10," Don't believe the bad reviews.
","The bad reviews are left by snobby purists who can't just relax and enjoy a show. Anne Rice herself worked on this and called it an adaptation of her work. Just watch the show and see for yourself, try not to think about the books too seriously. A lot of things line up but the things they changed did not harm the heart of the story. The actor who plays Lestat is great at playing his thoughts and emotions on his face, you have to see all the actors performances as well! Please just give this show a chance out of respect for all the hard work Anne and everyone put into it before she passed away.",/review/rw8780596/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2023,thecinephilejade,10," STUNNING.
","The devotion of Sam Reid, Jacob Anderson and Bailey Bass is what makes this show the best adaptation of my favorite series. Jacob! Jacob Anderson IS Louis De Pointe Du Lac and he devoted himself to this role. He is SO expressive. He is incredible. His performance evokes emotions in you that sometimes leave you without any words to explain it. The way that the showrunners bought Louis to life, gave him so much more depth and dimension than the movie did.....it's to be celebrated. Louis needs to be heard and to be seen. Jacob Anderson's portrayal does that. You can see how Jacob cared, put the time and the thought in and actually gave his ENTIRE heart and soul to his performance. Every memory of Lestat and their relationship takes you on an emotional journey through Louis' eyes. And I love it. Sam Reid IS Lestat. And I grew up on the Tom Cruise version (no shade, I love Tom and I always will) but Sam Reid literally is Lestat De Lioncourt. There is no other that could convey every little detail of his rich, theatrical, emotional, explosive, loving and often times volatile personality. Lestat is my favorite character of all time and Sam Reid deserves awards for his portrayal. I wish I could thank Jacob and Sam personally. And Bailey, while Claudia isn't my favorite, she did an amazing job and bought new things to this version of Claudia that other actors couldn't have. She has such an energy about her and I really hope she gets the projects she deserves. She has such talent and such a perspective that I really respect. I hope she goes far in life, as she deserves because she is truly one to watch out for.",/review/rw8780596/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2023,ljohnson-49495,8," Wonderful new spin
","It took a few episodes for me to get past how very different this is from the original, but once I did, I absolutely loved it. The acting, writing, pacing, everything is superb. If you loved the books or film, go into this knowing that it is very much an alternative universe version of the story you know. I think if you can keep an open mind you will find they have honored the heart of Luis, Lestat and Claudia while creating something really fresh, new and uniquely compelling. Claudia is maybe the best part of the whole thing. The way they have expanded and focused on her really pulls it all together. I litterally cannot wait for the 2nd season.",/review/rw8780596/?ref_=tt_urv

3 February 2023,brooklynjade-65419,8," Revelation
","Jacob Anderson (Louis), had maybe a total of 20 lines, in all of his years on Game of Thrones. So, as a longtime lover of Anne Rice's novels, I worried that this retelling would be horrible- based on casting alone. I needn't have worried. Anderson's Louis is quite a revelation. Add to that the intriguing history of 1800's New Orleans, the charismatic and creepy portrayal of Lestat, and this series becomes readily enthralling. For once, they actually managed to get everything right, the perfect balance of commitment to source material, and necessary change/updating. Very much looking forward to season two.",/review/rw8780596/?ref_=tt_urv

","At first I was seriously disappointed in the casting and how it appeared to drift very far grim the books. I am a serious Anne Rice fan and it made little sense to recreate such wonderful characters... but...if you consider these books have had movies made about them already.. there is a key here :
You have to set aside anything that draws you to the books themselves and just look at this as lestat fan fiction. A reimagining. Warning to most that it's not like the books but I am really enjoying it so far.",/review/rw8780596/?ref_=tt_urv

","To sum up this series, I will have to say it is beautifully done. If you enjoy, as do I, films and productions about Vampiric culture, then you will enjoy this latest take on Anne Rice's captivating book, ""Interview with the Vampire, originally published May 5, 1976. Her book was later made into a very enjoyable film in 1994, staring Tom Cruise (Lestat) Brad Pitt (Louis), with a commendable performance by a very young Kirsten Dunst. The rest of the cast truly shined, which featured Christian Slater, Antonio Banderas, and Stephen Rea. The film, for the most part, generally matched the novel.",/review/rw8780596/?ref_=tt_urv

","I started watching this show thinking it wouldn't be that great. I expected queerbaiting, mediocre entertainment etc. But this show was one of the best I've seen. The setting, characters, character development, clothes, the psychology, the plot everything about this show was immaculate. Absolutely loved it. The plot twists had my jaw on the floor. There were so many scenes in the show that gave me chills. Whether it be about the love the characters had for each other or the dramatic scenes. The lines of speech, the foreshadowing, the symbolism, the use of politics and history and knowledge of art, literature and languages was used phenomenally both for the characters and the show all together. Absolutely loved it. It will always be one of my favorite shows. I cant wait for the upcoming seasons.

2 October 2022,danalaura-cazacu,8," Different from the initial version and the book, but it is poetic and it sucks you in
","Sam Reid is the Lestat I imagined reading the books., Some things have indeed been changed or swapped to give a more modern approach to the book. But this modern approach isn't, as some are going to rush to say, in service of the mandatory wokeness. Anne Rice was always woke, and one need only read her books to know so. I am sorry to say, folks, but Louis was always gay. I love the frailty in Jacob Anderson's performance. I think that is the essence of his struggle too, and a wonderful thing to witness, frailty in an immortal creature. Perhaps, this is why Lestat, in his alienation, which is his cornerstone, made Louis a vampire. For Lestat, only beauty matters, and Louis is plenty of that both as a human and a vampire. Romantic to the core. If you are a fan of books, then you should see it. Can't wait for Claudia to arrive.",/review/rw8780596/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2023,crunkgeorgew,8," A great adaptation
","I am not a professional critic but I really enjoyed this first season. I enjoyed the movie in 94' and have read the books and I appreciated this adaptation a lot. The change of setting to the 1900s from the late 1700s was a fresh take from the books and I loved it. I personally prefer adaptations that honor the book but also differ. I thought that all the performances by the actors and actresses were very well done. Sam Reid makes a wonderful Lestat and gave an amazing performance. I also appreciated that there was no restraint in making it bloody and brutal. If you love vampires I am sure you will love this show, it's personally now one of my top 5 vampire adaptations of all time. I am very much looking forward to the next season, and I hope it receives the attention it deserves.",/review/rw8780596/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2022,arod_85,10," Surprisingly Really Good.
","Out of each of the anticipated shows to come out recently (Lord of the Rings, House of Dragon, etc.) IWTV was the show I had the least amount of interest in. Imagine my surprise to see that this show was superior to the other two. It is actually very well acted and well written. The controversial changes and updates do not feel like a political agenda is being pushed, but instead, enrich the story and make it more complex and fascinating. I am a big fan of the movie and first few books. This series draws parallels to both while still managing to be modern and fresh. I really enjoyed Tom and Brad in the movie but I honestly feel that Jacob Anderson and Sam Reid are stupendous and do the roles justice. I won't compare because the stories are different, however, the casting for each is appropriate for the movie and for the series. The series is very intelligent, more intelligent then one would initially give it credit for. I've watched several times to fully understand what is going on and I've come to learn that nearly each scene has some relevance to the overall story. I do tend to be a little more on the conservative side, but have to say, I fell in love with the tumultuous love story aspect of the show. It can get a little campy in some areas but for the most part, it takes itself seriously, which I appreciate. The dialogue and costumes are eloquent and beautiful. If you haven't seen the series, give it a chance and you may be surprised how much you enjoy it. I cannot wait for season 2 and hope there are many more seasons to come. This is one show that has kind of stuck with me and I find myself listening to podcasts and discussing on Reddit which is something I have never been compelled to do before. Loved this.",/review/rw8780596/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2023,amelialundgren,10," Fresh blood anyone?
","This show had no right to be THIS good. Yes it is different from the book, it reimagines the source material - but it does so thoughtfully and with a big dash of love and understanding. If that annoys you, go watch the movie, read the book again? You're the dog barking up this tree, go to one that suits you? This show has freshened up the story and adapted it wonderfully to work for a longer form of conten. Yes, so far this review is very much a response to many of the bad ratings on here- but I do want to point out that saying that something is different from the source material isn't critique in of it self. I do genuinely give this 10/10, I don't do that lightly. Ive recommended this show to anyone who would listen. So let's get into it?",/review/rw8780596/?ref_=tt_urv
