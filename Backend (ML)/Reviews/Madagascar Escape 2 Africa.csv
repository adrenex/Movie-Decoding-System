4 January 2010,TheLittleSongbird,7," Very entertaining and colourful, and does it live up the first? Yes it does
","The first Madagascar was a colourful and above average animated movie. I saw its sequel last night for the first time, not sure not to expect, and I was surprised. It actually lives up to the first pretty much (and almost surpasses it), it isn't as zany in terms of humour to its original despite some very clever references, but it has more heart than the first film did. Of course the plot is very predictable and I did notice one or two similarities with the Lion King, and probably slower than pace. But it is well the watch, for a number of reasons. The animation was beautiful and very colourful, even more so than the original. The characters are still great, the penguins were great fun, but Julien was absolutely hilarious here. The voice actors bring a lot of vigour into the film, Jada Pinkett Smith has more to do here, Ben Stiller and Chris Rock provide great comedy and heart and Sacha Baron Cohen is a hoot as Julien. Plus there is a sweet romantic interlude between Melman and Gloria. All in all, a fun sequel that lives up to the first. 7/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2008768/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Madagascar
","It's hard to say if is an improvement or not on the original, but it's certainly a good continuation of the story this time more focused on Alex's origin and life. The animation looks great, the humor is on point of course, and the characters with so much more development. With some great moments is a fun sequel to all ages!",/review/rw2008768/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2008,Ramascreen,8," You Got To Move It, Move It!
","Rarely have I seen animated family sequel movie that's as good or better than its predecessor but speaking as a movie freak who didn't like the first installment, I gotta say I'm very much entertained by MADAGASCAR: ESCAPE 2 Africa and it way funnier than the original movie. Dreamworks has a habit of doing this what it lacks in its story and overall animation (Pixar still rules in those departments!) it makes up for it in its sense of humor. This is the movie that every age can enjoy and it has only a very, very few silly, lame moments but for the most part, you just got to move it, move it! The whole team is back, it doesn't take long for you to remember what each character is all about, there's no need for re-introduction but there is a bunch of new characters thrown in to the den without having to take us in unnecessary complication of having to understand what they are. The concept is simple and the jokes are funny. Here you see all the characters stranded in Africa and meet a their own kind. It's the freedom they've always wanted but don't really want at the same time. They have trouble fitting in and getting in touch with their heritage, all the while friendship and feelings are being put to the test resulting in an exciting adventure at the end that brings them closer together again. Kids will love it, Parents will be glad about it, and the rest of us will find it to be very amusing.",/review/rw2008768/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2008,Smells_Like_Cheese,7," I wanna see a spin off with the penguins!
","I am a fan of the first Madagascar film, I know there are a lot of people who dissed it, but I thought it was cute. So when I saw the trailer for Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, I was excited. I saw it on Friday and I absolutely enjoyed this fun family film. I think this even had a more coherent plot as well, plus how could you not love the penguins? They are absolutely hilarious and need their own movie, maybe a Full Metal Jacket with penguins! Anyways, I loved the characters so much, they're back and better than ever. They even ended up giving the little old lady from the first Madagascar who fought Alex the Lion, she has a bigger role and was so awesome to watch and listen too. I think the jokes were even funnier than the first Madagascar, my favorite scene without a doubt was the plane sequence in the beginning. But the whole story was just a blast to watch.",/review/rw2008768/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2008,DICK STEEL,7," A Nutshell Review: Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa
","Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer and Jada Pinkett Smith are back in their animated animal roles which 3 years ago saw their zoo animals being transported to Madagascar in a typical fish out of water tale, where they had to rely on their street smarts and friendship to survive in an environment they do not fully understand. While it's the usual pop-culture jokes and witty one liners that plague recent animated films, there were some gems in that movie, the ones which stuck suck as the crowd favourite penguins stealing the whole show, as well as the madcap rave party tune Move It!",/review/rw2008768/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2009,ccthemovieman-1,10," Another Madagascar Winner
","Well, so far ""Madagascar"" is two-for-two in the laughs department. This is just as good, if not better, than the first film.",/review/rw2008768/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2018,cricketbat,6," I don't get the hype
","An entertaining cartoon with some funny moments. However, once again, I just don't get the hype surrounding it.",/review/rw2008768/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2008,diac228,7," The animation was better, there is a stronger story, there is more heart....but....
","The original Madagascar was a break from the typical mold in family animated entertainment; it was fearless, didn't slow down to teach a lesson, and was not afraid of entertaining solely on physical humor. The content was light, but it was so satisfying that it wound up being Dreamwork's second best animated movie of them allbehind Shrek. The zany cast of characters easily exceeds the number of memorable characters in Shrek, and contained more humor and creativity than all of the other Dreamworks animated flicks before and ever since.",/review/rw2008768/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2017,filipemanuelneto,8," A sequel that almost surpassed the original.
","Usually, when a film achieves remarkable financial success, the film industry arranges for space for one or two sequels. This is what happened with ""Madagascar"", but the sequel was able to maintain the initial level of quality. In this film, the attempt of the four zoo animals to return to the US fails and, by great coincidence (this only happens in the films), they end up falling in Central Africa, in the animal reserve where Alex was born, which allows him to know his parents and origins. The film is very good and fun, it retains most of the cast and voice actors of the original film and adds or recovers some characters, such as the Elder Lady, who gains some protagonism here, alongside Alex's parents. I also noticed that some characters who, in the initial movie, were secondary, were now approached for a more central space, a measure that was certainly the response to the affection they gained from the public. This is the case, for example, of King Julian. The four central characters do not change much, but the script tried to give them more space and attention to counterbalance the weight of several charismatic secondary characters. The script recaptures an old tradition of animated films and creates moments where it conveys moralistic messages, especially regarding the differences between individuals (the events between Melman and Gloria and Marty's dilemma with the other zebras are just two examples). Personally, I have nothing against this militancy implied in the film. Voice actors continue to perform flawlessly, as well as drawings, animations, and cinematography. Oddly enough, this movie is very poor in music or great songs. There are some, but none deserve particular attention.",/review/rw2008768/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2013,SnoopyStyle,8," Much better than the original
","The gang try to leave Madagascar and fly back to New York. Of course, the penguins' plane completely falls apart and they crash land in Africa. There they are reunited with Alex's family.",/review/rw2008768/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2009,demonyoyozl,8," Madagascar
","This movie really will give you a good laugh. It is about a new adventure of the four friends: Alex the lion, Melman the giraffe, Marty the zebra, Gloria the hippo. On the trip back to New York, they had an air crash and came to Africa instead. There, they found their roots and also came across some difficulties. In this movie, there are many supporting roles. And among them, the four little penguins played an important part and even covered the other main roles for their genius and humor. From the very beginning, the four penguins spoofed the DreamWorks icon. As for their popularity, the DreamWorks even planned to make a film about the Madagascar Penguins. I'm really looking forward to it. In this movie, the film makers pictured us an amazing Africa with wild animals and beautiful landscapes. The visual effects are pretty good and impressing. And I like the theme song ""Move It"", really making me full of energy and feel the desire of dancing with the characters. The last scene when Marty said that ""Love has no boundary"", I can't agree more. And I think that this does not only apply to love between lovers but also apply to love between friends and family. All in all, this is quite a funny movie and worth watching.",/review/rw2008768/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2008,Dragoneyed363,9," A perfect sequel; totally lived up to the first
","I was really excited about seeing the sequel to Madagascar, because I really loved the first and thought it was one of the best animations of the decade, regardless of how underrated it is, and this looked just as good, and in my opinion it almost was. Both of them are excellent films that are nothing but fun and are super energetic from the moment they come on screen, and this just made me appreciate the first even more than I already did, and am even looking forward to a third installment. The quality of this film might seem more fast paced and careless, but it is just as lovable. ",/review/rw2008768/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2012,StevePulaski,8," Escaping, crashing, or vacationing, it's still a good time
","Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa? After watching the film, something about the title, when you say it, doesn't sound right. Even if you've read the plot, the title doesn't make too much sense. The plot involves Alex the lion (voiced by Ben Stiller), Marty the zebra (Chris Rock), Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melmen the giraffe (David Schwimmer) as they wind up fleeing the country of Madagascar in the very beginning of the film in a junkyard plane, flown by the pesky penguins, with hopes of reaching New York City. They crash-land in Africa, with no intentions of escaping to there. I guess they wanted to find a way to employ a title of uniqueness.",/review/rw2008768/?ref_=tt_urv

9 January 2013,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,8," A one-step improvement over the original and as a fan, it surprised me
","I loved the original film as much as anyone else. It had a flawed story, a shorter time length, and a script that contained some humorous parts, but only some parts that were too predictable; but I loved it for it's charming characters and it's beautiful animation. So, when I saw that Dreamworks made this sequel to that film, I was only expecting this to be as good as the first, but sadly, I missed my only chance to see it in theaters of that year.",/review/rw2008768/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2009,TxMike,," A great sequel, and IT IS even better than the first movie.
","In one of the DVD extras Ben Stiller comments that they wanted to make this second Madagascar movie better than the first, and from my vantage point they did it. There was more going on, the story was more interesting, and the dialog was more clever.",/review/rw2008768/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2008,dcandido,7," Better than the original
","I thought that the first Madagascar had promising characters and a decent premise, but it was very poorly put together. My son, who was 8 or 9 at the time loved the movie, however. We saw the sequel this morning and we both agreed - it was much better than the original. And, since part II begins with a brief summary of part I, there is no need to see the first one to understand what's happening in the new movie. All the main characters are back and there are many new ones as well. Going in, the big question on my mind was ""do the penguins play a bigger role in the sequel?""... answer is ""Yes, but not much bigger"". All in all an enjoyable movie that outshines it's predecessor!",/review/rw2008768/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2008,jemps918,9," Whattariot!
","Thank God the sequel to 2005's ""Madagascar"" turned out to be thoroughly enjoyable. Part Twos are usually scary territory, but I daresay this one outdid its predecessor in terms of storyline and packing in the laughs.",/review/rw2008768/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2016,ElMaruecan82,8," After the first false start (or first draft), the story finally takes off...
","In ""Madagascar"", a hippo, a zebra, a giraffe and a lion from New York Central Park zoo were lost in an exotic location and the Lion into a big identity crisis. In ""Madagascar 2"" pretty much the same happens, only this time, the writers did their homework and provided enough development so the plot and the dozens of worthy subplots could fill in a one-hour-and-half format.",/review/rw2008768/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2010,Beta_Gallinger,8," One of the rare cases where I found the sequel to be better than the original!
","I first watched the original ""Madagascar"" in 2008, not long before the release of this sequel. At the time, I thought that 2005 DreamWorks Animation effort, as successful as it turned out to be, was fairly disappointing and not good enough to make me want to watch ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"". However, early last month, I watched the original again, and this time, it rose up from a six to a seven out of ten for me. After that, I did intend to watch this 2008 sequel. In my experience (and I'm sure many would agree), sequels can usually be expected to be inferior to their predecessors, but for me, that didn't turn out to be the case with this particular one. In fact, this sequel was better for me with one viewing than the original was either time I watched it! ",/review/rw2008768/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2014,lesleyharris30,8," Fun Sequel that's Just as Good as the First,
","Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa is a great movie with a very well written storyline and a terrific voice cast.The movie is a very fresh sequel to Madagascar that I think is just as good,in fact probably better,than the first one.Its filled with more interesting characters and each of the four main characters are given their own story,which I really liked.I liked seeing all four of them dealing with a new life in Africa,particularity Marty as we see him hanging around a ton of Zebras who look and sound exactly like him,I thought this was a funny set up and seeing how sensitive Marty was about being unique,it was a good choice.Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa is a very enjoyable movie that fans of the first one will definitely enjoy.

16 April 2017,areatw,6," Not as witty as the original
","The original 'Madagascar' was one of the funniest animated films I'd seen in a long time, characterised by witty humour, hilarious one-liners and some brilliantly funny characters. The sequel is unfortunately a downgrade, a cut-and-paste job that loses a lot of what made the first movie so good.",/review/rw2008768/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2020,BabelAlexandria,6," Isn't Madagascar Part of Africa?
","Not as good as the original, even if the lovable characters are up to their familiar hijinks, with their sidekicks, King Julien and the Penguins, in tow. Easily the most memorable part of the movie is when the animals, led by King Julien, decide to sacrifice Melman to the volcano gods, in the hopes that water will return to the Savannah. Two great lines, both by Julien's sidekick: when the animals ask if the sacrifice will work, he says ""ehhh, 50%/50%."" And when the shark arrives, chasing the aye-aye, only to fall into the volcano, he says: ""I hope the gods like seafood!""",/review/rw2008768/?ref_=tt_urv
