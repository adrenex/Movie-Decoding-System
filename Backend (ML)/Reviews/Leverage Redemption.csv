2 April 2013,bkoganbing,7," Bondurant Family Values
","Lawless is the story of the three Bondurant brothers from Franklin County, Virginia, Tom Hardy, Jason Clarke, and the runt of the litter Shia LaBoeuf. Before World War I the Bondurants made a good living selling moonshine, but now Prohibition has arrived and there are new problems on the horizon for those in that business.",/review/rw2685049/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2020,Irishchatter,8," Very good historical film about the 1920s
",This film was very well done in giving us that 1920s vibe when alcohol was prohibited during that time. Be aware that it is very intense and quite gory in some scenes so it's definitely not for the fainted heart!,/review/rw2685049/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2012,WildBullWriter,8," Much better than most Hollywood fare
","Reading the other reviews, I'm amused by the number of reviewers who don't have a clue about how southern rural hill people behave (and esp. behaved back in the 1920s). They accuse Hardy, and to some extent LaBeouf, of bad acting because their characters are so laconic (that means they don't run off at the mouth a lot) and inward and don't wear every emotion on their sleeves. Then they mightily praise Oldman and Pearce for great acting when they were, in fact, just playing northern urban gangsters who like to behave over the top---the very thing that disgusts southern sensibilities.",/review/rw2685049/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2012,joebloggscity,7," Prohibition time: the most interesting battles are not just in the cities...
","Hold it everyone! Don't be put off because this has Shia Le Beouf in it. Yes, some of you loath him for the Transformers movies, Indy 4 and plenty of other stuff. However, in this one he manages to find a good vehicle to change his tact.",/review/rw2685049/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2013,tr91,7," good but not memorable
","Lawless was extremely well filmed, looked great and stayed true to year it was set in. The cast was strong and all delivered good performances, especially Tom Hardy, who once again showed how much of a versatile actor he is. Shia LaBeouf was also a stand out performer for me.",/review/rw2685049/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2013,Theo Robertson,6," Commercial Considerations Let It Down
",Prohibition in rural Virginia means bootleggers and moonshiners can make a lot of money producing liqueur . The Bondurant brothers are amongst the most successful moonshiners in the state . Their industry is under threat from Special Deputy Charley Rakes who will do anything to bring down the Bondurant brothers ,/review/rw2685049/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2013,Sergeant_Tibbs,6," Lacking chemistry, humour and grit, ""Lawless"" feels like nobody's heart was in it.
","I really like The Proposition so this reteam of Hillcoat and writer Nick Cave, who since he composed the greatest score in cinematic history in The Assassination of Jesse James can do no wrong in my eyes, was very promising, especially with a set piece and era that we haven't seen in a long while. Unfortunately, Lawless is tedious through and through. It's sequences go from bursts of heartless violence to development-less talking. The problem is its atmosphere, which could also be attributed to the choice of digital photography. It tries to be gritty, with its music hinting back to one of my favourite western TV shows, Deadwood, but the slick cinematography is just completely lifeless. It just feels like nobody's heart was truly in it (besides Guy Peace's menacing villain) with no chemistry between anyone. It was a huge mistake to try and force some romance subplots in here. There's nothing too bad about Lawless, besides its humourless and cold approach, it's just disappointingly average given the talent. ",/review/rw2685049/?ref_=tt_urv

24 October 2012,dfle3,9," A terrific (true?) story. 87.5+%
","This movie is based on a book written by a relative of some of the main characters depicted in this movie...just looked up Wikipedia, and the author was Matt Bondurant, whose grandfather, Jack Bondurant, is called ""the runt of the litter"" of the Bondurant brothers featured in this tale of moonshiners in the age of Prohibition in America. That book was called ""The wettest county in the world"" and the title refers to how much illegal alcohol was produced in that area. The novel was adapted for cinema by Australian alternative rock icon Nick Cave.",/review/rw2685049/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2021,cardsrock,7," Pretty decent
","Even if this film feels like it didn't quite reach its potential, it's still a fairly watchable Prohibition-era drama. The cast is excellent with Tom Hardy leading the way and picking up the slack for Shia LaBeouf. Gary Oldman was shockingly underutilized though and Guy Pearce is great for most of the film, but goes a bit off the rails at the end. The action is solid, however the story doesn't really seem to go anywhere and set up a lot of lingering plot threads. Lawless isn't a masterpiece by any means, but it's a worthwhile watch.",/review/rw2685049/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2012,phd_travel,8," Violent but great acting
","The combination of ""The Untouchables"" meets ""Tombstone"" meets ""Winter's Bone"" results in a violent involving Prohibition Era Western style thriller. A crooked law enforcement agent (Guy Pearce) tries to muscle in on the bootlegging activities in a Virginia hill town but some residents are not willing to let him take over. The war the follows is both thrilling and believable. It's also very scary because the movie makes you care about the characters - something that not many movies like this can achieve.",/review/rw2685049/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2015,grantss,7," Good, but a bit disappointing
","Good, but not great, and more than a little disappointing. Had heaps of potential: the (true) story was incredibly interesting. However, that may be the problem - there is too much to cram into a 2-hour movie. A mini-series may the more ideal medium. Certain events get glossed over. Some development of some of the more interesting sub-plots is required. Plus, we are lead down a few blind-alleys, plot-wise. The pacing is uneven too - better direction and editing was required.

26 June 2019,arthur_tafero,6," Better Than Average Depression Movie - Lawless
","The reason people love films like Bonnie and Clyde and Hard Times is because it portrays people fighting back; fighting back against a society that has not given most of them a second thought. Modern movie-goers can identify with these characters because their governments (from wherever they are from) oven overlook millions of their own citizens who are fighting on a daily basis to make ends meet. This is why the characters in these films are appealing. I don't recollect anyone ever rooting for the police or the government in the theater I watched the film in; and I saw the film with a cop buddy of mine.
The film is a tad violent, but these were violent times. Based on the recollections of three bootleg brothers, it paints a fascinating picture of Virginia in 1931. Don't worry, this aint the Waltons.",/review/rw2685049/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2020,masonsaul,6," Good gangster thriller
","Lawless has it's unintentionally laughable moments and annoyingly montages through some of the more interesting parts but it's still a good gangster thriller. It's got solid production values, John Hillcoat's direction is really good and it's beautifully filmed. The action is thrilling and the soundtrack is great. Shia LaBeouf and Tom Hardy both give great performances. Mia Wasikowska, Dane DeHaan, Jason Clarke, Guy Pearce and Gary Oldman are all really good but Jessica Chastain is unfortunately wasted in a bland role.",/review/rw2685049/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2012,littlemartinarocena,3," Less Than Lawless
","Wanting to be so many things, sometimes, leaves you with very little. ""Lawless"" is a blatant example of that. Everything feels so unauthentic no matter how much effort has been put into accomplishing the opposite. The script is rambling and sketchy as well as starchy and, at times, downright annoying. Tom Hardy is one of my favorites of late, but here, he seems to be impersonating someone. It felt like a self-conscious parody. And Shia LaBeouf? What's with this man? Why is he playing leads in films? He, I'm sure, must have acting coaches and he is, clearly, following instructions, but what about the truth? He acts up a storm but there is not a moment of truth, not one. Look at the moment when he's told his friend Cricket has been killed. I felt embarrassed for him. Jessica Chastain's character suffers a radical change in the middle of the story and I kept wondering, how? when? and more importantly, why? Gary Oldman is always a pleasure to watch and Mia Wasikowska is lovely and does the most with the little she was given. The lack of chemistry between her and LaBeouf is unavoidable. He is acting all the time. The only highlight, really, is Guy Pearce. His performance is fearless and enormously entertaining.",/review/rw2685049/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2017,nogodnomasters,8," Beyond the point of forgiveness
","During prohibition in Franklin Co. Virginia, three restaurant entrepreneur brothers operate an illegal moonshine business. Unfortunately everyone wants a piece of the pie, one that they are not eager to share. The brothers consist of Forrest (Tom Hardy), the brains and philosopher of the group. Howard (Jason Clarke) is a berserker, and Jack (Shia LaBeouf) is the shy driver. Jack is sweet on a Mennonite preacher's daughter (Mia Wasikowska) who likes his ""bad boy"" image.",/review/rw2685049/?ref_=tt_urv

15 November 2020,eva3si0n,8," Lawless is a typical B-movie in structure
","Lawless is a typical B-movie in structure. Here is a straightforward plot with a previously known climax and denouement. And the era itself has already been described so many times that it is almost impossible to tell something new. In such cases, only the cast can be of interest. And in this regard, Lawless hits exactly the target. This is a great cast. That Tom Hardy, that Guy Pierce fit perfectly into his roles. Yes, Shia LaBeouf played his role perfectly, as did Jessica Chastain. An excellent film that critics probably did not like at one time. This is a purely spectator simple movie.",/review/rw2685049/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2012,JohnRayPeterson,8," This is a really fine movie
","This is a really fine movie; there is a subtle difference between a work of which you would say 'the movie was fine' and the deliberate syntax I chose: 'fine movie '. If you can appreciate the nuance, you can appreciate the performances delivered by the superb cast. Indeed the producers and or directors as well as those responsible for casting the likes of Tom Hardy, Guy Pierce, Gary Oldman, Shia LaBeouf, Jason Clarke, Jessica Chastain and Mia Wasikoska must be commended for their choice. The filmographies of Pierce, Hardy, Oldman, LaBeouf and Wasikoska made this a film I would not have missed, one I awaited with as much anticipation as the next Bond flick, but not for the same reasons. These five consummate professionals were impeccable in depicting characters of Matt Bondurant's novel.",/review/rw2685049/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2012,DICK STEEL,6," A Nutshell Review: Lawless
","In competition at this year's Cannes Film Festival, Lawless is a tale set against the 20s Prohibition era in the United States, telling the historical tale about the three Bondurant Brothers running their moonshine business, and seemingly, against all odds, came through a period of corruption, lawlessness, and just about having to watch over their shoulders almost all of the time while they eke out a living. Based on the book The Wettest County in the World written by one of their descendants Matt Bondurant, the film boasts a stellar A-list cast but didn't seem to lift the film under the direction of Australian director John Hillcoat.",/review/rw2685049/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2014,Seraphion,7," A little bit of mafias, cowboys, and a sprinkle of romance
","I like how the movie can balance between the quite contrast elements of the crime, both the single elements and the organized elements, and the romance ingredient. Based on a true story and having quite many big talent names, this movie can quite get the balance between the story and the scenario so that the stars can have enough duration to depict their significance in the story without being just a complementary cast. I like how the final conflict comes so fast without building up with time much time. I also like how the movie has quite a down played overall mood despite it's hard and violent tale. I like how Tom Hardy acted out his lead role here; he can really get the depiction of responsibility and determination on his brothers. Shia Lebouf depicts the kid brother nicely, showing off everywhere without really realizing the consequences. Jessica Chastain was bold enough to got total on her role here, and Mia Wasikowska and Gary Oldman gives just enough to breathe live to their respective characters.",/review/rw2685049/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2013,jessicareid,10," Brilliant drama
",A lot of people are giving Lawless fairly negative reviews so I think I need to explain why it's such a great film. First of all it's really unique because of the specific setting of it during the prohibition in the United States which made it interesting viewing.,/review/rw2685049/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2012,ThePadraigMoista,7," Everything seemed to good to be true. And it was, but only a little bit.
","Lawless has a great cast - Shia LaBeouf, Tom Hardy, Gary Oldman, Guy Pearce. - And a great story about three brother's growing up in Depression- era Virginia and based on a true story. The three brother's are bootleggers, but when a special deputy and other police figures want a cut of their action, their whole world turns upside down. ",/review/rw2685049/?ref_=tt_urv

7 October 2012,UberGoober1411,7," Tom Hardy solidifies himself as the baddest badass of our time
","I'll be blunt, I came into this film with low expectations. Shia LeBouf was never my favorite actor, apart from when he played Stanley Yelnats in Holes (even if he was badly mis-cast). I was getting ready to hear him yell things towards something past the audience and watch him force himself to cry, which is one of the ugliest things I have ever seen. Apart from my low expectations, I kept an open mind and, let me say, I was pleasantly surprised.",/review/rw2685049/?ref_=tt_urv
