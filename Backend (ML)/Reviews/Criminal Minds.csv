","Yes the grammar would be wrong if I actually meant to say ""anybody"". There are things that you know are wrong (double negatives) and then there are things that may feel wrong (guilty pleasures) but actually are soooooo right! More than right to be exact! And considering the age of Bob Odenkirk it is quite the achievement they made him look so good during the action scenes - same rings true for Christopher Lloyd! An icon in his own right.",/review/rw6710164/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2021,boblipton,7," The Man With Something Extra
","Bob Odenkirk spends his weekdays commuting to a a dull job. Tuesday mornings he always forgets to leave out the trash. Wife Connie Nielson is always asleep when he climbs into bed. Weekends are a blank. One night he wakes up to finds housebreakers. He lets them rob him, despite his son's also waking and trying to stop them. When they've gone, he tries to return to his routine. When his daughter can't find her kitty-cat bracelet, Odenkirk tracks down the housebreakers. On the way home, he puts half a dozen obnoxious teens in the hospital. One of them, however, is the brother of a Russian mobster. Of course, Odenkirk turns out to have a skill set that makes Liam Neeson look like a wimp.",/review/rw6710164/?ref_=tt_urv

19 April 2021,nogodnomasters,9," Does it have a basement?
","Hutch Mansell (Bob Odenkirk) is a mild mannered auditor who works for his father-in-law. He allows a couple of crooks to get away with his watch and the contents of the kitchen table bowl. He is belittled for it. When his daughter mentions her kitty cat bracelet was in the bowl, he goes full John Wick vigilante to find it. He ends up crossing paths with the Russian mafia run by a connected and backed sociopath.",/review/rw6710164/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2022,classicsoncall,8," ""There's this thing I got to do.""
","I've been patiently waiting for this film to come out streaming without a fee, and HBO Max has stepped up to the plate. When I saw it in their menu this morning I didn't have to waste time choosing what to watch. I enjoyed Bob Odenkirk in 'Breaking Bad' and 'Better Call Saul', but knew his role here had to be entirely different based on the previews and trailers. Quite simply, the movie is a blast, and even though I usually qualify these kinds of flick by saying no one could possibly pull off the kinds of things Odenkirk's character does here, it's just too much of an adrenaline rush to see how he puts away bad guy after bad guy.",/review/rw6710164/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2022,planktonrules,8," ""Don't call 911""
","""Nobody"" is an incredibly unusual film for Bob Odenkirk. I assumed at first it was a comedy. After all, that's his background as he began as a writer for ""Conan O'Brien"" and ""Saturday Night Live"". However, the film is incredibly violent and makes ""Rambo: First Blood II"" look like a Disney flick!! So, if you hate violent and bloody films, try something else as it is NOT a comedy.",/review/rw6710164/?ref_=tt_urv

18 April 2021,ThomDerd,7," Pretty cool film. Not for everybody.
","If you are into John Wick type of films, you will be quite interested. But it's not exactly that kind of film this one. Mostly because there is no horse-riding and cartoon-ish absurdity in action sequences. There's ""slightly"" more realism and the fact that the hero of this film seems vulnerable makes it more interesting; Bob Odenkirk does look like an everyday day guy in this film. But the action scenes and the fights are excellent and he does an excellent job nailing them! The film starts off well, somewhat slow and picks up faster pace within 20 min. Right at that point, there is one scene which is rather stupidly set-up to give way for the rest of the story...the one with the bus...but later things do improve. The bus sequence is excellent action, don't get me wrong. It's just the way it was setup prior to the action. But... don't look for any script/scene consistency...just enjoy. Runtime is excellent for this genre; just 1h 30min, it never ever gets boring. It's just a cool movie overall, it won't get an Oscar or stay in your movie library but it will provide great entertainment! 7.5/10 for the fun.",/review/rw6710164/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2021,paul_haakonsen,7," Wow! This was just phenomenal...
","Why have this movie eluded me until now late in 2021? Sure, I had stumbled upon the movie earlier this year, but the movie's cover/poster was one that made me believe that this was just another Bob Odenkirk comedy, so I put off sitting down to watch it.",/review/rw6710164/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2021,Top_Dawg_Critic,9," Better not call Saul, John Wick's uncle.
","Writer Derek Kolstad, the creator of the John Wick franchise (no surprise there), gives us a fun, funny and action packed thrill ride that was... ""A bit excessive...but glorious."", as said by Christopher Lloyd's character. And what a ride it was.",/review/rw6710164/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2021,tandeki,8," Guilty pleasure
","I miss the old days. No internet, no social media and no pc bullcrap. ""Nobody"" is a movie that feels like it came from another time. Just what the Expendables wanted to do but, in my opinion, failed miserably. There is no fan service, no bathing in the glory of former heroes who are way too old for that you-know-what. And no 1980 memorabilia for no reason. This movie just is what it is and the main character does what he has to do. Nothing more, nothing less. Logic? Leave it at the door! Complex plot? Read a book! This movie is just fast paced action and a welcome escape from reality. Just what we need these days.",/review/rw6710164/?ref_=tt_urv

15 April 2021,MoistMovies,10," Influx of people who don't understand different genres of films, (edit have watched it twice, better on second viewing)
","No character development, cheesy soundtrack. Way over the top, Depressing and get this one... too violent. These are just some of the hilariously bad review points made by many people giving this flick negative scores.",/review/rw6710164/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2022,Leofwine_draca,9," Bloody fun
","Another fine action movie from the director behind HARDCORE HENRY. In fact there isn't a huge wealth of action here as in his debut feature, only three real set-pieces of note, but that doesn't matter because this is strongly-plotted and extremely well acted on the part of lead Bob Odenkirk (no surprise for this viewer who's currently loving BETTER CALL SAUL). The story is familiar from the likes of JOHN WICK, yes, but it seems more grounded than most and really draws you in; nice to see veteran performers like Colin Salmon, Christopher Lloyd and Michael Ironside playing in support, too. As for the fights and shoot-outs, they're blistering and gruesome, just as you'd hope for, with a climax to rival that of RAMBO: LAST BLOOD. Bloody fun!",/review/rw6710164/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2021,neil-476,8," Good stuff
","One of the things I enjoyed about this film is that, knowing nothing about the movie, I misread where it was going. Should I spoil that for others who haven't seen it? Well, I'm going to, so don't read on it you don't want spoilers.",/review/rw6710164/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2022,afura-78800,9," I recommend to watch it :)
","Oh my god I loved this movie, everyone who watched Breaking Bad knows who Bob Odenkirk is. The gold old Saul Goodman :). His performance was just great in this movie, I didn't know he liked making revenge movies like this.",/review/rw6710164/?ref_=tt_urv

5 September 2021,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,7," Better Call Nobody
","I was intrigued by this movie as Bob Odenkirk was in the lead role in the movie. Since the scriptwriter and producers of this movie are also in the team of the John Wick series, I was expecting this kind of movie. First of all, the movie is great. The acting is great, the action is very good, the director did a great job too. This is one of the surprise movies of the year. It was fun movie.",/review/rw6710164/?ref_=tt_urv

","After a good start and some originality in the tone, the movie turns quickly into a classic bad guy vs good guy with a huge dose of non sense, endless bullet guns and death proof characters. The end is a total nonsense. Too bad, there was potential.",/review/rw6710164/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2021,UniqueParticle,10," Beats so many action films
","The most exceptional slick surprise that is so well made in many aspects! It's like a spinoff of John Whick or a cousin that is just as good if not way better. Bob Odenkirk has incredible range I appreciate that in an actor he's been in a few comedies, mostly serious characters like Saul Goodman and this is iconic! Ilya Naishuller is perfect at his craft I hope he does more, I'll definitely buy this when available.",/review/rw6710164/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2021,nishasuperboy,9," 90 Min Ride with lots of great moments!
