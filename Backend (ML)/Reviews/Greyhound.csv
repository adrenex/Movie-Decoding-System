5 October 2021,cgvsluis,8," One of my favorite mystery series on Hallmark.
","Aurora Teagarden Mysteries is one of my three favorites in the Hallmark vault. (My three favorites being Hannah Swensen's Murder she Baked, Aurora Teagarden Mysteries, and Mystery 101...a series that just gets better and better.)",/review/rw8165573/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2022,rosemaryandthyme,3," Tolerable until she got married
","I didn't mind this until the last series when it became all about her and the fiancee, and subsequently she lost any edginess. The constant personal displays of affection became annoying as well, just too often. If I wanted to watch actors constantly sharing saliva it wouldn't be a Hallmark movie. The mother is the best character. Hopefully the excessively kissing lovebirds move away and Momma takes the rein.",/review/rw8165573/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2021,teebear817,1," Marriage ruined it
","We love Candace Cameron Bure. But after 15 episodes, its getting too repetitive. Too many murders in one small town. Too many murders around the same person (Bure). Her life is endangered EVERY episode. She gets kidnapped or assulted Every episode. Sometimes twice. She literally commits felonies every episode. Breaking and entering, etc. She would be arrested for interfering with police investigation every show.",/review/rw8165573/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2021,bigtrain45,7," Good show but some tired plot devices
","I like this show. Most of the episodes are interesting, well-acted, edited, and paced. But in every one Miranda Frigon's character, the cop investigating each case, resents Aurora and tries to keep her out of the investigation, when she can barely tie her own shoelaces. Aurora solves all the cases, and the cops show up in time to make the arrest in the final scene. It's time to put the cop's animosity away. Isn't there enough conflict with trying to solve the crime? Do we really need all the complaining and stupidity from the cop? Aurora's testy relationship with her colleague at the library is getting tedious as well. Lexa Doig as Candace's best friend is excellent as is Marilu Henner as her Mom.",/review/rw8165573/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2022,cos_i_cant,3," No tea garden for me thanks it gives me indigestion!
","First let me say l have over the years enjoyed a murder mystery and the hallmark channel make some good light entertaining mysteries, their is always a place for the Columbo's in this world and this has a nice way of presenting the case but all that is let down by Candace Cameron Bure, who as far as I can see is famous as a result of her older brother being a star even if a decade or two ago, but she cannot act she pulls faces and repeats lines however there is no emotion no rise and fall just all or nothing, and this is a shame because the cast isn't bad. There are some solid actors and actresses who are let down by a lackluster actress who is not only unconvincing in the role but to me flat out unlikeable.",/review/rw8165573/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2022,wings-24366,2," Stiff acting, bad casting
","Candace Cameron needs to stick with sappy shoes like Fuller House, she does not act well in a mystery series and in Hallmark Movies she over sugar coats with stiff unrealistic acting.",/review/rw8165573/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2021,Gaslog,5," droll
","I enjoy mysteries so I try viewing any that come along. This series is rather mediocre with a lot of annoying characters. I think a series needs interesting supporting actors to keep it interesting. Too many of them seem to be fresh out of acting school, having stopped at a beauty salon on the way The background music needs some work also.",/review/rw8165573/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2022,ljp-01470,9," Enjoyable, but...
","Now that aurora's married, she needs rescuing by her husband. Suddenly less strong and resourceful. Same goes for her mother. Stands up for herself, yet aurora's husband must come to her rescue as well.",/review/rw8165573/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2021,pgreywacz-500-46798,9," Good Mysteries
","Most of these episodes are well written and enjoyable. However, there was no chemistry between her and Yannick Bisson which made those movies awkward. I love him in Murdoch Mysteries though. Niall Matter is the perfect character for Roe. One of the episodes I can hardly watch because the wig that she was wearing or whatever hairpiece it was is so awful and I'm shocked that they left it that way through the whole movie. It was the one where she was in the wedding of a friend. Anyway, they seem to come up with some great murder mysteries and I enjoy watching them, as well as the other series on Hallmark Movies and Mysteries channel.",/review/rw8165573/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2021,sampah70,1," ridiculously forced and fake
","I have finished Garagae Sale Mysteries also by Hallmark, not as good as the classic Murder, She Wrote or as extravagant (read: expensive, A-class actors and properties) New Sherlock Homes series, but it was quite good, both in acting and story, though it still spoiled by stupid (in)conveniences here and there at critical moment, overall I quite enjoyed it.",/review/rw8165573/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2021,systersister,6," Has become too sentimental.
","It was fun i a lot of episodes but then the 40 year virgin got more steady guys. First the CIA guy and then the professor. ""See you tomorrow. Good night"". No sex until marriage. Well not to be too cynical but it was more interesting earlier. And it was Aurora who solved the cases with some help. Now the professor, her mother, cousin and Sally are all detectives. All in it. And the love story is way too sentimental. Aurora has disappeared and lost all independence. New writers?",/review/rw8165573/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2021,iseire,3," Subtle isn't part of Aurora Teagarden Mysteries
",The good thing is that the solution isn't always obvious right from the start. But in most of the episodes the obvious is being discussed and the acting is the same.,/review/rw8165573/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2022,carolynocean,6," Very Good Mystery's but..
","I quite like the whole idea of these movies , the mysteries are usually good ones , and the location is georgous
But.... I do not really like a lot of the characters here.",/review/rw8165573/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2021,marcielynne,9," Always Fun!
",Good fun entertainment! Always has a good twist that sometimes you really don't see coming. It's fun to see if you can solve it before the end. Acting is good and I like Candace.,/review/rw8165573/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2022,putnamdavis,7," It's Hallmark
","The series is fun to watch. Viewers will have to remember it is Hallmark, which is known for over-the-top, B or even C-list acting, and procedural. But I enjoy the characters and the ridiculousness they get into. Based on a book series I also enjoyed.",/review/rw8165573/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2022,CaptainHamhock,4," Started with potential
","This review is for the first four movies made, as that is how far I have watched thus far. It is unlikely that I will watch any more, unless I am at a loss as to what else to watch some evening. My expectations were low and I watched the first two out of curiosity. They were not that bad, if you are looking for a bit of light entertainment. But it seems to have hit some bad notes in the writing, and the acting, in the third and fourth. The writing was 'light' to begin with, and the acting was high school drama club level at best. This is not a complaint actually, as a movie like this is good for contrast sometimes - rather like a bite of stale cheese between cups of wine. The reason that I am not likely to go beyond the first four movies, is that the main character has turned into a bit of an odious sort. She does not have a good reason for some of her actions, which tend to cost or endanger those around her, and her attempts (the writers inserts) to explain them, come off too clearly as excuses to cover her drive to indulge her obsession. The term 'cozy murder' has been used to describe these sorts of story, and in a twisted way that actually fits quite well. Also, this may have been better cast by swapping the police officer and the main character actresses. So? Watch if you are a die hard mystery buff, especially of the 'cozy murder' sub-genre, but keep those expectations low.",/review/rw8165573/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2022,sctivey,3," Predictable and samey
",You have to close your ears to the awful squawky accent of the lead. It doesn't command attention. Not great to British ears. The 'trying to be young' haircut is not a great look either. Ps when did her mother have her? 12? 14? The stories are all pretty samey as well and the cops turn up with 5 minutes left.,/review/rw8165573/?ref_=tt_urv
