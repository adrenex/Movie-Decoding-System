22 June 2017,bola_de_pu,10," Holy . . . one of the best movies I have ever seen.
","Wow, just wow. I'm and avid fan of thriller movies, but this one give me goosebumps. Jose Coronado always steal the show since I see him for the first time in another great Spanish thriller, ""El Cuerpo"". For one moment, you think you have all the pieces of the puzzles but the director of this masterpiece persistently change the answers and the questions. By the way, the director and writer of ""Contratiempo"" is the same one of ""El Cuerpo"". That's not a coincidence, Mr. Oriol Paulo can write. If you're a fan of thriller movies and you're having a hard time trying to find a good movie, this is the one. I say it's better that the 85% of the Hollywood thrillers these days. Another Spanish film that beat a lot of Hollywood movies without the promo and a gigantic budget. What a masterpiece!",/review/rw7016546/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2017,andrbdeea,10," Want to see a great thriller? This is it!
",Can't believe this movie doesn't have more reviews here. This being my 6th movie with Mario Casas I've seen these past 2 years I can honestly say anything this man plays in becomes a hit.,/review/rw7016546/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2017,mongeortiz,9," Completely shocked
","Over the past months I've realized how much improvement have Spanish movies and series done in their works. However, when it comes to thrillers, I tend to be very selective and delicate because there are a lot of elements to take into consideration.",/review/rw7016546/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2017,Fella_shibby,10," Awesome suspense thriller.
","Saw this recently on a DVD. The movie is an excellent suspense thriller. It was full of twists and surprises. The movie has unexpected turns n hidden clues. It is masterfully directed n exquisitely written by Oriol Paulo. Superbly acted by everyone that appears in it. It also contains beautiful cinematography, great pacing n skilled editing. The plot- a powerful businessman stands accused of murdering his lover. He was found with her dead body in a locked hotel room. The twist ending will leave you with ur hand on ur head. The director's debut film, The Body has been on my radar for a long time. Fans of Jagged edge, Primal fear, Usual suspects will definitely enjoy this.",/review/rw7016546/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2017,florian_florica,9," A very good Spanish film, Hollywood must take it for example
","I haven't seen many Spanish movies so far, but I can honestly say that Contratiempo/Invisible Guest is about to be brilliant. I am not familiarized with the actors from the cast, but I can say that their acting is a very good performance and all the filming crew made a good job with this one ! Filming angles, soundtrack, story line, cast, plot, etc, all of them are a lot above the average thriller/mystery clichés that Hollywood got us used to, but still it has some minor issues that, in my opinion, of course, I would have changed. Those 'little problems' made me to decide this movie is a 9, not a 10, a 10 would be a perfect masterpiece, however, this one approaches perfection somehow. 1 hour and 46 minutes are surprisingly enough for this film, even if it may seem too little for a 9-rated movie, for the entire time I didn't get bored or badly surprised, it was just very thrilling and full of action and mystery. Contratiempo is, in my opinion, a must watch for thriller/mystery enthusiasts and legal movie fans.",/review/rw7016546/?ref_=tt_urv

8 May 2017,jtindahouse,10," Impossible to fault
","I'm widely known for enjoying French cinema, however I believe this is the first Spanish film I have ever seen. I'm glad to confirm that it will not be my last, because this movie was incredible. It was the type of film that I like more than any other type. A mystery thriller that is guaranteed to have a twist. It's also a type of movie that Americans don't do overly well. They always seem to think that a movie needs endless car chases and shoot-outs and that the story should just be there to facilitate those. The Europeans seem to understand that the true brilliance in cinema comes from the writing side of things. The intricate webs they weave never cease to astound me.",/review/rw7016546/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2017,brockleyavenue,9," Wow!
","Being an avid Thriller watcher, I came across this Gem by accident....and what an adventure this movie takes you on. Who Done It, comes to mind and just when you have solved it, it then twists you into another scenario. It is in Spanish and there are Subtitles, but it doesn't take away from this masterpiece. Well done, Oriol Paulo for his direction, and well done on the film editing. I will be watching out for more of Paulo's films. Well and truly worth the watch.",/review/rw7016546/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2017,deloudelouvain,8," Another good Spanish mystery movie
","I'm not very familiar with all the Spanish actors and actresses but I'm sure the ones in this movie must be the better ones from Spain. Because the acting is really good in Contratiempo or The Invisible Guest. The story is everything you want when you want to watch a mystery crime thriller. It's never boring, with plenty of twists and turns. All you want to do is know how this story will end. It keeps your attention from the first second till the last one. I saw plenty of Spanish movies and some are really good, way above average. This one is definitely one of the good ones. If you look for a good entertaining mystery movie search no further and watch The Invisible Guest. You won't regret it.",/review/rw7016546/?ref_=tt_urv

26 October 2021,vpashish,9," Short but Effective one
",The story of the movie was groundbreaking. The Acting and direction was outstanding. Worth watching one for sure. Just felt that it was kinda a short movie. With that story a good 3 hours + movie could have been easily made by adding some more elements in the story. This would have increased the intensity of the movie. But even this one grabs your really well till the end.,/review/rw7016546/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2017,Richie-67-485852,10," Be My Guest
","This is a movie where when paying attention to every scene the viewer is rewarded with meaningful and purposeful action and dialog not suspecting that all the while something is afoot but what? That's why you stay tuned and glued to the screen not wanting to miss out on what is being acted out or presented. This is the first time I have come across this type of thriller. You see not only does this movie entertain but it also challenges you to take a side and share a point of view that when done is doubted because of the next scene and what takes place. Just when you think you have a reasonable explanation for what is and has taken place, a new fact enters in making you say ""what is going on"" in a good way. At that point, you are wholly committed and don't know that you have been captured and the movie now has you in its grasp. This is quality entertainment. Kudos to the story teller, the director and actors for pulling off a nice memorable movie that you will want to not only discuss but recommend as well. I always watch Netlfix with subtitles because I have learned so much goes on in movies that one may miss and the sub titles make little comments like wind blowing or so & so is speaking or car door slamming enabling the viewer to become intimate with the flick. My wife and I read every line and even rewound a couple of scenes to see if we were ""getting this"". All and all a good, decent ride. Highly recommend sunflower seeds or popcorn so you don't chew your nails to shreds and forget about any and all distractions (cell phone) too. Give this movie your time and it will give you a nice return on that time guaranteed",/review/rw7016546/?ref_=tt_urv

","Thrillers, as I see them, I not simply another action film. Thrillers thrill! That's it, simple as it may sound. And this titles thrills! From the first minute to the very end of the film we enjoy what we see. The plot is great and what a direction! Great! I highly recommend ""Contratiempo"".",/review/rw7016546/?ref_=tt_urv

22 June 2017,kosmasp,9," Making things ... appear
","Have you seen the movie ""Body""? The one that was made before that. It's a great movie and was just an exercise if you will or training session for this one. A much bigger scope, a constant guessing game and tension that is filled to much, that it almost burst through the screen. The characters are well drawn and this does warrant repeated viewing, just so you know what you might have missed.",/review/rw7016546/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2019,newjersian,1," An insult to intelligence
","It's a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma how this movie got such a high rating.
It doesn't contain goofs. The movie as a whole is one big endless goof. The plot is full of holes so it looks like a fisherman's net. Let's start with the obvious ones.
-The movie begins with Adrian calling his wife and telling her that he's in Paris. His lawyer supposedly falsifies the hotel and flight records (which is highly implausible). However, investigators definitely checked Adrian's home phone record and could easily establish that the call was actually made from Spain. That means the movie ends here.
-Then the investigators find out that the call was made from a hotel where Adrian parked his car. Adrian claims that his car was stolen from the parking lot. Since later Laura drives that car which was serviced by Tomas Garrido, this implies that Laura was the thief?
-Daniel's car didn't hit any obstacle, didn't turn over, the air bags didn't pop up, and its windshield stayed intact. How in the world could Daniel be fatally injured in that accident?
Laura says that his belt was not buckled. But what difference does it make if Daniel's ""corpse"" didn't move an inch from his comfortable position in the driver's seat?
-Just looking at Daniel, Adrian and Laura decide that he is dead. Later Adrian reveals that Daniel was actually very alive. Didn't two lovers mention that Daniel is breathing? Why didn't they check his pulse?
-There was absolutely no sensible justification for getting rid of Daniel's body. The lovers didn't do anything wrong. If they didn't want to reveal their affair, Adrian could just walk away. Anyway Laura stayed alone in his car.
-It is impossible to sink a car in the water by just pushing it from the shore. To do that one needs to push the car from a cliff or a bridge.
-Laura transfers a big amount of money from the bank where Daniel worked. Where the money was transferred to? The investigators could easily check the internet IP address from which the transfer was made. And that would lead them to Laura.
-Adrian pulls out of his account 100,000 euro in cash and in small bills. Any bank in Europe would report it, especially, when the account owner is under investigation as a major suspect in a murder. Police would immediately bring him for interrogation.
-The hotel room where Laura's body was found immediately becomes the crime scene. Anyway, a hotel employee not only enters the crime scene but she also succeeds to lock the window (a critical evidence) in a room filled with police officers.
-The false lawyer Virginia Goodman talks to Adrian for a couple of hours while her face is getting very close to him. She is wearing a silicon mask, and Adrian doesn't mention that? That's childish.
I give this movie just one star because it insulted my intelligence. At these days many movie producers are working to entertain unscrupulous viewers without paying attention to the truth and with minimum care about the details.",/review/rw7016546/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2021,ashishsureshbhosle,9," Phenomenal
","After watching El Inocente latest on Netflix, I started hunting for such Great Spanish crime thriller, suspense kind of movies & undoubtedly The Invisible Guest have already holding the spot in that. What a movie, to the point, no waste of time, Limited locations, super talented cast, incredible story. Once you start watching you will not leave it unending. My worth 100 minutes of watching this beautiful content. I would've given 10 however, the only reason I gave 9 is because the ending I personally thought sorry of unrealistic. It was absolutely mind blowing but, bit doesn't looked practical. Overall a must watch.",/review/rw7016546/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2018,vegeta-julian,4," So many twists that it gets laughable
","It started off quite okay. But somewhere in the middle there's and explosion of possible narratives and each tries to trump over the one before. That gets a bit ridiculous, like: ""What if x happened?"", ""Yeah, but was if y happened?"", ""I see your cool story, bro and raise you that z happened!""
At that point the ultimate ""twist"" at the end can be seen in advance and left me wondering about some plotholes. It had a lot of potential to be really cool, but it tried too hard and became a satire of the genre.",/review/rw7016546/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2020,Xstal,7," Spanish Agatha Hitchcock...
","You know pretty early in this Spanish Agatha Hitchcock there's going to be some curve balls thrown, it leaves the door open for any number of conclusions. My advice, find a dubbed version so the subtitles don't distract as the dialogue is pretty pacy to say the least - and you really need to focus on the action.",/review/rw7016546/?ref_=tt_urv
