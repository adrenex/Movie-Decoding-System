10 June 2013,jordan2240,," Just as expected - Thankfully
","Far too often, you see the cast of a movie, the previews, go in with an idea of what to expect, and come out feeling you were duped out of your money. Not so with 'The Internship.' I was reluctant to see it based on some of the poor reviews I'd seen, but my wife, who pays absolutely no attention to reviews whatsoever, is a big fan of both Wilson and Vaughn (sp?), so we took the chance. We both found it to be entertaining and funny, never lagging too long before the next joke. The Google campus proved an interesting site in itself.",/review/rw2934605/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2013,TxMike,," We really enjoyed this comedy, about 40-somethings attempting a Google internship.
","I admit, we didn't have high hopes for this movie, but we see almost every DVD or BD movie our public library buys. It was a cool wintry night here in Houston, so we put in in the player.",/review/rw2934605/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2013,Reno-Rangan,8," Job hunting: The old fellows vs. the young
","A comedy about two 70s born middle aged guys who recently lost their job due to the new culture called e-shopping. It tells how the old fellows struggling to get the jobs in todays computer world. After forced to retire from their positions as salesmen, Bill and Nick applies for an internship at Google. Now these two have to compete with the energetic, smart, young generation seeking employment who are just coming from their college graduation. With the lack of computer knowledge Bill and Nick have to successfully complete the series of tasks to get the jobs.",/review/rw2934605/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2013,StevePulaski,8," A fairly smart movie disguised as a stupid one
","The Internship is a fairly smart movie disguised as a stupid one. It's too bad that many audience members saw the stupidity and judged the film entirely on that, rather than listening to what the film actually had to say. The film is by no stretch great and often becomes too obsessed with crude humor and directionless crassness. However, when the film recognizes that it's material is relevant and relatable to an older public is when the film becomes more of a moderately-successful venture than a mediocre comedy.",/review/rw2934605/?ref_=tt_urv

Billy and Nick do not have skills but Billy fills the application for a summer internship at Google. The candidates are divided into groups and Billy and Nick join the team of outcast.

3 November 2013,utgard14,5," Formula comedy is amusing at times
","This is a formula ""back to school"" type of comedy with lots of product placement and two aging stars going through the motions. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson play the same roles they've played for most of the last decade -- themselves. If you are a big fan of them you can add a point or two to my score because they're the whole show here. The rest of the cast is made up of mostly unknowns playing various stereotypes that are familiar to anybody who has seen a high school or college comedy. They do fine and there are no standouts, good or bad, among them. John Goodman appears in a thankless supporting role. Will Ferrell does one of his usual cameos he does in the movies of his friends. He's worth a chuckle or two. Like I said, the movie is formulaic and predictable but it has a very pleasant upbeat tone throughout and quite a few amusing moments but nothing that will have you bowled over in laughter. There's a ton of product placement for Google. Literally the whole movie. So if that sort of thing bothers you, you might want to skip this one and save yourself the righteous indignation.",/review/rw2934605/?ref_=tt_urv

9 June 2013,samgreer-694-680740,5," I heard that one before
","Let me preface this by saying I love Vince Vaughn. Its impossible for me to watch any of his comedies without laughing, and I think he's nothing short of a brilliant comic actor. That's why it pains me to write this review.",/review/rw2934605/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2018,vithiet,6," Formulaic comedy that's entertaining enough but totally predictable
","Typical comedy following the usual format so it's very predictable. Maybe I enjoyed it more than I should and gave it one star too many because I work in the tech industry and live in San Francisco. If you want a better, more realistic comedic take on the tech world though the show Silicon Valley is a lot better overall.",/review/rw2934605/?ref_=tt_urv

","I once heard someone say that chart music is music for people who don't like music. I couldn't agree more. Daytime radio in the UK sucks, and the playlist totals about 20 songs which get played over and over, every single day. No originality, nothing to inspire, nothing to get your teeth into - just like this movie. The Internship is basically a film for people who don't like films.",/review/rw2934605/?ref_=tt_urv

23 June 2013,rgblakey,4," Wilson and Vaughn apply for The Internship
","After Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson unleashed the fun of Wedding Crashers they became a hot team that fans could not wait to see doing their thing again. When the trailers for their latest collaboration The Internship hit they looked fairly amusing, but had that vibe that the film could easily go either direction. Does this film capture the same magic as the Wedding Crashers or is it just a forgettable add for Google as feared? ",/review/rw2934605/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2013,christophe92300,4," Not funny
","Vince Vaughn comes back as a writer with The Internship, a production labelled as a comedy, which isn't false in the sense that it's a light hearted movie, a feel-good movie in a way, but that is absolutely not funny since the gags are almost non existent and the lines mediocre.",/review/rw2934605/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2013,witster18,4," the only true spoiler here is the film itself
","There is a funny moment early when Vaughn and Wilson have a web-meeting/interview-for-internship with google. Funny scene. THere's another funny scene soon after when the two problem solve on the eraser-board, but the REAL problem is that these two scenes are about the only two funny moments in the entire film.",/review/rw2934605/?ref_=tt_urv

","Hello all and once again it's Robbie K reporting in with another movie. This time I'm coming at you with the Internship, the latest comedy starring that dynamic duo Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, who entertained us with Wedding Crashers. Well it seems eight years later the team who helped make that fun comedy have returned to make what many are calling a remake/ knock off of the ""romantic"" comedy. Is it true, or is there more to this movie than meets the eye? Please read on to hear my opinions. ",/review/rw2934605/?ref_=tt_urv

8 June 2013,mychemicalromance-vengea,10," Humorous Feel Good Film
","I never write reviews but after seeing how the film has been reviewed as mediocre, I thought I ought to, but I'll keep it short and sweet. To be blatantly honest, I saw the film mainly because Dylan O'Brien was in it. However,now that I've seen it, I would watch it again even if Dylan O'Brien weren't in it. It was humorous and I could connect with the nerd references in the film which I found to be very funny. More than it was funny, it was refreshing. The film felt modern and was spot on about society and how it works today. The settings themselves will have you in awe at just how cool they are. All the characters were lovable as well and strayed from what I had first expected in a good way. I mean, it was impossible to not connect with them, if not at least one. The film contained that basic underdog story line but the way they executed this story line was different and I appreciated it. This isn't a film that has the biggest climax or heartfelt ending, but it will keep you smiling the entire time. A very entertaining movie through and through.",/review/rw2934605/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2013,taylor_king-890-815491,1," Can I Get My Money Back?
","This was one of the worst, most boring, poorly scripted movies I've ever seen. Clearly Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are on the downhill slide as actors, and their attempt to revive the energy in ""Wedding Crashers"" was a dismal failure. There were so many contrivances to create laughs, and the film failed on every count. When we viewed, there were maybe 20 people in the theater, and not one chuckle or laugh was heard. There was one scene with Vince, Owen and Will Farrell that tried to revive ""Wedding Crashers"", but was so lacking in humor, it was truly grotesque, and completely mean-spirited. The writing on this film was below sophomoric level, and camera work, editing equally sub-par. If the producers were trying to portray a high tech company, like Google, they failed miserably. If they were trying to parody high tech culture, they also missed it by a mile! Thumbs down, my friends. This is a real dog.",/review/rw2934605/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2021,baumer,9," One of the under rated films of the last decade
","I think when this film came out everybody was expecting and hoping for another Wedding Crashers. This film wasn't well reviewed by critics and it wasn't well received by an audience. It opened softly and finished softly. People seemed to be angry over the fact that it was about working at a real company, Google. Others seem to lament the fact that it wasn't a laugh out loud comedy like Wedding Crashers.",/review/rw2934605/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2013,bryanh2585,9," Wedding Crasher Sequel?
","The movie was great from beginning to end. I laughed harder than I have in any recent comedy I've seen in the theater. I saw an advanced screening in Chicago a couple weeks ago and the entire audience was cracking up the entire time. Even the romantic scenes are funny in this movie, and thats kind of rare.

19 January 2014,leonblackwood,4," Not that funny! 4/10
","Review: I wasn't that impressed with this movie. I just didn't find it that funny. The best thing about the film was that you get a slight insight into the world of Google, but that's about it. Vince Vaughn has verbal diarrhoea throughout the movie, which does get on my nerves, and Owen Wilson's whiny voice also becomes a bit tiresome. Apart from that, it's a feel good movie which has to be taken light heartily because the plot is a bit ridiculous. Throughout the whole 2 hours, I was hoping for something funny to happen, but nothing really does. Comedies like these always get the big budgets nowadays because they always make there money back, but that's not to say that they are actually good. Personally, I was disappointed but I'm sure that there are people out there that will disagree with me. Expected Better!",/review/rw2934605/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2014,Hitchcoc,5," Saw It on a Plane
","I don't mean to be cruel. I like Vince Vaughan and Owen Wilson. This, however, offers absolutely no surprises as it reprises every underdog movie ever done. Nothing wrong with underdog movies if there is a unique spark. Not to be. The character are mere caricatures. Since Revenge of the Nerds we have been treated (sorry, bad use of the word) to sports films, sexual discovery films, and so on, which titillate and hope to gain the attention of those of us who are not handsome or beautiful or rich or whatever. Of course, they are the people that all these guys would choose to be if they could. So we have the usual nose-pickers, shy, frightened, socially inept cases of arrested development, hidden geniuses, and then the old guys who somehow found their ways into the Google infrastructure. This is no work of art so lets not criticize it as if it were Citizen Kane. Its a silly, haphazard, unbelievable series of events. It's like eating too much dessert. It tasted good, but you don't feel all that good.",/review/rw2934605/?ref_=tt_urv
