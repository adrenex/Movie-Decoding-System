28 April 2020,Xstal,7," A Convincing Rural Tale...
","... of crime and retribution in a small, provincial, Irish town. The misguided, misled and educationally challenged enforcer for the local drug dealing family takes a decision that may well jeopardise the relationship he desires with his autistic son, at the same time his ex partner is doing the same. A top performance from Cosmo Jarvis as the family's muscle; I was reminded of his equally brilliant performance in Lady Macbeth.",/review/rw6230002/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2020,peterhorrey,9," Bold, beautiful and brilliant
","This is a must watch for anyone. It has everything, it triggers every emotion. It is a brilliant observation of small time gangsters. This is in the same league as Shane Meadows ""Dead Mans Shoes"". Stunning cinematography, outstanding acting by the whole cast. And a simple tale of morality, loyalty and trying to do the right thing. How is is the latest Liam Neeson film can be #1 in the box office this week when a film like this deserves a huge audience.",/review/rw6230002/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2020,Pairic,8," Savage Gangster Film
","Calm With Horses: Savage gangster film set in a small seaside town. Cosmo Jarvis is Arm, a punch-drunk ex-boxer who is none too bright but is literally the strong arm of the Devers crime family, big fish in a small pond. He is used by his friend Dympna Devers (Barry Keoghan) who withholds money due to him and feeds him cocaine. Dympna tries to turn Arm against Ursula (Lisa Algar) who is the mother of Arm's son, Jack. Jack has special needs but loves horses and Ursula needs money to enroll him in a new school. Dympna's uncles Hector (David Wilmot) and Paudie (Ned Dennehy) think that he hasn't gone far enough in punishing someone who has crossed the family and demand that the culprit be killed. This sets off a train of events which can only have a tragic outcome.",/review/rw6230002/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2020,robNorseman,7," Very misunderstood film I these reviews.
",Firstly it is a sad gritty portrayal of criminal families retribution and loyalty set in rural Ireland...,/review/rw6230002/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2020,13SecondFilmReviews,," Great indie filmmaking!
","This was an intense and well-made crime drama with excellent performances. Barry Keoghan delivers as do the actors who play the diabolical uncles. There are a few spots that unnecessarily slow down the pacing, but overall this is relatively taut and impressive for a lower-budget indie. Nick Rowland's direction was spot on. This film is well worth taking a ride on.",/review/rw6230002/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2021,radhrh,7," Gritty crime thriller set in rural Ireland
",First off the performance of Cosmo Jarvis is the stand out in this movie. He has a feel of Tom Hardy about him and I'd tip him for big things in the future.,/review/rw6230002/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2020,michael-kerrigan-526-124974,9," Gritty drama does not get much better
","Wow. I would have loved to have watched this on the big screen but it came out just as lockdown was taking hold. This is not a film for the faint hearted. Cosmo Jarvis plays Arm, an ex boxer who, having lost his vacation, has hooked up with a gangster type family to be their 'hatchet man'. Violence is all he's ever known. But he's not an evil man, and the methods of his bosses don't sit well with him. But he gets on with it - until he's asked to do a job too far, that has repurcussions for everyone. An absolute gem of a film. Dark. Tense. Gritty. And yet with hope. Bravo",/review/rw6230002/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2020,MOscarbradley,9," One of the best films you will see in 2020.
","There's nothing in ""Calm with Horses"" that we haven't seen before but seldom have we seen it done this well. It's an Irish gangster movie of sorts but it doesn't follow the rules of other gangster films or movies dealing with criminals or family feuds. Everything about it is different from its location on Ireland's West coast to its characters. Indeed, this is more a character study than a history of violence, (it's actually been renamed ""The Shadow of Violence"" for its US release).",/review/rw6230002/?ref_=tt_urv

27 April 2020,tkaine3,6," The B reel accompanied in this film was good enough to get a nod for a nomination.
",Been a blessing because it kinda puts you off hearing the heavy Irish accents you have to really concentrate when listening at times it doesn't even sound like their speaking English. But once you get a handle on their cadence and comprehend Ireland's pronunciation the dialogue is pretty well written. The whole film is shot beautifully and the acting was superb a melancholy vibe persisted from start to finish. Not really disturbing or ominous but as you watch the anticipation builds tremendously because you know something tragic is bound to happen it gives you that feeling at any moment you'll see it explode. Oddly enough with everything in place the story sparks but never blowups. Not that nothing happens it does run it's course but it could of been so much more powerful at the end. I did enjoy watching and the score was phenomenal an early 90's late 80's vibe and sound. The film had a great msg. which means a lot so I would definitely recommend this film to checkout.,/review/rw6230002/?ref_=tt_urv

","Douglas 'Arm' Armstrong is a former boxer who retired after killing a man. He still has feelings for his ex Ursula and tries to do right for their autistic son Jack. He works for the criminal Devers family and his volatile friend Dympna Devers. He's basically the muscle for Dympna who supplies him with party drugs.

18 August 2020,marmar-69780,8," Calm with Horses
","Calm with Horses or Shadow of Violence was a good gangster type film and it give me some very good staff in it,im not usually big fan of british gangster films,i liked snatch and some other ones,but classics like Get Carter,Brighton Rock and Layer cake were fine but in end nothing awesome or brilliant,but this film may change that and force me to give those films a second chance one day,cause Calm with Horses was a very character driven film that had some strong story that had a lot of depth and arcs that had impact on me,strugles between characters were also done in a right way and i liked final product in end,Calm with Horses was a good gangster flick",/review/rw6230002/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2020,valleyjohn,9," An absolute gem
",Douglas isn't blessed with intelligence but he is with strength . He struggles to cope in the world he was brought up in . At heart he doesn't want to be violent yet the people around him use and abuse him and it's all he knows . What he wants Is what's best for his autistic son but you just know things will never turn out good for Douglas. That's just the way it is .,/review/rw6230002/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2021,classicsoncall,7," ""Don't go thinking all violence is the work of hateful men.""
","There's not a lot to do about horses in this story, though the idea sits as a backdrop to Douglas Armstrong's (Cosmo Jarvis) young autistic son and the calming effect provided when he rides or otherwise associates with them. 'Arm' is the brute enforcer for an Irish gangster clan headed by a thug named Paudi (Ned Dennehy), and things go a bit haywire when Arm fails to fulfill a hit on a family friend who raped a young girl from the Devers clan. Jarvis is quite effective in demonstrating the angst one might feel when ordered to kill someone for the first time, so he tries to take the easy way out by threatening Fannigan (Liam Carney) to leave the village and never come back, lest more than mere bodily harm come his way. The plan doesn't last very long, and Paudi doesn't intend to let Arm off easy for failing to heed his directive. Seems in this case, blood isn't thicker than water.",/review/rw6230002/?ref_=tt_urv

10 August 2021,martynherman,8," Brutal and haunting Irish gem
","Cosmo Jarvis take a bow. Playing lead character Douglas (The Arm) he hits every note. His portrayal of a former boxer struggling to break free from the brutality of his past and present life is both captivating and heart wrenching. Set in rural Ireland, Douglas is used by local crime family the Devers as their enforcer, and while the punishment he dishes out to those unfortunate enough to have crossed them is savage, he is the real victim. Jarvis captures superbly the tortured soul of the main protagonist with a brooding and sensitive performance that deserves huge praise. Superb supporting roles from the brilliant Niamh Algar as his former wife trying to make a life for their autistic son and Barry Keoghan as his manipulative wannabe drug king pin. Throw in Ned Dennehy's performance as Paudie, a wretched local crime lord descending into madness, and the ensemble in complete. Cinematography is bleak and beautiful and the music is so in tune with the narrative that you forget it's there.",/review/rw6230002/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2021,eddie_baggins,6," A well performed but unoriginal Irish crime drama
","Also known as The Shadow of Violence in other territories, this gritty Irish crime drama that is produced by Michael Fassbender under his DMC production banner is a solid entry into a crowded sub-genre of UK/Irish films of this ilk, films that refuse to back away from the bleakness that lay at the core of their beings.",/review/rw6230002/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2020,aisharaji-99579,10," Beautifully shot, emotionally gripping.
","This movie leaves you with a feeling you can't shake. It's not one of those superficial Hollywood, wooden actors type stuff. This is gritty, top notch acting. You don't doubt the characters realness at any moment.
It's not for the faint hearted, if you are looking for formulaic gangster movie then this isn't for you. It's set in Ireland which we don't see much on our screens so it was very refreshing. Artistically executed, great film.",/review/rw6230002/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2020,rufus-rich,10," A real Crime drama. Not another dumb cockney gangsta flick!

3 March 2021,Otte1,5," This is an emotional drama....not action film
","The title, 'Shadow of Violence' is extremely misleading.....this is a family drama of person reconnecting with his ex and son. The acting is well done, atmosphere is bleak to match the story, but the trailer/title advertises this film to appear like a action/revenge/drama .",/review/rw6230002/?ref_=tt_urv

2 November 2020,paudieconnolly,4," Not at the races
",A very disappointing Film . Poor dialogue. Badly drawn over the top characters . Enhanced characters can improve a film when done like snatch. When done like this everyone is even less believable. The lead is so unbelievably and uninteresting your hoping the film will move away from him. Filmed in Galway and Clare could have really done with some actors from the west or at least rural Ireland. Mostly accents from the capital added to more badly done dub accents. But very little that sounded like rural Ireland. With so many great regional accents around the country this was just lazy filmmaking to not take advantage of it. Niamh Algar as a struggling mum was the only part that seems believable . Living in rural Ireland. I had looked forward to this film. But from the time a seen the trailer my expectations were lowered and sometimes first impressions are right.,/review/rw6230002/?ref_=tt_urv
