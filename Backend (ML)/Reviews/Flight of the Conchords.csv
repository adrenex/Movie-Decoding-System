24 November 2022,KOOLAIDBRO,9," Was not expecting this at all
","So I thought this was going to be God awful like most Netflix adaptations, but I found myself laughing and appreciating the camerawork, the clothes, the colors, the acting etc. The way everything is colorful and vibrant while Wednesday is just colorless and unemotional makes Wednesday stick out so much from being so out of place. You almost can feel how much she dislikes almost everything. She's smart, witty, and honestly kind of scary. Catherine Zeta Jones made me a believer in her from her performance. From start to finish this was a easy and fun watch. It almost flew by too fast and now I want more.",/review/rw8694700/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2022,trimblecali,6," I feel like I'm the minority here
","Don't get me wrong, Jenna Ortega's performance was absolutely fantastic. She captures Wednesday's essence perfectly. Pretty much everything else about the show falls flat for me. The plot really doesn't work for me. It reminds me of the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina and Riverdale. It doesn't feel creative or inventive at all and just doesn't work for me. The whole ""school for outsiders"" thing plus murder mystery just wasn't a hit in my opinion. I also wasn't impressed with the casting of Morticia and Gomez and their relationship with Wednesday. Overall, it feels very YA so maybe it's just meant for a younger crowd.",/review/rw8694700/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2022,mbell-56214,6," Maybe I'm the wrong age
","Had high hopes for this as I enjoyed her character in the first Adam's Family movie, and because Tim Burton was involved in this series for Netflix. The first episode gave me hope that her character wasn't going to be messed with, as in watered down into a more friendly Wednesday. However, it turned out I was wrong, as by the end she was hugging her room mate.",/review/rw8694700/?ref_=tt_urv

","As a life long fan devotee of Charles Addam's creepy and kooky family, I will be very judgmental of every adaptation that comes our way, and I have to say this mysterious and spooky series is amazing.",/review/rw8694700/?ref_=tt_urv

27 November 2022,zaywhat,8," Jenna Ortega Kills It As Wednesday
","Loved the show. Didn't care much for Uncle Fester as he seemed like an unnecessary distraction. There were a few moments where her attitude felt tedious but overall, a perfect rendition of the wit, ability and fearlessness of the Wednesday Addams character. Jenna Ortega did a masterful job as the stoic young woman where slight nuances of facial expression were subtle but expressive moments of character development. I enjoyed all the performances and the story line was engaging enough. I remember watching the original Addams Family TV show and this in depth story on Wednesday was a worthy rendition of those characters and a lot of fun to watch.",/review/rw8694700/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2022,justair,9," Wednesday gives me hope for Netflix
","Once in a while a show comes along on there that I go wow... yes, this is what I am paying for. Now give me more. The season is contained but short. Ortega's Wednesday is exceptional, you will grow to love her and her supporting cast. The music and scenes set a great tone... (yes, I am listening to APOCALYPTICA: Nothing Else Matters as I write this)",/review/rw8694700/?ref_=tt_urv

27 November 2022,UniqueParticle,10," Jenna Ortega is exceptional so is the directing
","Perfectly morbid, superb acting throughout and smooth! I enjoy anything with Jenna Ortega is quite talented and she's great as Wednesday based on Adam's Family. Tim Burton is masterful at weird/intriguing characters that are excellent to watch. The bulk of the time I use other services, this is a perfect reason to use Netflix. I love that this is focused on young folks, anything bizarre and beautiful 4K quality colors. Quite surprise form Tim Burton a lot of his projects didn't have much horror, mostly Sci-Fi, adventure, and drama. Wednesday is a pleasant surprise after all the promotions I've seen I highly recommend it!",/review/rw8694700/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2022,Idle_Hands08,8," Soooo Good...!
","Directed by Tim Burton... Music by Danny Elfan... The look of the frame, the acting and story all remind me of the two now classic 90s Adam's Family Feature Films... Wednesday was my favourite character in the films, especially the second one when she and Pugsley got sent to Summer Camp...",/review/rw8694700/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2022,rmmil,2," Mostly terrible and by-the-numbers teen drama
","This series has a few fatal flaws, but chief among them is the fact that this series is no different than any modern Netflix series aimed at teens: angsty unrealistic depictions of being a teenager, random bore romantic subplot, catty girl fights, etc. The fact that it's Wednesday Addams becomes background noise once the drama starts.",/review/rw8694700/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2022,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,4," X-Men meets Scubby Do Mysteries
","I started watching this show with anticipation having seen the trailers before it's release on the streaming platform. I loved the classic tv series and the previous films with Raul Julia. But the more episodes I watch of this new Tim Burton produced series, the less interest I had in continuing. The production quality is good and expected given Tim Burton is directing it. But there is just something off about the tv series that make it so different from the previous Addam family shows. I didn't care for the X-Men like school of odd balls or the ScubbyDoo Mystery at the heart of the film. This show just had too much of a Disney vibe to it, especially with the casting. Yeah, this wasn't for me but perhaps it will appeal to the newer generation who grew up with the X-men, Umbrella Company comic book films. Sad, because I thought the first episode was good. I like what Wednesday character did at the pool, that was funny. But the mystery behind the Hyde monster, not so much.",/review/rw8694700/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2022,jbartelone,5," Great Music and Special Effects. But Family Background is Very Wrong
","I only watched the first episode of Wednesday and feel uncertain about continuing with the series. The music and special effects are amazing! As well as the actress who plays Wednesday. The huge downfall is that in the series, Wednesday and the Addams Family are seen as ""mean spirited."" That is not how the original series was at all. In the original series, The Addams Family, the family loved being weird, and could not understand why a normal society, (seen as strange to the family) could not accept them. They still loved each other, and were kind and considerate to each other. The pairings of John Astin and Carolyn Jones as Gomez and Mortica, along with Ken Weatherwax as Pugsley. And Lisa Loring as Wednesday showed a family that loved and cared about each other. Who all liked to do strange things. But they almost never had evil intent to hurt others. In contrast, they would feel puzzled about why a visitor's behavior in their home would feel strange to them. To the Addams Family, they saw their world as perfectly normal, but very rarely would they act or react with threats of violence, unless a visitor was really a threat to them. However, the Netflix series, Wednesday tries to compensate the flawed premise of Wednesday Addams being evil, by using great music and special effects. The result is brilliant CGI animation and music. But this can't save the flawed characterization of Wednesday as mean-spirited, when the real Wednesday Addams was not. Fans of the classic 1960's show may want to stick with the original series for these reasons.",/review/rw8694700/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2022,RockyMtnVideo,10," NOT an old Addam's family comedy. It's just a great, extremely dark, series.

27 November 2022,mklarsen-51895,10," Woefully brilliant
","I walked into watching this thinking it was going to be great, bring back some much loved childhood memories and amaze me. Jenna Ortega managed to make Wednesday into a far more interesting character and her recital on the rooftop was brilliant not to mention the Nothing Else Matters overture at times.",/review/rw8694700/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2022,mfb-88130,9," Exceeds my expectations
","Being a huge Addams fan (owning the books by Chas Addams, the tv series, the movies and, yes, even the cartoons) I've been looking forward to this new iteration since it was announced a year or two ago. I can tell you it doesn't disappoint and, in fact, delivers on all fronts. Following Christina Ricci's iconic performance is a tall order for anyone but Jenna Ortega knocks it out of the park with her portrayal of the titles title character. Her dead pan, sarcastic delivery is spot on but there's a sweetness to get poison tongue... You know, like ethylene glycol.",/review/rw8694700/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2022,breneff,9," I'm Officially Done With Rotten Tomatoes
",For the life of me I cannot figure out the absolute terrible takes that the rotten tomatoes website has on actually good TV shows and movies. They literally called this a CW show with Wednesday Addams. I was shocked because I'll be honest this is probably the best experience I've had watching a show on Netflix since the first season of stranger things. Not only is it one of the best shows I've seen this year but it's probably one of the best things that Tim Burton has done in a very long time. Jenna Ortega is the best part of the show but all the other characters are extremely likable as well and nobody is perfect. Which is also the thing that I like the most is that everybody in the show is flawed. It's not super over the top cartoony dark like some of the movies are but it takes a little bit more of a realistic approach with the Addams family personalities and relationships. The Burton monster elements are still there though and they are awesome to watch. If you look at it more through the angle of Wednesday trying to find empathy and a reason to care about the people around her you get a lot more out of it. So for me personally I really don't understand why snobby critics just accuse us of being a cheesy teen drama with a consensus that you would see on CW... because it has a lot more to say than those types of shows and it's also very smart in the approach that they have with the Addams family and their relationship with each other and the people in the town that this takes place in. Please give this a watch this is a good show!,/review/rw8694700/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2022,hottiebootyboii,9," Jenna Ortega is amazing!!
","I can't imagine a more perfect casting for Wednesday. The plot is a little hard to follow and people expecting this to be an Addams Family reboot will not be happy, but the show stands on its own. It's enjoyable and unique and definitely worth the watch if only for Ortega's performance. The cinematography is beautiful as well, everything is catered around Wednesday, so she stands out in every scene, even in a school full of ""outcasts"". I especially enjoyed the juxtaposition between Wednesday and her bubbly roommate. People who enjoyed Charlie and The Chocolate Factory and Series of Unfortunate Events will love this show.",/review/rw8694700/?ref_=tt_urv

29 November 2022,vassiliskounelis,4," Way too boring
","Way too boring for the adult audience .The shift to teen drama may work for an audience that is coming into contact with the universe in question for the first time, but its execution does injustice to the rich legacy that cartoonist Charles Addams' creation has left us .",/review/rw8694700/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2022,Ttdf122,10," I really enjoyed!
","Tim Burton's Wednesday is pure dark magic, and it's fantastic to watch. - Yes, I'm actually quoting another franchise, but it has to be said: ""I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it. Just a very entertaining watch buoyed by an incredibly magnetic performance by Jenna Ortega ... mark my words this girl is the future of Hollywood. While the show may not appeal to all, it's witty script and compelling mysteries should boost Netflix's 'Wednesday' to potentially becoming a cult classic. Without a doubt one of the best things Netflix has released in a while.",/review/rw8694700/?ref_=tt_urv

","I absolutely refuse to accept that this is an 8/10. It just isn't. At the very best it's a 5, because I get that it can be popular with 12-16 year olds. But for me it's a solid 1. Something is definitely off about these reviews.",/review/rw8694700/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2022,suego-49293,8," Disappointing...
","I think the only way you could enjoy this series is if you had never seen the Addams Family movie or older series. Because if you had you could not help but be massively disappointed in this new show. It has lost all of the charm, warmth and wit of the previous show and movie and completely dismantled the original family dynamic. In this new series, they have completely trashed what made the original so wonderful - their love and support of each other and how they embraced and cherished their ""weirdness"".",/review/rw8694700/?ref_=tt_urv
