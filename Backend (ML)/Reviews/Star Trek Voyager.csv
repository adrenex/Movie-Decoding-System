14 April 2019,breckstewart,9," My Favorite Star Trek Show
","I have a particularly strong attachment to this show and can honestly say it is my favorite in the whole Star Trek universe. I started to watch it from day one all the way to the end even though it took a while for the series to fully realize its potential. The first 3 seasons were good but nowhere near as great as the show would become later yet I hung on, hopeful that something better would come along and then boom, Seven of Nine appeared.",/review/rw6234017/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2021,Hughmanity,8," Top 3 Trek TV series
",I just finished watching Voyager start to end over the last several months. Of course there are some misses at times but mostly it's very good and definitely gets better as it goes along. Adding Seven of Nine was a great move but Janeway and the heritage crew also get more interesting as time goes on.,/review/rw6234017/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2003,matlock-6,," Not the worst, as some would have you believe, and really quite good
","Contrary to what many Trek nerds would have you believe, Voyager is not the worst Star Trek series, and is not at all a bad show. The acting is superior to that on the beloved The Next Generation (that comment alone will probably have people throwing their Spock ears at their monitors), and I think many of the stories were better. TNG stories always seemed to revolve around spacial anomalies and holodeck malfunctions, which became excruciatingly boring. I wasn't interested in seeing Picard dressed up like Sherlock Holmes and trying to solve a fake mystery, only to be trapped on the holodeck and have the safety mechanisms shut off. As many times as this happened, I would have shut the silly thing down and prohibited its use.",/review/rw6234017/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2003,crisrabb,," Folks... relax. It's just a show.
","If IMDB had a way of getting a blood pressure reading on some of the users making comments for this show, the results would be frightening.  There's no reason to EVER get that worked up over a program!  ",/review/rw6234017/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2006,thepartyoftea,8," Exploration is the name of the game
","I've been a fan of the Star Trek series since Star Trek the Next Generation. I used to watch The Next Gen after school and I loved the idea of going off to space to explore new worlds and meeting new peoples. But the one thing that bothered me about the series was all the constrictions that the Enterprise had to go through. There was several shows that had the Federation saying 'You can't do this, or that!' But with Star Trek Voyager you have a smaller ship with only a couple of dozen of people on board in a distant part of the galaxy who are trying to get home. Far away from their family, friends and superiors. The series does an great job at redefining several species and introduces new ones. The cast is great and is always fun to watch Robert Picardo as the Doctor because he gets me laughing all the time. The ship has plenty of interesting characters all growing throughout the series. The Doctor becomes more then just a hologram medical helper and becomes a real member of the ship. Captain Janeway becomes a strong confident captain. Tom Paris, a womanizing troublemaker buckles down with a former hot head, federation hating Klingon. ",/review/rw6234017/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2006,roghache,10," Gripping dangers while stranded in a distant, hostile space quadrant
","This is yet another brilliant Star Trek series, this time the danger  fraught adventures of the Federation star ship Voyager. As a result of  the Caretaker's intervention, Voyager has been stranded in the  generally hostile Delta Quadrant, 75 years travel from Earth, with  little prospect of any return home in the foreseeable future and  initially not even any communication with the distant Federation. The  Voyager crew consists of some likewise stranded Maquis (including  Chakotay & B'Elanna) who have been forced to join forces with the  original Federation crew in a mutual struggle to survive and return  safely to the Alpha Quadrant.  Commanding Voyager is surely the Federation's most bold, determined,  decisive, and feisty captain. Kathryn Janeway is a no nonsense lady  who, given the risks inherent in this unexplored new quadrant, is  frequently obligated to arm the photon torpedoes first and seek  diplomacy later. Her stern voice commands 'Hail them!' when hostile  species threaten, generally followed by the even more terse and severe  call, 'Battlestations'. Captain Janeway, who is addicted to black  coffee, has left a fianc√© back home on earth.  The Delta Quadrant really isn't a very friendly place. One of the first  adversaries encountered is the Kazon, a brutal race subdivided into  constantly warring factions. The Vidians have an unfortunate tendency  to steal organs from living victims in their attempts to counteract the  Phage, which has plagued their people for centuries. The Malon are the  quadrant's polluters, dumping their garbage of deadly theta radiation  wherever they can get away with doing so. The Hirogen are obsessed with  the hunt, the pursuit of prey, the kill, and the collection of  trophies. Species 8472 hails from fluidic space and boasts five  genders. Most deadly is the ongoing threat of the ubiquitous Borg with  their cubes, spheres, nasty Queen, and disquieting desire for  assimilation.  Janeway's calm, likable first officer, Chakotay, is a former Maquis of  Native American origin. He has a tendency to navel gaze about his  ancestors' spiritual beliefs. He & Janeway share a truly touching bond  of mutual respect, friendship, and dependency, unhindered by the threat  of romance... except once when stranded perhaps indefinitely alone  together on a planet, when some sparks fly between them!   Harry Kim is the innocent young operations officer, everyone's  favourite boy next door, homesick for his parents and unlucky in love.  The ship's ongoing romance is between Tom Paris and B'Elanna Torres.  B'Elanna is the feisty, hot tempered, half Klingon Chief Engineer. Tom  is Voyager's cool, nonchalant, charming pilot / helmsman, who has a yen  for old movies, Captain Proton, rock & roll, fast cars and even faster  spacecraft. Midway through the series he designs a fancy new shuttle  craft, the Delta Flyer.  Tuvok and Neelix are polar opposites. Tuvok, the totally logical,  openly emotionless Vulcan tactical officer, has left a wife & family  back home on Vulcan. Needless to say, he experiences a pon farr during  Voyager's travels! Tuvok's leisure pursuits include meditating, playing  logic games such as kal-toh, and listening to Vulcan dirges. Neelix is  the super friendly, warm hearted, enthusiastic cook and morale officer,  a Talaxian who has lost his family as a result of a devastating weapon,  the metreon cascade, on his home planet. Tuvok appears to barely  tolerate Neelix, but underneath is a touching, unacknowledged  affection. One of the more intriguing episodes sees a transporter  glitch combine Tuvok & Neelix into one individual, Tuvix, with a truly  unique personality mixture of the two.  In my opinion, the only uninteresting crew member is Neelix's  girlfriend, the lovely Kess, despite her developing special powers.  Kess is an Ocampan, a Delta Quadrant race with a short life span, whose  females incubate their young in a sac on their back. Kess is replaced  mid way through the series by the totally compelling and endearing  Seven of Nine, a Borg of human origin, severed from the collective  during the fascinating two part episode, The Scorpion. The beautiful  blonde Seven struggles to adjust to her newfound individuality as she  punches up data in Astrometrics, ever efficient in her skin tight garb  and pausing only long enough to regenerate.   Perhaps the most lovable crew member is The Doctor, actually the  Emergency Medical Hologram, but with more personality than any of the  organic folk! He's a totally insufferable, arrogant, yet very appealing  character who has a brief love affair of his own with a Vidian doctor.  He also sings opera and has something of a crush on Seven, to whom he  gives dating lessons (definitely Voyager's funniest episode). There's  even a child aboard, the charming little half Ktarian Naomi Wildman,  who was born on Voyager. Neelix reads her bedtime stories, but later  she longs to become Captain's Assistant. Her role model is Seven with  whom she plays kadiscat.   New technologies introduced in the series include Voyager's bio-neural  gel packs. Needless to say, the crew frequently encounter false leads  that promise a quick trip home to the Alpha Quadrant. A number of their  adventures involve disruptions in the time line. The most compelling  time related episode is the two part Year of Hell, involving constant  attacks by the Krenim time ship with its devastating temporal weapon.  At the heart of the series is the crew's camaraderie in its assorted  struggles to return to the Alpha Quadrant. Their goal is challenging,  but it's the journey that counts. My sole complaint is the show's  occasional intrusion into the theological realm with the Klingon  Messiah, Klingon hell etc. Otherwise, it's a wonderful & unique science  fiction series with a stellar cast. Finally, my compliments to the late  Jerry Goldsmith for his amazing theme music. I call it the music of  longing to go home.",/review/rw6234017/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2004,Msdenny,10," Sci-fi continuance of an original property
","I had to respond to someone who said this was the worst of the franchise. I happen to favor DS9, but Voyager has many great qualities including cast and unique plots. Captain Janeway was an excellent addition to the captains of Star Trek. Let us not forget the criticisms that James Kirk had during the beginnings of his work in Star Trek. The ensemble worked well together, slowly but surely over seven seasons and there were many truly memorable segments. Chakotay, Tuvok, Blana, Tom, 7 of 9, Kes, Harry, Neelix, the Doctor, at the end named Joe, each and every one developed into a character you liked each and every week, irrespective of the episode. They grew even better over time, although I wondered how Chakotay and the Captain never got together and on occasion how Blana and Tom did!and the final episode a two parter was truly a great ending to the show.",/review/rw6234017/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2004,arcamian,," Relax
","The universe of Star Trek has done something brilliant to keep alive.  The creators have imposed a story arch for all the series starting with DS9. Don't get me wrong.  TNG was what got me into Star Trek in the first place. It had vibrant characters, unique ideas, and was the building block for setting the stage for the other series and the later movies.  However, in all it's glory, it lacked something.  Continuity.  The longest the crew of the Enterprise D would have to deal with an immediate situation, was no more than 2 episodes.  No doubt things would reoccur, but it was seldom. Voyager, however, would have numerous back to back episodes dealing with something.  And that might even resurface somewhere down the line.",/review/rw6234017/?ref_=tt_urv

24 July 2019,swordsnare,7," Seven (Out) Of Ten
","Much like much of the other Star Trek series, some episodes are better than others. On the whole, I enjoy this series. I especially like the characters of The Doctor and Seven of Nine. Jeri Ryan's character was originally introduced as a bit of ""eye candy"" I'm assuming, but yet Seven of Nine became one of the more endearing character developments of Voyager.",/review/rw6234017/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2007,whosjohnny,10," Voyager is great in its own right, I love it!
","I was not really a big fan of Star Trek until I saw Voyager accidentally one time on cable. I forgot which particular episode but it was so creative and funny, that I kicked myself for not noticing this treasure. Thanks to the advent of Netflix and post 2000 video technology distribution, I am able to embark into every episodes for the entire 7 seasons. What about the doctor!? Emergency Medical Hologram to Emergency Command Hologram, Robert Picardo made me love the show so much, what a joy to just see him perform and struggle with his ""humanity"". He makes me laugh out loud so many times, I had to apologize to my roommate for my uncontrollable outburst. Voyager is my painkiller for breaking out the laughs. It's just so funny sometimes, I can't help it. My wife and I love, Jeri Ryan (Seven) and Robert Picardo (EMH) duet -- ""You are my sunshine"". Their voices so pure, I still hear it in my head. It might be corny to some but Voyager is making a grand statement -- to EXPRESS as humanly possible -- the purest form of unrelentless expression of art -- without restraint -- of music, dreams and holo novels, etc. I have to say, Voyager is a very entertaining series. There are immense creativity into the moral conscience, and interpersonal development within each member of the crew. Instead of making artificial intelligence awkward and jerky, writers of Voyager gave Picardo the freedom to express beyond anything you can imagined. He is more feeling and more emotional than most organics -- and boy, can he sing! I love the premise for doctor's expansive, self growth, developing, and becoming a valuable member as part of ""the family"" decision in the final 2 episodes of Endgame; science fiction at its best! Toward the end, EMH actually disobey Captain's order and make ""human"" mistakes. I believe the chemistry between the crew works well. Harry Kim and Tom Paris, Neelix and Tuvok <-- those two are actually quite funny. I love Tuvoc occasional humor, despite being a Vulcan. Finally, I'm SO GLAD they did not go with the original actress for Janeway-- have you seen the rare 1st episode footage?! -- thank God for Kate Mulgrew! She has developed through the 7 years into an extremely confident, believable, and respectable female captain. Let me put it this way, Kate Mulgrew did more than I ever envision a female Captain could do -- even with a hint of feminine quality. Hard to believe but the chemistry balance was just right. Kate, what a GREAT job! Thank you Star Trek for making Voyager, I enjoy every episode, the creativity, of morals issues we face everyday, and the potential possibilities of our Cosmic expanse.",/review/rw6234017/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2005,dimitriskats,," The Star Trek legend lives on
","Voyager - 7 seasons on DVD. This is a must see. Backgrounds, stories, characters, are all first class. An excellent work of modern TV drama. Following entirely the Gene Roddenberry's vision, this show is indeed a prime derivative. It would be unfair to mention any name in particular. The integration of roles, stories and dialog is remarkable. If you ever liked a sci-fi film then these DVD boxes contain a treasure. From very important social issues, through galactic perils and humor, the crew of Voyager along with its creative team will take you really where no man has gone before. Packaging is robust and typical. All seasons contain extra material. Audio and Video take a 10 in 10. Enjoy the ride in the 4th Quadrant. This is an order.",/review/rw6234017/?ref_=tt_urv

","Just paying my tributes here: I gotta confess, on the side of the original Star Trek with Captain Kirk and his crew, Star Trek: Voyager is my other most favorite piece of Roddenberry's universe: lots of interesting and unique (and lovable) characters and on top the idea of a crew getting lost in some far away place of the galaxy, which provides a great background story for lots of unique and special stories.

","I was an angry teenager back when it aired on local networks in my country South Africa. Star Trek was oh so lame for the 90's generation. There was nothing on TV so I switched to a channel where Voyager was showing. I still recall the episode that changed my life. It was the one where the crew fell asleep and believed they reached earth, all but Seven of Nine. The Venus flytrap nebula episode. Since then I got interested in science and physics, all I needed was a good TV show with hypothetical scenarios to make me think.",/review/rw6234017/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2003,Li-1,," Best concept, weakest series.
","Star Trek Voyager had a lot of things going for it:  a wonderful premise (the crew of a starship stranded far, far away from the nearest outpost) and the best special effects of any of the Star Trek TV series.  But the show (barring Enterprise, which I've only seen one episode of) was the weakest of those spawned from the original Star Trek.  The show had lots of problems, but the fundamental one is the very fact that the cast was simply not up to par.  True, it's hard to live up to the likes of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy, but The Next Generation aptly held its own with Picard and Data and overall as a crew, surpassed even the original series.  Deep Space Nine had a nice sense of camaraderie and an excellent lead in Avery Brooks.  Voyager has precious little of that.  ",/review/rw6234017/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2018,ellimic,10," A good series, maybe the best of Star Trek
","Much like other Star Trek series' each episode is more-or-less self contained, in that it has little to no effect on future episodes as they're exploring other worlds or space phenomenon, but there is one constant, they're trying to get home. As good as The Original Series or Next Generation were, they never had any underlying storyline as Voyager does.
I like the point of choosing Voyager for the journey, it's a ship that can just about manage the long distance at a good speed (other lesser space-craft in the Star Trek universe would be too slow making thier journey seem unrealistic and virtually unattainable) and the brilliant crew work well together.",/review/rw6234017/?ref_=tt_urv

What I particularly appreciate this time around is The Doctor, Robert Picardo's character. The way Picardo developed him was truly brilliant. From a flat, plain person, to a full bodied character. Very well done.
