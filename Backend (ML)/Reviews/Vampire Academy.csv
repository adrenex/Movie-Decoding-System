26 April 2006,craigman,," Very original and well done
","I'm surprised no one has written about this great show yet! I've always liked HBO's original programming, from Video Jukebox back in the early 80's (before Mtv!), to Taxicab Confessions, OZ, Sopranos, and Six Feet Under. I really had little interest in watching a show about Mormons and polygamy in Utah, but I knew HBO would make it interesting. I love the cast! Bill Paxton is perfectly cast as the lead. He was always an underrated actor. Same goes with Jeanne Tripplehorn as his first (and favorite) wife. Chloe Sevigney is almost unrecognizable as the manipulative second wife, with her long hair and prairie outfits. I first noticed her in Kids. Newcomer Gennifer Goodwyn is quite good as the overwhelmed and lonely youngest third wife. She reminds me of a young Sherilyn Fenn. It doesn't hurt that all of the wives and eldest daughter are quite attractive!",/review/rw2774286/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2007,Brownitus,," Unfreakinbelievable-- MUST SEE
","A friend of mine asked me if I had seen ""The show about the guy with three wives,"" and I had no clue which show he was talking about. He told me it was called ""Big Love"" and I should catch it. Well, now having watched the first two seasons, I can confidently say this is the best television show I've seen in years. The polygamy is not even close to what the show's all about-- even though that part is extremely interesting.",/review/rw2774286/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2006,Rogue-32,9," A tricky premise, handled with charm
","I was curious about this series because I like Paxton, Sevigny and Tina Majorino in particular, and also Harry Dean Stanton (whom I got to see play blues at the Mint, in L.A., a couple of years ago - got his autograph that night as well, which was very cool). I don't agree with 'the principle', but I do like the series.",/review/rw2774286/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2020,Calicodreamin,9," A wild ride
","Big Love is a wild ride from beginning to end. The acting is amazing, the storylines captivating and always just shy of outlandish. The characters were well cast, well developed, and it's so easy to get invested in their lives. A show for the ages.",/review/rw2774286/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2006,jollieewok,9," Surprisingly good
","I will admit I didn't think that I would be at all interested in watching a show about polygamy because I find it bizarre and degrading but I was pleasantly surprised by how good this show is. I love the cast. Bill Paxton as ""Bill Hendrickson"" is the head of this crazy household and he makes you sympathize with him more than criticize him for the lifestyle he chose. His life is so stressful trying to run an expanding business, 3 households, appeasing 3 wives, hiding the fact that he is a polygamist from his neighbors and employees, dealing with the constant stress brought on by a man called the ""prophet"" who runs the polygamist compound Bill grew up in (his parents still live on this compound)who is trying to extort money out of his business and recently blocked it's expansion,and dealing with the stress that his brother and parents cause(i.e.his father played by Bruce Dern is a complete jerk and loves to pee in Bill's kitchen sink and his mother allegedly poisoned his father). I also love that he has a favorite wife,his 1st and only legal wife played by Jeanne Tripplehorn, because I love her character (she tries hard to be a good wife, mother, and support to the other wives) and the jealousy that the other wives feel make it that much more dramatic. His conniving 2nd wife played by Chloe Sevigny is so much fun to hate, not to mention she is the prophet's daughter and is loyal to him. And Gennifer Goodwin as his young 3rd wife is so cute and lovable. Though this show is chocked full of jealousy and emotion,you really get the sense that this family of 3 wives, 1 husband, and 7 children (with another 1 on the way)really do love each other. They're just having a hard time dealing with the stress that arises from this very unique lifestyle. Each week I wonder if the prophet is going to win his battle with Bill, if one of the wives are going to say forget it and leave, if this family is going to be exposed for what they are (a few characters have gotten close to discovering their secret), or if Bill is going to have a nervous break down. This show is jam packed with good actors and good acting with such interesting plots that you don't get caught up in feeling conflicted over liking this show because you think polygamy is wrong. You get caught up in the chaos that is this family's life and it is so much fun to watch. I highly recommend giving it a shot.",/review/rw2774286/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2010,mcsheehey,8," Starts Off Very Well
","""Big Love"" begins as a gripping exploration of a family that attempts to walk the tightrope between polygamy and normalcy. Bill Paxton stars as Bill Henrickson, a straitlaced family man with three wives: Barb (Jeanne Tripplehorn), Marge (Ginnifer Goodwin), and Nicolette (Chloe Sevigny).",/review/rw2774286/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2019,zachbaritone,10," Amazing show
","As a Mormon, I gotta say this show gets a lot of things right, at least cultural living in Utah County. While mainstream members do not practice polygamy, there are many similarities in belief and jargon here that are portrayed quite accurately. HBO clearly did their research. All in all, first-rate acting and writing and hardly a dull moment. Highly recommended for those who like to be challenged by their entertainment and perhaps even made a bit uncomfortable.",/review/rw2774286/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2006,gharbinour,7," A new approach of the family concept by HBO
","""The Sopranos"", ""Six feet under"", and now ""Big Love"". Hbo offers us a totally new outlook of family, this time by describing the harsh quotidian of a successful polygamist. The family according to Hbo is always subject of greater afflictions than the regular family. In ""The sopranos"", the father's profession was the issue (the mafia), in ""Six feet under"", the father's profession was once again the issue (death itself), and in ""Big love"", the father chose to live against the rules of society, he chose to be a polygamist and that's a big problem because it takes a lots of responsibilities to have three houses, three wives and plenty of children. Somehow, in all these TV series, everything rotates around the problematic of being a father and in a larger sense HBO talks to us about MORALITY. The way of life of these men is really the main idea. ""Big Love"" is a really great and profound show. As always, HBO prefers the realistic treatment of his subject rather than the inner and comical sense of polygamy. The cast is unbelievable, and the score is great. In spite of the dramatic aspect of this show, I find it really entertaining. Anyway, if you like HBO's shows, you will love ""Big Love"".",/review/rw2774286/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2008,B24,9," Just Like All Other Marriages, Only More So
","This engaging series is one of the zaniest soap operas yet offered by HBO -- which is saying something given their record to date. It adds plural marriage to a list of subjects including whimsical vampires (True Blood), dysfunctional funeral directors (Six Feet Under), and narcissistic Hollywood groupies (Entourage). What's next? Fundamentalist cross-dressers? The paucity of genuine drama on cable television is nowhere as evident as in these recurrently fun but trite exercises in topical one-up-man-ship. Each episode strains for originality only to sink under the weight of multiple off-beat characters and subplots that ultimately carry the classic message of theater: no matter how bizarre the overall concept, we always recognize parts of ourselves to the extent that it's hard to hit the ""off"" button. So we continue to look for and appreciate the really excellent work of veteran actors like Harry Dean Stanton and Mary Kay Place and the novel or nuanced interpretations offered by younger ones like Chloe Sevigny.",/review/rw2774286/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2006,blackeyedsuzy,10," Excellent Drama
","I cannot honestly remember when I enjoyed a television show quite so much. There are so many well developed characters in this show, yet there is still so much we do not know about them. We get a few hints each episode. I love the complex relationships these intriguing characters are involved in. The plot is intricate and moves at a fast pace without sacrificing believability.

18 June 2007,hobbyhob,9," What I truly LOVE about BIG LOVE!
","Yes, it has a nice complexity of characters, who are ever being revealed to us. Yes, you really don't need to know much about the Mormons to get this show. But what I really love is how it points out how very few people in our supposedly ""free society"" are truly free to be who they are without fear of judgment, or worse, legal hassles and entanglements. Little by little, our freedoms have been whittled down by those among us who think they know best for ALL of us. If you don't believe me, go find a cancer patient who wants to smoke pot for their nausea and pain. Go ask the Californian who adores their pet ferrets but must hide them from the dept of fish and game. Ask the person who exclusively prefers the company of someone of their own sex yet fears losing their job if the wrong people find out.",/review/rw2774286/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2006,sydgallaher,10," Big Love is another HBO Home Run!
","When I first saw the ads for this show I said, ""huh. Really weird premise to base a show on. Not to mention towing the line on being patently offensive. How good can it possibly be?"" Well not only is it good, it's beyond wonderful. This is a series of many layers. It is at different turns screamingly hilarious, poignant to the point of tears and thought-provoking. Most of all though, it is just... human.",/review/rw2774286/?ref_=tt_urv

11 August 2007,Ryu_Darkwood,10," Another great show by HBO
","Big Love is in my opinion a strong exploration on polygamy and how this form of marriage is negatively influencing the individuality of the people involved. Isn't it hard enough to have one wife, let alone having three totally different characters in one marriage? It also explores religious fundamentalism in the United States. But HBO wouldn't be HBO if they just made fun of their protagonists. All of the characters are humans of flesh and blood with their own flawed characters and morally ambiguous nature towards making choices in life. They are treated with the respect that they deserve.",/review/rw2774286/?ref_=tt_urv

29 September 2020,m-47826,7," Feminists and stuff will hate it.
","Good. I miss THIS HBO, the little channel that took risks with their program subject. And how timeless and neutral these were touched upon. Do I agree with this lifestyle? I'm not sure I do. But that's besides the point. Especially when it changes nothing wether I do or not. The show, aside from the subject matter, is your run of the mill drama. But having actors/actresses talented enough to make the difference, and see the difference, is worth more stars in my book. A good writing isn't to be overlooked either. Life on the compound, looks pretty accurate to me. Even though I hope some of it aspects are exaggerated for storytelling sake. It took me years to keep up with seasons 3 to 5, thanks to overseas poor exploitation of the show. So now that I finally can, that's exactly what I'm doing. And to quote Chloé Sevigny, season 4 suck... And the finale season is struggling to keep me invested.",/review/rw2774286/?ref_=tt_urv

In the UK we managed to catch Season 1 some years ago - may have been on E4 or some channel like that. We found it intriguing, odd, quirky, believable, fun.

17 January 2015,skay_baltimore,5," A show about the biggest bunch of screw ups you'll ever meet
","This show suffers from the most fundamental flaw imaginable -- not a single main character is worth caring about. Why? Because their flaws range from pure evil to raging arrogance, lying, lust, greed, jealousy, pettiness, delusional thinking, hypocrisy, and sheer, utter stupidity. I'm not kidding. These characters lack even the most basic fundamental human qualities. The men are misogynist, and the women are portrayed in a variety of negative lights -- take your pick.",/review/rw2774286/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2006,dunning96,10," Love this series
","I find myself rushing to put the kids to bed on Sunday nights so that I can watch all of Big Love without interruption. I love how some of the characters struggle with being a polygamist and come to terms in their own way. Also, Nicki's character is one of those you love to hate. She drives me crazy most weeks with her behavior and then makes me really respect her in others. My experience in life is that most people are this way, where they do really dumb or selfish things majority of the times and then they surprise you with something wonderful, which is why you keep them in your life. Although the main theme of polygamy is not something I deal with in my life a lot of the other issues they face are things that can happen to any of us.",/review/rw2774286/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2016,ElessarAndurilS,7," Surprised to be interested
","When I read the summary for the story for Big Love I was not interested at all. Took a year and a half to get through the first few episodes. Finally though somewhere approaching the middle of season 1 it started to catch my interest as I became familiar with the characters and the serious dysfunction that they had and evolved quite interestingly throughout the series. Bill P. as the lead was very good. It was easy to see why his love for his first wife Barb remained the strongest throughout the show as they were the only ones not so damaged and immature that he could have an intellectual relationship with her as well as physical. Nicki just made me want to smack her about every third show as she started out self centered, mean, and always criticizing others for her faults. How Bill forgave her for repeatedly breaking basic vows was beyond me, but hating her was part of the fun of the show. Margene was a kid and never seemed to grow up until the final when they shocked me by wrapping things up by offing Bill by a emotional neighbor. All in all the show was much better than I expected and did bring to my attention some things I wasn't aware of. Bottom line, if you can get by some of the ludicrous oversights in the story's gaps, it is an entertaining show even if I wanted to slap every character at some point for being so self centered and blind to the hypocrisy of their actions at the time.",/review/rw2774286/?ref_=tt_urv

1 May 2006,UlisesGirl,8," Wicked!
","This is such an amazing show. It has all the elements that make it as fantastic as it is - comedy, intrigue, action, sex - everything coming together in a delightful mix. The characters all have such depth, each with their own problems despite the ""shiny"" exterior of their lives. In a polygamist Mormon family live three wives and their husband, Bill. Barb is the first wife and sometimes longs to be the only one, though doesn't show her true feelings to her husband, nor the other wives. Nicki is a compulsive shopper, having growing up in an illegal polygamist compound. She is in thousands of dollars of credit card debt, unbeknownst to her husband. Her father, Roman, is the leader and ""prophet"" of the polygamist sect Nicki comes from. Margene, the youngest of the wives, longs for a life she once had, where she could freely befriend the neighbors and often struggles with being a young mother with her little boys. Because of their precarious situation, the family has to hide the fact they are polygamists, a practice outlawed not only by the Mormon church but the U.S Government as well. Roman, Nicki's father, gave Bill money to start a hardware store, Henrickson Home Plus. However, Roman has become greedy, insisting that he get a cut of all the profits made not only from the first store, but the second as well. The conflict between Bill and Roman has come to the point that one or both of them may lose their lives at the others hand. Bill makes attempts to bring Roman down along with all his underhanded business deals, but Bill's mothers, his father and much of his extended family would be punished along with Roman for practicing polygamy. Will Bill have to choose between the family that raised him and the family he has now? We have yet to find out. I have become thoroughly addicted to this show! It's sexy, it's funny, it's exciting and it's flat out great. I don't get HBO, but I go out of my way to make my parents record it so I can watch it when I visit them. It's rare I'll make that much of an effort for a TV show. This one is different. I highly suggest, that if you're longing for a fresh, inventive story, that you check this one out.
