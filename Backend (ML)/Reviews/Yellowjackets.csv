11 January 2023,ben-j-ellis,5," Ridiculous character spoils it all
","I will concede that I do not, and have never worked on a rig. So if you have, and I'm wrong, feel free to correct me.",/review/rw8830590/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2023,namstonk,1," I hoped it would get, I was seriously wrong
","Where to start, well it has to be the writing first, it is woeful, the dialogue is laughable. Some of the speeches made me laugh they were so bad. It's like a child has written it without any research. The direction is ropey at best, but with a script as bad as this you can kinda forgive. The characters are hilarious in some places, everybody does everyone's job. A nurse can run the fire suppression system, a lowly pipefitter can fix virtually anything. Then there is the usual rubbish, the misogynistic man, the lesbian, the enemies who becomes besties, the tortured man who lost a child. Oh yes the rubbish that providers ask for is all there.",/review/rw8830590/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2023,fallyhag,4," Written by a child and painful to watch
",You don't need to watch for long to know that this is another dumbed down TV drama made for the lowest common denominator. It feels like it has been written and produced by children. It is just so painfully made.,/review/rw8830590/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2023,antide-42376,5," So so
","This wasn't as good as I hoped that it would be. A largely good cast give decent performances although Emily Hampshire isn't always convincing and I felt the part was too big for her at times. The story is in very basic terms a global warning, harm the planet anymore and it sure as hell will harm us.",/review/rw8830590/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2023,rosemaryandthyme,7," Great binge watch
","Not sure why the negative reviews. This series reminds me of Vigil but I am enjoying it far more. There are some stellar and well known faces in this series, especially Owen Teale in a different role for him. Also it seems to me that anything with Martin Compston or Mark Bonnar in it is sure to be a good watch and they have not disappointed. It's not particularly original, there are subtle shades of Alien, The Thing and various other horror movies that I can't remember the titles of, but definitely not as frightening. This is a good solid thriller and mystery to enjoy after the excitement of Christmas and the current wet weather here in Oz.",/review/rw8830590/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2023,sue-06239,3," Started off OK but got ridiculous
","Some well known British actors in this and it started off promising but just got more ridiculous as it went on. One for Greta Thunberg to love perhaps. An ancient living organism starts to fight back against man's mistreatment of the planet's natural resources. Corporate greed, woke messaging, token BBC issue-led characters blah blah blah.",/review/rw8830590/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2023,mbell-56214,2," Great cast, appalling script
","With a strong cast and an intriguing storyline I was actually looking forward to this show. However, even in the first episode there was the all too familiar characters that we have all seen a million times before, including the angry at the company, aggressive, always looking to stir up trouble one.",/review/rw8830590/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2023,Sleepin_Dragon,7," Fury from The Deep.
","Strange things happen on an oil rig in the middle of the sea when a strange fog descends, and a member of the crew suffers an accident.",/review/rw8830590/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2023,elidav,4," The Fog meets Helix meets the Mist meets the Abyss meets the Thing meets ecological mush mosh nonsense
",All the ingredients for a great supernatural tv show were here but badly let down by a poorly written plodding plot with a bunch of stupid characters who did stupid things or got angry or had an argument about every 5 minutes in a effort to make the show seem exciting .....but it didn't !,/review/rw8830590/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2023,kevdexxx,4," Starts well, but ultimately runs out of steam...
","My wife and I binged watched this over 3 nights, and it certainly started well, with an interesting premise, but then, it just became a bit weird. That's not to say it didn't keep us interested though, you kind of want to know what's going to happen next all of the way through, but not in a way that made it compelling, more curious to see what they were aiming for with the writing. I will also say that some of the effects were pretty shoddy, which, in this day and age, is unecessary. In the end, I thought it was a load of clich√©d nonsense, which, while well acted and written, was a great disappointment.",/review/rw8830590/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2023,Njs2016,5," Great cast. Lousy plot.
","The problem with the series is symptomatic of most of the big streaming giants. Good idea, great cast, adequate budget - then no idea of how a script develops. Six episodes for this was far too much, leaving the plotline long and dawn out. The character development is minimal and rudimentary and ends up with generalised cliche and arguments that they need to sustain conflict.",/review/rw8830590/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2023,TomFarrell63,6," Enjoyable schlock, but...
","I found this to be very easy watching,but there are several things that stopped it from being really good.",/review/rw8830590/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2023,greencrest,3," Really quite badly done. 3/10
",Oh well. In spite of a great premise - creeping horror on an oil rig - this actually turns out to be pretty poor stuff.,/review/rw8830590/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2023,bay-77008,6," Edge of your seat downer. Spielberg could have made this so much better.
","I almost quit watching mid' first episode due to the unrelenting anger among the entire crew just about. However I stuck by and watched the entire series. On one hand it kept me watching while on the other I couldn't wait for it to end. All in all it was quite absurd and the characters were given little to work with in range other than anger and resentment. A little of that goes a long way and and this went all they way. The acting for the main characters, with the exception of the female lead, was what I'd expect from them - good, considering the direction and dialogue. I was disappointed in Emily Hampshire's performance, though, even if it did improve as the series progressed (or should I say regressed). I liked her in Schitt's Creek, so expected more.",/review/rw8830590/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2023,kindofblue-78221,2," Boring and stereotyped.
",I got to the second episode and couldn't take any more.,/review/rw8830590/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2023,scarlettimogen,2," Terrible
","Managed to watch 2 and a half episodes but was driven to distraction by the terrible acting by the majority of the cast. Overacting at its finest. Seen tree trunks look less wooden. The whole storyline seemed to get worse by the 3rd episode. A very poor idea stolen directly from The Thing with obvious nods towards Alien and The Fog. Unrealistic reactions, formulaic characters and a script that seems to have been written by a failing pee grad film student.",/review/rw8830590/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2023,waggydj,6," Don't expect much.
","The two main things that let this drama down are the poor script and the dreadful visual effects. You don't empathise with any of the characters therefore you don't actually care what happens to them with little to no suspense. As for the visual effects, very poor. It is so obvious this was filmed on a set. The lighting is all wrong and actually takes you out of the story it's so bad. There are a number of great actors in this drama but some seem miscast and the others are trying their best with the poor writing. The story isn't new, it's just a few ideas from a selection of 80's movies cobbled together.",/review/rw8830590/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2023,wbprops,4," Ridiculously bad!
","When it first started I was super excited to see all the stellar British actors I've loved so much over the years. My excitement was short lived though as soon as Emily Hampshire showed up. Who thought casting her in a lead role amongst all of these terrific Brit actors made a lick of sense?! Her weird slick back pony tail hairdo, pursed lips and gobs of make up didn't go at all with the scene. They're on a damn rig in the middle of the ocean for gods sake. And the story line is totally bizarre, the special effects are low rate, the script is terrible. Could've been so much better with a cast like that. Oh and I don't understand the ending at all, no idea what just happened but I really don't care.",/review/rw8830590/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2023,BlockLike,3," If this is a success then it's rigged
","I was intrigued by the trailer and geared myself up for what looked like a psychological horror, despite appearing to look rough around the edges.",/review/rw8830590/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2023,FilmFanatic2023,7," Delivers Eco-Horror Thrills with Homespun Charm
","A supernatural thriller that follows a group of oil rig workers who become trapped on their rig by a strange fog. As they struggle to survive, they discover that their drilling may have awoken an ancient, supernatural force that wants to punish mankind for disturbing the natural order. Despite its predictable survival-horror plot, ""The Rig"" is elevated by its charming cast of characters and its underlying themes about the damage caused by oil work and our responsibility for it. While the central mystery may not be particularly original, the body horror and special effects are well-done and add to the tension. Overall, ""The Rig"" is a satisfying, if formulaic, watch that is worth checking out for fans of the genre.",/review/rw8830590/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2023,Gentzen,5," Plodding Envirobabble
","Part River City, part ER, this mini-series at heart is a soap drama taking place on an oil rig, peppered with an icing of pseudoscience, corporate conspiracy and superficial environmentalism.",/review/rw8830590/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2023,t-feier,4," Absolute waste of a cool premise
",I've been looking forward to The Rig and really liked the premise of the show: An oil rig in the middle of nowhere get enveloped by a mysterious fog that cuts off all communication while something huge begins to stir at the ocean floor. But while this might sound exciting the creators completly squandered the potential of a great idea. The result is a poorly crafted by-the-numbers show that feels like it is based on a fifty year old script. Everything you'll see here has been done before and the entire show is laughably predictable.,/review/rw8830590/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2023,Mili_Cja,1," This is RIGged
","So what are you trying to say, that one of the most hardened people to walk face of the Earth, oil rig workers, are in fact a bunch of crybabies and hotheads who are beyond control? How the F do they even manage to get that oil to us if all they can do is yell and burst with anger any minute. What a bunch of nonsense. This portrayal is beyond ridiculous. But why am I surprised. If producers can send psychotic teens in Space, they can make oil rig workers yell and argue all day long for no reason at all.",/review/rw8830590/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2023,mbazhome,1," Ugh
",A purportedly exciting show like this one is just another boring forgettable slow burn. The first episode was actually interesting and I was looking forward to more. I thought with the ash coming down it was maybe a nuclear attack had happened and no one on the oil rig knew about it. Sadly this was not the case. The plot degraded into a silly unbelievable supernatural type of situation. The Thing did this much much better. As others have said the actors didn't have much to work with. I recognized many faces and have enjoyed their work in the past but this was not good. Sorry but I hate-watched the remaining episodes. Should have just gone to bed early instead.,/review/rw8830590/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2023,phlplls,1," Rigiculous
","I kept thinking surely this must get better once all the exposition is out of the way. No, it didn't. A few nice visual moments, I thought, although mostly the cinematography owed much to 1970s soaps. Some credible actors giving terrible performances so let's assume that much of the blame lies with the script and direction. The onboard affair with no chemistry, crew members who are all technical wizzes but can't follow basic orders, the odd acceptance that this is The Ancestor, the heavily signposted eco messages, the surprisingly mild weather in the middle of the North Sea (maybe it is but there was little or no sense of this being at sea), the willingness to accept that lethal negligence at work just makes you a slightly bad person rather than needing addressing,etc. Utterly lacking in the kind of atmosphere that might be expected. I think there's probably an okay 90 minute film to be made where a faster pace over a shorter period of time makes it easier to suspend disbelief.",/review/rw8830590/?ref_=tt_urv
