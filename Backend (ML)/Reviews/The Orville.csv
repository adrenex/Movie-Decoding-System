16 August 2020,bob the moo,," Solid Heart of Darkness tale, although it is not serious enough for its sombre tone, or fun enough to sell its moments of action
","Perhaps if it had committed to one of its stools to sit on, Ad Astra would have been a much better film than it was. Of course a big budget sci-fi with great effects, big names, and plenty of talent was unlikely to be a 'bad' film, but in this case it seems not to be totally sure what sort of film it is trying to be, and in trying to do multiple things, it fails to merge them into a working whole.",/review/rw5512947/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2019,ThomDerd,8," Br Ad Astra is a good film.
","Hello from Earth, Moon, Mars, Neptune, Space.
Brad is all over the place.
The film starts with a great sequence for approx. 7 minutes, which is captivating and visually stunning. Unfortunately, then it gets to a slow-burn mode till the story develops a bit more and we get to see another visually impressive sequence past 30 minutes. It does get more interesting later on and together with the visual impact (a kind of dreamy action sequences) and the nicely written score you will want to sit this through the end.
Acting is good and for fans of Brad Pitt, this works perfect as he is in almost every scene.
Science...well i am not an expert here but the things portrayed in the film are not really tied to exact science. It is the future after all and humanity knows more, right? I would not read too much into that; it will help you enjoy the film more.
In contrast with some negative and maybe unrealistic reviews that I read here, if you like a mix of mild father-son drama together with sci-fi, this is a very nice film to watch.

8 October 2019,peterwcohen-300-947200,1," Bad science, pointless characters, turgid dialog and evil baboons
","The first thing you find out in this movie is that the inverse square law does not apply. Yes, that's right. Someone is sending some kind of force from out near Neptune all the way to Earth, and, I kid you not, it gets stronger as it travels. Nothing in the universe does that. Nothing. And we're off to the races with total, monumental scientific illiteracy. A structure that reaches from the surface of the Earth into space serves as an antenna. On the moon, the transition from the near side to the far side of the moon is a sharp line between sunlight and darkness. Guess what: The far side is commonly called ""the dark side"" because it's not visible from the Earth, not because it doesn't get sunlight. A lunar rover goes flying over the edge of a crater, spinning, and lands on its wheels and keeps on going. It takes 19 days to get to Mars. It takes a further 79 days to go to Neptune. Yet, at what must be monumentally high speeds, they can still slow down, stop along the way to battle evil baboons, and get going again.",/review/rw5512947/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2020,csheff3,9," A beautiful space epic about the true journey of depression
","'Ad Astra' was a film I knew nothing about going in, and i'm glad I went in blind. It was visually gorgeous with nail biting set pieces, but the story hit me in just the right spot. It takes a good script for you to hear voice over in lieu of dialogue and not feel like you're being cheated, and this script was, in my mind, excellent. It's a vibe-y film that spends a lot of time in silence, and if you're like me you'll really appreciate the time it takes to develop the emotional and visual severity. On its surface it's a space epic, but in its heart it will speak to victims of depression, as well as anyone who's ever spent years feeling like they didn't belong. It takes a journey greater than most are wiling to take to find your deepest demons and confront them. Absolutely loved it.",/review/rw5512947/?ref_=tt_urv

24 September 2019,The-Sarkologist,9," A Journey to the Heart of Darkness
","Some have suggested that this is a sci-fi version of Apocalypse Now, but the thing is that this story goes back to the writings of a brilliant author named Joseph Conrad, and his short story The Heart of Darkness. This is a story about a sailor who goes on a trek up the Congo River to try and find one of the company men named Kurtz. If you haven't read this then I highly recommend that you do so since I don't believe any movie can really capture what Conrad was exploring here.",/review/rw5512947/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2019,cardsrock,9," Much more than your typical sci-fi blockbuster
","I love seeing different ways in which new space films can expand the genre. Ad Astra takes the unique approach of mostly avoiding thrills in favor of a deep dive into the protagonist's psyche. While some may argue about Gray's approach, I believe the film's resolution more than justifies this tactic. Brad Pitt gives a tremendous, understated performance in which you really feel the emotions his character experiences. The cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema is truly stunning and produced several shots which will likely live on in space film history. A beautiful score and story round out this brilliant, introspective space character study.",/review/rw5512947/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2022,hugues-talbot,7," A film about solitude
","In my opinion, the film is better than most reviewers give it credit for. Forget the spectacle and the poor science. The film is rather dystopian but perhaps more hopeful at the end. The entire space program is under the control of the military who rule it with an iron fist. In spite of insurmountable odds, the hero played by Brad Pitt wants to reconnect with his long-thought dead father, who is actually alive and has been marooned in orbit around Neptune for decade, in search of extra-terrestrial life.",/review/rw5512947/?ref_=tt_urv

",I generally like slow burn psychological dramas which this movie is supposed to be. Holy mother of God is this a bad movie. They try to get you emotionally involved in the father-son drama but have one preposterous plot line after another.,/review/rw5512947/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2019,JoeYabuki,8," Gorgeous
","Explore the galaxy. Search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Are we alone in the universe? Are we self-destructive? Are we willing to continue until the end regardless of the consequences? Do we become what we judge without realizing it? The story that the film tells us has a very deep meaning and explores the most hidden corners of the human being. A slow movie that goes through the stages of degradation and collapse of an individual feeling lost and the will to continue forward and get up to reach a goal. The sound and score, the photography, the scenarios and landscapes, the cinematography, the direction and the colours are really gorgeous.",/review/rw5512947/?ref_=tt_urv

","Greetings again from the darkness. Astronaut Roy McBride's pulse rate may never go above 80 bpm, but mine certainly did during the opening sequence which features a stunning and spectacular space fall. It's unlike anything we've seen before. Roy has trained his entire life for this work; however his true mental state is only revealed slowly throughout the film's run. After witnessing his actions and hearing (through narration) his thoughts, we are left to decide what we think of Roy ... stoic hero or simmering psychopath? Either way, he's haunted by a past that has rendered him mission-focused and the world's worst party guest. The film takes place in the not-too-distant future.",/review/rw5512947/?ref_=tt_urv

18 October 2020,Leofwine_draca,6," Watch it for the cinematography
","A different kind of science fiction film, this one, one that moves at a glacial pace while telling the slow-moving story of an astronaut hunting for his estranged father, another astronaut who's missing and possibly become deranged. It's a beautifully shot movie that feels like it offers a more realistic depiction of space travel than most, and I enjoyed it much more than the overrated GRAVITY due to the assured performances. Brad Pitt is an actor who's really grown on me over the years and he's fine here, with solid support from old-timers Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland in small roles. There's little in the way of meat to the story and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY this isn't, but it's worth seeing for the cinematography alone.",/review/rw5512947/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2020,Hitchcoc,4," Endless!
","I really thought this was a weak film. First of all, I'm not sure of the science or the futurism. Is this really the way things could be? There are so few controls. The people in authority are weak and scared. Brad Pitt's character, Roy, is about as dull as one can make him. Yes, he has been given a difficult job, but then it is pulled out of the program. The way he gets on board the final rocket is beyond possible. Even in the future. We would hope that people with the kind of money it takes to do a film like this could have channeled it into a real script. I could list 25 questions about the absurdity right off the top of my head.",/review/rw5512947/?ref_=tt_urv

","Sci-Fi is not my favourite genre in film, or overall in general life actually, by all means, but that is not to say that it does nothing for me.
