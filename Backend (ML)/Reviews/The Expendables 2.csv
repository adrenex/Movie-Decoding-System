12 August 2012,zetes,," This starts off as fairly mediocre, but gets more and more complex and original as it goes on, building to a third season that is as good as anything I've ever seen
","Created by Mr. Show alumnus Dino Stamatopoulos (best known now for playing the character Alex ""Starburns"" Osbourne on Community; his Mr. Show alums Jay Johnston and Scott Adsit (best known for his role on 30 Rock) are also major artistic contributors) created this stop-motion puppet show for Adult Swim. It's a parody of Davey and Goliath, a religious cartoon from the '60s. Oral is a young boy living in the very Christian town of Moralton, Statesota (located in the exact center of the United States, between Missouri and Kansas). He eagerly wants to do right by God, and tries to take the advice of his reverend, his parents and his elders, but that advice always leads to horrible situations (in the first three episodes he raises the dead, who of course attempt to eat everyone's brains, he gets a bunch of women pregnant and he gets addicted to crack). This is the basic structure of the first season and most of the second season. At the beginning, it reminded me a lot of South Park. Like South Park, it's funny, but ultimately cheap. In the second season, the writing grew a lot sharper, but, as it goes on, something happens. Even in the first season, it's revealed that there is a lot of darkness and misery underneath the adult characters' positive, Christian exteriors. But Stamatopoulos and his writers add a lot of depth in that second season, and they do a lot of world and character building. It starts to get pretty interesting, and then comes the final two episodes of the second season, where Orel, always an innocent before, learns the truth about his father: that in reality, he is an abusive, alcoholic *beep* While these episodes are very funny, there is an unprecedented emotional depth for any animated series I've ever seen. It's absolutely devastating, and it just kind of left me shaking. And then comes the third season. Unable to move past the season finale of Season 2, the first 10 episodes of 13 (each billed as Episode 1 of 13 and so forth), it weaves the complex story of Orel's family and the other citizens of Moralton in the days leading up to the hunting trip, often focusing on just one sentence a character speaks during those two episodes and expanding on why they would say that, the backstory of that sentence's existence. Only in Episode 10 of 13 do we move to the events after the hunting trip, dealing with its fallout until we reach the season's and series' enormously powerful final moment. It's one of the most complexly structured seasons of television I've ever seen. It's an unbelievably enormous achievement, especially considering how slight the first few episodes of the series are (honestly, if I were watching this live, I probably wouldn't have bothered seeking it out after that first season; each episode only being 11.5 minutes long - yes, it does all this in 11.5 minute installments - it wasn't much of a commitment). I am not at all kidding when I say this turned out to be the best thing I've watched all year. I have not stopped thinking about it for a minute since I finished it a few days ago, and I have a hard time not weeping whenever it comes to mind. The night I finished it, I almost couldn't go in to work. I felt too emotionally exposed. The biggest tragedy of it all is that only that first, fairly mediocre season made it onto DVD. They never did release the second and third seasons. There are bits and pieces of the series on Youtube, and you can watch the hunting episodes, entitled Nature, as well as the three episodes which follow it, on Adult Swim's website, but you can't purchase it (though, of course, you can find it elsewhere, not legally). Supposedly they are working on a follow-up special for Christmas this year, so maybe that will spur them to release the entire series. Any way you can see this, though, it's worth your time.",/review/rw4675869/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2008,arc_a2007,9," One of the best shows on television
","Most Christians will probably be severely offended by this show, but that's part of its charm. Its offensiveness is riding on the shoulders of an innocent little boy who simply doesn't know any better. He misinterprets others' advice and chaos ensues. The same could be said about religion itself. What I find so continually compelling about this show however, is that it dares to be different. The line-up on Adult Swim has swiftly shifted to gore porn as of recent (Metalocalypse and Robot Chicken being perfect examples), but Orel focuses its sights on the way religion controls people, changes them. Lying beneath the bitter sentiments however, is something even better: character development. Throughout the series, we see the various demented characters of Oralton for who they really are. This really kicks off in season three (which is currently nearing its end) and it's truly gripping. What you thought were one-off humor characters in the first season are revealed to be deeply troubled human clay-things in the second. Speaking of, the series gets quite dark at times, and with only the personalities of the characters... Yes, things can be dark without buckets of blood. But in the little town of Oralton, Statesota, we see much more than a bewildered mass. We see a portrait of the American psyche. (other psycho-analytical jargon here)",/review/rw4675869/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2019,nasdagoodshepherd,8," The Perfect Blend with Comedy and Drama
","If there is any Adult Swim show out there that has comdey and drama as a the main genre, it's Moral Orel. The writing is not bad, their is some character development in this show, also people said that this show is dark and they're right. It's a shame that Adult Swim canceled it after 3 seasons and some episodes from this show are considered unaired. But in 2012, Adult Swim released a Moral Orel tv special, Before Orel and it was pretty entertainment and enjoyable. Without a doubt, Moral Orel is one of the greatest cartoons Adult Swim has ever made. I give Moral Orel and 8.5/10",/review/rw4675869/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2009,gonelunch1,10," Unbelievably well done
","This is an amazing show. The Williams Street (southern corporate bods zieg heil ted turner) bods canceled it after 3 seasons, but it was amazing. Not only did it walk a fine line between criticizing a putative deity and criticizing the morons who choose to speak in the deity's name, but it also showed us how actual adults (inevitably marginalized in Moralton) do adult things like move on and call a halt to unproductive relationships. (Stephanie and Danielle respectively). The ending is unexpected and unbelievably sweet - it makes me cry every time. I can't wait to see what DS does next!",/review/rw4675869/?ref_=tt_urv

29 April 2009,EvelPlatypus,10," Amazing.
","Moral Orel, created by Dino Stamatopoulos, is my favorite television show of all time. The show depicts (at least in the first season) young Orel Puppington growing up in Moralton trying to be a good protestant by sticking to the moral code and lost commandments, unfortunately screwing it up in the process, only to be corrected (in his study with belt in hand) by his supposedly good father figure and father, Clay. In the later seasons, though, it turned much, much darker, focusing on the dramatically repressed citizens of Moralton. In the final season, however, they abandoned the brighter episodes to much more depressing story lines (did I mention this is all done, very well I might add, in stop-motion animation?).",/review/rw4675869/?ref_=tt_urv

","Moral Orel is a great parody of Davey and Goliath. Actually, it is the best. I'm sure it's not the only one because the internet and all. But anyways, this was a great show for my liking. It is actually like saying it's the softer side of Adult Swim, except it's still like the violent, offensive animated shows that Adult Swim hand-selected and airs.",/review/rw4675869/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2010,Chugalugaboo,9," Impossible to define, always a unique surprise
","I can't for the life of me figure this show out. Sometimes I find myself genuinely laughing almost uncontrollably, others I'm left reflecting on the message, and still others I'm just lost and a little bored even; the episode with orel's stop-motion animation for example. Interesting concept but fell very short. In any case I admire the uniqueness. Now I've seen jokes in a negative light and dark comedy in plenty other animated shows but this one manages to pull off full on cynicism about a wide range of topics using some very unique yet inexplicably relatable characters.",/review/rw4675869/?ref_=tt_urv

","After reading some of the reviews on here, it leads me to believe this don't have a clue as to what they are saying or are entirely missing the ""Adult"" part of Adult Swims lineup. Adult's swim creative and off the wall shows like the popular ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force"", ""Sealab"", ""Stroker and Hoop"" , ""Harvey Birdman"" all revolved Adult humor mixed with in with random humor, dark humor, and yes offensive issues. Get a clue!!! If you have a problem with that perhaps you should be watching correct cartoons Pokemon or some garbage like that.",/review/rw4675869/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2006,imdb-4792,," excellent parody
","This is a great parody of the old show from the 60's or 70's called ""Davey and Goliath"" It's a show poking fun at far right wing christians so if you are a born again Christian you will not want to watch this. It is done in what looks like claymation. Orel is a little boy who lives with his family, mom, dad and little brother. They live in the town of Moralton in a NEW state wedged between Kansas and Missouri called ""Statesota"". This is really short like most Adult Swim programs. It is about 12 minutes long. There is some claymation blood and gore so if that bothers you you might want to skip this. This cartoon is really meant for left wingers like me or maybe atheists or perhaps people WITH A SENSE OF HUMOR. I'm sure there will be complaints and they will come mostly from people who never watched it but just heard about it. Have fun, hope it goes on for a long successful season or more.",/review/rw4675869/?ref_=tt_urv

15 May 2006,hellcopinc,8," Great parody of a crappy show...
","I remember the old ""Davey and Goliath"" show and thought it was dumb when I was 10. This is a great parody of that show. The humor is on the lower end of the ""South Park"", Family Guy"" spectrum. It is a funny show. I don't understand why some people don't like it. The episode where Orel gets hooked on crack is hilarious. The episode where Orel starts drinking had me laughing for days. What I like most about the show is it keeps with the ""Leave It To Beaver"" mentality with out being cute. It is worthy of its Adult Swim counterparts and should be given consideration.Give it at least three episodes before passing judgment or go to the study with dad.",/review/rw4675869/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2017,quinimdb,8," Moral Orel
","""Moral Orel"" began as a clever and biting but formulaic religious satire by design, parodying the religious cartoons meant to teach young kids lessons about their faith. Each episode began by focusing on a rambling sermon given by Reverend Putty that Orel then follows to a literal fault, often causing havoc in the town, and then being ""set straight"" by a illogical and contradictory teaching from his alcoholic father after a beating. If this sounds very dark, that's because it is, but in the show it is all delivered in an absurd and comical manner, for the first season at least.",/review/rw4675869/?ref_=tt_urv

4 February 2006,gabrieldel,," Don't listen to the other reviews, Moral Orel is one of the best new shows on adult swim
","Many people say that adult swim is losing its touch with brand new shows like Perfect Hair Forever and Squidbillies but I see it as a new direction. Moral Orel is adult swim's newest show. Animated using claymation, this show is about a young boy named Orel and his troubles growing up Christain. This show uses offensive humor sort of like South Park which is the main cause of the negative feedback but the show feels innocent and with that brand of offensive humor brings hilarious results. If you like twisted situations and claymation you should watch Moral Orel. If your a big baby that gets offended by this sorta humor Moral Orel is defiantly not for you. 8/10",/review/rw4675869/?ref_=tt_urv

18 June 2006,PrisonerNumber655321,10," I love this original play on corny religious shows!!!!!!!!!!
",Hopefully this review replaces the narrow minded review that preceded this one. First of all this original mockery of claymation religious shows makes me laugh no matter what anyone has to say about it. I've been waiting for a show like this to be created and this show does it and takes two steps further. This show is the best display of original thinking in this less than original world though it does take the religious parodies a little to far sometimes but other than that it just makes it more dangerous and unexpected. I give this show Two thumbs up and and two big toes up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,/review/rw4675869/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is a nice little warped take on ""Davey and Goliath"" about a pious, well meaning boy name Orel and his family ""The Puppingtons"".

10 December 2006,severin-gregor,10," Bravo, Dino Stamatopoulos!
","I'm a Christian and I find Moral Orel completely inoffensive. It's actually quite enlightening and reassuring. What the episodes criticize, in a very astute way, are the hypocrisies committed by some of the members of my religion. Orel, the lead character is a very pious and likable character. Dino Stamatopoulos and co. have found a way to reflect on some negative aspects of Faith while still keeping a carefully trained and sympathetic eye upon the positive.",/review/rw4675869/?ref_=tt_urv
