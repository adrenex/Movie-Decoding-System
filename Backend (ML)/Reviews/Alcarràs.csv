","I do not give out ratings of 10 lightly, but here it is - the first film in years that has been deserving of the rating.",/review/rw2158400/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2010,planktonrules,9," This is mind-blowing!
","This is such an incredibly weird movie that I am not even sure if I can adequately describe it, but I'll try. The film is, through the first half, a mockumentary about a problematic alien problem that will supposedly be happening in the near future. In 2010, an alien ship appears over Johannesburg and just hovers there. When humans eventually decide to cut through the hull, they find the ship packed with over a million aliens--aliens that are starving and look like giant bugs. Well, there seems to be no one in charge and they all are apparently workers who have no real purpose other than to work. When the UN decides to finally do something about it, the aliens are herded into a giant ghetto like those used during apartheid. And, for the most part, they are reviled or exploited--and kept as a permanent underclass.",/review/rw2158400/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2009,Robert_90,9," Expect the unexpected
","Everyone's seen the trailer that kick-started one very fishy-looking viral campaign, interviewing several humans and an alien in quick succession. That marks many people's first exposure to Neill Blomkamp's District 9, and the trailer - which had a decently executed ""mockumentary"" feel to it, which only served to make its sci-fi content seem even more surprising. This same element of surprise is still present throughout the film proper, and it is quite a cinematic treat.",/review/rw2158400/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2009,dvc5159,8," Excellent no-nonsense sci-fi actioner...
","Going into the cinema I had mixed expectations as I only saw a handful (yet interesting) posters and only one trailer. I only heard a handful of reviews yet all of them came from this site. Well, I decided to hedge my bets and walk in anyway. And I'm glad I did.",/review/rw2158400/?ref_=tt_urv

25 August 2009,Hitchcoc,9," A Sociological Sci Fi Thriller
","I have to admit I was sucked in by the TV commercials for this movie. I wasn't disappointed. It didn't take long to link the events of this film with the realities of many parts of our world. The aliens are the oppressed, and, realistically, the earthlings have interned them in camps and allowed them to create a dystopic society. They feast and are feasted upon by the exploiters. Like the Native-Americans and many other disenfranchised creatures, they have become a nuisance, and the society that is treating them so badly is now going to move them to a ""more convenient"" place. An overzealous public official, the central figure in the movie, gets his jollies by treating the aliens as if they were non-sentient creatures. He does a Steve Irwin kind of commentary as he invades their homes and tries to get them to agree to their relocation. He is so cocky that he doesn't realize that swipe from one these beings could cut him in half. In his stupid recklessness, he infects himself with an alien canister and begins to transform into one of them. The strength of this movie, however, is the ""humanity"" of the aliens. They have personalities. They are not bugs, though they look like them. They love, they fight, they survive in horrid conditions. This is a very complex movie that doesn't go for the cheap thrill, although it does occasionally go too much to the special effects and predictable battle scenes.",/review/rw2158400/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2016,Leofwine_draca,9," Visual masterwork
","Sci-fi has been in a bit of a rut in Hollywood so it's refreshing to see this South African take on the genre. Here, aliens are subject to apartheid and the film's ""hero"" is a guy committed to driving them away from mankind. The lead character is one of my biggest problems with the film. He's a jerk, and his redemption comes way too late in the proceedings. It should have come after his first escape, but even at the climax he's still acting like a jerk. The actor's fine, it's just the horrible character we're saddled with that rankles me.",/review/rw2158400/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2022,Misss25,8," Weirdly mindblowing
","This movie different from the rest of the Alien movies. Though the gross awful looking aliens creeps me out most of the time at but that doesn't distract me from enjoying this the unique story. It kept at the edge of the seat whole time. It surprises, saddens, and amazes me at the same time. I never imagined this movie would end in this way.",/review/rw2158400/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2020,truemythmedia,8," Brilliant World-building and Social Commentary
","""District 9"" is a film I was lucky enough to see in the theater when it first released. The marketing for the movie was remarkably good, posters everywhere meant that before you even entered the theater, you had already been primed to see the ""Prawns"" as a nuisance, larger and stronger than humans, and probably best kept at a distance. The film's opening and narrative bookends being from the perspective of a documentary of news crew meant that everything felt very lifelike when you saw ads running on TV. As a Sci-fi lover, my interest was primed and pumping as I bought my ticket.",/review/rw2158400/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2009,Billy_Costigan,," District 9 - Not your typical Sci-Fi Action Thriller
","District 9 is a story about aliens who make contact with Earth and the relationships with humans and society. The creatures were set up in a makeshift home in South Africa's District 9. Control over the aliens has been contracted out to Multi-National United (MNU), a private company uninterested in the aliens' welfare. Their sole interest, alien technology and weapons. Weapon research would mean huge profits for the company. Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) is placed in charge of the filed operation to evict, remove, and place the aliens in a new holding facility. Conflict and tension threaten the operation as agents move in. ",/review/rw2158400/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2014,SnoopyStyle,8," Great original sci-fi
","In 1982 a spaceship appears over Johannesburg, South Africa. They find an alien population of ""Prawns"" and put them in a concentration camp called District 9. After 20 years, the local population has had enough of the aliens and plan to relocate the aliens to a location far away. Wikus van der Merwe is a meek bureaucrat who is given charge to organize the relocation plan by private corporation MNU. District 9 has become a vast lawless place with alien technologies. While rounding up the Prawns and getting signatures on paperwork, Wikus is infected with something that is slowly morphing him into the alien.",/review/rw2158400/?ref_=tt_urv

",I caught an early screening of this movie last night. I went into it with high expectations considering the high ratings it has been getting already. My expectations were not high enough however because this film exceeded my them in every way possible.,/review/rw2158400/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2009,thebackofmyhouse,9," It is just THAT good.
","Saying this movie is good would be an understatement. The movie has it all, a very intriguing deep plot, good acting and great action. If I was to find a flaw in this movie, it would be the shaky cam technique employed at the beginning part of the movie and also at the very end. The shaky parts are supposedly documentary clips telling the story of Wikus, the protagonist. But rather than add to the feel of it, the shakiness is just nauseating. They just over did it. But after a while into the movie, they got out of the documentary mode and things couldn't be any better. And the special effects in his movie will have you believing that these aliens are real.",/review/rw2158400/?ref_=tt_urv

","Ever since Neill Blomkamp was lined to do the film version of the ""Halo"" video game, he's become a household name with the fanboys. But as we all know, that project stalled and Blomkamp is no longer on board as a director. After that happened, Peter Jackson gave Blomkamp $30 million to make whatever movie he wanted. Blomkamp made this film, and it is a stunning debut.",/review/rw2158400/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2018,Kirpianuscus,," a great film
","Short, it is a film who must see it. For so many reasons than it escapes of any explanation. It is a Sci. Fi. and an action film and it propose a touching story. But it has, as basic virtue, the science to present the near reality in the most inspired manner. That defines it as one of films who are , in same measure, bitter and gentle and impecable work. It is a pledge. Foor a lot of causes. But, more important, it is a simple story of an ordinary man changing everything. A film about noble courage. Almost, wise use of an old fashion recipe. In fact, a great film. In few scenes, the film who you expect from a long, long time.",/review/rw2158400/?ref_=tt_urv

","District 9 is a movie to think about. The first (and second) time I watched District 9, I wasn't quite sure what to think. I came at it from the p.o.v. of a science fiction fan, and I thought some of the SF elements were not entirely thought through. But I thought some more about it, and things started to gel.",/review/rw2158400/?ref_=tt_urv

7 August 2009,charlytully,10," Provocative movie has something for almost everyone
","I just saw an advance screening for DISTRICT 9 with some others from my book club. Half of the 300 people attending were still buzzing about this film-goers' delight when the lights came up after closing credits. Some said its setting in South Africa's Soweto slums reminded them of CITY OF GOD. Others said its mockumentary style was reminiscent of CLOVERFIELD. Someone said it ranks up there with THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL (1951, of course) and ALIEN for sci-fi originality. Another fan said it reminded her of IMPOSTOR ""on steroids"" (I looked this up, and it's an obscure 2001 flick starring Gary Sinise, in a moral dilemma similar to Wikus' in DISTRICT 9). At any rate, normally I don't award low-budget ($5 million) remakes of shorts with a ""10"" out of 10 rating, but I found DISTRICT 9 to be enough of an eye-opener to deserve a ""10,"" despite being more flawed than any other top-ranking movie I can think of at the moment. The key to enjoying DISTRICT 9 is to sit back, and not to nit-pick. It may lack the stars and special effects bazillions of TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN or STAR TREK: THE FUTURE BEGINS, but DISTRICT 9 will give most people more food for thought than either of those two earlier releases of this summer.",/review/rw2158400/?ref_=tt_urv

1 March 2013,The-Sarkologist,9," A brilliant movie on so many levels
","One of the great things about watching this film with a South African is that you do get a different perspective of the film that you would otherwise. I saw it first in the cinema and then at a film night when one my South African friend came around as well. Her comments were that a number of the scenes in the film were reflective of what she remember in South Africa, particularly during the apartheid period (despite her being too young to actually remember South Africa then). Also, she came from Johannesberg, so she could also attest to the slums that were there.",/review/rw2158400/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2009,Quinoa1984,8," a ruthless satire and a (mostly) kick-ass blockbuster
","District 9 doesn't f*** around, mostly. It's a harsh look at a harsh people, mainly us. It asks a question posed countless times before: what would happen if ""they"" came ""here"" and how would we respond and they act. By the end of District 9, a movie where we see an alien ship stalled over Johannesburg and the million or so ""prawn"" aliens taken and put into a slum of the movie's title, you'll wonder deeply about our own ethical state of being. You might wonder also why Neill Blomkamp, the director (first time feature by the way), didn't show more of the aliens, at least until the second half of the film. This is intentional on his part because it's about drawing specific parallels in how human beings will look at a culture that is the ""other"", and I do mean ""other"".",/review/rw2158400/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2020,aidanratesmovies,9," Unlike Anything Before
","With some fascinating and wildly realistic worldbuilding, and some well given direction, District 9 is a modern day sci-fi classic that will not soon be forgotten. The film does have its fair share of problems from time to time, whether it is its struggle to find an appropriate pacing, burdening on cliches, or mimicking around plot holes in its story. However, District 9 offers some of the best realistic sci-fi films have had to offer in quite some time, with some splendid performances, mostly good CGI and a harsh but entertaining nature. Highest praise goes to Neill Blomkamp, whose vision for the films shines more than anything, with its gritty and sole picture being the backbone of the film entirely. The writing can vary from strange and complex, to weak and illogical, but it's shining moments are what sticks through the longest. The performances are all well given, although there isn't quite any standouts, as it just feels so lifelike, it's hard to quite pick what actor is truly giving the best work. In the end, District 9 is an unforeseen gem that is not to be missed, and not to be forgotten.

7 September 2010,Smells_Like_Cheese,9," Comment for Humans only
","Amazing how far we've come in the Sci-Fi genre, thinking back to the 1950's of all those alien movies that always somehow involved an improper joke about the Russians. Nevertheless, since then some incredible movies have come out and one after another each one has either been groundbreaking or just.. Battlefield Earth. District 9 brings in a new audience with many current issues we have today that include immigration, segregation, capitalism and hopes of a better future then the current. District 9 was showered with nothing but positive reviews and was even offered the Best Picture Oscar. I'm not so sure I see it as the best thing as sliced bread as some other critics praised the picture to be, but I really did love this film. Back in the 1980's, a film called Enemy Mine came out and seemed to be overlooked. The film has a similar plot and had to be carried by two great lead actors, only difference being the setting. So I don't look at District 9 as highly original or groundbreaking, however it's still a great movie that I was very impressed with. So used to the image where most Sci-Fi movies have a clean stainless steal look to the aliens and their home, this film is dirty. The aliens are ugly, but have personality and are friendly with humans, to those who don't fight their unfortunate situation having to stay on Earth. The humans however are mostly evil, almost to a fault where it will take just one human to be put in place of being as isolated as the aliens are.",/review/rw2158400/?ref_=tt_urv
