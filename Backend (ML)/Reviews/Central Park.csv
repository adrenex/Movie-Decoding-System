7 July 2021,starlight172006,8," Season 1 is fantastic but...
","Okay, as a Bob's burgers fan, I have to say I really enjoy the whole awkward-but-loving family backstory and the songs are catchy as hell. Season one had a fantastic backstory / plot that made the whole thing fast paced and truly amazing, but somehow they dropped it in season 2 and even though I love the characters, my sparkling joy has been tainted and is slowly wearing me out. Come on Central Park, find back your soul !",/review/rw5788721/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2020,G33KEd,9," Bob's Burgers, but as a musical!
","The creator of Bob's Burgers, Loren Bouchard, has created a brand new show made exclusively for Apple TV+!",/review/rw5788721/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2020,Boganafoganacy,7," Getting hate for the wrong reasons
","People seem annoyed that the show is a musical and it uses the same animation as Bob's Burgers.
Firstly, it was made by one of the creators of Bob's Burgers so it seems obvious to me they would use the same animation style, all of Matt Groening's shows (Simpsons, Futurama, Disenchantment) all use the same animation style and I don't know why it should even be an issue anyway.
Secondly, it is very clearly a musical but this still surprises people. If you strongly dislike musicals the show isn't for you and that's okay but if you don't mind them then I'd say give it a go. It's a fun show with great characters, a supportive loving family, Daveed Diggs and some great stories. I believe this show deserves a much higher rating than the one it has. I guess people just feel very strongly about singing...?",/review/rw5788721/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2020,someweare,10," For the love of musicals-WATCH THIS SHOW!!!
","Let me start by saying right off the bat that this is an animated MUSICAL series. If musicals are NOT your thing, please...DON'T WATCH THIS!! I've noticed several negative reviews here from people who hate that ""there is too much singing"" in the show. Don't ruin the ratings here for a new, original series just because it's a genre (musicals) that you don't even like. I don't like reality shows so, you know what? I don't watch them and therefore don't share my opinion on any of them. Now... for those who DO LIKE musicals (like myself) this show, in just two episodes, has tapped into something that has not really been explored much outside of Disney animated movies. We've had plenty of animated series that use adult humor but how many have used the musical as their primary format? Not only is Central Park laugh-out-loud funny, the musical numbers are actually really, really good! Almost all the songs are infectiously catchy to the point that you might just find yourself searching for the soundtrack in Apple Music or Spotify (I know I will). Watching this I felt like I was watching a great Broadway musical, not an animated tv show. Please ignore the negative reviews here because they are speaking from their bias against an entire genre. This is a hilarious show with surprisingly well sung musical numbers that will have you rewatching when it's all done.",/review/rw5788721/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2020,pogopuggie,9," New. Different. Wholesome. Musical.
","The musical element is an absolute stand out, the casting is perfect, the episodic stories are good as well as the park vs development villain storyline that ties it together. Smooth quality animation and natural dialogue, with all the silly quirkiness you'd expect from a show animated like Bob's Burgers. It's early but I feel confident to recommend the watch.",/review/rw5788721/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2021,Dust_in_it_off,5," The story is lost in the music
","The plot is pretty interesting, but in true musical fashion, half of each episode is spent singing about things that don't further the plot along. If you are into musicals, this show might be for you, but if you are looking for something more like Bob's Burgers, you are better off checking out The Great North instead.",/review/rw5788721/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2020,plasticanimalz,5," It's No Bob's Burgers
","I think Josh Gad is funny as an actor but this is the 3rd animation pet project I've seen from a famous actor who doesn't seem to understand that animation is not the same as live-action. It's a completely different art form. It does have the creator of Bob's Burger on it but it's pretty obvious he's not running this ship, other than it using the same character design style. The narration doesn't work. I understand Josh Gad wants to be part of the project but all the narration chisels away at the limited time for a 22-minute+ show. I like Kristen Bell, as always, and Stanley Tucci's character is kind of funny, and the dad in the show has a good singing voice, though, I don't particularly care for his character or the family's storyline, other than that. Kind of bland.",/review/rw5788721/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2021,ViewingBoch,9," Treated unfairly.
","This show is really great! People who are rating this one stars are mad because it's a musical and it uses the same art style as Bob's Burgers for some reason? Firstly you should've known it was a musical as soon as you clicked on the trailer, and secondly who cares if it uses the same art style it's literally made by the creator of Bob's Burgers they use the exact same style for The Great North and I don't see anyone complaining about it. Overall, give it a shot I don't particularly enjoy or like musicals but this was just spot on! Hopefully the ratings go up higher, it's sad to see it on a six....",/review/rw5788721/?ref_=tt_urv

30 May 2020,jlimtiaco-69419,10," I LOVE it so far!
","The music is great, the characters are loveable out the gate, and I'm really looking forward to watching the rest of the season. I'm already on that first episode soundtrack on Spotify.",/review/rw5788721/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2020,redhotfuzz,9," Fresh and fun!!!
","I can't say I'd normally call myself a big fan of musicals, but I have to admit I really love the musical angle of this animated series. Love the characters, interesting setting (family living in Central Park) and plot thus far. Funny, clever, and endearing. Great voice actors and love the music. Good luck hearing the song ""Weirdos Make Great Superheroes"" and not having it stuck in your head for days (the soundtrack is available on Apple Music). A great addition to the Apple TV+ lineup!",/review/rw5788721/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2020,realitycheck4you,2," NOT like bob's burgers
","Bob's Burgers is funny; this is not. It's like it doesn't know if it is written for adults or children. Yea, the animation is similar to Bob's Burgers. The humor is not at all similar. It's not funny. It's actually annoying because it is TRYING to be funny but it's boring. There are SOME minor moments that are funny, and there are a few catchy songs. But most songs are boring. It's just too PG and boring. The characters are dull except for the evil old lady. Of course Kristin Bell kills her songs - she has a great voice. Maybe this is a show parents can watch with children. For a childless adult, this is NOT adult animation.",/review/rw5788721/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2020,cartoonnewsCP,10," Loving this show so far
","Wow! I am blown away with how good the new Central Park show is. I'll be giving a short review!

30 May 2020,chrismtw,10," Weirdos make great superheroes
","Great start. Bob's Burgers quality writing with a well composed soundtrack so far. This is a musical, and it's a pretty good one so far (2 episodes available at time of review).",/review/rw5788721/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2020,babymanperson,1," Not very good and lacks the wit of Bob's Burgers
","Its boring, its slow, its excessivly cutsey, and its schumltzy. The characters themselves are fine. There is even more toilet humor in this show than Bob's Burgers. There are too many toilet jokes and not enough witty jokes.",/review/rw5788721/?ref_=tt_urv

30 May 2020,CartoonMan2020,1," Unfunny Musical Bob's Burgers Reject
","The art director/animators didn't even TRY to make it their own unique artform, they just use the exact same style as Bob's Burgers. You know those annoying episodes of cartoons where the theater people on the crew force everyone to do a lame, painfully unfunny musical episode and shove it down the audience's throats? Yea, that's ALL THIS SHOW IS. No wonder this show failed to make it onto Fox and got pushed to Apple+, (cough) total crap (cough cough).",/review/rw5788721/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2020,cherold,6," seems kinda promising?
","Central Park is an animated musical TV series that starts it's first episode with a big, splashy, Broadway-musical-style number that is quite long and tedious. It is easily the weakest song in the episode, and perhaps if I hadn't been so immediately put off my response to the episode would have been different.",/review/rw5788721/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2020,mdbourke-282-899973,9," Loren Bochard and Josh Gads Love Letter to New York
","This is just what the doctor ordered!! To a heartbroken New York City recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic, Central Park is a quirky and refreshing animated Musical Comedy from the creator of Bobs Burgers and Josh Gad (Yes, That Josh Gad - who is a not as annoying as he has been in the past). Firstly, this is a musical which is animated, but I warmed to it from the first note. Voiced by Kristen Bell, Titus Burgess, Daveed Diggs, Stanley Tucci ,Leslie Odom Jr and Kathryn Hahn, you wil be well served and the musical numbers are to damned catchy!! Oh and not that it should matter, but Bravo for the Bi-Racial family :-) 13 Episodes this season with an average of 3 musical numbers per episode, that's 39 songs to get stuck in my head...Oh well, I guess ""We've got to do it while we can""",/review/rw5788721/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2021,MajBlade2,5," a big yawn
",Remember when this was a big deal due to a voice actors color? Ya neither does anyone else. After the fake outrage machine moved on this show slowly sank into oblivion its not a good look from the creators of Bobs Burgers its just missing something and yes the musical part of it is annoying and not funny. They will shoehorn in a second season because they have to but that will be the end of it,/review/rw5788721/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2020,OnlyAtJMart,4," Would be mediocre without the song exposition... that makes it really annoying
","I thought we all agreed that breaking in to songs was unnatural and completely takes you out of the experience. Apparently this show didn't get the memo, because they made something more bland than Bob's Burgers, with song breaks, that take any interest you had in the episode, and throw it away. It seems like Apple TV has its loyal legion of employees, investors, cast and crew bumping up it's ratings. If you have to have a gimmick and a star studded cast, just to pull of something as bland, and annoying as this, maybe you shouldn't have gone with this to bulk up your streaming service. Apple TV has yet to make a good show, without its flaws. ""See"" was good, but you have to forgive a lot of stupid choices, boring travel, and characters being brought to other story lines to make them interesting, and it was very predictable. Plus Voss' (Momma) plot armor is thicker than anything I've seen since Game of Thrones. ""Morning Show"" tried too hard, and is just an over the top commentary of the post #MeToo movement. ""Defending Jacob"" was painfully boring, predictable, full of extremely stupid character choices just to make it work and wouldn't have been as watched without the casting of Chris Evans who does most of the heavy lifting, as far as the acting goes. Pablo Schreiber and JK Simmons did a great job as well, but are offset by Martell (Jacob) and Dockery (Laurie), who have 2 emotions, and are annoying. I could go on but you get the point. If it's on Apple TV, it's pretty flawed. The Beastie Boys documentary/stage biopic was great, but you'd have to be a fan to be interested, and it's not Apple TV that should get the credit here either, they just picked up something that would have been good, no matter who streamed it, and probably would have ended up on Netflix had they not grabbed it first. Anyway, if you wouldn't like a less amusing Bob's Burgers, with musical numbers, you won't like Central Park. Plus, the act of releasing each episode one week at a time takes most of the fun out of streaming services.",/review/rw5788721/?ref_=tt_urv

","From the creator of Bob's Burgers, we've got Central Park, and animated musical comedy that features a family who lives at a central park and trying to set things right, the characters are pretty good, especially the show's antagonist, she's pretty funny. Also Josh Gad did pretty good with this show. The animation is very fluid and the songs are pretty catchy and also hilarious. This show makes me laugh and it is just as good as Bobs Burgers.

10 June 2020,charleski2000,1," Ghastly singing, vapid humour
","I've watched some bad TV in my time, but this must be looking for some sort of prize. I'm not a fan of musicals, but when done well they can be very enteratining. This is not the case here. The music is leaden and trite and the singing is simply awful, and by that I mean really, REALLY bad. I bet you'd get better vocal performances from your local high-school. If you've seen Pierce Brosnan in Mamma Mia then you'll know what we're getting here.",/review/rw5788721/?ref_=tt_urv
