27 August 2003,emily37,9," a good teen movie that shows how bad today's teen movies have gotten
","with the recent release of the special edition dvd of this film, i'd suggest you go watch it.  yeah, this movie is a light, fluffy gen-x teen movie with its music video moments.  however, what was eight years ago just a normal teen movie has gained some semblance of social relevance --  compared to today's teen movies, this film can be seen as some sort of masterpiece.

2 May 2011,hitchcockthelegend,8," I do not regret the things I've done, but those I did not do.
","Empire Records is directed by Allan Moyle and written by Carol Heikkinen. It stars, Anthony LaPaglia, Maxwell Caulfield, Debi Mazar, Johnny Whitworth, Liv Tyler, Renée Zellweger, Rory Cochrane, Robin Tunney & Ethan Embry. Plot centre's on one day at independent record store Empire Records. With the store under imminent threat of a take over by a corporate chain, this is no ordinary day. For on the day that the store will be visited by a fading pop star, they are forced to confront their personal issues, and maybe, just maybe, learn something about the people they work with.",/review/rw5716443/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2001,po5mrk,10," Perfect...Well, not quite Perfect
","For me, Empire Records is a very conflicting movie.  On the one hand, it's hysterically funny.  On the other hand, it attempts to make great revelations about America's youth.  Somehow, though, it all works!  Sure, there are some ""sappy"" predictable parts that you're not sure whether to laugh or cry at, but the timing of these scenes is fantastic.  One thing that really struck me about this film is the amazing use of music.  Certain songs can be heard repeatedly throughout the movie which really help to distinguish parallel story lines.  All in all, I think it's great.",/review/rw5716443/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2004,vertigo_14,8," Damn the Man, Save the Empire! (spoilers)
","Empire Records is one of the great music-based teen comedies made at the tail end of the grunge years. The characters are fantastic, the story is completely nutty, its got a pretty fantastic soundtrack, and the movie is really a good time all around, destined to bring a smile to your face.",/review/rw5716443/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2004,mifamily6,10," One of my modern favorites. Wait... THE favorite.
","This movie is awesome.  The best thing is the music.  Excellent.  It's the greatest collection of songs put into a movie.  Even better than Pulp Fiction.  There should be a BEST COMPILATION Oscar given to a music supervisor.  That's hard but in this kick-ass movie, it seems so effortless. The acting is also top-notch.  Renee Zellweger, Liv Tyler, Anthony LaPaglia, Robin Tunney, Johnny Whitworth, Max Caulfield, Debi Mazur, and Rory Cochrane, one of the coolest people alive.  The script is really good. Directing, also good.  Everything was pretty invisible, and I absolutely mean that in a positive way.  Just like in the old days, when it was invisible, they put you in the movie.  I felt like I was with these characters the whole way.  The new ""Remix!  Special Fan Edition"" is probably better.  I can't decide.  They're both superb.",/review/rw5716443/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2001,Taggarttrains,," See it twice to appreciate it.....you'll be lukewarm the first time and love it the second time.
","I love this movie.  This movie is the kind of movie I watch movies for (um....did you follow that?).  I would make one suggestion, however....watch it twice before you decide if you like it or not.  If you're like me you'll probably be lukewarm the first time you see it but like it more each time you see it after that.",/review/rw5716443/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2005,lilcutie18613,9," Empire Records
","This movie follows the stories of many people who work at Empire Records, a music store on the brink of closing. All the characters are memorable, even the boy who steals a CD and is caught and hit by the door of a car. The drama, comedy, and music work well together all around.",/review/rw5716443/?ref_=tt_urv

",This is a films that you can easily watch over and over again and not get sick of. If you are a teenager and havent seen this.. where have you been. Go rent this baby today. This film reminds me of my days working in a certian franchise doing little as possible and slacking off at any time possible. AHHH those where the days..... The acting overall is quite good and along with the pumping soundtrack makes this a joy to watch. GO GET THIS NOW!!!,/review/rw5716443/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2013,AvidClimber,7," Empire Records — Mostly marginal kids working in a record shop as solace
","Empire Records is funny and slightly offbeat teen movie. A well built one, which each quirky character having a well defined personality, a set of problems, and realistic interactions with each other. Their personas all ring solidly true, each with deep emotional affects. However, not everybody will see themselves represented here, it is but a thin slice of society.",/review/rw5716443/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2005,Smells_Like_Cheese,8," A rock and roll good time of teen movies
","I remember watching some of this when I was like 11 years old, a year after it came out. A friend of mine was just in love with this movie, but I didn't really watch much of it. I just couldn't relate or didn't get it.",/review/rw5716443/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2021,shawnmikedryer,9," Nineties essence
","Empire records is the last of a dying breed, the heart and soul of the place is held together by a tight knit group of young people who work there. This film shows a day in the life of the group who all share a common bond with the love of music. Now the business is at risk of being taken over by a larger conglomerate, Music town. With a stricter business model the plan would turn the beautiful essence of the place on its head and become just another money greedy chain. With countless personal complications amongst the gang whilst trying like hell to raise enough money to keep the owner happy enough to keep the place independent it won't be easy. This is a last ditch effort for Empire Records to escape being swallowed whole by corporate greed.",/review/rw5716443/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2012,The-Sarkologist,10," Pretty much my favourite romantic comedy
","When coming to this movie there is so much in it that needs to be said and can be said that it is almost impossible to get everything out of it in 1000 words. Aristotle's unity of time and place plays out well in this film as the action occurs through a single day and plays out mostly in the record shop. Further, each of the characters in the film have an epiphany which will change the direction of their life.",/review/rw5716443/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 1998,Lindy-5,," A Soon-to-be Cult Classic

29 May 2019,BandSAboutMovies,7," A failure at first
","Empire Records may not be a musical, but without music, it wouldn't really have much of a story, would it? It does fit into the main prerequisite for this week: it was a total bomb on release before finding an audience that was ready for it years after it was actually made. This coming of age and battle against the corporation film may have just been too much for 1995, but in 2019? It fits right in.",/review/rw5716443/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2006,TxMike,," Slice of life in a music store.
","As one critic bluntly says, in one day everything that can possibly happen to the characters does, and everyone comes out better at the end. Truly this doesn't happen in real life, but in REEL life we call it entertainment. I enjoyed it as a quirky comedy. I probably would not have been so entertained if it didn't have some of my favorite stars, some before they hit it big -- Renee Zellweger, Liv Tyler, Debi Mazar, and Anthony LaPaglia. I was not familiar with Rory Cochrane, but his character Lucas was one of the best here.",/review/rw5716443/?ref_=tt_urv

8 August 2005,PersianPlaya408,9," A great movie with a now-famous cast that was young at the time
","I was impressed with Moyle's comedy about young teens helping their boss (Lapaglia) save his record store from turning into a chain ""MusicTown"" (barbershop sort of stole this theme). After seeing this film, I'm enthusiastic to watch Pump up the volume. The film sets out and achieves everything it attempts to achieve. A very funny film, with a great atmosphere, nice dialogues, and a very talented young cast. The screenplay was very well written, with some very cool dialogues. La Paglia was good in his role, however the best performances in the film came from Renee Zellweger, Rory Cochrane and a very hilarious Brendan Sexton. Liv Tyler was also good, as were Embry and Whitworth. I actually enjoyed this film a lot, contrary to the people I saw it with, who said they bored (this is typical of them however because they wanted to watch a Jackie chan movie, lol) A very funny, unorthodox teen movie, 9/10",/review/rw5716443/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2005,nobbytatoes,8," surprising
",It's closing time at empire records. Lucas has close and he is anxious about it being but with this responsibility; but then he does something wrong. He takes off with nine thousand dollars to Atlantic City and loses it in one grand gesture on the craps table. The next day he comes to realise his mistake; but he's not the only one with problems today at empire records. Through this one day we meet the rest of the employees and one day they wont forget in a long time.,/review/rw5716443/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2006,jleroy013,10," Great movie!
","I had heard a lot about this movie, that it was one of those really great but under-appreciated 90's movies, so I decided to watch it. It is now one of my favorite movies and I'm really glad that I saw it. Every actor does a great job - they make you feel like you've known them forever and you really go through the troubles that they are going through. I especially liked Ethan Embry as Mark and Johnny Whitworth as A.J. I was really surprised with how well Liv Tyler acted the part. The characters themselves are really relate able, and made me want to work at that store so badly. Also, it had one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard. I loved how they incorporated the music into each scene - it was part of what was going on, not just background noise. Overall, this was a really great movie - ***** out of 5.",/review/rw5716443/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2003,Johnny_Depp_Forever,8," Great movie, a sign of it's time
","I love this movie very much. I don't own a lot of movies but this is one that I do. Like any film, it has it's problems but in general it is great. The film was well casted, each actor fit and made the best of his or her role. Maxwell Caulfield played Rex Manning, the character you love to hate. Anthony LaPaglia played Joe who was one of the best managers that you could work for. The actor's attitude toward his role was very well displayed. Rory Cochrane played Lucas, who is my favorite character in this movie. Then there is Johnny Whitworth, now everybody sort of disinclueds him or doesn't like him but I think that he did a good job as AJ, I could not see anyone else there, maybe someone could have done a better job but he did well. The rest of the cast was fantastic. The plot of the film was a little non existent, it's more like a series of events that just go one after the other with no really flow. Anyways, take the movie for what it is: teenagers working at a record store, dealing with life issues with good music playing in the background. This is a great film.",/review/rw5716443/?ref_=tt_urv

","An employee steals the money from a record store's vault, with the hopes of gambling with it in Atlantic City and making it big. He fails, and the next day the store must face the reality: without the money, they will be turned into one of many chain stores where the more laid back approach to selling music just doesn't slide with those in charge. Also, this day features a visit from washed-up pop star Rex Manning.",/review/rw5716443/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2019,angeloukorstjens,9," Shock me shock me shock me with that deviant behavior
","I was a teenager when this movie came out and as a nineties kid this movie really speaks to me. The soundtrack is awesome, the characters make a nineties teenage heart beat faster. I understand it's not a movie ""kids"" under 30 will relate to. It has no plot, no real storyline, the characters are clichés. But who cares!! That was never the intention of this movie. I literally watched this over 29 times and love it every single time. It just makes me happy.",/review/rw5716443/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 1999,JeffG.,1," You can feel the IQ points dropping
","Roger Ebert pretty much summed this movie up best when he described it as a soundtrack in search of a film. There's no plot here, just a bunch of obnoxious teens goofing off and dancing. This is one of those movies that really insults your intelligence. Spare yourself and rent something else instead.",/review/rw5716443/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2020,rivertam26,9," A criminally underseen classic
","Initially when this film was released it flopped financially and critically. It has definitely built a deserved cult following over the years. It's one of my favorite go to make me feel great movies that explores a plethora of emotions making it similar to having the impact of the breakfast club and fitting perfectly in the wheelhouse of films that explore youth in a genuine way. This review is for both the Superior theatrical version and the interesting but flawed extended version. It centers on a group of employees whom deal with a variety of issues while working at a record store that's on the verge of closing. All the characters are quirky and wonderfully likable Renee Zellweger, Robin Tunney and Liv Tyler being the standouts. It's easy to see why the extended stuff was cut and the impact of some of the films best scenes are lessened including the amazing finale. I would highly reccomend just skipping the extended version and just sticking with the best cut. As it stands it's a love letter to the changing music scene as well as youth in general. Its hilarious fun and heartfelt and also stars Joe Mategna, Debi Mazar, Ethan Embry, Maxwell Caufield and so many more.",/review/rw5716443/?ref_=tt_urv
