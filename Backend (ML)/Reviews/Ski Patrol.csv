9 June 2015,kosmasp,7," Feeling the touch
","You cannot be more down to earth than having no shoes and socks on. Barefoot is being risky, because you're expose yourself to getting hurt (a lot). But it also means you feel things on a different level, you probably enjoy things more than others, since you are more connected to things and letting them in.",/review/rw8318347/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2015,inkblot11,7," A remake of a German Film, has very original concept but the first half is more successful than the second
","Jay Wheeler (Scott Speedman) lives up to his name as a wheeler-dealer. A son of wealthy New Orleans stock, he has chosen to run up gambling debts and pursue other nefarious actions. This lands him in jail, where he is sentenced to community service at a mental hospital. While mopping the floors, he saves a pretty patient, Daisy (Evan Rachel Wood) from being assaulted by a male resident of the same ward. Not long after this, his gambling totals are so large that the casinos are after him. His only recourse is to go back home for his brother's wedding, where he will ask his father for a ""business loan"". But, needing to look the part of a successful gentleman, Jay decides he needs a lady on his arm. All of the pole dancers of his acquaintance turn him down so he gets the brilliant idea to bring DAISY, after she follows him out the door one night. Is he serious? Yes, she's highly functional but may have killed her mother, also a disturbed individual. With instructions to tell everyone she is a nurse, can Daisy and Jay pull this ruse off? Not likely, and soon other escapades follow. Meanwhile, the hospital's head shrink (JK Simmons) is throwing fit after fit. Is there a future for this strange couple? This remake of a German film has a great concept and a winning performance from Wood to elevate its eventual loss of energy. What fun to have a ""crazy"" woman pose as a gal pal at a high society wedding! Speedman does fine work, too, as do Treat Williams, Simmons, Kate Burton and more. As the scenery goes from California to Louisiana to Texas and back again, fans of varied venues will be happy, too. Yes, the flick slows down and loses focus in the second half but still will resonate with a certain kind of offbeat film lover. So, if that's you, get shoes on and go get Barefoot.",/review/rw8318347/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2015,stills-6,7," Implausible and charming
","Don't look too deeply. This is a movie that wants to be fun and adventurous and a little bit dangerous. If you're in the right mood, you don't need much more than that. Sure it's ridiculous and implausible and poorly edited, and Scott Speedman only has two gears, and the writing is a little off, and the central relationship is a little creepy on several different levels. No matter. This is one of those movies that is touched by the magic of the movies -- maybe not enough to make it great or even good as a movie, but it has a relentless sparkle-eyed charm that makes it pleasant and irrationally satisfying as an experience.",/review/rw8318347/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2014,tanjareen-1,8," Sweet remake with a lovely Evan Rachel Wood
",As a German movie fan I am familiar with Til Schweiger's original 'Barfuss' (2005). But since I always try to keep an open mind I was intrigued to see this remake - and I wasn't disappointed.,/review/rw8318347/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2021,SirTalyn,10," One of the best romantic movies
","One of the best romantic movies I've seen in a long time. Scott Speedman is great but Evan Rachel Wood is SPECTACULAR as the semi clueless character he supporting cast of J. K. Simmons, Treat Williams, and Kate Burton is supreme as well.",/review/rw8318347/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2014,hiyaboyos,," Somewhat clunky but still heart-warming
","I watched this movie last night not knowing what to expect. I briefly read the premise and thought I'd take a chance and watch it. In a word, I was not disappointed. I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys just a good, simple, plain vanilla romantic movie. If you're not into that, then you wouldn't appreciate this movie.",/review/rw8318347/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2014,face-819-933726,9," Tender moments with a fantastic story will touch your heart.
","Take all of the innocence, and sweetness of Pretty Woman, and then make it feel real, and you will be getting close to the precious movie that this is. Evan Rachel Wood seems to have gotten younger, and is just so radiant as Daisy who is so like a little child that we meet on her first day in the real world. Scott Speedman is just great as the scatterbrained lead Jay, always looking over his shoulder, and running for the next bit of scraps as his life is slowly rotting away under him. The two come together at the best time for each, and we are taken with them on a sweet and tender journey in which they will both be the cure that the other one needs. To say I Enjoyed this would sell it short. I really loved this movie, and recommend it to everyone. There is a bit of language, and some minor violence. Beyond that you just have one great story with a fantastic cast who are all as real as you could hope for, but that still has a little bit of magic that every story needs.",/review/rw8318347/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2020,mistidakitten39,8," A Hidden Jewel!
","Not real sure why this didn't get a better score on Rotten Tomatoes! I am glad that I watched it anyway! Evan Rachel Wood is one of my favorite actresses ever since I saw her in ""Thirteen"" She is really great at ""feeling"" her character!! She did a perfect job with playing the innocent, sweet, isolated girl that falls in love! Fabulous story! Great job! Must watch, very heartfelt!",/review/rw8318347/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2020,jkt2006,6," Very cute and simple a romantic story!
",Sometimes all you are looking for is a simple story that is about simple people and simple lives. This one is about pure characters who find each other. Don't give a damn to the critics reviews or ratings. Just enjoy this one for a fun filled evening with a glass of wine. You won't regret it!,/review/rw8318347/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2014,soundaryaona,9," A heartwarming & feel good movie
","It was a very well written script with excellent acting by the lead pair. Evan Rachael was flawless in her portrayal with some great support by Scott. Its very different than your average Rom-com but does fall prey at some areas to the regular formula film making. Nevertheless a movie that's light & frothy which will end up making you feel for the characters. Its a good choice for a refresher after a day's long work to just unwind. The cinematography and music were also working well with the script. The direction was top notch and it looked like the director knew what he wanted from his actors. I wouldn't really mind watching it again sometime. A surprise package indeed, go for it !!!",/review/rw8318347/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2014,garychapman72,9," A rom-com with a difference
",Some reviews on here criticise that the male protagonist learns that you can just continue behaving badly until it pays off. I think those reviewers miss the point rather spectacularly. They're demanding the formula they've come to expect - no doubt if the movie WAS as perfectly formulaic as they expect they'd almost certainly criticise this too.,/review/rw8318347/?ref_=tt_urv

15 March 2014,audrulyte,9," A heartwarming and feel good movie
","Barefoot is a heartwarming and feel good rom-com with a twist. it ain't just another love story, but digs just a little bit deeper into themes of mental health, and the power of love to change one's course of this life. While my first encounter with the story came with the German Barfuss movie back in 2005, and while I still much prefer the German version (the soundtrack alone was a star in itself in that version) to this one, I was very satisfied with what Barefoot managed to achieve. I love the actors, both Scott Speedman and especially Evan Rachel Wood, gave a very strong and convincing performances. After watching the movie I felt elevated and heart-warmed, and for this lingering feel good sensation I give this movie 9 out of 10, and recommend it to any one looking for a good rom-com not following the standard rom-com formula all the way.",/review/rw8318347/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2021,NovaMarieWilson,8," Endearing
","The movie's atmosphere (in my eyes) was sadness mixed with empathy, silliness, romance and understanding. It's absolutely beautiful how innocence meets bad and how the two influence each other. I do think that you should watch further then the screen is showing to really feel the movie. Short verision: Just a real feel good movie! Which I think is worth watching.",/review/rw8318347/?ref_=tt_urv

25 June 2014,planktonrules,3," You could do a lot better than this one...
","""Barefoot"" is a very frustrating film to watch. The acting is very nice, the direction very good as well and the film has a lovely soundtrack. So it has everything you'd want in a rom-com...except for an intelligent and well-written script. Rarely have I seen a film like this---where everything was so good and the script was so darn awful. It's a shame, as the folks in this film deserve more...as does the audience.",/review/rw8318347/?ref_=tt_urv

25 February 2015,Aktham_Tashtush,5," a nice new Rom-Com to watch ... Not Hilarious but you'll still feel the story :)
","so this is actually the second time i watch something for Scott Speedman, the first time i'v watched him was in the Underworld movies when he was serious guy vampire /wolf .. but he really fits in these kinda romance-comedy movies ,, the movie had its moments , some highs and lows ,, the plot is good and new and heartwarming. the script is written in a good way , no complications on following the events. you know when you watch a movie and you feel happy , smiling in a weird way in the end , yeah .. that's one of those. The story itself starts slow and there is some missing ideas and it's not that Hilarious ,, but it still felt nice . the casting was so good. so i think overall the movie worked out pretty well.",/review/rw8318347/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2015,pooja_1390,8," A simple but sweet movie not to be missed
","The movie starts off simple (no beating around the bush and stretching the story; it is straight to the point) with Jay (Scott Speedman) who is a janitor in a psychiatric hospital. Jay owes a lot of people money and is actually on probation for the janitor job. He likes to spend some of his time with some of the patients. But the psychiatrist does not approve of this as Jay usually provides them with porn materials and booze. Anyway, one night, he saves Daisy (Evan Rachel Wood), a newly admitted patient in the psychiatric hospital, from getting raped. From that point, Daisy follows Jay as she does not want to stay at the hospital. As the story unfolds, we learn that Daisy has never stepped out of her house her entire life when her mother was alive. She is different and her sense of communication is different as well. Daisy is naive and we even see her lack of awareness of social rules but her character is nevertheless charming and will warm your heart as she is innocent and genuine in her own way. Jay takes Daisy home for his brother's wedding. Things soon get messy as Jay's parents find out about the real identity of Daisy. This movie was heart warming and different. Evan Rachel Wood portrayed the character of Daisy so well. The way she acted confused in pure innocence and the way she responded to the environment around her was amazing. She played her role really well. Loved it!",/review/rw8318347/?ref_=tt_urv
