17 November 2021,deloudelouvain,7," A good western is hard to find these days but this is one.
","Westerns look like a dying breed. Only every now and then you get another western so it's waiting for a good one. Old Henry is one of those. Not very fast paced but certainly worth watching. No huge names either, although Tim Blake Nelson was perfect to play his character. The cinematography was good, the acting was more than good, and the story has a little twist that was clever. Definitely worth your time if you like westerns.",/review/rw7533565/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2021,zardoz-13,10," Superb Western Showdown
","Accomplished character actor Tim Blake Nelson takes the lead in writer & director Potsy Ponciroli's horse opera ""Old Henry,"" one of the best frontier fracases since Clint Eastwood's Oscar-winning ""Unforgiven."" ""Unforgiven"" and ""Old Henry"" share many similarities. In ""Unforgiven"" (1992), notorious gunslinger William Munny (Eastwood) had gone straight, bought a farm, and settled down. He'd gotten himself hitched, too. His wife Claudia and he had two kids. He eked out an honest living raising hogs. Tragically, Claudia succumbed to smallpox. Later, disease ravaged his pigs. Leaving his kids to fend for themselves, Munny took his shotgun and rode off to get enough cash to change his fate. Similarly, Nelson plays an equally nefarious frontiersman. Having forsaken his six-gun, he settled down, got hitched, and sired a son. Furthermore, like William Munny, Henry McCarthy (Tim Blake Nelson of ""O, Brother, Where Art Thou"") lost his wife to tuberculosis, a disease often called 'consumption.' As a single parent, McCarthy has struggled to raise his son on the farm. Interestingly, before he turned to farming, McCarthy was a legendary desperado, who had been shot to death reportedly in the Arizona Territory in 1881. Since cheating death, McCarthy has laid low as a farmer. Nobody knows Henry's true identity, except his brother-in-law, Al (Trace Adkins of ""The Outsider""), his closest neighbor and his only surviving kin. Altogether, ""Unforgiven"" and ""Old Henry"" paint a bleak picture of frontier life. Nothing about the depiction of the Old West in either film could be described as glamorous. Farming lasted from before dawn until after dark. It was as back-breaking as it was soul-eroding. Diseases exacted a toll on both man and beast. ""Unforgiven"" and ""Old Henry"" look incredibly authentic. The violence erupts suddenly, often fatally, with neither the hero nor villain observing strict rules of fair play. Who wants to play fair when their life hangs in the balance?",/review/rw7533565/?ref_=tt_urv

30 September 2021,ferguson-6,8," a twisty western
","Greetings again from the darkness. When asked to explain the appeal, many fans of Western movies note how the clear division of good and bad, and right and wrong, allows for easy identification of those to root for, or even admire. Writer-director Potsy Ponciroli muddies the water with this one, blurring the lines between good guys and bad guys, and keeping us guessing until the end.",/review/rw7533565/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2021,nogodnomasters,8," So you saw it
",Old Henry has a homestead in the Oklahoma territory in 1906. He is basically a pig farmer and lives there with his son Wyatt (Gavin Lewis). His wife passed a decade ago. His Brother-in-law lives in a nearby farm. We see a sheriff hunting a man. An injured man manages to make his way to the homestead. Henry nurses him halfway back to life and protects him from the posse.,/review/rw7533565/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2021,jdesando,10," A small classic reminiscent of Unforgiven. Good viewing.
","Film westerns are sometimes like the dime novels that so frequently supported the tall tales therein-minimalist and fabulous. However, now and then an authentic and harrowing story like Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven rides in and changes things. I also characterize Old Henry, an Amazon original starring Tim Blake Nelson in the title role, of striking out for new fictional territory, although having a whiff of Unforgiven in the telling.",/review/rw7533565/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2021,billcr12,8," Great Western
","Tim Blake Nelson is Old Henry, a seemingly simple farmer who lives with his teenage son on a farm in turn of the century Oklahoma. He rescues a wounded man with a satchel and eventually must make choices in order to protect himself and his son. An all male cast is unusual in the modern era and they are all excellent. The story is has twists and turns which are based on historical people. The scenery is beautiful and Nelson should earn an Oscar nomination.",/review/rw7533565/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2021,A_Different_Drummer,7," good REVEAL!
","Irony abounds. Six decades ago you could not turn on the TV or go to a theatre without bumping into a western. Today they are few and far between. (Except for the fact that Clint Eastwood is still starring in them, which is just plain odd). So when this little gem shows up, with the guts to bet the farm (literally) on a tight script and a BIG REVEAL, you really have to take off your hat and salute it.",/review/rw7533565/?ref_=tt_urv

10 October 2021,DeadMansTrousers,9," Reminds us why we love westerns
",First of all the acting was superb on all accounts. I love a good western film and yes this is a slow burn thriller but once the action kicks in there are some beautifully choreographed gunfights and while I expected there to be a reveal of who the main character was in the past I never would've guessed what it ended up being. This is easily one of the most entertaining westerns I have seen in recent years and I highly recommend it if you're a fan of the genre.,/review/rw7533565/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2021,namstonk,7," Very enjoyable, a good film and better than fair western
","Is it a 10/10 as some are saying? NO. Is it below 5/10? Definitely not, it is a well above average film. The acting, score, cinematography are all very good, the script itself is also decent for its limitations, the only downside for me is that once you recognize a name it's pretty obvious the way it's going.",/review/rw7533565/?ref_=tt_urv

13 October 2021,Neptune165,7," Who is ""Pa"" ??! He got skills
","It was quite a good western movie I've seen recently. Good father for his son and excellent gunman for himself. This was a very good low budget movie! Simple. But good acting. And I like how the main hero is not some rugged handsome baby-faced actor.and I love it!! I really miss westerns. And seems like no one can make a good one these days? But tbh The kid (Gavin Lewis) he doesn't fit the role here, Found the sons character to be a bit annoying but overall pretty decent. This is good modern western. Deliberate pace, but not slow, holds the attention, and pays off well. This was a great if you haven't seen it don't read the comments to many spoilers.",/review/rw7533565/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2022,eddie_baggins,7," Nelson shines in a low-budget Western with a killer final act
",Much about new low budget western Old Henry feels familiar to anyone that has ever watched a grizzled and humorless take on the American west but that never stops director Potsy Pociroli's well-shot and acted drama from being an above average affair that gets extra points for allowing the always great Tim Blake Nelson a chance to take charge in a rare leading man role.,/review/rw7533565/?ref_=tt_urv

15 October 2021,gsygsy,7," Nicely made
","Well-written western, with an excellent central performance from Tim Blake Nelson as a farmer with more to him than meets the eye. Nelson is given top-flight support from Scott Haze and Stephen Dorff. I'm not so sure about the choice of Gavin Lewis, who plays Nelson's teenage son; he's less well cast, and feels urban in a way that the other actors in the cast don't.",/review/rw7533565/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2021,anthonyjlangford,9," Straight to the point
",Goes to prove that you can still make a great movie by just telling a simple story. It doesn't need to be dressed up with alternating timelines and overly political messages. No need to tick every box of some sort of identity manifesto in order to appeal to audiences. It just has to be entertaining. That's it.,/review/rw7533565/?ref_=tt_urv
