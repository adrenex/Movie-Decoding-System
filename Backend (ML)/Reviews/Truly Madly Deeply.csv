3 October 2022,DiCaprioFan13,10," All-time great!
","The Office is one of the best sitcoms ever made, period. This show is so good and so funny that it actually makes it look like working in an office is fun. It's not just the stars who make this show good either, the supporting cast are all just as funny as the main characters. It was universally thought of as the best sitcom on tv while it was on and now thought of as one of the best sitcoms in the history of television. The show wasn't quite as good after Steve Carell left but that's only because the seasons with him are so good. It's still a good show after he leaves, just not all-time good like when he was there. I still watch all the reruns when they're on and they're still just as funny after numerous viewings as they were after one.",/review/rw2956368/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2022,Supermanfan-13,10," One of the best comedies ever created!
","The Office is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the greatest tv shows ever created and easily one of the best comedies I've seen in my lifetime! It's at the top of just about every ""best sitcom ever"" list for a reason...because it's incredible! Just about every episode is hilarious, which is nearly impossible for any tv show but The Office comes pretty darn close. All you have to do is read through some of these reviews to see how loved this show really is. I'll always miss it but at least we'll always have the reruns to watch!",/review/rw2956368/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,RahulM007,10," A timeless sitcom that never gets old
","The Office is a mockumentary style sitcom that is loosely based on the British sitcom of the same name. One of my all-time favourite movies is 2008's ""Get Smart"" starring Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway. Despite being a massive Steve Carell fan, I only started watching The Office in 2022.",/review/rw2956368/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2014,movieaddict_8,10," Never gets old, never will.
","I'm going to go straight to the point, and say this is the most hilarious show I've ever seen. Michael's idiocy, and Jim's pranks on Dwight,and even Stanley's grumpiness is even hilarious! The show not only makes you laugh, there are some heartwarming moments, and there are some moments where you didn't see coming. And you know another way how 'The Office' is an fantastic show? The show was still good when Michael left! An huge part of The Office left, and it still was great! I've seen the ending of the office, and both times cried (And proudly so), because during the show, you fall in love with the characters, you relate to them. Basically, what I'm trying to say is, it's worth the 21 minutes.",/review/rw2956368/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2022,drana-86716,10," No Laugh Tracks!!!
","The best thing of this show is there are no background audiences laughing at even poor jokes. There are many sitcoms who use these tricks to add laughter and it is sometimes little bit irritating. The show depends on great dialogues, one liners and Steve Carell.",/review/rw2956368/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2019,ComedyFan2010,10," One of the best!
",The Office is definitely one of the best sitcoms out there. How many times have I watched it! And yet I still always laugh and find new jokes I missed before. I still get upset when it is over and already wonder when will I start again.,/review/rw2956368/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2011,kellypaul,10," Comparisons
","I'm from Scotland and loved the British ""Office"". But I adore the American version! Steve Carell leads a great cast and I'm not surprised it has lasted so long. I'm working my way through Series 3 and have series 4 and 5 to look forward to. It's amazing how much the writers can get into 20 minutes. I like it when there is a double episode. I too am so glad there is no laughter track (which has stopped me watching quite a few comedy shows). I have noticed in this third series that the camera can be very annoying when it whizzes from character to character - far too quickly. Completely unnecessary. Steve's ""Michael"" conveys so much about the character - he's full of himself but so vulnerable and anxious for friends. Rainn Wilson's ""Dwight"" is just brilliant. And I love the company name - ""Dunder Mifflin""!",/review/rw2956368/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2022,JokesOut,10," Obviously the best sitcom!!!
","This is the most remarkable and hilarious workplace comedy created in this decade unarguably. I watched all the first 7 seasons inside a few days and I wondered how this show kept me so relaxed and wanting more and more from these characters as the story lines kept me hooked on the ever changing plot. The writers have marvellously twisted the flow of the show adding suspense, a little bit of drama and romance and a whole lot of insanely funny pranks, jokes and it really bond us with the characters. And something I felt unique about this show is that how we felt for Michael when he was desperate with his life although we hated him when he was a nuisance and he added something to the show that I find unexplainable.",/review/rw2956368/?ref_=tt_urv

",A documentary film crew is tasked with recording the daily lives of the employees of the Scranton branch of the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. The employees turn out to be a wide assortment of characters.,/review/rw2956368/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2022,chrisklugh,9," Easily one of the best shows of all time
","So much to relate too. All the characters, they all had their place, and they all nailed it. Maybe Micheal was a little bit too over the top at times, but your love to hate him is what made him such a good person for the role.",/review/rw2956368/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2014,nigeljoy,10," My favourite sitcom EVER!!
","Honestly, I thought show as 'boring' even before I watched a single episode. Seriously, what interesting could happen in an office environment? I remember first scene I saw from this show. It was from an internet wallpaper with Michael Scott with a white board behind him saying ""You miss 100% of the shots you don't take"".",/review/rw2956368/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2022,evan_lassi,9," Hilarious!
","As someone who has a career in HR but has a sense of humor, this show is absolutely hilarious!",/review/rw2956368/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2007,MessyStinkman,7," Surpasses the brilliant original.
","After reading all of the horrible reviews coming from the UK, I felt the strong desire to comment. I learned that most of the reviewers bashing it have only seen a few (at most) episodes from the first season - many haven't seen it at all, and are simply bashing it because of an overwhelming sense of pride in the original. I'd be surprised if this review isn't skimmed over and marked unhelpful by them. Obviously I'm not speaking to all the British, but the majority that unfairly judge this show with little to no basis in the truth. ",/review/rw2956368/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2013,SnoopyStyle,9," One of the best comedic shows of all times
","It's a remake of the hit 2001 BBC TV series by Ricky Gervais. There is a documentary crew that has invaded the office of a midsize paper company in Scranton, Pennsylvania. The office manager Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is a good hearted if somewhat delusional and insensitive boss.",/review/rw2956368/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2020,leemyers-60171,10," One of the best TV shows EVER !!
","It's not common for an English persons to admit this but .......... Yes, this version is the absolute best. It is in another league to the original British program By miles!",/review/rw2956368/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2022,Joeihannah,10," The Best Show Of All=Time
",It's the best show of all time and it's not even close. The only thing I will say is it took me 3 times for this show to stick. Just push through the first couple episodes and you're home free and you'll be glad you stuck with it.,/review/rw2956368/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2010,inkster-9,9," A pleasant surprise....six years later.
","I am a huge fan of the British version of the Office. I remember looking forward to the American version when it first came out and being disappointed immediately to the point that I refused to watch it after the first episode. Almost 6 years later I gave it another go as people were telling me that it was actually quite good. I took the advice that I should start from season 2. This time around I enjoyed it more and gradually warmed to the characters that were basically copies of the British version. I can't believe that I would ever say this, but this show is as good as the British version. The bonus is that there is a lot more of it. It was certainly a knee-jerk reaction to give up on it so quickly, but it seems that a lot of people did. The Jim/Pam relationship is a clone of Tim and Dawn, but some of the pranks that they play on Dwight(Gareth in British version) are quite brilliant. There are certainly differences between the two versions, but generally the American version stays fairly true to the original.",/review/rw2956368/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2009,temporary_fault,10," well what can i say really!!
","This show really is outstanding, in fact its the only show i think i can rate as a 10. ",/review/rw2956368/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2016,deloudelouvain,10," Excellent! I want more, more, more please...
","I saw Ricky Gervais' British first version of The Office first and I really liked it. I was septic that there was going to be an American version and I completely zapped it because of that. So it's only in 2016 that I thought I give the American version a shot and oh am I pleased I did that. I loved it so much I watched the entire nine seasons in only a month. I was completely addicted to it, so I was actually sad that they wrote this series off because to me it could stayed on forever. It's just an excellent show. I mean, if there are people that don't think this show is funny then they just don't have the right sense of humor. Every single character brings it's own touch to the show and they are all good. The pranks between Jim Halpert and Dwight Schrute are a delight to watch. The 9 to 5 I-don't-care-about-anything office mentality from Stanley Hudson is just so recognizable. Kevin Malone and his craving for food, with his nerdy look, is just hilarious. Michael Scott, the man I would absolutely hate in real life, is so irritating in his character but yet so funny to watch. Andy Bernard, the guy that just don't get it but that desperately tries. Pam Beesly, one of the only ""normal"" people in the office, her flirting with Jim, also a delight to watch. Meredith Palmer, the slut of the office, every office has one of those, lovely to watch. The eternal love-hate relationship between Kelly Kapoor and Ryan Howard. The poor poor Toby Flenderson, hated by almost everybody in the office, even though he tries to do his best to please every-one. Angela Martin, she acts like a nun but deeply she's completely different. Oscar Martinez, the gay of the office, also one of the ""normal"" people from the office. Phyllis Vance from Vance refrigeration, a name I will always think about when I see refrigerators. Darryl Philbin, great to watch as well. I really loved every character in this series, but my favorites are Dwight, Kevin, Darryl and Michael. I love the way of filming. A bit like in Parks and Recreation, where as soon as the character says a punchline he stares at you into the camera for a couple of seconds. Just love that kind of cinema. It works really well to make it funny. Anyways, I'm so sad it's finished. If you never saw it I can only recommend it. You won't be sorry.",/review/rw2956368/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2007,Quinoa1984,10," grows on you very quickly
","The luscious saga of Michael, Dwight, Jim, Pam, Janice, the whole ball of wax, is one of the great comedy successes of the past decade. It might not quite be Seinfeld, but it's close, and in its own way this revamp of the British TV show (with Ricky Gervais here as executive producer and occasional writer) is similarly groundbreaking. Almost all of the dialog is improvised- I think Steve Carell said once that he has an earpiece to feed him lines here and there- and the writers they do have for the show are some of the finest around (some crosspolination, if that's the word, from the likes of the Daily Show like with Larry Willmore). Plot - there are a bunch, as I am beginning to learn bit by bit going through the past seasons. Unlike many a sitcom, the storyline and continuity does matter, but if you were going into a random episode in season 2 or 3 you might be able to follow along. It's all about the characters, really, and how the personalities one grows accustomed to stay true even when things shift a bit.",/review/rw2956368/?ref_=tt_urv

7 February 2014,sportscarft2,10," In the end, I'm really glad I took the time to watch the series in its entirety...
","For the past several months since I dropped my cable company and picked up Netflix I've been watching The Office. Practically everyday after work and after finishing what needed to be done I'd watch several episodes and have done so from start to finish. I have been captivated by every character and to watch their personalities develop I almost had to ask myself if this was really a TV series or a real documentary. Even though the characters were slightly dramatized, I had coworkers or friends that had similar traits to 'almost' all of them so that made it even more personal. Having just watched the last episode I was surprised on how sad I became to not be able to come home and see what new adventures the office was going to go through. The show was very captivating and really pulled you into their lives. I think the people that don't like the show probably didn't start from the beginning and only watched several episodes because, to be honest, after the first several episodes of the 1st season I was going to stop watching it but I'm glad I didn't.",/review/rw2956368/?ref_=tt_urv
