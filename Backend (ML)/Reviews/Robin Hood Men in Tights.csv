1 December 2020,Supermanfan-13,9," One of the best shows based off of true stories that I've ever seen!

It's one of the best shows based off of true stories that I've ever seen! It's an anthology series where each season tells some of the most incredible true stories that have taken place. Season 1: The People vs. O. J. Simpson, Season 2: The Assassination of Gianni Versace, Season 3: Impeachment (the Bill Clinton/Monika Lewinsky scandal) and the upcoming Season 4 which will be based off Studio 54. Obviously some seasons are better than others but they're all really good, the best seasons are pretty much in order 1, 2 and then 3.",/review/rw7285674/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2019,UniqueParticle,9," Spectacular Sarah Paulson deserved the Emmy she won!
","I barely knew about the OJ Simpson scenario so everything about that is glorious while being outrageous! I'd like to see the second season for now I am the middle of season 1, it's quite enjoyable and intriguing. Ryan Murphy the creator/writer is a mastermind for many projects, I would definitely recommend this show.",/review/rw7285674/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2016,cherold,8," Fascinating story with a serious casting mistake
","When I read the critic's reviews of this fascinating portrayal of the trial of OJ Simpson, the most common complaint was John Travolta's performance. So I was expecting to find it a bad, cheesy performance and everyone else to be great.",/review/rw7285674/?ref_=tt_urv

1 June 2022,wvfempwolford,9," Horny Hillbilly Hick
","I'm watching the series now. Clinton obviously has a sex addiction, enabled by the power of his Presidential position. Monica was basically a naive child who placed in contact with Clinton, was extremely vulnerable. Oh, and as for Hillary...she and Bill are a partnership power couple. She dismissed his many indisgressions...still does.",/review/rw7285674/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2022,Omnicient9,10," Another one out of the park for Mr. Murphy
","I hate to sound like a fanboy here, but Ryan Murphy never fails to please and has yet to disappoint...yes, Glee was a guilty pleasure for a lot of us.",/review/rw7285674/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2020,maanikroda,8," True representation of truth.
","The People vs O.J Simpson & The Assassination of Gianni Versace are both outstanding mini-series. Both, are completely two true events so it's hard to compare, if not at all.",/review/rw7285674/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2022,moniquerich,9," Season 3 is awesome
","As someone who was in DC when Clinton got himself in all kinds of trouble, I can say, they've captured just about everything that happened during his time in office. I was impressed at how they tell the story from the perspective of all the women involved.",/review/rw7285674/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2021,mls4182,10," Very pleasantly surprised by Versace episodes
","Friends kept trying to convince me to watch this. I told them I didn't want to think about Andrew Cunanan or look at a facsimile. Well, this isn't about him, it Is mostly about his victims, as it should be.",/review/rw7285674/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2016,phd_travel,10," Hooked!
","At first I thought who needs to see all this again but once I started watching it I was hooked. The pilot moves quickly from discovery of the bodies (and they are shown) to fleeing down the highway in the Bronco. There are so many details and people that come flooding back and it's interesting to see things put together in a quick moving episode. Lots of details are included that you won't have pictured in your mind at the time because they didn't come out all at the same time in sequence. With race, money, abuse, celebrity it's still the crime of the 20th century.",/review/rw7285674/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2022,katefrichardson,10," GOD BLESS RYAN MURPHY
",Ryan Murphy knows what the hell he is doing. I'm a big fan of American Horror Story - that's a given. But I absolutely LOVED Ryan Murphy's transition into the genre of true crime.,/review/rw7285674/?ref_=tt_urv

25 March 2022,wordshifter,10," Fantastic casting & acting
","One of the things I love most about this show is that they allow actors and actresses a chance to really flex their skills. Sarah Paulson is an absolute chameleon as Linda Tripp. Billy Eichner in a serious role is a thing I never knew I needed. Bravo, all.",/review/rw7285674/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2020,lee_eisenberg,9," some bad stuff has happened in our history
","During the 21st century, Ryan Murphy has been one of the people revolutionizing TV. With ""American Horror Story"", he looked at humanity's capacity for evil. Now he brings us ""American Crime Story"", about some bad things that have happened in the US during the past few decades.",/review/rw7285674/?ref_=tt_urv

8 February 2016,lch100,7," Fantastic Casting--exception: OJ!
","This series is riveting, well directed, fast-paced and informative. The casting is marvelous with one little exception: OJ Simpson!! Cuba Gooding is a fantastic actor, but he completely fails to portray OJ Simpsons incredible charm and charisma that actually enabled him to sliver through years of abusive behavior and the cold-blooded double murder. Gooding is reactive and unsophisticated, while the cocksure Simpson is just missing. This is an incredible failure of casting where the remaining characters are spot on and compelling. Why not Dwayne Johnson or someone with the physical charisma and cool? Travolta deserves great kudos for taking this on, but one has to wonder why he allowed the utter miscasting of the major role. At any rate, this is a worthwhile series to watch and it surely is award-rich.",/review/rw7285674/?ref_=tt_urv

2 March 2022,yerlo,8," Impeachment=Guilty Pleasure
","All well acted. Very entertaining. Must remember that the ""facts"" are novelized and subject to bias and invention aka literary license to communicate whatever message or slant is wanted. As expected, Tripp is pretty much blamed for orchestrating the entire series of events that led to impeachment like a Svengali. Big stretch. No blame on Clinton nor on Monica. Yet, what brought the legal system down on Clinton's head was his perjury, obstruction of justice, and failure to pay taxes. All he ever had to do was own-up and take the arrows like a man. He would have survived just fine. SCOTUS UNANIMOUSLY 9-0 stated he could be sued by Paul Jones and the ball became a speeding train. Tripp had nothing to do with the Jones case nor with the SCOTUS decision, but the story piled on Tripp. Writers made sure everyone hated her by the end.",/review/rw7285674/?ref_=tt_urv

29 August 2021,pm-98002,10," Superb season one
","The OJ season was top notch. Such an amazing production from top to bottom: excellent actors & characters, realistic dialogue and quality direction. So much attention to detail too. Felt like it was actually filmed in the mid-90s, not just that the story took place then. And it wasn't over saturated with 90s' nostalgia - just enough. Intriguing and compelling. Thumbs way up.",/review/rw7285674/?ref_=tt_urv
