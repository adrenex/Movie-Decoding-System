20 January 2021,Slarkshark,6," Takes Too Long to get Going
","As one who loves 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz' this was a bit disappointing. Pegg, Frost, and Sheen play supporting characters more or less, while the students are the main cast. They unfortunately don't bring enough comedy or drama to make you feel invested in them. And it feels as though two thirds of the movie goes by until something actually happens and it gets going.",/review/rw7676385/?ref_=tt_urv

31 October 2018,carlo_simone18,3," Unfortunately Disappointing
",This was a real mixed-bag of a film. Tries to be a horror-comedy without being particularly scary or funny and uses elements we've seen from stories set at boarding schools like this many times before.,/review/rw7676385/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2018,Padreviews,8," Homage to the cornetto trio and so much more
",Whereas this misses the vital team members of the cornetto team namely Nira Park and the combined writing efforts of Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright it still produces the goods.,/review/rw7676385/?ref_=tt_urv

1 December 2018,cinemawithcj,2," Slaughterhouse Rulez
","Slaughterhouse Rulez makes you feel so disappointed after going into a film not expecting much and hoping to be pleasantly surprised. It's a feeling you'd get from say, the St Trinian's movies. Which aren't very good, but they are watchable and fun enough to keep you away from the feeling that you've wasted your time.",/review/rw7676385/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2020,Blumanowar,7," Perfectly Funny Little movie
","Perfectly Funny Little movie
Full of laughs and chuckles. It's not meant to be an award nominee... but definitely worth a watch! Pegg is funny as always...",/review/rw7676385/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2020,claudio_carvalho,5," Disappointing Film
","""Slaughterhouse Rulez"" is a disappointing film for fans of comedy, black-humor, drama, romance and horror. The silly plot does not satisfy any of the foregoing genres. The comedy is silly and not funny; the black humor is poor; the drama and the romance are shallow, almost inexistent; and the horror is ridiculous and not scary, with terrible special effects. The great cast is wasted and cannot save the film. My vote is five.",/review/rw7676385/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2018,GoldenBlunderbuss,5," I'm sorry, but you're going to be disappointed
","Just come out of watching what was billed as a horror comedy. What I saw was so little of either that even Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Michael Sheen couldn't salvage a comprehensive description of what this film is meant to be.",/review/rw7676385/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2018,Pairic,7," Good Horror Comedy
","Slaughterhouse Rulez: This is the exclusive Public School from Hell, bullying at epic scales, mad sadistic prefects, especially Clegg (Tom Rhys-Harries), as Blake (Asa Butterfield) tells newcomer Wallace (Finn Cole): ""Clegg comes from a long line of war criminals"". Yes, Slaughterhouse provides the Nation with it's politicians, generals, captains of industry, spies and weirdos. Wallace is smitten by Clemsie (Hermione Corfield) but the gulf of noth class and school ranking separate them.",/review/rw7676385/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2018,TheLittleSongbird,4," All slaughter, no rule
","Actually really wanted to like 'Slaughterhouse Rulez'. There have been many great horror/comedy films, the cast and premise sounded promising and the advertising was attention-grabbing. Have also liked to love Simon Pegg and Nick Frost's previous collaborations, especially 'Shaun of the Dead', and think they work great together and really shine individually when the material is good.",/review/rw7676385/?ref_=tt_urv

8 November 2018,bob-the-movie-man,4," Form-Prefect of the Dead
","Meredith Houseman (Simon Pegg) is housemaster of Sparta house in Slaughterhouse school: an ancient public school establishment steering England's future greats to greatness (which probably explains a lot about the current Brexit mess!). Houseman is not in a happy place, given that his girlfriend is now in deepest darkest African doing ""good works"" with handsome French doctors, and particularly that she is played by Margot Robbie: I would be also be sad... #punching!",/review/rw7676385/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2018,mark-3417,8," Fracking good fun
","This film has been pretty comprehensively savaged - I'm in the minority who actually enjoyed it. Okay it's disjointed, but as kitsch horror nonsense - with a splendid scenery gnawing turn from Michael Sheen it worked for me. Disengage brain, enjoy a romp. May have an afterlife as camp b-movie fun when it inevitably reaches Netflix. The young cast are also good.",/review/rw7676385/?ref_=tt_urv

17 November 2019,Green-Bubble,8," Great movie!
","I had this movie in my watchlist for months, but I avoided watching it, because of all the negative reviews.
I have absolutely no idea why so many people have rated this movie so low, because it is awesome!
I am a fan of horror comedies and this was a great one. Great storyline, great cast and great direction.",/review/rw7676385/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2019,deloudelouvain,6," Good fun.
","If you expect hilarious moments or suspenseful horror scenes that will make you look away than you will be disappointed. It hasn't hilarious humor but just some lighthearted subtle comedy moments and it's not hardcore scary but just entertaining horror. Slaughterhouse Rulez is just fun to watch once, just don't expect too much out of it. The acting wasn't bad at all so that's a good point because with horror comedies most of the times the acting is quite bad. It might not be a movie for everyone but to me it worked.",/review/rw7676385/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7," It may play by the rules, but it always has fun while it does.
","Though it is always clear and forward-moving, the story is, especially in retrospection, a little messy. 'Slaughterhouse Rulez (2018)' does feature some nice, if heavy-handed, themes and messages, but they ultimately don't amount to much more than ""this is bad, isn't it?"" The film also conforms quite heavily to the confines of its genre, hitting practically every cue and clich√© it can while always seeming to be aware it is doing so, yet never going the extra step to satirise any of it. Still, the flick has a consistent style, several distinct characters and an excellent sense of tone, meaning that, even if it's never exactly funny (to the point of being 'laugh-out-loud', at least), it's always a lot of fun. It's an entertaining horror-comedy that works both before and after all hell breaks loose towards its final third, in which its horrors are all rendered with a wonderful, splattery practicality. The flick feels very much in the vein of the phenomenal 'Cornetto' trilogy, but, make no mistake, it doesn't come anywhere close to it in terms of quality. Despite this, it's still a very enjoyable, though pretty predictable, experience that remains engaging throughout. 7/10",/review/rw7676385/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2018,neil-476,7," Daft horror spoof, daft but fun
","Nouveau riche north country working class lad Don gets sent to posh private school Slaughterhouse, where he is roomed with troubled Willoughby. The school has recently become co-ed, the posh old-boy head is determinedly trendy and has allowed fracking to take place in school grounds. And the fracking is disturbing aeons-old tunnels underground... Meanwhile teacher Meredith Houseman is having trouble coping with a girlfriend who has gone off to Africa, and anti-fracking campaigners are camping in the woods.",/review/rw7676385/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2021,kosmasp,7," Goofy Blood and violence
","The title talks about a slaughterhouse, so I reckon no one should be surprised that this actually is quite violent. Even if the school that is named that way was not intending to go that way. They only wanted to establish meanness verbally and psychological ... if you know what I mean. You probably do and even if you don't you'll get into it right quickly.",/review/rw7676385/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2019,thomasjay-2201,6," Wildly underrated
","What a little surprise this was. I'd been aware of this when it was first released but missed it in cinemas when I had the chance however thanks to Sky Cinema it became quickly available to watch. This upfront is a VERY British film in itself featuring some fairly A list Brits known in our media industry and some rising stars and such has the same comedy, subtle but also quite physical and can be easily missed. Taking a stand on fracking it can be enjoyed in multiple levels and then some. Overall however it's a school based, pretty outlandish comedy splashed with elements of horror that for me did at least in some form manage to fill the gaping void of Pegg/Frost that many people share with myself, a decent little watch",/review/rw7676385/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2021,NestorTheGreat,8," A Hole In Hell!
","With the dudes from Shaun Of The Dead, the Devil from Good Omens, the Kid in the Striped Pyjamas and a couple of worthy newcomers, this comedy hits all the right notes in both gore and teen fun! Highlighting the pits of English boarding schools, the trappings of love at first sight, and the evil of fracking, this film touches all the injustices beneath their surfaces perfectly!",/review/rw7676385/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2018,noelcorless,2," Disappointed
","I only saw it through until the end, because I had nothing better to do.

1 October 2020,sha-66294,5," It does not rule, at all
","A great cast full of easily recognisable faces, a mildly interesting plot and some funny lines scattered throughout (thank goodness for British humour) but in all honesty, the only terrifying thing is the film overall. Somewhat enjoyable if you don't take ANY of it seriously.",/review/rw7676385/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2021,ernestsbakulis,8," Really nice, easy to watch, good humor
","Really nice movie. When started watching was suspicious. But it has a nice style, very good humor, jokes. And all the time something is happening and keeps the plot intriguing. Enjoyed it very much... even had few laughs, that these days happens rarely to me.",/review/rw7676385/?ref_=tt_urv
