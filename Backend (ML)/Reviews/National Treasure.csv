","This really is one of the best superhero movies of all time. And best of all, it doesn't even feel like a superhero movie. Fantastic story and great acting all around.",/review/rw3723404/?ref_=tt_urv

7 May 2018,Tweekums,9," A gritty, more adult Wolverine film
","It is 2029 and Logan is getting old and tired. Most of the mutants are long gone although Professor Charles Xavier is still alive; he too is old though and as his mind goes so does the control of his powers. Logan is working as a limo drive in the area near the Mexican border and is approached by a woman asking him to drive her and a young girl, Laura, to North Dakota. It turns out Laura is a mutant with similar powers to Logan; unlike him though she isn't a natural mutation but one of a group of new mutants created in a lab in Mexico City as part of an experiment to create super-soldiers. When the experiment was judged to have failed the children were due to be killed so their carers are trying to get them to safety. Logan is initially unwilling to get involved but eventually ends up heading north with Laura and Xavier. They are pursued by those determined to retrieve Laura; everybody who gets in their way is expendable.",/review/rw3723404/?ref_=tt_urv

2 March 2017,TheJediWay9,10," Brutally violent, emotional, and character-driven, ""Logan"" is the Wolverine film fans have been waiting for
","""Logan"" is directed by James Mangold and stars Hugh Jackman for one final go around as Wolverine. With an R Rating secured, something the previous two Wolverine films should have had, ""Logan"" was bound to be fantastic. It wasn't fantastic. It was phenomenal.",/review/rw3723404/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2017,trublu215,10," If there was ever a comic book movie deemed worthy of perfect, Logan is it.
","The word 'perfect' is very objective especially when it comes to film. While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.",/review/rw3723404/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2020,mbhgkmsgg,9," A comic book film done right
","Gritty, honest and brutal. Just like a movie about Logan should be. This is by far the best X-Men film as far as I'm concerned. Logan doesn't hold back at all which I absolutely loved. For the most part, there is just an onslaught of awful things happening. And apart from the relationship between Laura and Logan, nothing makes you go 'oh, that was nice'.",/review/rw3723404/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2017,shawneofthedead,9," A fine, fitting farewell to an iconic character, LOGAN is one of the best superhero movies ever made.
","Let's cut to the chase, shall we? In every beat, every frame, every moment, LOGAN feels like the Wolverine movie Hugh Jackman has been waiting (and training) for 17 years to make. Set free of a PG rating, this wildly kinetic film has plenty of gore, action and violence pumping through its veins. But what makes this one of the finest superhero movies ever produced is the big, messy, somewhat broken heart beating at its core. ",/review/rw3723404/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2017,hitchcockthelegend,10," The Last Cut Is The Deepest!
","SPOILER: Did we need another X-Men movie? In fact did we need another Wolverine movie? Well the result is there for all to see, with Logan not only showing itself to be undoubtedly the best Wolverine venture by far, but arguably the best X-Men picture as well. If, as expected (and surely to god it's hoped so), this is the last we see of the grumpy metal clawed superhero, then what a fitting and triumphant bow out it is.",/review/rw3723404/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2017,ahmetkozan,9," Say goodbye to Hugh Jackman...
","When Logan heard that his comic book would work in a similar way, my expectation was a little more. Later Logan's first trailer ended me. The tone of the trailers, the selected music, the intensity of the emotion was superb. I did not get my eye from X-23 in action scenes. Very good performance. ",/review/rw3723404/?ref_=tt_urv

","The best X-men movies and the little girl character were excellent, Hugh Jackman was the best in the movie, I saw Logan bury Charles and it was so sad that Logan's death made me cry. The action scenes in the movie were excellent",/review/rw3723404/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2019,NpMoviez,8," A nice revisionist western ending to Wolverine saga
","Wolverine is perhaps the most beloved character from X-Men film series, but his solo outings have been the most forgettable and/or totally stupid. Thankfully, we have Logan to break that trend. Still have issues with it, but I would acknowledge that it was one of the best films in X-Men series.",/review/rw3723404/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2017,badmanlykme,10," Logan is everything you wanted it to be and more
","Logan is the 2017 movie everyone has been anticipating after two great trailers and a R rating it delivers a surprising amount of heart to characters we have grown to love and know and also balancing a surprising amount of action within the first and third act climax, its violent but not blood for blood sake every cut is with reason.",/review/rw3723404/?ref_=tt_urv

17 February 2017,Ramascreen,10," A character-driven superhero film done right!
","LOGAN is brutal, merciless and powerful. This is a character-driven superhero movie done right. I would even dare to say it's better than many of the previous X-Men installments and spinoffs. And if this is indeed Hugh Jackman's final Wolverine movie, then my goodness, what a helluva way to go out in a blaze of glory.",/review/rw3723404/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2017,tavm,10," Logan is a more than excellent final chapter of the Wolverine saga!
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend who had previously seen this several times before. He must have liked this a lot if he agreed to watch it again with me as a first-time viewer. Indeed, this was quite different from many previous Hugh Jackman/Wolverine movies as it's a bit more intense and a little more explicit in language as well. This time, it's a future timeline in which he has to take care of a somewhat sick Charles Xavier (once again, Patrick Stewart) in some desert town while he works as a limo driver. Then a woman asks for his help which he at first refuses before a mysterious little girl appears. I'll stop there and just say this was quite a dramatically compelling narrative with plenty of exciting fight scenes along the way. So on that note, me and my friend highly recommend Logan.",/review/rw3723404/?ref_=tt_urv

",It's 2029. Mutants in America have been hunted to almost extinction. Logan (Hugh Jackman) is a dying drunk and driving a limo. He is caring for Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) who is losing control of his powers and his sanity. Logan is approached by Gabriela for help to care for a little girl named Laura.

","The Wolverine movies did not have much luck. While we got used to Hugh Jackman and his performance will be burned in our heads, the stand-alone movies never really stood out that much. Well that is until Logan came along. And Logan has another member of the X-Men family in it, portrayed by Patrick Stewart in this case. And while Logan/Wolverine does not age, both are retired.",/review/rw3723404/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2017,bryank-04844,9," 'Logan' is the 'Wolverine' film we've always wanted!
","For decades now, we have been clamoring for a 'Wolverine' film done right. From his first incarnation in Hulk #181 to his own miniseries in comic book form in the 1980's by Frank Miller, to the amazing Saturday Morning Cartoon, and his first appearance in a feature film in 2000 with 'X-Men', which had the song and dance man Hugh Jackman play the iconic character. He was so good at playing Logan/Wolverine, that fans immediately took a liking to him as that character and he went on to play the 'Snikt-y Snikt' character in almost a dozen more films. Besides the 'X-Men' films, Wolverine got his own set of standalone films, which may or may not have been liked by a lot of people for various reasons. Either the story was too silly or the character Wolverine was to PG for fans.",/review/rw3723404/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2017,Horst_In_Translation,8," Logan the Personal
","Let me start by saying that ""Logan"" is my first favorite movie from 2017. And let me continue by saying that you should not read this review if you have not seen the film yet as it will be full of spoilers to an extent where the normal message up there is not enough and I would like to put special emphasis on this. Now lets go: James Mangold returns from the 2013 film ""Wolverine"" here and I think he did a really good job as this film never drags despite a runtime of over 2 hours and 15 minutes. It's probably still not my favorite from him (""Walk the Line""), but this should not take away anything from his effort. You will not really see too many familiar faces in this one except Jackman and Stewart. As for Stewart, there is one quote from him about mortality and this is a theme that fits the entire movie. Everybody keeps dying here, the good guys, the bad guys and the longer it goes the more you wonder if Logan will get out of it alive. The wolf has gone gray and he only has two friends left with whom he is arguing all the time. For example what I just said also applies to an innocent family of Black people and the dad is a perfect example of how hate towards the mutants is fueled, even if you cannot blame Jackman's character really for anything that happened to this family. It's all humans causing it with their decisions.",/review/rw3723404/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2017,UMWolvie2442,," Just A Flat Out MASTERPIECE!
","Holy Cow! We've finally got the Wolverine movie we've all been waiting for and then some! Mr. Mangold has nailed the character and the action, and Hugh Jackman is truly a part of a Wolverine movie that has showcased the true character that the fans had hoped to see full on. Yes, we've seen superb runs and flashes but nothing this deep or this epic.",/review/rw3723404/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2020,Xstal,7," Short Changed...
","Riven by some cavernous plot shortcomings you feel the characters, having provided such robust, beguiling and generous entertainment in the past perhaps deserved a little bit more circumstantial authenticity as they spiral their way to the final curtain call. The Cornish Caliban was a big ask to accept and take seriously, and I only see the camp and drunk Withnail whenever Richard E. Grant pops up, which makes playing the bad guy a bit more of a challenge in my eyes. Plenty of violence and dismemberment if that floats your boat and a finale that might leave more questions than answers.",/review/rw3723404/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2017,templar77099,8," Logan is another level
","The best X-Men film alongside First Class. It felt gritty, it felt real with a sense of dread and hopelessness you don't often see in this comic-book blockbuster adaptations. It should be praised for doing things differently and really pushing the edge with what can or can't be done in the genre. The triangle between Logan, Charles and Laura works as the driving force of the plot, and is very well developed. Logan's character arch is quite pleasant to watch, though obviously predictable. With that said, the acting is clearly masterclass. You can feel the dilemmas, the emotions and feelings that the characters are put through, specially those three. And another thing it does really well is alluding to a previous event - the Charles incident - but never fully explaining it to the audience, leaving you wondering. The action is nothing like you'd expect from a tenthpole - the R rating really makes up for wonders - being quite visceral and impactful. ""Logan"" probably deserved a better villain, although one could argue that the real villain here is not the typical multinational corporation, but the inner demons of the characters. Demons that prevent them from living albeit normal and somewhat stable life.",/review/rw3723404/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2017,slicedbread117,10," Here's to 17 Years
","Without question, this was Hugh Jackman's movie, from start to finish. No matter how you view it, or who the mantle is passed onto next, Jackman will forever be Wolverine, and this film proves it once and for all. Logan dives deep into the hearts of its viewers, twisting and turning until every emotional string is pulled, and in the end, delivers a superhero film like no other before it; a perfect swan song.",/review/rw3723404/?ref_=tt_urv
