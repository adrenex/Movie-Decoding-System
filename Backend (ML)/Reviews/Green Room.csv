23 April 2021,Movi3DO,9," Turn off the light. Lie down. Close your eyes. And listen to the calls.
","A TV series on Apple TV+. It's 9 episodes with conversations between multiple people on the phones, and we had the chance to figure out the stories, just by listening.",/review/rw6735053/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2021,shaunmcevoy-98833,9," Fantastic first season
","Watched Calls in it's entirety in just one day. I must say it was really enjoyable I had an absolute blast watching this show. So many creepy episodes, it's so amazing how every episode is connected and its all linked. I really hope this gets renewed for a 2nd season genuinely excellent show with such a unique concept.",/review/rw6735053/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2021,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,7," Scary Screensavers
","I like the stories and how you have to use your imagination to visualize what is happening. It's certainly is different and I would recommend LISTENING to these stories from a cell phone using headphones instead. I felt silly watching the first episode in the dark on the big living screen. Kind of reminded me of the intro of the old ""The Outer Limits"" tv episodes from the early 60s",/review/rw6735053/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2021,akshunhiro,9," Wow!
","I'm not entirely sure if this series was borne of COVID or not, but what a great format and concept! It was bone chilling!",/review/rw6735053/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2021,xxmisssvxx,8," Follow the voices...
","For those curious about this should know this series plays out over various voice calls of strange occurrences paired with sound waves. You are immersed into the stories simply by listening (and reading) the voice communications taking place between past and present. And unexplained phenomena, if you will.",/review/rw6735053/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2021,andrewchristianjr,9," WORTH A WATCH.
","Calls delivers a scary, sinister yet empathic and human story. Through the use of immersive, hypnotic and beautifully sound designed filmmaking. If you like science fiction and immersive storytelling, this is definitely worth a watch, or should I say listen? Anyway, some have said this is just a podcast with fancy background, but I don't think so. This series differs from other podcast-like series by having extraordinary talented actors and actresses.",/review/rw6735053/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2021,henrycoles9,10," Now we're talking!
","I can't believe this is the first good thing to come out of Apple TV+ this year. The thrill, the suspense, the emotion, the menace, the quick turns, the graphics. It was absolutely amazing!",/review/rw6735053/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2021,Just-A-Girl-14,9," Give it a chance! It's great!
","When I heard about the show I was excited. I liked the concept a lot. Unfortunately I did not like the first episode but I'm really happy I kept on watching. I was skeptical and worried I won't get the closure and answers by the end of the season. Luckily I was wrong and I did. I don't want to spoil it for anyone so I'm just going to say it's definitely worth watching and if you're like me and you don't like it at first or you are skeptical, all I can say is give it a chance! There are 9 episodes and each episode is between 12 to 20 minutes so you can really binge watch it in one sitting.",/review/rw6735053/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2021,GabrielGray,8," Acting without actors/actresses
","Never thought I'd enjoy a mini series starring Windows Media Player visualizations (LOL) so much. You can even call it an audio book if you like. The diversity in story settings, step by step unraveling of a main storyline is so irresistible that you just can't stop watching the whole season all at once.",/review/rw6735053/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2021,Arcadia1701,10," Like an immersive art experience!
",Giving this a 10 for the sheer originality and execution of it. Realise this is a remake but the concept is so unique and very rarely (nowadays) is there an end to end story told in a new way that is engaging and artistic.,/review/rw6735053/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2021,Hawkins88,," Captivating & Impressive
","I can't get over how good this is! On one side it's so simple because it is just dialogue but the excellent writing and outstanding voice talent elevate it to something else entirely. Each conversation takes hold and pulls you in with impressive mastery. The wavelength and frequency graphics are a nice touch too and add to the whole captivating experience. Please give this a shot for yourself (Especially if you're into the sci-fi/horror genre) and ignore the negative reviews. Yes, it is just audio but it's more than that too.",/review/rw6735053/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2021,steve-case,8," Pretty decent SciFi presented an interesting way
","Knowing nothing about this show, I decided to check out IMDb. I was confused as to why the rating was relatively high when the show was apparently just about a bunch of phone calls. I'm glad I decided to give it a try. Being a sci-fi fan, I binged watched every episode on my iPad.",/review/rw6735053/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2021,shaunmcevoy-98833,9," Great so far
","What a unique concept for a show, really good opening episode too. I'm onboard with this.",/review/rw6735053/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2021,ruipericles-56921,10," This was insanely good
","You need to watch this in order, it's not an anthology. Episode after episode, it will make more and more sense until it comes full circle in the end. Everything is so coherent and well thought out, the writing is marvellous. They put an amazing cast together in this weird premise - and it turned out amazing. It's disturbing, intense, suspenseful and addictive - a real gem born of this pandemic.",/review/rw6735053/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2021,Conkieh,9," Very good
",This was much better than I thought it would be. I get it's not for everyone but some of the reviews are just childish. Maybe stick to Marvel or Anime next time.,/review/rw6735053/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2021,bogdan-64813,8," Some good chills
","Really enjoying this star studded offer from Apple TV that merges soundwaves with audio to show a series of phone calls that happen over the course of the epidode. P{robably not going to be ""down enough"" with the kids of today, but if ytour old enough to have listened to ghost stories on the radio this is pretty amazing stuff. Episofde lengths vary between 10 and 20 minutes and if you watch/listen in the dark with the volume up it could get you right on the edge.",/review/rw6735053/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2021,maria-maria-328-520664,10," This Is Mind Blowing!!!
","Wow just wow! Such fresh breeze of air, so unique and so captivating! If you're a fan of Stephen King, good sifi and some chilling horror then you must watch it! Yes there are no pictures, but that just sparks your imagination even more to paint all the colors and to focus on the actual story. I sat down and didn't get up till I finished entire series. Do the same and you'll have goosebumps the entire time, I promise.",/review/rw6735053/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2021,hoboss2806,7," It's different...
",And it's nice. It's a whole new category and it's like watching a podcast/audioplay. The trippy visuals (like those from windows media player) match the conversations.,/review/rw6735053/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2021,danalaura-cazacu,10," Brilliant at setting a mood! Embrace it and it will be a great experience!
","Don't listen to the bad reviews! This was absolutely brilliant!
Every piece: story, voice, graphics fall into place just right. Have a little faith!",/review/rw6735053/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2021,niseynisey,9," Unique and insane!
","Wow. Talk about using your imagination. This ""show"" is like a radio show had a baby with a horror podcast. What a cool concept! I really enjoyed these. My stomach still hurts with fear since I binged all the episodes in one sitting. Great to ""watch"" while working from home since I don't have to really ""watch"" anything. This is a podcast on steroids. Was vey unique way to produce new content during a pandemic & lockdown.",/review/rw6735053/?ref_=tt_urv

",Really enjoyed this original series,/review/rw6735053/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2021,azarrayyan-29799,10," A Masterpiece.
",I made an account just to write down this review and I've never done that with any show or any movie. Now I agree with some reviews that this show would've been better off as a podcast but it's still really really good. You definitely should check it out. And also how is the rating so low??????? It deadass deserves like an 8.,/review/rw6735053/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2021,ncatapano,10," Yes!!
",Something new. Loved it. Watched three episodes back to back. So cool.,/review/rw6735053/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2021,chaotic_observer,10," A unique and powerful experience
","I don't enjoy audio plays or podcast dramas, so this was a completely uncharacteristic choice for me.... But WOW, I'm glad that I gave it a chance and I'll never forget it! A sci-fi drama mystery about the end of the world, told through a series of phone calls with seemingly ""random"" background graphics to watch... but the images in the background add so much to the story, it's incredible. Because the viewer is completely focused on the emotion of the characters, it's so easy to put yourself in their shoes and you'll spend the entire time wondering whether you would have made the same choices. The visuals in the background are actually an important piece of the series (which I may not have realized if I hadn't seen the trailer), using colors, shapes, and the flow of energy to really tell the story. There are so many times the characters don't understand what's happening around them, but the background gives clues to their story! The low or negative reviews are only from people who did not realize that this was an alternative viewing experience and were disappointed when they couldn't see the celebrities faces, or who did not understand the format and couldn't realize that this was a new, unique form of storytelling and that the ""random"" images were important to the experience.",/review/rw6735053/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2021,fvrehbinder,10," First Review ever and probably my last
",This show is pure art. Or call it magical or whatever you want. Its wellness for our lazy brain cells and honey for our eyes. I loved it! Well done!!!!!,/review/rw6735053/?ref_=tt_urv
