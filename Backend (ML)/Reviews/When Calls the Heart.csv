12 April 2021,Tweekums,8," Groundhog Wedding
","Nyles is attending a wedding in Palm Springs with his girlfriend; his behaviour seems somewhat unusual, he turns up dressed for the beach rather than in formal wear, but later on, he rescues the bride's sister, Sarah, as her toast is a bit of a disaster. Through the evening they get closer and head into the desert together. Just as they are about to get intimate a strange man attacks Nyles with a bow and arrow. Injured, he heads into a mysterious cave, warning Sarah not to follow. She does and they both wake up and it is once again the morning of the wedding. For Nyles this day has been repeating for almost as long as he can remember but for Sarah it is the first time of many. As the wedding day repeats Sarah tries to make sense of it, figure out how to get out and gradually grows closer to Nyles. Of course there will be problems for them both.",/review/rw5900246/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2021,cricketbat,8," Keeping things fresh in a time loop
","Due to the repetitive nature of time loop movies, they have to be done right in order to keep the audience engaged the whole time. Palm Springs does it right. This film does a great job of keeping things fresh. Andy Samberg shows that he's more than just a goofball, and Cristin Milioti proves, once again, why she should have had a more prominent role on How I Met Your Mother. I wish this film were a little less vulgar, so it would be accessible to a broader audience, because I think more people should take a trip with Palm Springs.",/review/rw5900246/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2020,kjproulx,9," It's Very Hard to Dislike a Movie like Palm Springs
","Films that revolve around characters repeating the same day over and over again has grown very tired in my mind. Groundhog Day perfected it and it really wasn't until more recently with Edge of Tomorrow that I really found a film that seemed to stand out among the rest. Well, I'm glad that I can now add Palm Springs to the list of films to put a clever spin on this concept. This film was originally supposed to play at more film festivals around the world and eventually receive a theatrical release, but things being the way they are, Hulu has now released it. Although this may be a film that's hard to find for some right now, here's why Palm Springs is one of the very best movies to come out of this bare year of 2020 so far.",/review/rw5900246/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2020,The-Sarkologist,8," Another Pretty Cool Timeloop Movie
","There's something about time loop movies that are pretty cool, though I guess it probably has to do with Groundhog Day simply being one of those classic films that spur people on to adapt it to different situations. This one is certainly no different, and it does have some uniqueness about it that I particularly enjoyed. The difference with this one is that multiple people are actually trapped in the time loop, and they are able to interact with each other, which I thought was quite cool. The other thing is that while we know who is trapped in the loop, we don't know how long they have been in the loop, namely because they have been caught in it for so long.",/review/rw5900246/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2020,kosmasp,9," Paradise for a day
","Or is it? Sometimes you can't tell. Also while this is reminiscent of a Bill Murray classic, it does not contain the moral lesson. At least it is not meant to be taken that way. Doesn't mean there is not good things happening and characters developing. It just not as attached to the story or rather resolution as the Murray movie was.",/review/rw5900246/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2021,BandSAboutMovies,8," Shockingly enjoyable
","All of the time loop films of the last year or two - Happy Death Day 2U, Boss Level, The Map of Tiny Perfect Things, Koko-di Koko-da, Game Over, The Obituary of Tunde Johnson, Russian Doll, See You Yesterday - all follow that Groundhog Day-style approach of the same day happening over and over again. Of course, we can also point to 1990s 12:01 PM, which part of the Showtime 30-Minute Movie entries.",/review/rw5900246/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2020,evanston_dad,8," Quirky and Charming
","For a film that rips its premise off the ultimate time loop movie, ""Groundhog Day,"" ""Palm Springs"" is surprisingly unpredictable and exceedingly charming. It's got an anarchic anything goes vibe and a pair of vibrant actors, Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti, who also happen to have a ton of chemistry together. It's a movie for our very troubled times and seems tailor made for a quarantined audience, where day bleeds into day and the repetition of the weekly grind is sending many of us to the loony bin. The sweet message at the center of this otherwise naughty film is that it's not the what we do that keeps us happy but rather the who we do it with. It's all about appreciating the little things that make life worth living moment to moment rather than focusing all of our energies on the big things that we chase at the risk of letting peace and contentment pass us right on by.",/review/rw5900246/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2020,exlana,8," Weird but Good Weird
","I was expecting a conventional rom-com where the guy meets the girl, but this one has a little twist. It's smart-funny, well written some of the shots are gorgeous and very wholesome. It's a fresh take for this type of ""genre"".",/review/rw5900246/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2020,ansharora-12638,9," They removed the Grumpy old man character of Groundhog Day and added a romantic comedy angle and added some science and there you go.
","Groundhog Day gave us some pretty realistic scenarios about life but still Bill Murray was grumpy as we saw the beginning of his character's curse. Here we don't. We meet Andy aka Nyles when he has already lived the same day for years and have had made peace with it. Cristin aka Sarah, on the other hand is new and starts out grumpy but becomes the adventurous one.",/review/rw5900246/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2020,Xstal,8," Very Funny & Amusing, Nothing You Haven't Seen Before...

18 July 2020,ThomDerd,6," 2/3rds of the film are great.
","This is a six (point...twenty-five...). The start of the film is actually pretty good and you 'd think that this will get funnier and funnier but halfway through it gets closer to romance than comedy and loses it's pace. Acting is ok, storyline is cool...but for about 45 minutes. Then the script changes tone and becomes a neo-melo-dramatic hipster-esque conversational piece.",/review/rw5900246/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2021,Prismark10,7," Palm Springs
",Palm Springs is a fun time loop comedy. Mainly because it assumes that the audience is familiar with the Groundhog Day concept so it hits the ground running.,/review/rw5900246/?ref_=tt_urv

13 April 2021,ethanjjacobs,8," Great and Crazy movie
","I've seen lots of movies try to do what Groundhog Day did and completely fail, but this is just as good, it's really weird and really funny and it's not to romantic that it ruins the film. Andy Samberg and Cristin milioti were perfect for this, definitely a movie worth watching.",/review/rw5900246/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2021,siderite,8," Infinite time loop romance
","This is Groundhog Day ver 2.0, with updated references, upgraded sexy actors and kind of the same plot. To me this kind of story always makes me insanely angry: how dare they underuse an infinite time loop? Do they realize they could learn everything there is on the Internet?! But enough about me.",/review/rw5900246/?ref_=tt_urv

12 May 2021,youngcollind,8," Good times in the loop
","Taking a premise that admittedly isn't breaking new ground and having a fun time finding ways to put a new spin on the charted territory. Everyone just seems to be having a party playing around with the many possibilities of this impossible scenario, while somehow making a rom com that isn't nauseating.",/review/rw5900246/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2020,mycannonball,9," Fresh, funny take on an old theme
","I've never been a huge fan of movies like Groundhog Day or Happy Death Day where the characters are caught in a time loop of the same day. I like both of those movies just fine, but I do find the repetition a bit tedious. This movie has that same theme of characters stuck in the same day, except it never felt overly repetitious. It's very funny, and it's actually a pretty sweet romance. Highly recommend.",/review/rw5900246/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2020,PennyReviews,4," Not Good Enough
","Palm Springs was an okay movie. Script vice, the movie doesn't really offer anything new. The characters find themselves into a time loop and they just follow every classic rom com trop until the final ending. We don't get to know them, we don't get to understand them, or to understand the whole time loop concept really. The whole thing can be described as generic at best, with some odd touches here and there. The performances, in addition, were okay but nothing special. For all it's worth, it is not a waste of time, but nothing special either.",/review/rw5900246/?ref_=tt_urv

15 December 2020,dromasca,8," smart entertainment
","'Palm Springs' directed by Max Barbakow (incredibly at his first feature film) is for me the good surprise of the end of this strange cinematic year 2020. It is also a film that proves once again, if necessary, to skeptics and cynics that there are entertainment films and romantic comedies that do not insult the intelligence of viewers, and that 'feel good' movies can contain a dose of fantastic (and even references to quantum mechanics). The premiere of 'Palm Springs' took place at the Sundance Film Festival, after which the movie was supposed to be screened in theaters, but then the world froze and same as many other productions Barbakow's film had to find a streaming platform as its main broadcast channel. I'm so sorry for their missed opportunity, because this funny movie would have had good chances to be the big surprise and maybe even one of the blockbusters of the summer of 2020. Unfortunately, COVID-19 had other plans.",/review/rw5900246/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2020,jenellewalker24,9," Hidden Gem!!
","I really wasn't expecting a ton from this movie, I expected a pretty decent romantic comedy and I also love Andy so I was excited to give it a shot. But WOW was I very very pleasantly surprised!! I literally started it over immediately after finishing it cause I liked it so much. Completely not what I was expecting but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I laughed out loud multiple times, and the story is completely amazing in my opinion. Highly recommend if you're wanting a quirky comedy, but it also has very cute moments. LOVED it. I hope it gets the recognition it deserves.",/review/rw5900246/?ref_=tt_urv
