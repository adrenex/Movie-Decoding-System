19 December 2006,kovalchukyou,5," What I learned from watching this movie
",1. Sorority girls like high school guys 2. Girls are willing to show their tits on command 3. Eugene Levy has a lot of depth as an actor 4. Lingerie/underwear parties are very common 5. You can drink where ever you want on a college campus 6. People find it hilarious when you walk around a party erect and even drinking games take place because of itÂ—you become the life of the party 7. The continuing development of the pool table to lose your virginity shows the lack of talent by the writers 8. Girls love virgins and inexperienced guys 9. When guys climax they kill grandparents,/review/rw2333125/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2009,Floated2,5," not that good
",Before I saw this movie I expected to see the story about another popular adolescent who is the leader of the group and is admired by everyone... but it was more than what I thought. It's about a boy like you or your best friend or neighbor: Erik Stifler.,/review/rw2333125/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2008,siderite,6," Boring, predictable, lots of breasts
","The title says it all. I need to really screw my brain to fill the required 10 lines. The actors are completely unknown, the script is not that complex and it's rather bad. The mandatory opposition to the ""team cool"" is a bunch of evil midgets that somehow are better at American football and getting girls.",/review/rw2333125/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2009,Sandcooler,4," Pretty bad, even for what it is
","Perhaps I just don't get the movie business, but I never thought they could squeeze three more sequels out of this franchise just by naming random characters Stifler. So this time around it's some guy named Erik Stifler's turn to lose his virginity and get into misadventures, while in the meantime his interchangeable friends just kinda stand around and remind everyone his name is Stifler. They do that like, a lot. I think the name Stifler is said about every six seconds or so, and all these references do is make you wonder why you're not watching the real thing. Occasionally there's some vaguely funny stuff going on, like in the scene where the gang plays football against midgets, but whatever potential this movie had is ruined by the ridiculously awful dialogues. Even The Sherminator had cooler lines than the cool guys in this movie. The trash talk scenes have to be seen to be believed, and even then. And I can laugh at the dumbest, lowest, raunchiest things, but guys using their boners as baseball bats is just really unfunny. And also, why the hell is Jim's Dad still around? Anyway, this movie has a good moment here and there, but for the most part it's dull and very uninspired.",/review/rw2333125/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2014,SnoopyStyle,4," Boring actors as charmless characters
","Erik Stifler (John White) is still a virgin since his girlfriend Tracy (Jessy Schram) wants to wait. He can't live up to the legacy of cousins. After a night of misadventure, Tracy gives him a guilt-free pass for the weekend. He and his friends go to party with cousin Dwight Stifler (Steve Talley) at college where he tries the local tradition of the Naked Mile, a naked run across the campus. Tracy gets scared and has second thoughts. And there's the sexy college girl Brandy (Candace Kroslak). ",/review/rw2333125/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2007,Kashmirgrey,6," Nasty and Morally Decrepit ! But Fun
","I am ashamed to admit it, but I enjoyed this movie. It was one of those guilty pleasures that you keep out of sight of your kids, folks, and the respectable social ilk, to be sure, but I found this film to hysterical and enjoyable to watch.",/review/rw2333125/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2007,Matt_Layden,4," ""A Big Step Up From Band Camp""
","Eric is a Stifler, but there is one problem, he's also a virgin. Being a virgin and with the Stifler name is not easy for Eric, especially when his girlfriend is the one who isn't ready for sex. Wanting her boyfriend to be ""sexually pleased"" Eric's girlfriend gives him a guilt free pass for the weekend. Eric and his two buddies go the The Naked Mile, a naked run across a college campus. Eric's girlfriend then has second thoughts, fearing that this guilt free trip will eventually lead up to their break-up.",/review/rw2333125/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2007,barrys82,3," American deception
","five movies are enough, there's no way people can support another American Pie movie. I Thought that the American Pie franchise was over with the fourth movie American Pie: Band camp, that already was a little lame.It has some funny moments, but most of it its just a movie about sex, nudity and bad words. There's no story at all and the plot seems weak and very plain. Awful acting from everyone. Please the American Pie movies were over with American Wedding, stop using its name to produce bad quality movies. They were the worst two hours in my life. The story was so repetitive, it was like watching the first American Pie but without the funny parts. Even the the brief performance from Eugene Levy wasn't enough to make it a decent film.",/review/rw2333125/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2007,Clay-Pigeon,4," The Boring Mile
","Very poor entry in the Pie series. ""Band Camp"" didn't compare to the original trilogy but it still had some of that American Pie charm plus a semi-interesting story. It also had some funny gags and some funny lines. All that is missing from this fifth entry. ""Naked Mile"" had no really funny or memorable moments. No story. And a terribly bland, forgettable cast. While the original Pie films felt like a smart homage to the sex romps of the 80s (Porky's, Revenge of the Nerds, etc), this one just felt like a retread of the lame straight-to-video sex comedies of the early 90s (Ski School 2, Meatballs 4, etc). No real imagination went into making this movie. It was purely made to quickly cash in on the DVD success of ""Band Camp"". Of course many people will watch this just for the naked mile scene in which several naked female breasts are shown bouncing around. That's about the only watchable scene in this whole film. Sadly, by that merit alone most people will see this film as fitting for a recommendation. Trust me, it's not worth it.",/review/rw2333125/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2006,causeiwantto2001,8," It's surprisingly a funny movie!!!
","As it goes with most spin offs, I expected this to be a $4 budget poorly written train wreck, but the mix of a Stiffler with moral values,and the classic jerk Stiffler, work well. Stiffler getting the beat down from midgets ( little people) was great. Eugene Levy is all thats left from the original cast but he does a good job, in an Axl Rose minus Slash,Duff, Matt, and Izzy kinda way. He lends credit to the continuing American Pie theme. Although he really had to be placed at weird points, in the movie. It was great listening to him tell cousin Stiffler that he was at the school hanging out, because he's an alumni. Which is actually true, I think? Theschool used was the McMaster University Campus, in Hamilton. Eugenes from Hamilton, and as far as I know went to school at Mac. with Dave Thomas, and other Second City alumni. I would watch this movie a second time, and I think it could have been a strong enough premise, to have been a first run theater movie. It's really funny, and most will enjoy it. It deserves a shot.",/review/rw2333125/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2007,tripod_x,," Stay far away from this!
","If you like the AP movies (yeah, I mean the real trilogy. The fourth wasn't really a part of the series) chances are you won't like this. The plot(?), centers around Erik Stifler (a virgin) and two buddies, Cooze and Ryan, going to the 'Naked Mile'. This is a crazy festivity were a lot of students run naked around campus (or something like that). When they go there, Erik's girlfriend Thracie gives him a free weekend pass, so he can do whatever he wants, which he of course finds intriguing. But of course everything is not going as planned...Although this differs from person to person, I didn't found this movie the slightest funny at all (apart from the opening), and completely devoid of memorable dquotes like most of what came out of Stifler's mouth. The acting is not extremely bad, but not a single actor is doing a really good job, and I only found the Dwight Stifler character a little interesting (a different kind of Stifler, which is actually liked by the populace). When it comes to nudity, this film delivers. Well, with the title 'Naked Mile', you know what to expect. A lot of the ''humour'' is centered around this too, and it all came off as too much in the end. With a plot only there for an excuse for the naked women to be there, you see it comes off as very shallow in the end. If you want to see tits in a movie, come see this. If not, stay far away from this.",/review/rw2333125/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2010,StevePulaski,3," Run A ""Naked"" Mile Away
","I don't get it. The American Pie spinoffs are made for next to nothing, they get abysmal reception from fans of the original trilogy, but the legacy continues with more helpings of spoiled, unwanted pie. The sad thing is that actor Eugene Levy returns to these messes, when all he is doing is locking himself out of more respected work. It's a lose-lose for fans and Levy himself.",/review/rw2333125/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2007,ptb-8,1," Teen porn terrorism
","We just had Foxtel connected and this used condom of a movie spurted out of my big new 106cm telly last Saturday at 5pm. Programmed for that time by some corporate adult pervert who (gleefully) knew lots of unsuspecting underage teens could be morally loosened up by the cheerful naked sexual party imagery and it's relentlessly degrading depiction of healthy looking 20 something Americans, this 5th element of phallus/orifice adoration is exactly the sort of movie that proves to the rest of the planet that the polluting degraded immorally sexually cretinous USA must be annihilated. As I spilled my cock-porn er I mean popcorn over myself I wondered at these lovely looking 20 year olds, getting a gig in a 'new movie' and enthusiastically telling their families, Mum Dad Aunties and Gran and the littlies, about their fantastic new acting opportunity. And then they all go the to premiere, or worse still, the new DVD is brought home, mum throws a party for the street and then they all sit down together and .... this pus ejaculation (with sprinkles) manifests before them. There is their new family film star reduced to be some frat-boy jerk, near nude with duck-lipped tit-faced chicks each yahoo-ing and whooping at each other while every character behaves like a 'f*ckwit'. Tedious immature embarrassment piled upon scene after scene... with the apparently hilarious 'climax' being where two guys stand naked and erect in front of the whole party and conduct some sort of erection carnival (toss a hoop, etc) .. and one 'hilariously' ejaculates over his pals and their girlfriends in some sort of screenplay teen porn orgy fantasy. The production team of adults far older than the actors who are responsible for this jaw dropping inane pathetic attempt at inferring that this is ""university USA fun"" should be in Guantanano Bay.",/review/rw2333125/?ref_=tt_urv

13 February 2009,jerekra,3," Good Looking Women, But Not Much Else.
",THe Naked mile is not a very good film. I really do not like the American Pie series and tend to think that they are over rated as a whole. However this film makes the other American Pie Films look good. The Jokes are old and predictable and the cast really was not spectacular. In particular the football scene against the midgets I thought was just lame and did not get it at all. Also they try to recreate past scenes from other American Pie films to get some laughs but it did not work for me. THe only really memorable part for me was seeing all of the hot girls run around naked during the climatic naked mile run. But that alone is not enough for me to recommend this film so I will have to not recommend this film.,/review/rw2333125/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2007,kooleshwar,6," As good/ordinary as expected.....
","OK so I thought the fourth one was probably going to be last one, personally I felt they had milked the franchise for all its worth and the previous one only rose above the ordinary on the basis of some great DVD extras.............but obviously the filmmakers thought otherwise and KNEW THAT THEY COULD MILK PEOPLE LIKE ME FOR SOME MORE.",/review/rw2333125/?ref_=tt_urv

15 June 2022,thewalkingpuns,6," pretty strong continuation of the series
","Sure it might not have all the same cast, apart from eugene levi, who is still just as awesome. Some people might not like it as its not like the original, but really its still great. The same adult humor and gags and a nice story laying under it of a guy that just wants to lose his virginity to his girlfriend. Are new cast members all do well at bringing the eye opening at times fun and there are good callbacks to the series this far. Altogether just as funny and a solid continuation.",/review/rw2333125/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2020,carlos37andre,5," Definitely an improvement from Band Camp
","I'll give them credit here, they learned a bit from the last one here. Sure, this one has SO MUCH more naked people than the other ones (if I'm not mistaken - since I've watched the previous ones recently - this is the first one that actually shows a vagina), and you still have some familiar beats, but they at least came back to the formula of not focusing entirely on one character, and we have at least some new things added to the series (like the whole beta/naked mile thing), which is, you know, ok.",/review/rw2333125/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2006,alex_cd89,10," Funny and enjoyable
","I was really surprised and happy when I found out that the fifth American Pie movie appeared, so with the first opportunity that I had I went to see it. Usually sequels are not so good and they copy so many things, especially from the first movie, but even if it's the fifth American Pie movie, The Naked Mile is really fun and enjoyable. It comes with some original ideas, definitely it has more nudity and even if most of the actors don't have experience, I really liked the way they acted and overall the movie was great. I didn't get bored and the 90 minutes passed so quickly. I think guys will really like this movie and probably girls too, because they also can learn something from this. I give this movie a 10, because it was funny and definitely it wasn't a waste of time.",/review/rw2333125/?ref_=tt_urv

2 November 2010,Boba_Fett1138,3," Very immature and being not very clever with it.
","As far as teenage comedies go, the American Pie movies always had been among the best. The first movies actually were genre redefining at its time. Now 7 years after this first movie 5th movie out of the series. It doesn't feature any of the original characters anymore, besides Mr. Levenstein, and it's the second one out of the 'American Pie Presents' movies, that basically don't feature any continuation with any of the previous movies. Nothing wrong with this but there is still an awful lot wrong with this movie.",/review/rw2333125/?ref_=tt_urv
