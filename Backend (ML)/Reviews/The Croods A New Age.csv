13 May 2016,ofumalow,5," Well, there's nudity at least
","The director's prior ""I Am Love"" ultimately transcended its more pretentious, arbitrary aspects with a certain feeling of epic emotionality. But this time around there isn't enough substance or originality in other departments to detract attention from how...well, pretentious and arbitrary many of his directorial choices are. To an extent there's interest in simply watching the well-cast stars go through their paces: Fiennes plays one of his most extroverted characters; Swinton has magnetism as usual in a contrasting figure (contrasting because her rock-star has to be silent while recovering from surgery--but a laughable flashback where she sings in a recording studio blows any belief that we're watching a credible musical talent); Schoenaerts is attractive and earnest; Johnson is good playing a petulant brat who uses her sexual allure in obvious (yet successful) ways. If you've ever wanted to see any of these actors full-frontal, here's your big chance, since there's a lot of nudity here that doesn't seem to exist for much reason beyond producing a ""Look, s/he's taken it all off, too!"" reaction.

24 June 2016,Red_Identity,," Interesting, then obnoxious and annoying
","There's something that made this film really come together well in the beginning. I didn't think it entirely successful, and many people will not take to its meandering tone and feel. More importantly, the character beats all seemed to work well. Yet at the same time, the longer it went on, the more and more I disliked it. The longer it went on, the more obnoxious it became, and what was initially interesting and intriguing became really lazy and uninspired. The more original the film thought it was, the more aggravating it was. I can't even really pick any specifics, it just did not sit right with me. The cast itself was good, and the film definitely wasn't following any clichés or formulas, so perhaps I would feel like rewatching it in the future and that would change my mind. But oh no, not right now.",/review/rw5087384/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2015,Sergeant_Tibbs,7," While the film is hit-and-miss, Ralph Fiennes is a total riot.
","While she rests her voice after throat surgery, a David Bowie-esque rock legend, Marianne (Tilda Swinton), and her documentary-filmmaker boyfriend of 6 years, Paul (Matthias Schoenaerts), relax in the remote Italian paradise of Pantelleria. Her record producer, mutual friend of both and former flame of Marianne, Harry (Ralph Fiennes), brings his estranged daughter, Penelope (Dakota Johnson), to spend time with the couple and, mostly, interrupt the vacation. Tensions flare as Harry's ulterior motives to steal Marianne back after having 'given her' to Paul, while Penelope's relationships with her father and Paul come into question. Jacques Deray adapted this story once before in his 1969 film La Piscine, but Luca Guadagnino's 2015 iteration relies on its sharp sense for revelations of secrets and lies to draw us into its narrative and wrap us up in the impression of its characters. It works for the most part, but largely due to the efforts of the talented, committed cast.",/review/rw5087384/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2016,davidgee,5," Bigger splash - biggest yawn
","Rock-star Marianne (Tilda Swinton) is recuperating on an Italian island after throat surgery, with her film-maker lover (Mattias Schoenaerts) for company. Then an ex of hers turns up, loud and boozy record-producer Harry (Ralph Fiennes), with his nymphette daughter (Dakota Johnson). Marianne can only speak in whispers, but Harry could - and does - talk for England. The reunion rapidly turns from jolly reminiscence to sullen silences and naked confrontation.",/review/rw5087384/?ref_=tt_urv

","I hadn't seen A Bigger Splash but after being dazzled by Call Me By Your Name, I rushed to find and see this Luca Guadagnino 2015 film and it confirmed without a doubt that Luca Guadagnino is a remarkable filmmaker with a retro eye and a futuristic sensibility. His elegance makes cinematic the most unpalatable of tales and this one, a four sided triangle, it's unpalatable and scrumptious all at the same time. Tilda Swinton is superb as the voiceless singer, Dakota Johnson gave me, for the first time, a glimpse into what she could be, Matthias Schoenaerts hits all the right notes even the most unexpected ones but Ralph Fiennes gives a performance that it hast to be seen to be believed mostly because this is the same actor in Schindler's List, Quiz Show, In Bruges and last year he provided me woth one of the funniest scenes of the year in Hail Caesar. So, as you must gather, I had a great time and I'll wait for the next Guadagnino with childish anticipation",/review/rw5087384/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2016,LiamLovesMovies,6," Great performances and moments that contribute to very little...
","If you thought that Oscar Isaac's dancing in ""Ex Machina"" was a sight to behold, then wait until you see this. Directed by Luca Guadagnino, who is best known for his well-received work on ""I Am Love"" in 2009, this has to be a shoe-in for the most screwed up family holiday of the year. Tilda Swinton, who has worked with Guadagnino in the past, stars as voiceless rockstar Marianne Lane, who has retired to a remote island off the coast of Italy in order to recover from an operation on her vocal chords. Joining her is partner and filmmaker Paul (Matthias Schoenaerts) who, as we see through flashbacks, is introduced to Lane by record producer Harry Hawkes, a rambunctious and zany character played in true dickhead style by Ralph Fiennes. After intruding on Marianne and Paul's get-away with his daughter Penelope (Dakota Johnson), who seems to share a rather suspicious and discomforting relationship with her new-found father, it becomes clear that Harry has some designs on winning his ex-lover and colleague Marianne back. Set in the beautiful Pantellaria, and often around an enticing swimming pool, what seems like an above-board retreat soon turns pretty sour. Having competed for the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, which saw it receive rave reviews from many critics, can ""A Bigger Splash"" live up to its impactful title?",/review/rw5087384/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2016,nikicianciola-702-657633,2," Dreadful
","I'm clearly in the minority here, but I absolutely hated this movie. Every character were annoying and not likable at all. I'm not really sure what the point of the movie was. I kept thinking it would get better the longer I stayed, but it didn't. The only redeemable thing about this movie was the lovely Tilda Swinton, and her beautiful wardrobe. Sadly, with no voice in the movie, she was still the most exciting character to watch.",/review/rw5087384/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2016,born_naughty,2," Annoying
","There is some talent here. I don't know the director but Ralph Fiennes, Matthias Schoenaerts and Tilda Swinton are all talented actors. While Matthias wasn't at his best, Tilda Swinton was, even voiceless, remarkably well cast. Ralph Fienness was very good as well... at least his acting was. And now to the negative. Basically every single protagonist in this film is extremely annoying but by far the worst is Ralph Fiennes as Harry Hawkes. His acting was good but the character was written that way. Now, in a way this was how it was meant to be. His ""friends"", if you can call them that, were also annoyed by him. But why keep him around then? And what's the point of annoying the audience so much they want to leave the cinema? The behavior of all the other characters around him didn't make any sense. They were annoyed and didn't want him around and yet kept him and didn't say a word. Marianne Lane hates the guy, seems almost disgusted by him and yet let's him come so close physically. There were two reasons for me to stay to the end in this movie. I was hoping that Paul would kick Harry's ass, so I was waiting for that. And the second reason was that I wanted to see another movie afterwards so I might as well kill some time in the meanwhile. When I finally got what I was waiting for it was an awkward fight that was only mildly satisfying. At least after that Harry shut up, so that's a plus. What could have somewhat saved this movie is some good scenery shots and cinematography. Giving the setting of the movie that would seem obvious. While there were some good shots it was ultimately disappointing. Just like the rest of the movie.",/review/rw5087384/?ref_=tt_urv

","At one point in ""A Bigger Splash,"" there is an exchange of dialogue that goes as follows: --""We're all obscene."" --""Everyone's obscene."" To complete this train of thought, it might be added that this film is obscene! And pretentious, meandering, poorly paced, self-indulgent, and shallow.",/review/rw5087384/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2016,sol-,6," Splashing
","The peace and tranquility of a rock star recovering from throat surgery and her documentarian boyfriend is shattered by a visit from the musician's former lover and his estranged adult daughter in this unusual film. Tension hangs in the air throughout with much unannounced but pronounced animosity between the characters. Ralph Fiennes is simply electric as the unwanted guest, oblivious to his intrusion (not to mention the disturbance he causes by constantly walking around nude), while Tilda Swinton is solid in a challenging role that forces her to emote without talking above a whisper. Intriguing as all this might sound though, it adds up to precious little. There are a lot of zooms-in and out that call attention to themselves without discernible purpose. The daughter's motives are also elusive throughout without any explanation; she acts with hostility towards Swinton, for instance, simply for the sake of it. That said, the plot takes a sharp turn in the final 35 minutes with a twist that causes us to view three of the characters in a different light. For a two-hour film though, such a twist comes late in the piece and with an inconclusive ending too, it is hard to hone in on what the point of the film is (outside of the notion that the Italian police are competent). For Fiennes, Swinton, some great costumes and several breathtaking locations, 'A Bigger Splash' is worth watching, but is that alone enough?",/review/rw5087384/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is the second Luca Guadagnino film I've watched, the first being Call Me By Your Name. I've come to the conclusion that Guadagnino is highly pretentious. Watching both of these films I get the impression that when he was making them his thought process was ""I'm going to make a cerebral, artsy movie"" rather than letting greatness come naturally. I'm a fan of Tilda Swinton, but her performance here was awful. I understand the circumstances before she took on the role, but if she didn't feel up to it, she shouldn't have taken it. Matthias Schoenaerts and Ralph Fiennes are the stars of the movie, and both of their performances are exceptional, especially the former's. Dakota Johnson was just being Dakota Johnson the whole time.",/review/rw5087384/?ref_=tt_urv

20 March 2016,CineMuseFilms,6," Beautifully photographed Sicilian landscape dwarfs four small lives and the mess they create.
","The getaway-retreat scenario is a common film device for creating a chaotic crossroad where divergent character types can bring their shady pasts, chronic problems and deviant desires. It works well in the melodrama genre because people act differently when brought together, especially in a luxurious or exotic location where they can let go and be who they really are: recent examples include Youth (2015) and The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014). A Bigger Splash (2016) does this using a beautiful Sicilian hillside villa with a prominent pool for baring bodies and souls. To keep the plot line taut there are only four actors who play out in two pairs and the chemistry is anything but harmonious.",/review/rw5087384/?ref_=tt_urv

","Complete load of rubbish, masquerading as an art(y) film. Four characters, only one of whom is remotely sane, three of whom are both uninteresting and unpleasant. Tilda Swinton is her usual pretentious self, only voiceless. Mathias Schonaerts is handsome and quiet (thank goodness). Ralph Fiennes doing manic is the most irritating and pointless character I can remember on screen. No-one half civilised would stand him for as much as minute. The nymphet does what you expect nymphets to do. I despair of professional critics who go weak at the knees if they can describe a film as arty.

","Ralph Fiennes, Dakota Johnson and Tilda Swinton may wander through A Bigger Splash naked (or nearly so), but it's director Luca Guadignino who's truly without clothes here. This is a genuine mess of a movie, boring as a bad dinner party for 7/8s of its length, nonsensical for the rest and exuding an irksome pretentiousness throughout. Worst, perhaps, is the way Guadignino cynically salts in occasional references to the Mediterranean migrant crisis in an attempt to add political meaning to this addled, indulgent trifle. By the picture's end, we're supposed to believe the character played by Matthias Schoenaerts has gotten away with murder.

","If you don't have enough exposure in your life to shallow hedonistic narcissism with lots of four letter words as compensation and coupled with a touch of dishonest sex then this movie homage will complete those inadequacies in your being. One star rating for you. Otherwise there are two raison d'être moments to watch this film (and why it got a two instead of one rating) as follows: First, there was Fiennes' dance scene to the Stones' ""Emotional Rescue"" (ball park, around half way through). That song title might have made a better film title. Second, was the incongruously weird way the movie almost ended followed by it's denouement, actual ending.
