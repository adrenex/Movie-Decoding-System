29 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Solid Fantasy Series!
","Shadow and Bone is a solid, interesting fantasy series that will keep you entertained throughout each episode. While it's not the best fantasy shows to come out in the last few years, it's still a very good one that's worth your to time to watch. I never read any of the books so I didn't know what to expect but have to say I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I've read that it is a good adaptation so even the book lovers should mostly be happy. It has a little of something for everyone...fantasy, humor, action, drama, romance, etc. While it does take a few episodes to really get going, stay with it because it's worth it! The pacing really picks up once they build their world and characters. If you like fantasy then give this show a chance, you won't be disappointed!",/review/rw7279311/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2021,meritcoba,," How writing for cool moments ruins a story
","Initially, I was hooked. Shadow and bone has a promising setting: late 19th century technology with magic on top. You get a lot of lore thrown at you and hardly any explanation, but, hey; I am okay with that. They explain things later, right? Well, perhaps or.. perhaps not.",/review/rw7279311/?ref_=tt_urv

23 April 2021,TheFarscapeProject747,9," Great fantasy
","Fantasy shows on netflix is hit or miss, their biggest hit for me being The Witcher, this one comes in at a close second. It seems that they shelled out just as much of a budget for this show as much as TW. The sets, costumes and cinematography are all top notch. I find it interesting that the setting is like a fantasy world version of Russia. Plus gun battles and magic is not something I've seen in a fantasy show or movie before. The actors all do a great job as well, most of which are unknown to be except for Ben Barnes. I have not read the books but according to some other reviews the show is a good adaptation of them when usually their are massive changes. So if you are looking for a fun well made fantasy series this one is worth watching. I've watched half of the season so far and I'm trying not to watch the whole thing today but I'm hooked!.",/review/rw7279311/?ref_=tt_urv

16 June 2021,daisukereds,3," No thanks
","Alina Starkov is one of the most underwritten main characters ever put onto a series. Doesn't react to anything, has little to no personality (aside from her boyfriend obsession), and is NOT proactive. She is boring and sometimes stupid. The worldbuilding is nice, sure, but the series as a whole is a representation of the main character. It's just there, and will do something if she has no choice. Also, what are her powers? Does Light do anything? I'm personally tired of ""I can do everything"" characters, lazy writing and no consistency. Predictability is also a problem (amongst many others).",/review/rw7279311/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2021,Expat-in-America,9," From a watcher who didn't read the books
","It's still fantastic, and it makes me wish I'd read them! I usually read a book series before watching the adaptations, but I just found this on Netflix. I did a little research to fill in the holes I may have missed, and I'm sure having read the entire book series would enhance your viewing, but you can definitely watch and enjoy without having done so. It's a beautifully well done series, and the acting is superb (Ben Barnes is always worth a watch). An intriguing premise and a whole new and creative world, in a sea of fantasy options we have available to watch these days (I just recently got hooked on His Dark Materials and The Witcher as well). It won't disappoint, when if you are new to the series.",/review/rw7279311/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2021,urbanswami,8," Ebony and ivory
","The show is an iteration of the oldest story in the book, which is nice, it's worth retelling. The worldbuilding is phenomenal, the characters are fleshed out and well acted. I don't quite get the romancing of tsarian russia, but it's as good a basis for fiction as any other, I suppose. I understand the show's based on a book trilogy; the season finale doesn't conclude the story and is a clear setup for another season, hopefully we'll get it.",/review/rw7279311/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2021,derbo73,4," Nothing wrong with it...just boring
","I don't know what's wrong with fantasy and other genre series these days... but they usually don't deliver anything special anymore. That feeling of expectation and excitement you had when a new fantasy movie came into theatres like years ago. It's most likely the fact that Netflix and all the other streaming platforms pump out movies and series without end, they can hardly be all of top quality or somehow unique. And the audience experiences a wear out effect: ""oh, yet another young adults fantasy series."" You can hardly finish a series before two others pop up already.",/review/rw7279311/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2021,gnatsong,7," I actually watched the complete 1st season!
","Not so much because of a tight plot that always made sense, but because the casting was really done, with engaging characters, with even some character development. This is the first Netflix fantasy in a long while I've found worth watching- most have been somewhere between horrid and utterly ridiculous. This YA offering does lapse into predictabllity at times, but the actors save it, with very fine direction. Don't look for deep and profound here- just sit back and enjoy, mostly, the ride.",/review/rw7279311/?ref_=tt_urv

",Good series based on the novel. A good adaptation. Perfect cast and screenplay. Vfx scenes are awesome. It has what it needs. Lead character and the villain character has steals the show. Perfect series tp watch. Superb lead for season 2.,/review/rw7279311/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2022,Bibiliography,8," Great start
","The network merged two -Shadow and Bone & Six of Crows- entirely different book series and frankly, it's a great disservice to Six of Crows which is the better of the two. Notwithstanding, it's exciting that Bardugo's work made it to the big screen and I'm positively giddy to see what they have in store for season 2.",/review/rw7279311/?ref_=tt_urv

","Its ok.. but not more... very cheese plenty of stereotypes. Im at episode 3 and its easy to guess what happens next. Very little world building and story telling, the story goes too fast. The character are not very interesting. Alina behaves like a 14-year-old. Kaz has exactly ONE FACE.... boring for adults...",/review/rw7279311/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2021,jessup-86446,7," Great SFX and solid performances, but story was too predictable
","I like the effort the author of the novel put into world-building and I have to give props for how well the show was brought to the screen, with the choice costumes and shiny special effects enhancing the performances of a solid cast.",/review/rw7279311/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2021,hussain-ayaz,9," Amazing!
","This has to be the best so far in netflix this year. The acting, cinematography is great which makes you give 9/10 rating atleast to this show. Ben Barnes is an amazing actor. He gave a wonderful performance as a villian in The Punisher and now in Shadow and bone as well. I am also looking forward to finish the book series of shadow and bone. Can't wait for season 2!",/review/rw7279311/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2021,criscal,9," Engaging story-telling, great cinematography for a TV series
","I watched the first four episodes of that Netflix show and I must say that I like it a lot. Rather than telling everything upfront, it introduces the most important things one by one. It shows how important Mal and Alina are to each other, what the terrifying fold is and the impact it has. The cinematography is very good for a TV series and the casting is well done so far. I haven't read the books, so I don't have any image in mind of the characters, so I don't know whether they deviate critically from the book. I really hope it can keep the quality.",/review/rw7279311/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2021,samratsingraur,9," Wasn't expecting this!
","Shadow and Bone is not just any flashy fantasy show. It seems to be much more than that. The production quality, sets and the costumes are terrific. The intense background music makes a great impact too. After watching Season 1, the thing I think had the most impact on grabbing the viewer's attention was it's cast and an engaging storytelling. It didn't seem dragged or bore nevertheless was unique and intriguing. I'd say the show definitely isn't as great as GOT but it's worth every second and has the potential to be even much bigger than what it is now. Can't wait for season 2.",/review/rw7279311/?ref_=tt_urv

3 May 2021,magguilmot,4," Pretty to look at
","Another netflix botched attempt at adaptation. Whatever substance books have, netflix sure knows how to get rid of. Especially if it's for teens. His Dark Materials is for kids but it seduced me and left me wanting more. This adaptation, however, will be forgotten next week with a vague feeling that Ben Barnes is poorly used.",/review/rw7279311/?ref_=tt_urv

28 April 2021,Blumanowar,8," Great show, but knowing Netflix's past...
","Great show, but knowing Netflix's past...The never keep a show over a year or two. Three seasons is rare. I wish somebody else had picked it up because this has the potential for a long run if the original show runner and casts stick with it. That's another problem with Netflix shows, the show runners who start shows seem to move on and that has to be more than a coincidence and leads me to believe they don't like working with N.",/review/rw7279311/?ref_=tt_urv

28 August 2021,PennyReviews,4," Good Enough
","Shadow and Bone is a decent try on a famous YA fantasy book series. It does great when it comes to costumes and even CGI. The performances were pretty great too. However, it is too rushed for a non fan to follow, and kind of changed for a fan to appreciate. That said, the Shadow and Bone story is pretty close to the original, apart from the casting choices and the plotline where they tried to comment on racism, even though the book had no discrimination twist in it. But, the Crows story was, well, not well presented and utterly changed. So, overall, the show is a nice take on the fantasy genre, but too short to make things work.",/review/rw7279311/?ref_=tt_urv
