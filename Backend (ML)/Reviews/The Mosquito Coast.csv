4 June 2021,kq999,3," The start was great!...then fizzled quickly
","The first couple episodes had me thinking this is going to be a really good series. The problem began quickly as all episodes are the same...they follow the same format, battle the same problems and end in the exact same way all while the actors perform super-hero tasks that no human could. If you watch the first 2 episodes you've seen the whole series. There is no escalation to the plot, it is just flat and repeats itself leaving one hanging at the end wondering if there is yet another episode.",/review/rw7850284/?ref_=tt_urv

",What could have been a great show turned into a series that grew more and more idiotic as the weeks went by. Plot holes abound.,/review/rw7850284/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2021,Acid_Reflex,5," Low rent MacGyver takes his annoying family to Mexico
","Low rent MacGyver takes his annoying family to Mexico, and not just Mexico, the very worst parts. One character is more annoying than the next. Some Mexican tramp is supposed to be so lethal every cartel in Mexico is scared of her or something and a genius thinks Mexico is the place to hide when the United States is after you. Worst thing Apple has done so far by far.",/review/rw7850284/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2021,SimonSaysSmallScreen,5," Not believable, not compelling
","I want to like this story, but I can't. The Allie Fox character is just not compelling. He is written to be flippant, even nonchalant, in the face of violence, sudden death and mortal danger to his family. The character is purported to be intelligent, but he behaves as if he doesn't quite grasp the reality of his situation. His daughter, for example, demonstrates to his surprise and awe that she is a smart, courageous and capable bad-ass by rescuing him from police custody. But he continues to treat her like a child, not discussing the risks and tactics of their route through the desert. Instead, he feeds his family quips and sardonic grins as he leads them to what very well may be their deaths. It's a shame that Apple executives don't seem to be able to distinguish between good and bad writing.",/review/rw7850284/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2023,DiCaprioFan13,8," Glad I gave it a chance
","I wasn't sure what to expect from The Mosquito Coast but heard enough good things to give it a chance. I'm glad I did because I was hooked almost immediately. It's packed with enough twists and turns that you'll want to binge it as quickly as possible. I actually binged the entire first season over a weekend and was upset when it ended because I wanted to see more. I think most reviews have already pointed this out but the only negative thing on the show for me is the daughter. Don't like the character and the actress is just as bad. It's based off a movie that came out in the 80's that starred Harrison Ford, Helen Morten and River Phoenix. I never saw the movie but heard it was pretty good but not as good as this show. Give this show a chance and I promise you won't be able to stop watching it!",/review/rw7850284/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2023,Supermanfan-13,8," I liked it but wanted them to kill off the daughter so bad!
","The Mosquito Coast was so much better than I expected. I've been a fan of Justin Theroux ever since his brilliant performance in The Leftovers. He really is an underrated actor as he's great in this as well. The rest of the cast is pretty good as well (except for the daughter) but it's Theroux who really stands out. He plays a brilliant inventor who has to go on the run with his family throughout Mexico as he's wanted by the US Government and some other dangerous people. The only problem with the show I had was that I couldn't stand the daughter. I couldn't stand the actress or how the character was written. The way she keeps disrespecting her parents is disgusting. I kept hoping that she would be killed off every episode. Anyway, It will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the season. It was good enough to get renewed for a second season so I'm looking forward to that coming out soon.",/review/rw7850284/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2021,whatithinkis,3," Face it . . . it's a dud
","The writing is absolutely horrible, drifting haphazardly toward non-existent. The storyline becomes more and more ludicrous . . . Silly.",/review/rw7850284/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2021,npvarley,5," I tried hard to like this but... It's just not very good
","I have struggled through season 1, watching all 7 episodes. I don;t think I'll be bothering with season 2, which has just been confirmed by Apple TV. It's the weakest scripted show on Apple TV yet.",/review/rw7850284/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2021,omendata,6," Started off well but soon becomes stale
",Was really looking forward to this due to the writer of the book being involved and his brother starring in it so perhaps we would get a more authentic version of the book and to be fair it started off quite well but soon becomes lacklustre and rather tedious.,/review/rw7850284/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2021,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,3," idiocy
","I am floored with the ratings of this show. I do not understand how it can be rated so high? Sure the production quality is good, the cinematography is good, the acting and directing is good. But hasn't anyone did some critical thinking about the screenplay? Ehmmmm??",/review/rw7850284/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2021,ncentia,6," Why?
","This show has many strengths and is well-produced. But 7 episodes in and the audience is still given no reason WHY we should care about, invest in, empathise with, and root for Allie and Margot and many, many reasons why we shouldn't. They are not likeable characters and that's hard to accept when we're given no reasons why they are the way they are. It undermines the entire show and as a viewer you just watch children endangered, lied to, and controlled again and again with no good reason provided for why it is happening. In a way it somewhat works as an allegory for abusive parenting and being stuck in the grip of a destructive narcissist but I'm not sure it is enough.",/review/rw7850284/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2021,Ashitaka137,5," Unbelievable
","The daughter had the right idea to run away from that family; the father is insane, the mother is clueless, and the son is simple; it's unbelievable they're still alive! Good actors; but i'm not sure about the story yet.",/review/rw7850284/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2021,zorroaca,5," Frustratingly Unreal
","There is enough to keep you watching... and that might be the overall plan... reeks of the carrot and the stick. At this point... a snail could flash past it. Might be one those series that keeps you saying to yourself ... with every character... ""give me a break"".",/review/rw7850284/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2021,Xavier_Stone,2," Just a muddled up mess of a show

12 May 2022,wrxsti54,8," Action packed version of Paul Thoroux's iconic work
","Having just binge watched the 2021 series after watching the 1986 original movie starring Harrison Ford, it was easy to make comparisons. The essential plot line is maintained but is dramatically elongated this time with a series of intricate twists. The family dynamic is different (movie: 4 kids with Charlie the oldest versus series: 2 kids with an older sister and Charlie now the youngest). The Allie/Margot chemistry is quite different with Justin Thoroux (son of author Paul) younger, more calculating and able to navigate past government operatives and Mexican cartels, something I can't imagine the more quirky and eccentric Ford version achieving.",/review/rw7850284/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2021,sabrakittycat-788-697886,3," Rooting for the family to lose
",This show started out strong but the further you go into the story the more you really hate this family. Allie (Theroux) is so selfish. He gets others into trouble even after they have gone above and beyond for this family they don't even know. He also keeps making empty promises to his kids and keeps them at bay when they ask why they're running from....we'll that's just the point. They don't know who they're running from or why. The wife's character goes in and out of being a strong female to a wife that dotes on her husband just because they're married. She's asked to steal for him and she does it even through protests. In one episode she manipulates the protagonists in order to save her whole family and the next minute she's caving into her husband's wishes. The kids aren't much better. The daughter has some sense. She keeps pressing her dad to telling her why they're running and doesn't accept his answers. She's also the only bilingual person in the family. The son is a snot nosed brat. Disobedient and way out of his element. Never have I wanted a family to lose so badly. It's the only reason I'm continuing to watch. Skip this and watch The Detour.,/review/rw7850284/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2021,iconians,8," Not bad After episode two
","So far, so good. Acting is good. Pacing is good. Def not boring. No clear answers yet. But, def a high quality production. Worth watching it, I think.",/review/rw7850284/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2021,fgddpk,4," Watched Full Season 1 - Writers Seem Lost
",It feels like the writers have no idea where they want this to go. There's a recurring moment where the family is about to say what's actually happening but then that conversation doesn't happen. It feels like either a lazy way to get you to keep watching or that the writers really haven't even decided what the history of the family even is.,/review/rw7850284/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2022,Dawson-1234,9," Please kill off the daughter...can't stand her!
","I want to start off by saying I really enjoy the show but HATE the daughter, Dina. She is so disrespectful and self centered for a 16 old year. She's 16 but talks down to her parents all the time. No 16-year old should be able to disrespect her parents like that. Also, Melissa George's character, Margot, is getting worse every episode. She's the main reason they're on the run but blames Allie (Justin Theriot) for everything. He could've cleared up his mess and been fine but she killed someone and he dropped everything for her to keep their family together. Then he tells the kids it's all his fault so the kids blame him and not her and still she wants to take the kids and leave him. Besides Allie, they're all a bunch of idiots. If Margot did succeed in getting her and the kids back to America then she would go to jail for life, the son, Charlie, would be sent to Mexico for killing someone and the daughter would be the only one to be able to live her life and she's the least worthy and dumbest character on the show. Margot started off as such a badass character but is getting more annoying each episode but still has nothing on the daughter. Please kill off the daughter already!",/review/rw7850284/?ref_=tt_urv

",It's really frustrating to me all the people on here writing bad reviews. This was a exciting show!! So there was a few annoying moments where the kids made dumb decisions.
