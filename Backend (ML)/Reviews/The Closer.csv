","Someone said this could have been another Adam Sandler movie. Well one of his ""comedies"" that is. That is not entirely untrue and there is more than just some merit to it. What is one major difference though: the female lead. While David Spade is the main character, she is stealing the show. Now as annoying as I think she is, as not attracted to that character I am (love the actress for sure), she is winning everyone over.",/review/rw5798317/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2020,rodrmar70,7," What kind of movie do we expect? Be real and don't follow the haters
","Not every movie is supossed to be Amarcord, casablanca or even young frankenstein.
It's not a sin to enjoy a simple movie, to stop the stress fron reality, to take a detour from the horrible things going on in today's world.
You're wathching a Happy Madison production, with Sandler's friends, a simple plot and yes, a 50 something year old men dating a 35 year old woman.
But i really don't understand the hate; when i want emotion i see Cinema Paradiso. When i want to be really scared , i see the exorcist....
Today, i really wanted to scape, be relaxed, and maybe have one or two laughs.",/review/rw5798317/?ref_=tt_urv

","So this was never meant to win an Oscar, let's be honest with ourselves. Nobody with a brain would press Play thinking this was going to blow their minds with best cinematography or acting. However it did one thing well & it did it VERY well, it made me LOL throughout the movie. The stupidest & simplest things can be worth every minute. Well done on this one, credit due there!",/review/rw5798317/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2020,deloudelouvain,8," The tone is set from the start. If you don't like it in the beginning just stop watching it.
","This is a typical comedy that will divide people, some will love it and others will hate it. You can count me in the ones that had a really good time watching this movie. I wanted to watch a funny movie and that's exactly what I got. There are plenty of hilarious moments, maybe annoying to some but who cares? If you don't like it after five minutes just stop watching it because the rest of the movie will be the same kind of humor. I thought the chemistry between David Spade and Lauren Lapkus worked perfectly. Rob Schneider and Nick Swardson also added to the comedy, it was just a good mix of comedians. People bashing Lauren Lapkus because she was annoying just don't get it, that's exactly the role she had, to annoy as much people as possible, so I would say very good job doing that. Do I think she was annoying? Definitely, I wouldn't want to know a woman like that in my personal life, but it's a movie so wake up and stop bitching. The story is lighthearted, nothing too serious, just funny, dumb and sometimes vulgar humor, so what? I wish there were more comedies like this one.",/review/rw5798317/?ref_=tt_urv

",I don't care what anyone says I must of been stoned the other night when I watched it. But I will be Honest with everyone I don't know why but it was pretty funny and that one Hot Nutty Chick Lol. Lauren Lapkus I think her name is she was very funny in this film. You think she is Crazy but she turns out to be very Smart as well. Great film it's a must watch. Not a Oscar but Fun to watch.,/review/rw5798317/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2020,Neon_Gold,4," It was a Happy Madison movie
",I didn't hate it as much as I thought I would. I definitely wasn't bored but I don't know. I think the issue was it just a Happy Madison movie. Like it had all the same bullet points that every Happy Madison film in the past 10 year has had.,/review/rw5798317/?ref_=tt_urv

",She keeps sexually assaulting him and straight up r*ping him like twice in the movie and it's funny cause she's a quirky woman? No wonder why no one take men seriously when assault happen cause it's treated like a funny quirky thing in media.,/review/rw5798317/?ref_=tt_urv

~The confusion that is created with the messages of Spade's character is entertaining to watch and Nick Swardson deliver some funny lines.

25 May 2020,rmmil,2," Why was I ever a Happy-Madison fan, again?
","I will say this about Happy-Madison films, they are consistent, in theme, tone, ""message"", etc. But that's probably a bad thing, because this movie feels exactly like many other recent HM movies too.
I will say this, kudos to Adam Sandler, David Spade, and the other HM regulars, they have a pretty sweet gig. Adam Sandler has openly admitted that whenever Netflix approaches him for a movie, his demands are a big fat paycheck, and that the movie be filmed somewhere nice so it acts like a vacation for him. This HM film doesn't have Adam (because he was too busy being a ""serious"" actor again, wonder how long that'll last?), instead it stars his pan burger partner buddy, David Spade.
David plays a typical ""loser"" in HM films, but somehow, like all HM films, he draws the attention of women who are way, way too attractive for him. Molly Sims, Sarah Chalke? Are you kidding me? In his dreams.
It seems like a small point, but having models lust over David Spade significantly reduces the believability factor of this movie by quite a bit.
The plot is okay enough, and Lauren Lapkus' attempt to bring life to this film is commendable. She definitely gives this film her everything. Nick Swardson is also in this, but I can tell why his comedy act consists of ""Remember me, I was in Grandma's Boy?"" Not a funny guy.
Stupid stuff happens in the film that doesn't matter much, the plot is throw-away. There's also a really stupid ""threesome scene"" that ""goes wrong"" because one of the participants keeps getting karate kicked in the head. There's the level of quality you're getting here.
Only worth it for Lauren Lapkus' performance, I look forward to seeing her in other things.",/review/rw5798317/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2020,rahs-al-ghul,7," Lapkus makes her mark
","I'm generally skeptical these dates of anything that Adam Sandler's name is attached to these days. While the movie itself has its shortcomings, not the least of which is Spade as the romantic lead it has a shining light: Lauren Lapkus, whose comedic performance is the superb.
It puts her alongside the best comedic actors of the moment. She completely commits to everything which means that many of the moments that would be rendered unfunny in less capable hands hit the mark or exceed it.
I will be going out of my way to watch her in the future.",/review/rw5798317/?ref_=tt_urv

14 May 2020,btoews,7," Tommy Boy as a RomCom
",David Spade in his trademark role-straight man to a crazed over the top funnyman (funnywoman)-Lauren Lapkus shines as the force of nature and overall it was a lot of laughs. I hope they make a sequel.,/review/rw5798317/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2020,jakebrann,2," Hard to watch...
","Lapkus is a female Mr. Bean! She's so over the top annoying its unreal. I hoped she would eventually calm down as the movie went on and not be so damn obnoxious but no such luck... she single handedly ruined this film! She's hard enough to look at and then they made her so stupid its unwatchable... but of course, as predicted Spade falls in love with her and the scene where he tells the blonde ""other Missy"" was so cringeworthy. They have no chemistry.",/review/rw5798317/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2020,DarkVulcan29,8," A big surprise to me, I was very entertained.
","Not saying this was a great movie, it's not , but an enjoyable one, never tries to be anything more. The cast really make the comedy worth while. The story of a guy(David Spade) who is basically a good guy, but is pretty much down on his luck with love, after a miserable blind date with Missy(Lauren Lapkus) who is beyond wild and crazy, he seems to find love with another woman who is also named Missy(Molly Sims). He is soon to ask to go a business trip that could help his career, and he texts Missy if she liked to go with him, she says yes, but the problem is it's not the Missy he was hoping for.",/review/rw5798317/?ref_=tt_urv

","I guess you have to be a Happy Madison and company fan to truly enjoy and appreciate this like I did. I grew up watching these guys and David Spade always delivers. As always, the usually suspects showed up to make it another comedic classic under the HM umbrella. Great cameo at the end too if you're from this generation of comedy gold.",/review/rw5798317/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2020,ttttony-18640,1," The wrong message!
","Ok, so Missy is allowed to act like a complete imbecile, public nuisance, encourage a threesome etc. Although it be for 'laughs', I thought was way over the top. She then goes on later on, to take the moral high ground because David Spade's character didn't like her. Oh yeah, I forgot, she brings out the best in him.
Sorry mate, the infantile, attention seeking behaviour of Missy at the beginning is trying too hard to get laughs and is off-putting. There is zero intelligence in this movie and zero care factor for the characters.",/review/rw5798317/?ref_=tt_urv

22 May 2020,eliasbelrhiti,1," Just horrendous
","This movie is literally an example of a terrible or a 1/10 movie. Every aspect of this movie is horrendous. The story does not make sense at all, and its idea is completely unoriginal. Although this movie's genre is comedy, it is the absolute opposite of comedy, it is not funny AT ALL, I did not laugh at all during this film, the humor is just pure crap. The editing and cinematography are basic and does nothing to stand out and is honestly just rubbish. The acting is some of the worst I have seen in weeks, I mean David Spade is honestly just terrible at playing his role, it does not even look authentic, sam thing goes for Lauren Lapkus. I honestly cannot go on at this, this movie is just garbage it does not deserve an in-depth review. I think this is the worst movie I have seen in 2020, absolute garbage. For your own sake DO NOT WATCH THIS!",/review/rw5798317/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2020,Hussain-AL-Naseer,6," A Time Pass Movie For Quarantine
","Well the plot is common , predictable and have nothing new to offer.
The film is silly in every possible way but there are some moments which will surely gives you a good laugh but if you watch it critically then the very same moments might be disturbing and you might call it a molestation but for me those were LOL moments. Locations were exotic with some beautiful ladies around and then there was missy played by Lauren Lapkus, doing all the heavy liftings and it was good to watch her in a lead, she did a good job.
Nevertheless don't watch it with much of the expectations but it is indeed a one time comic watch i.e. a Time-Pass movie in these quarantine days.",/review/rw5798317/?ref_=tt_urv

","The names David Spade and Rob Schneider were enough to get me interested in the film.
