18 February 2018,Fella_shibby,7," Fun to see Nic Cage stumbling. Cage Rage is back with his over-the-top, grimacing, eye-bulging performance.
","Nic Cage is always enjoyable to watch especially with his angry n constipated face aka Cage Rage.
If u enjoyed the scene wher he is crying in pain in a jute sack aft getting a beating in Wicker Man then u will love the scene where he stumbles...",/review/rw7171892/?ref_=tt_urv

24 July 2021,parkerbcn,7," Better than expected
","Just when you think that this is a movie that you can't take seriously (it's kind of a mix between a zombie film, ""The Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", ""Home Alone"" and ""The Happening"") and that you just have to enjoy the most over the top side of Nicolas Cage and the fun of it all, it throws in some interesting social commentary and gets even better.",/review/rw7171892/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2018,subxerogravity,6," Soooo good!
",This movie was strangely therapeutic for someone. If you hate your kids or don't understand your parents this movie is for you.,/review/rw7171892/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2021,nashw82,7," Dark Black Comedy Horror
","I guess it's okay to label this as a black comedy, but there are very few laugh out loud comedy moments, the comedy comes more through the premise of the film. It also feels as if this movie is a major venting of frustration for modern parents who are stuck with the spoilt brats they gave birth to. Selma Blair gives a solid performance as a gorgeous mother who is starting to pass her prime and worried that her best days are behind her, she is not shallow enough to stoop to sleeping with the yoga teacher to make herself feel better about it. Nicolas Cage plays the aging father who tried his best for a while but has basically given up and withdrawn, looking for simple ways to reclaim some of his youth such as building a perfect snooker table. As something causes parents to lose their inhibitions and become like many wild animals who will occasionally kill their offspring, things get crazy in the schoolyard, the streets and in homes. The kids of our two leads do their best to survive the ordeal and this battle is the climax of the film.
It's definitely a new and interesting idea, and while it doesn't fully tap Nic Cage's potential it definitely allows him a few great moments to go full 'Nic Cage'. Avoid it if you have a real problem with over the top violence against children, but if you have no issue with that then watch it on a day when your kids are being particularly bratty haha.",/review/rw7171892/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2018,Aktham_Tashtush,6," Not the perfect movie you're looking for,, but it's really nice, thrilling and somehow funny :D
","So when i saw the trailer, and Nicolas Cage in there i kinda had a bit of hesitation , because lately he had some really weird mediocre roles ,, but i think this is different ,, the idea of the movie is fresh and genuine and it build up to an easily followable plot.",/review/rw7171892/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2019,UniqueParticle,9," Nicolas Cage doing what he does best
","Refreshing super bizarre original Brian Taylor directed experience! Selma Blair is great too. I love the soundtrack, the pandemic vibe of what the hell is happening and I love Nicolas Cage's black shirt that he wore in part of it. This is exactly what you'd want from a horror/thriller and I'm completely ok with loving it when others didn't.",/review/rw7171892/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2018,TheMovieDiorama,7," Mom and Dad may be the only reason to justify divorces.
","Nicolas Cage, the legend that he is, smashes a pool table (that he just built) with a sledgehammer whilst excitedly singing the ""Hokey Pokey"", before shouting how his life has been a total ruin since he had kids. Just let that wondrous imagery sink into your mind for a little bit. Initially I thought this would be horrendously bad. Surprisingly, I rather enjoyed this...possibly too much. Mass hysteria arises within a suburban community, forcing parents to murder their own children. If you find it distasteful, don't watch it. Nobody is forcing you. It's a satirical horror comedy that is not to be taken seriously. For those of you that actually have a sense of humour, may I present to you one of the best modern horror comedies I've seen in quite some time. Parenting is a challenge, and I'm sure occasionally it builds up some anger through all the frustrations of adult life. This film illustrates the unleashing of that inner aggression, with an adequate balance of tension and humour. The final line of dialogue surmises the premise perfectly. ""Kids, we love you...but sometimes we just want to...!"". Smartly written and intelligently executed, with enough energy that it's as if it consumed a litre of isotonic fluid. Cage was absolutely perfect for this role. Guys, this could be the comeback we've been waiting for! Why was he so good? Initiate ""Cage Rage"". He. Went. Bonkers. Suggestively licking a can of drink. ""Sawzall saws...all!"". Eloquently discussing about anal beads and dildos. And even falling asleep whilst watching porn. Father of the year, indefinitely. Cage produces the humour, Blair provides the menace. Excellent combination! The editing is where it unfortunately takes a turn for the worse. Haphazard, disjointed and quite frankly all over the place. Several scenes of frantic action had too many quick cuts which made the experience slightly headache inducing. Also the abrupt ending may leave some underwhelmed (including myself), although the lack of explanation is much appreciated. Still, an incredibly entertaining flick.",/review/rw7171892/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2018,eve_dolluk,7," Decent Black Comedy Horror
","To be fair this is the best movie Cage has done in years but that's not really saying much now is it. 
Its trashy and silly but its very well done for what it is. Cage Hams it up with his wacko faces and obviously makes it easy looking like a crazed lunatic.
Selma Blair is even creepier as you never know what she is going to do next. ",/review/rw7171892/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2018,gwest-58160,7," So enjoyable. Really underrated.
",I really like this film.,/review/rw7171892/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2018,bhiargoplease,4," Interesting, but Ultimately Confusing.
","When I first watched the trailer, I thought this would be a pretty brainless movie. Given the premise, I thought I'd enjoy a couple of violent shenanigans and feel content with simply that. Unfortunately, Mom and Dad fail to deliver any ending, which leaves even the most uncomplicated movie a confusing mess.",/review/rw7171892/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2018,mofobuss,3," Ummmmm
",Great premise. Had it on my watch list and then was stoked to find it. The movie is going well when - it's over...NO DAMN ENDING!!!!,/review/rw7171892/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2018,swinson,2," I don't get it?
","Great film, loved the action, love the actors (not a Cage fan), but why is it they can never come up with an ending so they just ""cut it"". My suggestion to all those people that think they are super film makers, creating a film is like writing a book, you have to catch your audience in the first paragraph and have a bloody ending. If you can't come up with an ending then don't do the movie.",/review/rw7171892/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2019,sNate87,7," Most people who didn't enjoy this are overthinking it.
","I see a lot of people getting upset that this movie ""didn't have an ending"". Yes, the movie does end with Nic Cage in mid-sentence, but I completely disagree with that. I'll get back to that though (which this does contain major spoilers, I advise not to read anymore of this review until you've watched the film).",/review/rw7171892/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2018,elmoslively,7," Wild and crazy and weird
","Finally, a film for Nick Cage where he can go over the top hysterical and it works! The acting is crazy and the plot just down right absurd, but it actually makes this little low budget time killer fun.",/review/rw7171892/?ref_=tt_urv

15 July 2018,eddie_baggins,5," Crazy Cage is the highlight of this otherwise forgettable event
","It's not often you'd say this about a film that's central premise revolves around parents wanting to hunt down and violently murder their children, but Mom and Dad needed to be a little more crazy and unhinged to make its downright bonkers plot click.",/review/rw7171892/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2018,S_Soma,10," An art-house-like homage to old-time horror. Hits its target perfectly.
","On the face of it, MOM AND DAD is an oddball horror film about parents who suddenly and inexplicably turn into homicidal maniacs but only with respect to their own children.",/review/rw7171892/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2020,btoews,7," Great fun for Horror Fans
",Not bad at all-you have to hand it to Cage-he churns out so many movies and he never seems to sleepwalk through his roles like some big names-he gives it his all every time he is in front of the camera-and Cage has some superb scenes in this one for sure.,/review/rw7171892/?ref_=tt_urv

21 March 2021,jjenk911,7," Don't Think Too Hard About this Movie
","Seriously, don't think too hard to figure out the plot of the movie. When you're a certain age where you hate your parents and your parents want to kill you, then this film is understandable. Just turn your brain off, watch Nic Cage lose this goddamn mind for about 90 minutes, and enjoy.",/review/rw7171892/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2017,Blue-Grotto,6," Bold, Zany and Irreverent
","Imagine if the instinct to nurture suddenly became the impulse to kill?! Parents, through some sort of virus or plague, ruthlessly hunt their offspring. Authorities attempt to stop the carnage, yet they are clueless, ineffective and overpowered. Kids are left to their own wits, resources and improvised weapons from their homes, to fend of the attacks. Love becomes hate and blood lines become blood pools as kids and parents battle to the death. Thanksgiving day dinners and family nights will be awkward from now on.",/review/rw7171892/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2021,K_Rad88,7," so entertaining and a little odd
","Entertaining as hell, love the concept because you don't consider it's parents vs kids, no matter their age.",/review/rw7171892/?ref_=tt_urv
