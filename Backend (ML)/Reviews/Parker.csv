6 March 2022,irnbru-333,8," Turned out to be a high quality drama in all departments
",New six part TV adaptation of Len Deighton's classic spy thriller with the protagonist spy Harry Palmer played so memorably by Michael Caine in the 1965 film.,/review/rw8302278/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2022,yooniverse,9," Excellent spy thriller
","While some may be overly critical of this show by comparing it to the classic 1965 movie, I think this show can stand on its own. I loved the ""vintage"" cinematic look they achieved. They could have done something atrocious as many remakes do, of ""re-imagining"" to the modern era (and they certainly could have--the cold war is back). As this show sets out to be a very different animal than the earlier classic, there's no need to compare.",/review/rw8302278/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2022,a_mobbs,8," Excellent
","I have just seen episode two and this is getting better and better. Hard not to compare to the original, but the leads all do a good job. A slow burner, yes, and not for anyone who lives at a fast pace. But an evolving story, believable characters and on gripping plot. Sit down, bin your phone and watch this.",/review/rw8302278/?ref_=tt_urv

22 June 2022,Sleepin_Dragon,8," Well worth watching.
","I didn't believe my ears when I heard that ITV were going to make this into a six part series, my hopes weren't high, hence why I'm so late to The Party. I'm always happy to eat humble pie, I was very wrong not to watch this, it's a cracking series.",/review/rw8302278/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2022,barryjames-mc,10," Such a brilliant homage, ignore the haters.
","Brilliantly shot, Cole is superb as Harry, the references to the original movie, one of my favourite all time movies, are fantastic. It looks amazing, the scenery, the clothes, it's all just so beautifully done. A great take on Deighton's character, great soundtrack and a wonderful tribute to the original director. I can't understand the haters, is it political? There are shades of modern politics, particularly the far-right Christian fundamentalist American, sounds familiar right? But maybe I'm reading too much into it. Bottom line, this is definitely the best show I've seen this year. Joe Cole is just incredible. All the nonsense about wooden acting is utter rubbish. Give it a chance, it's well worth it.",/review/rw8302278/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2022,HarbingerUK,8," Classic Cold War series - ignore the imdb haters that cannot see past the film
",I have binged this like I haven't for ages. Imdb gives very mixed reviews and compares it to the film a lot. The film is a classic but hasn't really held up to time.,/review/rw8302278/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2022,ShadeGrenade,8," The Ipcress File Reopened
","With the Russian invasion of the Ukraine dominating the world news, ITV have not chosen a good time to screen this much-publicised remake of Len Deighton's 1960's Cold War drama, previously filmed in 1965 with Michael Caine as the bespectacled British spy 'Harry Palmer'. Anyway, I gave it a chance and thought it got off to a decent start. The film also took liberties with the book so once cannot complain about the series following suit. We got to see Palmer in his army days, when he got arrested ( for black marketeering ) and imprisoned, followed by his recruitment by British Intelligence. There was a reason why he was given the task of tracking down enemy agent 'Housemartin' ( Palmer had met him once before ) in order to negotiate the return of the kidnapped atomic scientist Professor Dawson. The executive producers were Steven and Hilary Saltzman, whose late father Harry produced the original franchise. I had feared the series would go down the James Bond road but thankfully that has not happened. The first episode was stylish and kept my attention throughout,. Joe Cole had the tough job of replacing Caine, but worked out well. 'Jean Courtney' , a major character in the film ( Sue Lloyd was terrific ) , benefits greatly from the extra running time. The inclusion of a black American agent isn't a new idea though. Thomas Baptiste played 'Barney' in the first film.",/review/rw8302278/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2022,andrewpeel,9," Fail to understand the dislike
",Have watched the original film several time & read the book. This TV series is excellent and takes a whole new dimension with the characters. Well worth watching. The acting is extremely good. Have to say ITV have done a good job with this one.,/review/rw8302278/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2022,kurtisbeacroft,7," A solid Spy Drama
","I enjoyed every episode, 1960's spy drama done right with great camera, lighting and sound work. The sort of thing the BBC used to make before the agenda driven drivel they roll out nowadays. Good on you ITV.",/review/rw8302278/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2022,aufo-91281,10," I loved the film
",But think this is even better. It perfectly re-creates the time period without being kitchy or a pastiche. I cannot understand the poor reviews. I honestly can't believe they are genuine.,/review/rw8302278/?ref_=tt_urv

","Beautiful adaptation with stunning cinematography, beautiful locations and some wonderful dialogue. A strong cast, with a standout performance from Lucy Boynton as Jean Courtney.",/review/rw8302278/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2022,cwqfck,10," Excellent series, loved it.
","Captures much of the glory from previous historic espionage films. The music is used to enhance and embellish the programmes with some dramatic effects. ( with a slight tip of the cap to John Barry) . The use of light and shade adds to the historic noire of the series, very atmospheric.",/review/rw8302278/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2022,A_Different_Drummer,7," sympathy for the writer
","A writer writes. A novel. When it comes to his novel, the characters, the flow, the exposition, he is God. It is his universe. A film studio buys the rights. A 2 hour movie is made compressing the story and exposition. It is a hit. A star is launched. It is iconic. Time passes. Looking for content, a production company redoes the novel as a miniseries. It has to maintain the vibe in an extended time format and fight the stereotyping of the main character for those who remember. Given the above, this is a competent effort. The two main stars are excellent. Boynton in particular seems more at home in the 60s than those of us who are actually from the 60s. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

12 April 2022,southdavid,6," Palmers Green.
","I've seen the Michael Caine movie a few times, but not for a while and had only a vague recollection as to what its actually about. My thoughts are that there was much in this new ITV adaptation that I didn't recognise at all - though cursory research suggests that this is because a number of subplots and other stories were added to increase the running time.",/review/rw8302278/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2022,baudalaire,9," Comparisons are pointless
","Beautifully done from start to finish. I watched all six episodes in one sitting. Period detail, music, mannerisms, colour-palette and set-dressing are exquisite.",/review/rw8302278/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2022,tim-137-552735,7," The 60s like 60s TV
","I'm not sure about this, and have some scruples about the acting, but for those who have some memories of The Avengers, The Champions and other stylised programmes, then it makes sense. There is also homage to the original film. Lucy Boynton captures the look and spirit of how young women such as Jean Shrimpton and Julie Christie were seen. The camera angles and direction are also straight out of the 60s. This may all be intentional, if not it's a happy accident.",/review/rw8302278/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2022,nimrod-14908,9," Not Michael Caine but totally enjoyable
","Twisting plot, backstabbing and subterfuge. Only the barest hint of the original film and book but it could easily have been written by Len Deighton. Joe Cole is no Miachel Caine and doesn't try to be which is good. He's his own man in this, with a backstory and depth which is lacking in the original film but then, with a full 8 episodes you can add so much more. My only real criticism is that I would have loved for the original film theme tune to have been used.",/review/rw8302278/?ref_=tt_urv

24 March 2022,johnwwwatson,6," Still Love Michael Caine
","Having finished The Ipcress File 2022 Episode 1, I just had to watch my copy of Michael Caine's 1965 The Ipcress File and we know who's is the best but I stress, like the many remakes of Heaven Can Wait, I like Warren Beatty's 1978 because that's my generation as Robert Montgomery's 1941 original ""Here Comes Mr Jordan"" was my grandparent's favorite. If you have never seen Michael Caine cutting his teeth in The Ipcress File 1965, only a year after his first real lead in ""Zulu"" 1964, watch it! That said and repeated, Stop complaining about remakes! The only way to keep a good story alive is to retell it. Let people decide to research and find prior versions. I will be watching each episode of The Ipcress File 2022 because it is a good story!",/review/rw8302278/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2022,skellons,9," Tom Hollander does what he does best...
","Really enjoyed this first episode. Angled shots, great soundtrack and great characters - Cole and Hollander are brilliant. The groundwork for this feels like it was influenced by the remake of 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' - but that isn't a bad thing.",/review/rw8302278/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2022,steveamanda-oates,10," Stylish Thriller
","Binge watched all episodes. Excellent thriller, stylish and atmospheric. Filmed with the quality of a movie and coloured as a reflection of the era in which the series is set. Even the soundtrack takes you back to the great crime dramas of the 60's. Produced by Steven Saltznan, son of Harry (007) and it has the settings and locations we've come to expect from a Bond film. Good acting from all, good script and moves at a pace. Comparable with the original.",/review/rw8302278/?ref_=tt_urv
