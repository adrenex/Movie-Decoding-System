14 January 2023,surajgorti,6," Waltair veerayya - The Sankranthi winner
","While the Sankranthi festival plays a crucial role in the Telugu calanders, so does the movies released in this duration. As everyone's set free and each want themselves to get entertained so, these film enthusiasts prefer watching films in theatre. And the films released are mostly made for the masses so, one cant expect a film with good content. You either have to enjoy the film with the fans or prefer to watch it in the ott.",/review/rw8803219/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2023,RameshJ85,8," Chiru means one emotion. Emotion fulfilled with vintage look
","Muthamestri, Gangleader, JVAS getups superb. He is at 68 now but looks like under 40. Coming to story it's not new story but screenplay and twists reveals at good time. Director justice to Raviteja role as well. I liked the movie very much enjoyed throughout the movie. Few characters doesn't have importance that's ok. Special thanks to DSP for music and BGM. Poonakalu can't be loaded without him. Usually in US can't see much audience in theatres in 2nd week, but I had seen good number of audience for this one. It's enough to show Megastar stamina. Thanks Bobby for presenting Vintage Chiru. Chiru means undescribed emotion.",/review/rw8803219/?ref_=tt_urv

","Vintage chiru is back with ultimate mass movie. I got goosebumps on each and every scene. DSP rocked with BGM. Direction is too nice. Every character has their importance in the movie. As soon as Ravi teja enters movie completely changed its vibe. Chiru entry scene, interval scene and climax are the highlights of the movie. Remembered the old days comedy from shankar dada movie. Great performance by chiru and ravi teja. Direction and BGM is biggest hit to the movie. Action sequence is the best. This movie should be watched within a week of release to get the hype of it. Perfect mass masala for this Sankrathi.",/review/rw8803219/?ref_=tt_urv

","I tempted to the brotherhood sentiment of Mega chiru and Mass raviteja üòÑ I hope 2023 sankranti fest is celebrated in the theatres! Sruthi Hasan again looking in the fighter look, Catherine Tresais also done herself best character. And the main thing is Chiranjivi is not compromised in her character, maintained well! Raviteja give the best action of a police,I think everyone felt very happy at the theatres and chiranjivi again looking like adarivaadu movie style, some dialogues are also beautiful so I hope movie is going to a biggest hit and all the best to babi the director of Waltair Veerayya for the further movies.",/review/rw8803219/?ref_=tt_urv

","Director Bobby Brilliant work. Thanks for being a true fan and quenching thirst of millions of diehard mega fans! Mad ensure every character is justified. Awesome awesome way of showing Megastar Chiranjeevi
Megastar at his vintage best. Raviteja at his versatile best. Bobby at his direction best. DSP music at his BGM best! Should appreciate Director #BobbyKolli garu for never failing the logic in the screenplay even for a moment. Tight screenplay. The way he made Megastar utter the trending memes/jokes is howlarious. Inka Megastar Araachakam Aarambham! Team's confidence justified WaltairVeerayya. Few words about my Boss,
Megastar Chiranjeevi is truly back, he makes you laugh with his antics 80% of the movie and in one scene he makes you cry with his innocence.",/review/rw8803219/?ref_=tt_urv

22 January 2023,srideepsy,10," AMAZING COMEBACK BY CHIRU
","He looks amazing in the movie , especially songs .. the comedy doesn't seem like added track in the film instead it is part of the film . Heroine looks so old and surgery face. I am not sure why they chose her. Anyways if Chiru is in the movie no one cares about heroine, Ravi teja was good, they wasted Nazar charecter. And Prakash Raj is just ok , I would prefer other villans. But the show stopper is Waltair Veerayya dressing in any scene. Congrats to Chiru daughter, she made her mark. Songs are block buster, DSP was in full swing . Poonakalu and Boss party are smashing, others are good to watch, overall a feast to fans and regular audience too,",/review/rw8803219/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2023,chand-suhas,5," Megastar unleashing his vintage form in an underwhelming venture.
",Bobby Kolli being a fan himself of Megastar Chiranjeevi has delivered a thorough fan service with Waltair Veerayya. The writing takes multiple hits badly as most of the efforts has gone into presenting Megastar in his beloved avatar and as expectedly he aces it be it with comedy or intense drama. Mass Maharaja Ravi Teja lends able support in second half but the writing comes to an haphazard halt once his portion end.,/review/rw8803219/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,arjun-echilies,1," Fake rated and another copy story
","When a movie is good, i watch highlights after first time. I couldn't watch it second time. Forget about third time. I felt this is Raviteja's movie and chiranjeevi as side character. Only Ravi teja's part is good in entire movie. Fans only give high rating. If chiranjivi play dual role, it would be a big flop b'coz story is not good. Prakash raj as drug dealing villain is also routine and boring. It can be compared with andarivadu. It is one time watch slow movie. Opening gives hype and after, kept falling like intial plane.",/review/rw8803219/?ref_=tt_urv

14 January 2023,kongecssn,5," Mass Poonakalu and Sankranthi Winner
","This one got back vintage chiru on track. In the first half the intro scene and interval scene was highlight. Most of comedy and scenes worker out in first half. The second half was quite lag. Two fight sequences,some emotional drama and bonding between Raviteja sir and Chiru garu worked pretty well and these things save us from second half of the movie. Songs and its placement was horrible in second half and throughout the movie. Comedy scenes in second half were dull only a few worked. Cinemtography and Production values of the movie is good. At some parts the customer designing is not suitable to the protagonist.",/review/rw8803219/?ref_=tt_urv

Both the stars have gave their best
Mega star Chiranjeevi sir have starred with an excellent role play and a good comeback Ravi Teja the mass maharaja also played a powerful role in the movie
Especially the interval bang gave the movie a very good intensive hype for the 2nd half
Each and every fight gave every one poonakalu Prakash Raj also gave his best in the film
Boss starred with the dance with same grace as of in 1980s As we all of us know Chiru was named as the boss of tollywood film industry and with his grace poonakalu loadeddd.",/review/rw8803219/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2023,surajchatakondu,7," Overall a great entertainer
","Appreciated that Bobby was able to show us the old charismatic chiranjeevi with his dance, comedy timing, dialogues and personality. Raviteja and Chiru combo was well showcased and the movie was kept entertaining throughout. Emotional scenes were done pretty good. I found the initial intro scenes to be quite cringy and over inflated. Like I don't want to see the Indian navy and raw to be undermined as such. Also, the last song of the movie was completely out of context and really spoiled the emotions we carry towards the end. Like most directors, Bobby seemed to have rushed the ending, which was not at all matching the vibe of the whole 2hrs. But after watching the movie, I would definitely recommend people to watch it. Finally, it's a great movie for sankranthi and I hope vintage chiru is back!",/review/rw8803219/?ref_=tt_urv
