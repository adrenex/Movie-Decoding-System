26 February 2002,soonerhokie,," ""Good times, good times""
","I have to say, I really didn't get into this show until A&E started showing it in reruns. I really miss the fact that there are no new shows that will ever come because NBC didn't have the foresight to place it on its Thursday night lineup. In that time slot it would have easily outpaced such dogs as Veronica's closet even without Phil Hartman (I raise my glass to you sir).",/review/rw1411258/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2013,SnoopyStyle,8," Fun gang prematurely ended by real life tragedy
",Dave Nelson (Dave Foley) is the new director of a New York news radio station owned by the eccentric Jimmy James (Stephen Root). Lisa Miller (Maura Tierney) is the producer and romantic lead. Joe Garrelli (Joe Rogan) is the fixer. Bill McNeal (Phil Hartman) and Catherine Duke (Khandi Alexander) are the news readers. Beth (Vicki Lewis) is the irreverent secretary and Matthew Brock (Andy Dick) is the wackiest of them all. ,/review/rw1411258/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2008,Okonh0wp,10," Impeccable ensemble
","Newsradio was the best of the Manhattan-based nondescript workplace comedies that came out in the late 90's (Working, Caroline in the City, the Naked Truth, etc. are more examples). The show had an impeccable ensemble that just came out as more than the sum of their parts. Each of the characters was malleable enough to be able to be thrown into any comic situation and make the plot go along. Highlights included: Phil Hartman as a radio personality who while appearing congenial on the surface is plagued with an incredibly large ego and an incredibly low emotional I.Q; Andy Dick as a spastic reporter who is absolutely useless but is aloud to keep his job for mostly sentimental reason; Joe Rogan is a blue-collar idiot savant; and Vikki Lewis as a ditsy secretary who's loyal to her boss but unapologetic about her dress or any of her other faults. Dave Foley, as the office boss, and Maura Tierny, as the smartest and most ambitious member of the staff, who has a secret office romance with him, ignite a screwball comedy for the ages (not to mention the hilarious sexual tension that arose out of that single sort-of-date between Joe Rogan and Khandi Alexander's characters). Throw in Stephen Root is the least sensible boss in TV history, yet somehow the most successful, and you've got quite a show.",/review/rw1411258/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2000,Op_Prime,," NBC cancelled this?
","NewsRadio was an excellent and clever show, yet it was cancelled while shows like Suddenly Susan (which when you really think about it rips off NewsRadio) got to continue. What's with that? Granted, the series never recovered from the loss of Phil Hartman, but NewsRadio was still good and way better than other shows on NBC or any other networks. The cast was great, especially Phil Hartman. Jon Lovitz was not as good as Phil Hartman, but he was a good replacement and funny. My favorite episode would be the one where Bill gets a piano and sings hilarious songs about the government and Dave keeps trying to stop him. Hilarious. NBC, cancelling this series makes you the dumbest network in the world without a doubt. And with a network like Fox around, that saying something.",/review/rw1411258/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 1999,Juliet-8,," One of the greatest TV shows the 90's has ever seen...
","NewsRadio has to be one of the most wittiest television sitcoms the 90's has to offer. Every character is wonderfully written and hilariously portrayed by a cast of excellent actors. Dave Foley, from Kids in the Hall, is great at playing the dead pan and sarcastic new boss ""Dave."" And of course Phil Hartman and Andy Dick steal the show as a great combination of stand up and slapstick. This show is one of the funniest ever!",/review/rw1411258/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2002,coase,," Brilliant!
","Newsradio was a fish out of water. In a time of oversexed young white sitcoms, Newsradio relied on brilliant writing, expert character development, and excellent plots to drive it along. No gimmicks needed. Each character had a role to fill, and they filled it well. All of the cast members are excellent, with no misfires. Everyone has classic episodes they like to talk about.",/review/rw1411258/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2002,TeamECK,," One of the greatest and most underrated shows ever
","A true classic, one of the funniest shows in the history of television. It's a shame that Phil Hartman passed away, which basically was the beginning of the end.  I can understand why they tried a fifth season, but it wasn't the same.  Newsradio was smart, funny and had an amazing cast from top to bottom.  A&E airs reruns daily from 8-9 am, and 2-3 pm.  Definitely worth a look, you'll not be disappointed.",/review/rw1411258/?ref_=tt_urv

29 October 1998,sting-13,," At this point ""Newsradio"" is one of the top three shows on tv
","""Newsradio"" is possibly the freshest comedy left on television in 1998. The chemistry between the cast members remains at a high level, even after the unfortunate passing of Phil Hartman. To this point of the fifth season Jon Lovits has stepped in and done a great job as Max. I salute NBC for not giving up on this fine show just because it's not in the top twenty each week. Someone at the network obviously still feels there should be SOME quality programing on television.",/review/rw1411258/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2002,wolf008,," Classic all the way
","NewsRadio is probably the most underrated comedies of the 90's. The writers gave us a more sophisticated brand of comedy lacking in many of the sitcoms of today. It spared the viewer of cheap gags and absurd sexual humor seen in most sitcoms. The cast consisted of an excellent ensemble, and gave us some very memorable moments.",/review/rw1411258/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2003,rbverhoef,," Fine TV show
","'NewsRadio' is a sitcom about the co-workers on a radio station named WNYX. Dave Foley, Stephen Root, Joe Rogan, Vicki Lewis are very funny. Andy Dick as Matthew adores Bill McNeal (Phil Hartman) and they have the funniest scenes. Lisa Miller (Maura Tierney) is very beautiful and of course very funny as well.",/review/rw1411258/?ref_=tt_urv

",I can't believe I'm the first person to write about this gem!  I didn't discover it until after Phil Hartman had been killed and the show was in it's final year.  A friend forced me to watch the late-night reruns; I was and am forever hooked.,/review/rw1411258/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 1998,mj-16,," Very funny, great comedy!!
","News Radio is a brilliant 90's television show. It's a great comedy, great actors, and is flexible (has many different forms of comedy) Never boring or dull. Once I started watching, I couldn't stop. I never miss it! Get it on your TV screen NOW!",/review/rw1411258/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2010,Aaron1375,9," Funny show that I feel never really overcame the death of Phil Hartman.
","I do not wish to disparage Jon Lovitz, it has less to do with the introduction of his character that the show kind of fell apart at the end for me and more for the fact it just sort of depressing after the untimely death of Hartman. Bill McNeil was my favorite character on the show and while everyone else played their parts well it just was not the same without him. Before he passed on though this show was simply great and funny, though I have to say work related shows tend to be better in my opinion than shows that center around families and simply friends. The shows first episode is rather interesting as there are a couple of different things going on as the maintenance man is different and the whole appearance of the show was a bit off compared to the rest too. Still, it marked the beginning of a very good show that was cut short by most likely to many schedule changes and those copy cat shows that tried to emulate the early success of this one. That show Brooke Shields did during this time seemed almost a duplicate right down to the red head. The episodes in this one ran mostly hot, with the occasional cold episode. Most of the cast was on fire, however Andy Dick's character sometimes proved to be a bit to much. Khandi Alexander left a bit of void when she left, however the show probably had to many characters as it was so it probably was best she left as the show had enough people to focus on. My favorite episode though had to be when Dave got obsessed with playing that video game Stargate and I also like the one where Bill is locked up in the loony bin and Jon Lovitz was in that one too and did a good job. All in all a great show that ended prematurely.",/review/rw1411258/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2002,Krishnan-3,10," off the wall humour
",The great thing about this show was that it was not based off a long plot line - each show was almost stand alone.. there were no continious plot lines and were just fun. I certainly enjoyed the sometimes far-reaching plot lines for a good 22 minutes of non serious off the wall entertainment.,/review/rw1411258/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 1999,Cindy-39,," most brilliant sitcom ever made
","You know those studies we hear about that say network television viewership has gone down since the increase of cable channels and the internet? Well, the real reason why nobody watches network TV anymore is because they make idiotic programming choices such as cancelling NewsRadio!  And for the record, NewsRadio came before all these other uninspired, lame workplace comedies of the last couple of years.  Thank goodness the show lives on in syndication, where we can witness the brilliance of the second and third seasons.  NewsRadio also had the most underappreciated (and underpaid) ensemble cast -- Dave Foley, Phil Hartman, Stephen Root, Andy Dick, Vicki Lewis, Maura Tierney, Joe Rogan, and Khandi Alexander -- each hilarious in their own right.  Fairly unique to the show were the sight gags, physical comedy, and surrealist plots -- all rare these days. Seriously, the writing was always consistent and brilliant.  There are hundreds of great quotes from NewsRadio; everyone has their own personal favorites.  Here are a couple of mine:",/review/rw1411258/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2002,Bob__Loblaw,10," a Pox on the neilson ratings
","Brilliant, beautiful and hilarious.  Three ingredients that usually lead to early cancelation.  Very few shows with those qualities seem to last long.  Sadly,  this show did not. Ratings hardly ever represent true quality.   The death of Phil Hartman was horrible.  He fleshed out and brought depth to one of the best characters (Bill McNeal) in tv history. Jon Lovitz did a good job, but he was not able to bring the same richness that Phil Hartman did.  The rest of the actors were also incredible.     ",/review/rw1411258/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2000,mystic80,8," A groundbreaking show unlike any other show
","Newsradio is brilliant in every way and every sense.  It isn't a run of the mill sitcom filled with dumb actors saying dumb one liners.  Each member of the cast contributes something to the show that makes it so great.  I have yet to miss a Newsradio show and tape as many as possible.  The cast members are brilliant.  It's creator, Paul Simms is obviously a gifted man. It's a really good thing Newsradio lives on in syndication.  Newsradio is groundbreaking in the sense that it's new and refreshing.  It completely eradicates the predictability of any other show with it's quick wit.  I really think NBC has proven how dumb they can be by canceling such an incredible show.  Phil Hartman's arrogant Bill McNeil will live on in syndication as he was one of the greatest character actors ever.  I don't understand how the crap NBC has on now manages to stay yet Newsradio got the boot.  Newsradio is definitely one of the smartest shows of the nineties.",/review/rw1411258/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2003,DaveHasNoTimeForAnyOfThisBull,9," ""NewsRadio"" is Funny
","I can't think of a better four seasons of comedy than from early 1995 to 1998 of NewsRadio.  All of the actors were funny.  Phil Hartman, Dave Foley, Maura Tierney, Joe Rogan, and so on.  I personality hate ER for turning Maura into a dry soap opera star on their overrated, irritable program for shut-ins.  When it comes down to it, I'm glad that ""NewsRadio"" did not become a repetitive tv program like ER.  So therefore, it was a good thing that it was cancelled after 5 great seasons.  The 5th one wasn't as good as the others but it ended the series.  Brad Rowe, Jeanne Gorofalo, Mike MacDonald, and Lauren Graham all got their starts from this show.  That's to name just a few.  If it hadn't been for this show, those people would have nothing to their credit now.  To summarize, ""News Radio"" rules and ER SUCKS!",/review/rw1411258/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 1999,Boon,," If you don't laugh with this show, you'll never laugh.
","I have been watching this show about 7 months now and by far It is my absolute favorite show on TV. I originally hated ""NewsRadio"" and would be disappointed when it came on, but after I gave it a chance by watching the old episodes with the late Phil Hartman, I never miss it. I have seen my own mother in tears over this show laughing out loud. I myself don't believe a show has ever made me laugh this hard. So if any of the cast and crew is reading this, keep it up, we love it!",/review/rw1411258/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2002,Xploitedyouth,," Brilliant
","One of the most underrated shows on television, NEWSRADIO was consistently hilarious, smart, and above all, quirky. The bizarre characters are undeniably lovable, and the comedic actors are always at the top of their game.  Even a few gimmick episodes, like the TITANIC spoof and the outer space episode, don't take themselves too seriously.  Most memorably of all was the heartbreaking tribute to Phil Hartman after his tragic death.  The show didn't try to dodge his death of write around it.  It confronted the issue and let his friends remember him as he probably would have liked. Overall, a brilliant show.",/review/rw1411258/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 1999,Matt M.,10," Best of the 90's
","It's a pity that NBC is taking this show off the air. There is no doubt, that next to Seinfeld, ""NewsRadio"" is the funniest sitcom of the decade: full of quips, one-liners, and wonderful characterization.",/review/rw1411258/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2001,Cerberus666,," ""All this can be yours, if you bow down and worship me.""
","The most underrated TV show ever and probably the best of the 90's. That said, I don't berate NBC for pulling it because it was never going to be the same without Hartman...Phil is a God and I'm praying for his resurrection! Anyway, don't take my word for it, so far 45 IMDb users have commented on NewsRadio and not one slating, 45:0 the highest IMDb ratio ever?",/review/rw1411258/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2001,thisisaj-2,," ROTTEN DEAL!
","NewsRadio, as many others have said, is one of the best shows ever to be on tv.  The ensemble works well, however I have one quibble: why was Matthew given so much screen time and Catherine not?  Matthew is fine in small doses but when you put too much of him in an episode it kinda ruins it.  Anyway, curse NBC!",/review/rw1411258/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2006,tvnutboy,8," The last of the Smart TV Comedies of the 1990s
","I originally watched ""Newsradio"" for one reason only, (1 1/2 if you count Andy Dick) because I've been a fan of Phil Hartman when he was previously on SNL. That was all I watched the show for. Then when he died, I tried to give the Jon Lovitz Episodes a chance, but by then it just turned into just another ""sitcom"" (Though it could be argued that it was leaning in that direction regardless of whether it was with or without Phil.) Having rediscovered this show on DVD years later, I realize that this is a perfect ensemble show that gets a little goofy on purpose. What ""Arrested Development"" was for this Decade, ""Newsradio"" was for the 90s and the quality holds up to this day.",/review/rw1411258/?ref_=tt_urv
