29 July 2019,HotToastyRag,6," Unfairly criticized
","I'll never forget reading about the making of 1492: Conquest of Paradise in my beloved biography Depardieu. Gérard, set to play Christopher Columbus in Ridley Scott's epic, studied English with a private tutor for months before filming, to try and wean him away from his famous accent. Then, during the scene when he learns of his voyage's destination, he storms through the room and declares, ""My God! We leave in two weeks!"" When you watch that scene, you'll find it hard to believe he worked so hard to take away his accent, since he sounds exactly like he always does. But, since I love him, I don't really care. To any critics, I offer the challenge to them to try and become fluent in a foreign language without any trace of an American accent, all in front of a movie camera.",/review/rw0302536/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2002,OttoVonB,7," On Creating Worlds
","1492 casts a long shadow over my filmgoing life. It is one of the first films I remember seeing where I started thinking of all the activity that went into making a film. My young mind did not process a lot of the plot - and in retrospect I can partly blame the makers of this film - but I did notice shots, sounds, music. Perhaps the music more than anything.",/review/rw0302536/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2007,mid-levels,2," Ridiculously inaccurate
","The real story of Columbus is an adventure story with plenty of plot twists and interesting characters. So there was no need to fabricate history in this film. We have Columbus' journals that tell us what happened when he landed in the new world and the events that followed. This film set an agenda to make Columbus out to be a visionary who against the odds made good and the only problem was that everyone else didn't have his insight. Ridiculous! Columbus did something quite amazing in sailing to the new world but that doesn't mean that he didn't have serious flaws. For one, in the film he speaks about a ""New World"" but Columbus died believing he actually had found a passage to Asia so for him there was nothing new about it. The first encounter with the natives is also ridiculous in the film. In Columbus' journal we see that naked villagers came out onto the beach and that Columbus claimed the land for Spain and then took out his sword and tested the natives' knowledge of weapons. They had none and Columbus actually cut them. In the movie, Columbus is just walking through the jungle and he is approached by hostile natives ready to fire their arrows at him. He tells his men who are about to open fire to stop and that they must act peacefully. So Columbus becomes the peacemaker when in reality the natives were peaceful and he drew his sword on them. There are tons of these moments in the movie that make this movie a joke in terms of history. If directors are going to use real historical figures they need to represent them accurately. If they want to imagine or reimagine the colonial experience then they should use fictional characters.",/review/rw0302536/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2019,arthur_tafero,6," Better Than Average Epic - 1492: Conquest of Paradise
","This film is not completely historically accurate, although it is fairly true to events. Some omissions are Columbus' mistress by which he had a second son, which is not even mentioned in the film, which tends to paint Columbus almost as a saintly figure. He was far from that. In addition to his infidelity, he was an advocate of Indian slavery, which is not mentioned in the film as well. Those miscues aside, the film is gorgeously shot, well-directed and acted, and the sense of the realities of the royal court appear to be fairly accurate. The film also fails to mention that Columbus took Indian prisoners away from their homes back to Spain against their will. The film is quite engaging, otherwise.",/review/rw0302536/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2017,filipemanuelneto,4," Historically inaccurate, despite the cinematographic grandeur.
","This film seeks to show the journey in which Christopher Columbus allegedly discovered America. About this there is a lot of historical controversy and its very difficult to be sure if the true discoverer was him, Amerigo Vespucci or the Portuguese João Vaz Corte-Real (who seems to have explored the Canadian coast twenty years before Columbus's voyage). There are also doubts about the origins of Columbus. Some think he was Castilian and not Italian, others think he was from Sardinia, others claim that he was born in Portugal. But the film does not explore these controversies, remaining faithful to the canonical version of the facts: a Genoese navigator who discovers America to Castile. But even so the film makes mistakes. Columbus was an adventurer and not a man in search of a dream, and the Castilian kings only allowed themselves to finance him because they had information that already had given as probable the existence of new lands in the region that Columbus wanted to explore. Thus, the navigator died believing that he had arrived in Asia and only later navigation's determined to be a new continent. Everything I've said here throws out some ideas of the film and proves that the writer made a serious mistake by completely ignoring the navigator's travel diaries and basic facts of his biography, not restraining himself from inventing when he pleased, under the argument of creative freedom that, even in a movie, should not justify all that the screenwriter invents. Okay, it's a movie and not a documentary, but if it's a historical fact there should still be some rigor in the way it's portrayed. The interpretation of Depardieu is not bad, but the accent was something that he messed up a bit. The way the Indians were portrayed also seems incorrect and stereotyped. Even so, the film is worth it because its cinematically beautiful, has almost epic scenes and depicts very well the effort and daring of those who ventured across the seas. One thing I cannot fail to point out: the extraordinary soundtrack of Vangelis, which has become an icon of music for cinema.",/review/rw0302536/?ref_=tt_urv

4 February 2020,davidmvining,7," A visionary struggles to make the vision a reality
","This would make a really interesting lower half of a double bill with Terrence Malick's The New World. They're pretty explicitly about the same theme, finding paradise on Earth only for it to slip through the characters' fingers as they reach out to reclaim it, but the idea is approached very differently across the two films. The New World is the poetic version, and 1492: Conquest of Paradise is the more literal minded (but still visually sumptuous) take by Ridley Scott. It's not nearly as successful as The New World, but I do think there's quite a bit to like in Scott's take on Christopher Columbus.",/review/rw0302536/?ref_=tt_urv

27 November 2005,damienmuldoon,10," probably my favourite movie ever
","In 1992, the 500th anniversary of Columbus's arrival in the New World was marked with a deluge of movies, documentaries and T.V. dramas. Not only is this the best of those commemorative re-tellings, it is also a lesson in how good historical movies should be made. Ridley Scott's direction and Gerard Depardu's leading performance gives us a genuine feeling of what must have faced Columbus and his crew as they set off on a voyage that, in their time, was more dangerous than space travel. This movie does more than tell their story however. It recreates an epoch in a way that few other historical dramas ever have. Fifteenth century Spain is every bit as vivid as the unchartered jungles of Latin America. And it is a testament to Scott's skill as a director that he beautifully contrasts the splendor of Queen Isabella's court with the insect infested, monsoon ridden ""New World"". And yet we also see that while the hand of civilization has made Isabella's Spain so resplendent, it has also tainted it with corruption. No such corruption exists in the virgin forests of San Slavador. Not until the European's arrive that is.",/review/rw0302536/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2005,dentonsfarm,10," The Best Columbus Film Ever Made
","Ridley Scott's masterpiece, 1492: A Conquest of Paradise, is a visually compelling film and well acted. Those who gave low viewer ratings in the viewer comments obviously do not see the beauty of epic films. Epics are supposed to be kind of lengthy. It is, to me, the best depiction of Columbus I have ever seen. True, the lead actor is a Frenchman, but if you set that aside you can see that he looks and acts like what one would picture Columbus to be. Durring the sailing scenes it almost made you feel as though you were sailing along with Columbus. I think that the people who are down on the historical accuracies and ""inaccuracies"" of this film do not cease to realize that Columbus was out for more than spices from India but also a conquest to spread the Gospel to the people of the Far East. The other inaccuracies of the film have only been brought to light years after the films release. They discovered that Columbus was probably not from Genova.",/review/rw0302536/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2010,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,7," I will not be told what to be afraid of
","I honestly don't know everything about the history of the events that this is about, but from what I understand, this is almost entirely accurate, with only a handful of relatively minor mistakes or changes for cinematic quality. This comes off as very authentic. You are expected to know the basic background of what happens to fully follow this. This is mostly fair and objective, showing a great deal of respect for the Indians, their culture and beliefs. If it is black and white in any way, it is in the depiction of the Catholic church, which only has negative aspects revealed here. This is not unusual for Scott; look to Kingdom of Heaven, for example. While there are a couple of ""villains""(the nobility and the representations of Christianity, of course), the characters are largely credible, well-developed and distinguish themselves. Several of them, including the Queen, are strong and memorable, as well. Weaver plays the role well, making a lasting impression with not that extensive screen-time. The acting in general is good, with several performances being excellent. Depardieu is spot-on. The cast is well-chosen. Wincott is fun to watch, as always. This is dramatic, if some of it is a tad forced and/or awkward. The score is arguably often over the top and too bombastic. FX are nice for the time this was made. The production values are high. This can be tense. The action takes up less than a fifth of the running time, and varies; however, at its best, it is engaging and exciting. There is a bit of disturbing(at times disgusting) brutal violence in this. I recommend this to anyone who wants a solid retelling. 7/10",/review/rw0302536/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2003,gayromeo2000,10," a good movie
","I think this movie got a score it doesn't deserve. First of all the story is about an adventurer who discovered America and who was rejected the honour for his efforts, it is all in the movie. It shows how Columbus went from being a hero to a nobody, it was his sons who had to fight for his honor after his death. The movie really presents this perfectly, all from Columbus' dreams until after he discovered America, got mocked and became a laughing stock. So this is not the typical hero movie you have seen, but it is rather true to its real story, at least as true as you can get in a movie lasting 2 hours from a story which goes over a period of 30 years out of an extraordinary man's life. The other movie made the same year about Columbus was more the typical hero movie, where it ended when Columbus discovered America. And the music in this movie is so good, it catches the moods in this movie so great, this music is as perfect to its story as the music in 2001. I want to recommend people to see this movie again and this time with another view, and try to remember what their seeing.",/review/rw0302536/?ref_=tt_urv

","This interesting film deals with Christopher Columbus' discovery of the Americas and the effect this has on the indigenous people . 500 years ago , Spain was a nation gripped by fear and superstition. Centuries before the exploration of space, there was another voyage into the unknown . Ruled by the crown and a ruthless inquisition that persecuted men for daring to dream. One man named Christopher Colombus (Gerard Depardieu) challenged this power . Following the theories of Marino De Tiro and Toscanelli and driven by his sense of destiny , he left his lover Beatriz (Angela Molina) and crossed the sea of darkness in search of honor , gold and the greater glory of God . He discovers America along with Martin Alonso Pinzon (Tcheky Karyo) and sets off on various voyages . In 1502 Columbus sailed with his son Fernando on his last travel to the New World . They landed in Panama where the Indians revealed to them the existence of a new sea , the Pacifican Ocean . The biography that Fernando (Loren Dean) wrote about his father restored the name of Columbus to its place in history, but the glory had been taken by also Italian Americo Vespuccio . In 1992 , his descendant Christopher Columbus is an Admiral in the Royal Spanish Navy . Life has more imagination that we carry in our dreams .",/review/rw0302536/?ref_=tt_urv

","Christopher Columbus - THE DISCOVERY (1992) Warner Brothers opened in theaters same time as this film ""1492"". Viewed ""1492"" film again on Hulu for this holiday (Columbus Day 2017). I prefer ""DISCOVERY FILM"" for a number of reasons. At film's end Columbus is hero having completed first voyage successfully and long before things went wrong in Haiti (La Espaniola). ""1492"" film goes beyond first voyage up to his Third, next to last voyage. Things were truly as bad as depicted in second film. This is shown clearly in the manuscripts of his son Fernando. Fernando's book actually shows things were worse than shown in film. Both films were box office disappointments. However,year 1992 critics seemed to like ""1492"" film better. It shows Columbus as a victim, failure and basically a ""schmuck"". This may be why Europeans view Columbus in a good light. In the USA he seems to get little credit......but all the blame.",/review/rw0302536/?ref_=tt_urv

","This was a thoroughly enjoyable movie. There are many coming out today that capture me and hold my complete attention for two hours. But, this one does. It is most importantly punctuated by excellent acting by an all-star cast. What disappointed me about the film was its liberties with history. The film does not capture just how close the crew of the Pinta came to mutiny. It was a far more dangerous moment than the film gives it credit. Second, is the Island of San Salvador. The San Salvador of the film is a myth. It is a typical small (60 miles circumference) with the standard Bahamian out island vegetation of scrub brush and small trees that have been the indigenous flora for millions of years. Instead, in the film, Columbus discovers a tropical jungle with semi-friendly natives and an ""Eden"" on Earth. There is also no source of potable water on San Salvador, so there is no chance of a human population on the island. Plus, the explorers were seen dodging giant tree snakes, when there have never been any snake species in the Bahamian chain. The island of ""San Salvador"" is more like the real densely tropical islands of the Caribbean hundreds of miles to the South,, which Columbus did later explore. ",/review/rw0302536/?ref_=tt_urv

","What this weak movie brought home to me was the importance of a good script. Two days previously I rewatched The Mission, a masterpiece about European contact with the indigenous people of the Americas. The Mission has wonderful actors, inspired cinematography and a classic score, but what enables them all to synergise is Robert Bolt's intelligent, sensitive and beautiful script. It fills the film with radiance. By contrast, the script for 1492 is unbelievably poor, pedestrian to the last degree. I wonder that Ridley Scott allowed himself to be saddled with it. OK, Depardieu's English is not great, but from the start you can see that this fine actor can do nothing with these lines. Nor can Weaver and the others.

Further, there is not a single mention of the name Hispaniola (or La Española) in the film. The dramatic scene of landfall at Guanahaní is ruined by the appearance of the island. Watling Island is low and scrub covered, not hilly and forested. The birds on the island and the fauna are more proper of Costa Rica. The scene of the death of a crewmember from a snake bite is a comical sham. Not only were are there no poisonous snakes in the Caribbean, there are no snakes at all on Watling.
