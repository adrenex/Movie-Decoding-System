7 September 1999,TxMike,," Four adults, lots of money, no one else knows, oh what to do?
","""A Simple Plan"" immediately reminds you of ""Fargo"". A dull, snowy winter. Men beginning to cheat on a small scale, which then begins to escalate until it becomes out of control. And no one will *like* the ending, but it is the only ending that could make this fine film complete.",/review/rw0436049/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2009,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,8," At what cost?
","Say what you will about him, like him or hate him, you gotta admit that Raimi knows the craft. Here, he puts Hitchcock's methods to good use, decades after the master died, and creates amounts of suspense that honor his memory. The tension is thick and impossible to ignore. This is exciting and engaging, and it's completely realistic, down to earth and human, to boot. The pace is spot-on, this never outruns the viewer, in spite of being fast and tight, and so much of the relationships and past being told to us through hints, the behaviour and how situations evolve. More thrillers should be like this. This also qualifies as noir and drama. The acting is beyond reproach, there's not a single performance that is lacking, and I'd say Paxton does pretty good in a lead role. Kudos to Thornton for not turning his part into a caricature. The writing is excellent. I have not read the novel, but I would like to do so. I understand that this isn't entirely as brutal as the book, though it is disturbing, and, at times, violent. The cinematography and editing are incredible. There is some strong language in this. The story is magnificent, and develops so well throughout. Thank you, Sam, for making an effort, for not just going for the lowest common denominator, and for understanding that it was the build-up - not purely the plot twist at the end - that made Alfred, and his films, such treasure. The DVD holds a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to any fan of the director and/or anyone else who helped create it. 8/10",/review/rw0436049/?ref_=tt_urv

","Two brothers & a friend from a small town in Minnesota (Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton and Brent Briscoe) happen upon a crashed plane in the woods, which contains over $4 million in cash. They assume it's drug money and hatch a simple plan to sit on the money until spring when the plane is discovered; if no one legitimately claims it they'll divvy it up.

17 August 1999,Rumples,8," Dark and twisted - classy
","This is not a pleasant film and you are going to have to think a little - if this doesn't sound like your type of movie, stay away! If, however, you like intelligent and peculiar film-making, then you'll probably appreciate A Simple Plan. In an effort somewhat reminiscient of Fargo meets Shallow Grave, this clever, dark, character drama explores some unpleasant ground to produce a quirky and distrubing overall result. I must admit I finished this movie feeling rather unpleasant, but struck by its intellect and striking dialogue and performances. This movie is definitely worth the price of a video.

4 January 1999,lordrob,9," Twisted, but exceptionally crafted.
","This is not the film to see if you're looking for a feel-good Hollywood anesthetic to cope with the end of the holiday season. If, however, you wish to experience a great film, then I highly recommend *A Simple Plan*. Its disturbing twist on the American dream may be too difficult for some--especially the very dark ending--but that is part of what makes the film such quality fare. Scott B. Smith's screenplay is tight and flawless. Sam Raimi's inspired direction may finally reveal to the rest of the film industry what fans of the Evil Dead trilogy have known for years: that, though his tongue is often firmly in his cheek, Raimi is a fine and grossly underrated filmmaker. Especially impressive is the way he and cinematographer Alar Kivilo approach the snow-covered landscapes. There is an immensity to the frozen wastelands of the film's crucial scenes that is almost worthy of David Lean. Also commendable is Raimi's skillful use of animals (among them crows and foxes) for symbolic purposes.",/review/rw0436049/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2000,bandguy,," A study in desperation
","A Simple Plan is certainly not a simple film, as some reviewers here had hoped it would be.  The point is not how simple life is, but how horribly wrong and out of control things can get.  This film takes you to the absolute depths of human greed, desperation, and frailty.  It is amazing how many evil deeds one can rationalize by believing ""and then it will all be over.""  A Simple Plan is a great character study which makes you think of what you would do in the same situation.  At what point would you draw the line?  How far would you go to keep millions of dollars all to yourself? The excellent photography adds to the sense of desperation that permeates the whole film.  The vast, snowbound landscape is the perfect image for the feelings the main characters have for their station in life: cold, silent, lifeless, unending, and unrelenting.",/review/rw0436049/?ref_=tt_urv

27 December 2009,Samiam3,7," The Fargo of the year
","Sam Raimi may be most at home with Horror, but his body of work in the last three decades has encompassed a variety of genres, the most intellectual of which is drama. One could argue that a Simple Plan is Raimi's smartest picture but it is not a film where we see any of his distinct auteurism. Equal credit for the film's reasonable competence goes to novelist Scott Smith, adapting his own novel for the screen.",/review/rw0436049/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2000,Quinoa1984,10," A good solid thriller
","Scott B. Smith's A Simple Plan puts Sam Raimi back in my book (I forgot about him for a while after he did EVil Dead and part 2) by giving a good solid thriller that can sometimes be interpreted by some as a very dark comedy.  The plot (I think already stated) has 2 brothers and a friend in a winter setting, who find a plane, a plane that can change they're lives (chiching), but the cost, is something they don't even know they are going to bear.  Sometimes the characters make dumb choices, but that atually makes it entertaining.  The best surprise however is Billy Bob Thornton's performance because he is always good in anything he does.  Good film for Raimi to have, and for the cast also.  A-",/review/rw0436049/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 1999,baumer,9," Simply brilliant
","A Simple Plan is a film that had immense critical acclaim yet was in limited release.  I was eagerly looking forward to this films release seeing as I am a huge Bill Paxton fan, but why wasn't this film in wide release?  I was living in Toronto at the time and to find this film I had to go downtown to one very small art house theater.  It wasn't at any of the bigger Silver City's.  And that is a disappointment.  Because this film is amazing.  In a way ( I can't believe I'm saying this ) this film reminds me a bit of Star Wars.  Only in the sense that I think there is enough intrigue and well developed characters that you could have made a trilogy and prequels out of this.  Jacob could have a whole movie made about him.  The characters are that rich.",/review/rw0436049/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2010,Hitchcoc,8," When Bad Things Happen to Idiots
","I don't normally get squeamish about film, but this one was hard for me to watch. I knew pretty much what was going to happen. It just hurt to watch it. The plot begins with a couple of local yokels and a brother and friend, coming upon a crashed plan in the snow and finding millions of dollars. I live in rural Minnesota and that place looked like a hundred I've seen. Of course, they had that moment of ""should we turn this in?"" or ""Should we keep it for ourselves."" One look at two of these guys and there is no question which direction it's going to go. The key element is that the ""sensible"" one sets up a scheme by which they can put off spending the money and all be rich...at a future time. We all know what's coming. The movie is about the relationship among these three and what happens to them as a result of their simple plan. There's that old saying, ""Three can keep a secret if two of them are dead,"" or something like that. How this movie plays out is satisfying but so hurtful to watch. In essence, we kind of like these guys. They each have their own issues, for some just plain stupidity. I gritted my teeth and watched, but I can't get it out of my thoughts.",/review/rw0436049/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 1999,Arkaan,10," Superb, flawless examination of greed (spoilers inside)
","""You work for the American dream, you don't steal it"" Bill Paxton says in the film, and that line rings true until the very end.  The plot is simple. Three men find 4.4 million dollars, and decide to keep it.  From than on, they remain tied to each other in a crime, yet they see it as ""finding lost treasure"".  As soon as Jacob and Hank kill Stevenson, they are in even deeper.  ",/review/rw0436049/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2004,MovieAddict2016,," A Great Movie...
","""If you found four million dollars, would you keep it or turn it in?"" a  character asks his wife in ""A Simple Plan,"" which documents the events  of two men who choose to do what everyone always says they wouldn't do  but probably really would if they were given the chance.  What chance? A chance to take four million bucks, without anyone  knowing who took it, or even that it was taken at all. It's just a  simple plan for a simple event. But simple plans can be disastrous, as  ""A Simple Plan"" tells us, in which two brothers named Hank (Bill  Paxton) and Jacob (Billy Bob Thornton) discover a duffel bag full of  $4,400,000 in a crashed plane sitting out in the middle of an abandoned  nature preserve. Do they turn it in? Keep it? In a moment of weakness,  they choose to do the latter.  Hank's wife, Sarah (Bridget Fonda), is supportive of their decision.  She even tells Hank to return some of the money to the plane, to cover  their tracks. When Hank does this, it results in the death of a nosy  neighbor on a snowmobile. Soon this tragic chain of events slides into  even more murder and cover ups as one of Jacob's close friends and his  wife die, in short, because of Hank and his brother.  The town Chief of Police, Carl, suspects that something fishy is going  on. And when an FBI agent comes to town searching for the plane, Hank  has to face the facts that the man may not be from the FBI, but instead  might be one of two brothers whose ransom money was lost in the plane  crash.  The film reminds me of the Coen Brothers' amazing ""Fargo"" in many  different ways. Most noticeable is the landscape, as well as the  quirkiness of the film that lends a realistic tone to it. Also is the  spiraling downfall of the characters -- the events trigger one tragic  circumstance after another, eventually turning into murder and  double-crossing and greed.  Billy Bob Thornton turns in another great performance here as Jacob,  the lonely guy who has never kissed a girl but fondly remembers the day  that he held hands with a high school babe. His plan is to buy back the  family farm that his father once maintained. But underneath Jacob's  exterior is a heart with little armor. ""I feel evil,"" he says to Hank  after lying to the police about the death of his friend.  Hank, played by Bill Paxton, is the prime example of how greed can  corrupt a man. When they find the money, it is Hank's firm belief to  turn in the cash and report the plane to the police. He is convinced to  keep the cash, since it's probably dirty drug money. Soon he is the man  who is interested in the money more than anyone else. And by the very  end of the film, we realize that sometimes people do the worst things  for something they can never even have.  Paxton is one of our greatest actors, his credits ranging back to the  days of ""The Terminator"" (1984) and ""Aliens"" (1986). He's in most of  James Cameron's films, including those two mentioned before and  ""Titanic"" and ""Ghosts of the Abyss."" He's not exactly one of mainstream  Hollywood's brightest stars, but here he proves that he can turn in a  better performance than some of the highest paid actors (*cough*, Tom  Cruise, *cough*) in cinema history.  The last fifteen minutes of ""A Simple Plan"" are tense, exciting and  unnerving. This is the type of movie where the hero knows the bad guy  is next to him, leading him towards his own death, but can't say  anything because then everyone will know that he committed a crime  himself. He has to pretend that he doesn't know the bad guy is a bad  guy. He has to pretend that everything is all right, even when he's  being led into a trap. And when the so-called FBI agent, Hank, Carl and  Jacob split up in the woods to search for the plane, I primed myself  for what was to come.  Is this the type of movie where the hero dies or lives? I won't ruin  the surprise. But I think the ending is entirely more meaningful than  it could have been if Sam Raimi, the director, had chosen a different  route. This is one of the best films of the past decade, and certainly  one of the most important.  4.5/5 stars.  - John Ulmer",/review/rw0436049/?ref_=tt_urv

Horror is my favorite genre and while this isn't a ""horror"" flick it is still pretty damn horrifying.  Two things drew me to this movie.  Billy Bob Thornton was the first.  I have followed his career steadily since he gained recognition with Sling Blade and the man has not let me down.  Second reason, Sam Raimi.  He is an icon among horror film buffs and up and coming film students.  The Evil Dead trilogy showcased his talents with the brilliant camera work and his somewhat warped sense of vision.

1 July 2004,Maciste_Brother,1," Hollow film experience
","A SIMPLE PLAN is one of the most overrated films of all time. The fact that some actually view this film as a serious piece of film-making is truly amazing. Everything about this film is artificial: the characters, the acting, the plot, etc. Usually, genre films can get away with such an artificial feel because they mostly deal with things that don't necessarily exist in real life (zombies, monsters, deformed superheroes, etc) but when you transpose the same techniques used in genre films and apply them to actual human beings living in reality, well, the thing becomes forced and artificial. And this is what the folks responsible for this film, whom have experience in making mostly genre films, have done here. I didn't believe this story for one second throughout the entire film. The characters were amazingly stupid. The ""McGuffin"" story was uninspired and filled with plot-holes so big that you can fly a jumbo jet through them. And the acting, except for BBT, was unconvincing, certainly Paxton and Fonda playing a couple. Talk about zero chemistry. ",/review/rw0436049/?ref_=tt_urv

The performances of Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton were excellent and the film gives these characters moral dilemmas and decisions that are both rational and irrational. There's a Fargo-esque quality to it that shines and the pacing is just right if you ask me. By the end, there are huge consequences.
