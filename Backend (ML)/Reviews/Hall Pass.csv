12 February 2014,bkrauser-81-311064,8," Never Have I Been so Wrong About a Movie
","Like many of you, the first time I saw the trailer for The Lego Movie (2014) I thought to myself, ""Are you kidding me?!"" Yet another movie based on a franchise of toys aimed towards families willing to cough up the cash just to shut their kids up. Can't we for once make movies for kids that don't dull the senses? Have we truly come to the point where there are no original thoughts? Yet after seeing not just families but college kids' line up to see sold out viewings I became interested. In addition, The Lego Movie managed to muster a staggering 93% on rottentomatoes.com, an unheard of fresh score in the February film graveyard. In short; curiosity got the best of me.",/review/rw2956092/?ref_=tt_urv

7 February 2014,BrentHankins,9," An absolute must-see, consistently entertaining from start to finish.
","Hollywood has a long history of taking beloved relics from our  childhood and adapting them into big-screen entertainment, with the  unfortunate truth being that the final product often bears little  resemblance to the source material that our younger counterparts loved  so much. Typically we're left with something that feels like a cheap,  hollow cash-in (The Smurfs, Garfield, Alvin and the Chipmunks), or a  bloated, special effects-laden monstrosity full of explosions and poor  acting (Battleship, Transformers, G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra).  So it was with much trepidation that I sat down to watch The Lego  Movie, steeling myself for an experience that would be little more than  a two- hour commercial designed to drive traffic into the nearest toy  store, coaxing money out of the wallets of parents and into the pockets  of the Danish toy company. Instead, I was treated with one of the most  original, creative and entertaining films I've seen in years, which has  quickly cemented itself as the first must-see movie of 2014.  Emmett (Chris Pratt) is a construction worker, obediently carrying out  his daily duties in accordance with the instruction manual provided to  all Lego citizens by President (Lord) Business (Will Ferrell), an  obsessive compulsive, maniacal CEO bent on world domination. Think Lex  Luthor, but as a complete control freak with less intelligence and more  mustache-twirling insanity.  A chance encounter with the beautiful WyldStyle (Elizabeth Banks) leads  Emmett to the mythical Piece of Resistance, an ancient relic spoken of  only in prophecy that can be used to save the Lego citizens from their  impending doom. Wyldstyle quickly whisks Emmett away and brings him  before the Master Builders, which include the sagelike Vitruvius  (Morgan Freeman), the manic 1980s astronaut Benny (Charlie Day), and  WyldStyle's boyfriend, Batman (Will Arnett, in perhaps the film's most  hilarious vocal performance). Together, the Master Builders formulate a  plan to defeat Lord Business by infiltrating his massive high-rise  fortress, using the Piece of Resistance to defeat him once and for all   provided they can escape the clutches of the terrifying Good Cop/Bad  Cop (Liam Neeson), Lord Business' most loyal henchman.  From the opening moments of the film, The Lego Movie fires an endless  array of jokes at its audience from seemingly every angle. Writers Phil  Lord and Christopher Miller (who also directed the film) have an expert  grasp of the absurd, and they use it to great effect, ensuring that  every scene is stuffed to the gills with laughs. Many of the film's  best moments are derived from the fact that the characters, vehicles,  and environments are created from Lego pieces: one of the rules  established by the filmmakers was that everything appearing on screen  must be possible to construct in the real world.  There's an especially clever twist that occurs during the third act  that, if attempted by less talented filmmakers, could've easily  derailed the entire experience, but Lord and Miller's pitch-perfect  execution makes it work. With lightning-fast wit, a surprising amount  of action, and perhaps a bit of attention deficit disorder, The Lego  Movie is consistently entertaining from start to finish. It's a  brilliant mix of humor, heart, and creativity, and provides a great  foundation to build on.  Sorry, I couldn't resist at least one Lego-related pun. But seriously,  The Lego Movie is fantastic.  -- Brent Hankins",/review/rw2956092/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'd be surprised if anyone saw this coming. The Lego Movie is quite simply unlike anything seen in a long while: rip-roaringly hilarious, gorgeous to look at, imaginative beyond belief, a great parody of worn out ""chose one"" clichés and also rather poignant and touching.

6 February 2014,cameraslie,10," A reminder of how fun Lego can be.
","The stand out feature of the Lego Movie for me would be the way the Lego Universe was created. The movie paid great attention to detail making everything appear as it would made from Lego, including the water and clouds, and the surfaces people walked on all had the circles sticking upwards a Lego piece would have. Combined with all the yellow faces, and Lego part during building, I was convinced action took place in the Lego Universe.",/review/rw2956092/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2014,bob the moo,," Doesn't quite have the heart the message needed, but it is still energetic, clever and funny
","It was approaching the end of the year when I finally joined everyone else and enjoyed seeing the Lego Movie, a few seasons after it was released. Although I try not to pay attention to hype and critical response, it did seem like a positive that the same people sneering at Transformers for being a pumped-up toy commercial, were perfectly in love with the Lego Movie even though it is entirely reasonable to point out that it will do that product absolutely no harm to be literally the building blocks of a bright, colorful film where one of the messages is to be creative and mess around with things. The plot is quite light – a perfectly ordinary construction worker who spends his life following instructions and order, suddenly finds himself declared the Special One by a group called the Master Builders, who are racing to prevent Lord Business from destroying the world as they know it.",/review/rw2956092/?ref_=tt_urv

6 February 2014,PassPopcorn,8," Pass the Popcorn! review
","To be honest  when I first heard of 'The Lego Movie' I thought it to  be a ridiculous idea and automatically dismissed it as something bad.  However, when I gave it a second thought, I realized I kind of liked  the idea. I mean, why not create a big budget movie that takes place  inside the Lego universe? At least it's somewhat original (there have  been previous Lego movies, but they were all direct-to-video, and from  what I realize  they are much different from this one). And in this  age of spin-offs, remakes, prequels, etc. originality is more valuable  than ever. Add to that the amazing cast in the movie, and I, for one,  needed no more reasons to see this movie  and I ultimately enjoyed it.  The movie opens with the movie's villain, Lord Business (voiced by Will  Ferrell), stealing a mysterious artifact called the 'Kragle' (I hope  I've written it correctly) from a wizard named Vitruvius (voiced by  Morgan Freeman), in order to destroy the Universe. During their  encounter, Vitruvius tells of a prophecy about a Chosen one, who will  find another mystical artifact, called 'The Resistance Piece' and will  put an end to Business's mettle. 8 and a half years later, Lord  Business's alter ego  President Business  is ruling the whole world  in a sort of totalitarian way. We then meet the movie's protagonist,  Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt), who one day accidentally stumbles upon  'The Resistance Piece' and is thought to be the Chosen one by a group  of Lego characters called the MasterBuilders.  Despite the fact that The Lego Movie's plot summary may seem a bit  complicated (and despite the fact that I hailed the movie's originality  a moment ago), the movie is actually pretty predictable and formulaic.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing  actually, the movie has an  explanation of some sort for why it is so predictable  but the movie  does get slightly tedious from time to time. The only other possible  downsides to the movie besides that, are the movie's third act, which  gets clingy in some parts, and some of the action scenes. I like how  the animation is a combination of both stop motion and CGI, but this  unusual style of animation may be hard to follow during a few action  scenes  and I fear this scenes might be even harder to follow if you  decide to watch the movie in 3D. Nonetheless, all this downsides to the  movie are easily overshadowed by its qualities.  The movie's biggest quality is definitely that it is fun. The Lego  Movie is a nostalgic look back at childhood and it helps to realize  that our child games were often very silly, ridiculous, over the top  and funny  and in that way The Lego Movie could be better appreciated  by adults than by children. Virtually almost every scene contains a  silly joke or gag and I was constantly giggling throughout the whole  movie. The Lego Movie easily succeeds in being a feel good,  ridiculously entertaining movie that is worth your time. Moreover,  another The Lego Movie's quality is that it has quite an impressive  cast (Pratt, Ferrell, Banks, Day, Brie, Freeman, Hill, Neeson,  Offerman, O'Neil, etc.), that portrays a bunch of very colorful and  memorable characters. In short, if you are interested in watching a  nostalgic throwback to your childhood or just want to watch a fun,  feel-good movie, you mustn't skip The Lego Movie.

29 January 2019,CriticalOfEverything,10," What can I say?
","Everything is Awesome? Everything in the movie is Awesome? The Lego Movie is Awesome. There we go. This is easily one of my favourite animated films of all time and one of my favourite movies in general. It's not only what I think to be Phil Lord and Christopher Miller's second best film (second to Spider-Verse) but there's just something about it that is so sweetly and charmingly nostalgic about it to me, not just the fact that it's Lego (although that is a main reason why this film resonates with me and many others). Maybe it's the outstanding animation, the self-aware and clever humour, or the messages about Lego and different builders being unique, or maybe just all of them together. But most of all, this film just makes me happy. There is never a dull moment in this film and it definitely deserves every single bit of praise it has gotten over the years.",/review/rw2956092/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2018,jackfull,10," The Lego film that needed to happen
","Now, I know this film has its annoying spots and very child oriented areas, but when it comes to Lego films of the past, this film is leagues ahead. Lego films in the past either weren't professionally made, or when they were made, the Lego bricks themselves would behave and act in ways that they can't in real life due to their physical mechanics. In past films, mini fig's would move in ways that would bend and melt the plastic, or have human like faces that would scare the crap out of you. Also bricks and mini fig's would be combined with real life environments. So for example you'd have Lego Anakin Skywalker and Obi-wan Kenobi in a cantina, but the cantina looks like it does in the film, not done in Lego. In The Lego Movie however, you can look at just about any scene or area, and you can create that with Lego in real life. For the most part as well, the physical mechancis of Lego are respected in this film too. In addition to the life like movement, with how good the animation was, your first time watching this film you have to ask yourself if its animated or actual stop motion. The animation is THAT detailed. As you go through and watch it, you'll find subtle things like fingerprints or scratches on mini figs, printing on bricks, even mold numbers on certain pieces. This attention to detail is what makes the Lego movie the Lego movie that everyone has wanted for so long.",/review/rw2956092/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2018,Fred_Mopkopf,10," Awesome!
","Basically everything about this movie has has been said in the other reviews, so I'll confine mine to two points: 1) The realization that this movie is so good BECAUSE it can be mistaken as one big LEGO advert was a fascinating one to me. They found one extremely satisfying way to make ""the"" LEGO movie and tell a beautiful story (watch until the end!). Had they done something like ""G.I. Joe"", ""Battleship"" or the likes, they would have failed. 2) The way they're using LEGO bricks for EVERYTHING, including and not limited to fire, water, foam, smoke, explosions, laser beams, LED bargraphs, clouds, force fields, motion blur (!) and more, is just mind-boggling and alone warrants watching the film. Everything is awesome!",/review/rw2956092/?ref_=tt_urv

","Went to see it with my brother. With the age difference between us we both loved the movie for different reasons. For me it was superb. It's amazing to see how lego people in a world made by lego, live and interact with each other. There were some funny moments for kids and even some moments for adults too. Overall it is a very enjoyable movie and it is sure to remind you of your childhood. I recommend it to anyone who has ever played with any form of lego whatsoever.

23 February 2014,Danusha_Goska,2," Irritatingly Frenetic and Ugly to Look At
","""The Lego Movie"" is irritatingly frenetic, smug, and so ugly to look at it hurt my eyes. Its message is a mess of predigested secular or Pagan takeoffs on the Judeo-Christian tradition, not direct takeoffs, but borrowings of borrowings. ""Jokes"" come fast and furious. They come so fast you don't have time to assess whether they are funny or not. Example: Liam Neeson voices a police officer, and he sings a few seconds of ""Danny Boy."" This is supposed to be funny because Liam Neeson is Irish. It's a joke! Get it huh huh? Get how clever it is? You don't have to think about that, because another joke is coming down the chute.

4 September 2014,TheLittleSongbird,9," Ties with How to Train Your Dragon 2 as the best animated film of the year (so far)
","There was the initial worry to whether a film based on a popular (and timeless) children's toy merchandise would work, as results have been mixed on that front, but the trailer did look amusing and the reviews and ratings were great and I as a huge animation fan saw it anyway. The good news is that it does work, yes it is a little rushed at times, especially towards the end, and the last half hour got a touch complicated (if the pacing had slowed down then it would have helped). But what was so brilliant about The Lego Movie was how it took this merchandise and managed to make such a colourful, clever, imaginative and enormously entertaining film out of it when it could have easily been the opposite. The animation is really first rate, the vibrant yet dynamic colours are remarkably vivid and a lot of the visuals especially in the action are very inventive. There is a bright and breezy soundtrack that compliments The Lego Movie beautifully, wasn't that ""Awesome"" song catchy or what? The Lego Movie's chief selling point is that it is an outstandingly well-written film with snappy dialogue and thick and fast jokes that all hit their mark, by far the funniest film I've seen in a while. The action is also block-busting in the very best of ways. It's not all hilarious though, because there is a lot of heart in The Lego Movie and the message will be an inspiration to anybody. The characters have their entertaining quirks and personalities yet the film really allows you to properly care for them as well, the most colourful being the villain President Business. And what a fine voice cast too, with Will Ferrell stealing the show, he is a hoot, but Morgan Freeman's dignified blind seer and Will Arnett's splendidly dour Batman are worthy of note too. Chris Pratt is a likable, chirpy protagonist but not quite as memorable as the supporting roles. To conclude, a brilliant and near-perfect film, animated or otherwise, that people of all ages and the whole family can enjoy. 9/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2956092/?ref_=tt_urv
