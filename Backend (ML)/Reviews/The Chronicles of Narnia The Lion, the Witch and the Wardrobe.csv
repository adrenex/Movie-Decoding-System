21 May 2001,mentalcritic,," Better than some would make out...
","When The Mummy hit theatres in 1999, critics everywhere panned it as being a poor man's Indiana Jones. While the two movies are about as similar as Dr. No is to GoldenEye (thankfully), I suppose comparisons between one non-stop adventure film and other are inevitable. In the end, what really counts when determining a film's quality is the level to which it can entertain. And if there is one thing The Mummy did well, it was entertain. Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, and Arnold Vosloo were very well chosen for their roles.",/review/rw0666851/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2010,moviesleuth2,7," Non-stop action
","The success of ""The Mummy"" in 1999 surprised everyone, and on the day that it opened, Universal Studios greenlit another sequel. The original (the 1999 one) was a lot of fun because it mixed creepy scares with awesome action and goofy humor. The sequel does more or less the same thing, except that the action sequences come pretty much one after another from beginning to end.",/review/rw0666851/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2003,daria84,8," Pretty good for a sequel.
","This movie is pretty good, it delivers pretty much the same thing we got in the Firs movie.  Some characters are more developed and some others more expanded, all the same, some others are reduced and we are introduced to new characters.  The plot is good, not as good as the first movie, but still does a good job keeping you interested and entertained the whole time. ",/review/rw0666851/?ref_=tt_urv

8 May 2001,jhclues,7," A Special Effects Extravaganza
","If you've seen the trailer for this movie, you're probably expecting fast paced adventure, non-stop action and a special effects extravaganza with just enough story to keep it all interesting.  And if that's what you're hoping for, you certainly won't be disappointed; because that's exactly what you get in `The Mummy Returns,' written and directed by Stephen Sommers. The story begins in Egypt, where Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and his wife, Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) discover an ancient bracelet that had once belonged to a warrior known as `The Scorpion King (The Rock),' who, back in the day, had sold his soul to the god, Anubis, for control of his armies and domination of the world.  Now, it seems, The Scorpion King's resurrection is imminent, and if he succeeds and once again raises the armies of Anubis, he could very well take over or destroy the world.  Followers of Im-Ho-Tep (Arnold Vosloo), however, who are privy to this information as well, decide to resurrect their dark leader so that he can face The Scorpion King, defeat him, take control of Anubis' armies and conquer the world himself, putting them in control.  But the key to the whole plan lies with who has control of the bracelet at the time of The Scorpion King's resurrection.  And the O'Connells have taken it back home with them to London.

31 October 2004,philip_vanderveken,7," Enjoyable thanks to the humor and the many special effects.
","Most people compare this sequel to the first movie 'The Mummy', which is a good thing of course, but I haven't seen the first one, so no comparisons from me. ",/review/rw0666851/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Loved this sequel! Amazing work by everybody
","The Mummy Returns is a film that, I think, you need to see the first film of the saga because otherwise you don't understand some little details. That film is a film like Indiana Jones with the same plot and the same characters. But the kid is an exception. The cinema show us the kids like boys and girls insufferable, but Alex O'Conell is a boy that ""pass more time in the museum that in house"". One difference this film have respect Indiana Jone's films are the sobrenatural characters than appears like The Scorpión King or Imhotep. If you like Indiana Jones and Egyptian mithology, I recomend you that film",/review/rw0666851/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2001,zetes,7," Unpretentious and fun. 7/10
","The Mummy Returns is maybe a step above the first one. The action is non-stop, and it does manage, for the most part, to rouse the audience, or at least me. The good guys are likable. Brendan Fraser is where he belongs. Rachel Weisz is beautiful. John Hannah amuses as Jonathan, and Freddie Boath manages not to annoy as Alex, the kid. He's pretty good as a smart-mouthed brat. The bad guys are, for the most part, fun to hate. Im-Ho-Tep is a good villain. Maybe he isn't given enough to do here, but he's still cool. Patricia Valazquez is a real stunner as his love interst, Anck-Su-Namun. She's probably the best thing about the film. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje was good as Lock Nah, the main henchman. Perhaps the weakest part of the film is the Rock as the Scorpion King. The narration during the film's prologue is not nearly as good as it would be if we were watching the story develop. The Scorpion King is basically a boring character. His computer-animated doppleganger at the film's climax is neat, but it would have been better if there were some feelings towards that character.",/review/rw0666851/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2013,hitchcockthelegend,7," Yeah, right, and no harm ever came from reading a book. You remember how that one went?
","After the financial success of ""The Mummy"" two years earlier, the sequel was inevitable. The big players from the first film are back, Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo and Oded Fehr. Stephen Sommers once again directs (and writes), Patricia Velasquez comes in to be a main player after her cameo in the first film, and young Freddie Boath plays the son of Rick and Evelyn who are now married. This time the cameo goes to Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson who plays The Scorpion King and who is replaced by a very bad CGI version of himself at film's finale.",/review/rw0666851/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2009,TheLittleSongbird,7," More of the same adventure sequel, but it actually works.
","Both the original and this are great fun and completely likable. Of course the sequel does have flaws, the plot isn't quite as strong as the one in the original, the scorpion king was a bit of a disappointment(he could've been designed better) and again like the original it is overlong. But it does have a sense of unpretentious fun, and that is great to see. The visuals are very impressive, and the music score, this time by Alan Silvestri is very effective, though I do prefer the Goldsmith. Although he isn't given as much to do, Arnold Vosloo still impresses as Imhotep, who I admit I did find scary in the original, not so much here, but Vosloo's performance is great. The other performances are fine too, Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz are both charming in the lead roles, and Patricia Velasquez is just beautiful beyond words as Meela Nais/Arnk Su Namun. Plus Freddie Boath is perfectly tolerable as Alexander, and John Hannah is fine too, same with Allun Armstrong of all people. All in all, a fun sequel, that shows that more of the same can actually work. The only other sequel that I have seen that is more of the same yet lives up exactly to the standard of its original is Home Alone 2:Lost in New York. 7/10 for Mummy Returns.

","The team of Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) and Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) have increase by one with the addition of their son Alex (Freddie Boath). Together, they are treasure hunting and finds the Bracelet of Anubis. In ancient times, the Scorpion King used it to command the Army of Anubis.

2 June 2003,rye9969,," Simply Awesome!
","On my day off from work today, I decided to pop in the Mummy Returns for something fun to watch. I hadn't seen it since it was released for homeviewing, so it's been about a year or two. I must say that this movie takes my breath away each time I see it. The Mummy Returns is a roller coaster ride which barely stops during the entire 2+ hours! I love the CGI effects, and how lavish the scenery looks. The movie made me feel as though I was witnessing Ancient Egypt and and the 1930's era in person. So what if things look 'cartoony' during the battling sequences! I think that the battle sequences in Two Towers looked just as much the same. I find that with many fans nowadays, they take things way too seriously. If a movie or TV series is not what they hope for, then they blast it all to hell just because they are whining babies. Take for instance Star Trek Nemesis. That was another really good movie, yet the so called 'fans' ripped it apart piece by piece and then fed it to the dogs. I just wish that the babies would enjoy the movies instead of complaining that a movie isn't good quality. If thats the case they should just go back to their rooms and watch Fargo or the English Patient! Both the Mummy and the Mummy Returns rock as far as action movies go. Get a huge bag of chips a large bottle of pop, sit down with your girlfriend and enjoy two great movies!! Excellent fun!!",/review/rw0666851/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2001,rastaban3,8," Good, action packed with a few flaws
","The Mummy Returns is a good sequel to The Mummy.  Although The Mummy was remake of an earlier film and the sequel also takes from a few other movies, this one is good.  If you are one who can't stand movies that are not completely original, mostly likely, you will not be able to sit through this one.  However, if you are looking for some action packed, good entertainment, this one is for you.",/review/rw0666851/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2001,Hitchcoc,6," More of the Same but OK
","There are times when the cynical part of me gets put aside and I go to a movie to just see what happens. I decided that this time I would enjoy the special effects, the rules dreamed up by the Mummy experts, none of them ancient Egyptians, and just watch. There is really no plot, at least none of any importance. It is a series of events with some loose kind of contrived hierarchy of evil that needs to be addressed. It is pure video game stuff. Still, I watched it, admiring the incredible images put on the screen. The rapidity of motion. The critters that kept coming and coming. I looked at this like I look at a photograph and said, ""The people that did this are pretty darned creative."" Wouldn't it be nice if there was a bit of suspense and anticipation. We all know that you-know-who is going to meet you-know-who and according to the talk about the sequel, we know who's coming next. Anyway, I'm not going to put it down but I'm also not going to bother to watch it again.",/review/rw0666851/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2016,Tweekums,7," A solid sequel with almost nonstop action
",This sequel opens in ancient Egypt and shows a warrior known as 'The Scorpion King' raise an army and set about conquering the known world. Eventually he is defeated and as he is about to die in the desert he prays to Anubis; he gives him a new army and he takes Egypt but is then taken by Anubis.,/review/rw0666851/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2003,Theo Robertson,5," A Film Shouldn`t Revolve Around CGI
","The problem I had with the original film was that the script seemed to be written around the special effects , especially the CGI . Well the bad news about the sequel is that it suffers from the same problem multiplied by ten. Witness the opening prologue of massed armies fighting , an oasis appearing from nowhere and the scorpian king`s army overrunning a city all of which might have looked good on paper but on screen is badly executed due to some really apalling CGI . I don`t know what it is about this type of cinema technology but think of all the films where it`s been used in set pieces that fail to convince ( ESCAPE FROM LA , DIE ANOTHER DAY etc ) and watching it used in THE MUMMY RETURNS  left me shaking my head wondering why directors and FX maestros haven`t been able to improve upon it . Watching the action scenes in this movie is like watching a cartoon.",/review/rw0666851/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2004,JamesHitchcock,6," Don't You Just Love Social Realism?
","The plot of this film is too complex to set out in any great detail. Suffice it to say that a group of villains, including one of the curators of the British Museum, have revived the corpse of the Ancient Egyptian priest Imhotep, who was put to death for his part in the murder of the Pharaoh, a crime carried out by his wife Anck-su-Namun, who was also Imhotep's lover. The villains are also seeking to use a magic bracelet to revive the Scorpion King (a warrior from another period of Egyptian history who sold his soul to the dark god Anubis in exchange for military success) and his army. The idea is that they will then use Imhotep to kill the Scorpion King, which will give them control of his army, which they will then use to achieve their ambition of world domination. The only people who can thwart their schemes are Rick O'Connell, an American archaeologist, and his beautiful English wife Evelyn, whose young son Alex has stolen the magic bracelet. Evelyn just happens to be the reincarnation of the daughter of the murdered Pharaoh.",/review/rw0666851/?ref_=tt_urv

4 May 2015,Spondonman,8," Preordained entertaining sequel
","Not only does the Mummy return but his friends and enemies and all the romance and adventure they brought with them in the first film. Stephen Sommers, Brendan Fraser, Rachael Weisz, Arnold Vosloo and John Hannah were back to do the second part of the franchise, this time up against an even more powerful adversary. Parts of the plot are amusingly retrodden from the first part too; and again not much makes or is expected to make sense.",/review/rw0666851/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2015,davispittman,8," An entertaining and satisfying sequel!
","The Mummy Returns, which was released in 2001, is a sequel to the 1999 hit, The Mummy. This movie is a very worthy and fun to watch sequel. The actors all hold their own in throughout the film and do a wonderful job at portraying their roles. Brendan Frasier does a great job in the action sequences along side Rachel Weisz. The new characters are very well put together as well. I really enjoyed the villains in this movie, especially the scorpion King, played by the very well cast Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. He truly is perfect for the role of the scorpion King, tough, muscular, good looking, and able to do the hardcore action adventure scenes true justice. On to The special effects. The special effects are very well done in this flick, very cool and realistic looking, well for the most part that is, there is one scene at the end where the special effects are actually pretty bad looking. The end part where the scorpion King is resurrected, the cgi in that scene is very poor, but that's the only bad part with the special effects, the rest are great! This movies plot summary was also very pleasing and satisfying, the plot was original and creative. 8/10 for the mummy returns.",/review/rw0666851/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2001,bat-5,8," Outstanding and entertaining!
","Action and adventure abound throughout this movie.  There are grand battles, deception, romance and narrow escapes from death and that's just in the first half hour!  Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz are back and this time, they have more than an ancient mummy to contend with. This time around, there's evil followers of Imhotep, armies of the undead, pygmies and The Scorpion King himself.  The pace never lets up. It's a roller coaster ride that takes you up, down and then spins you upside down and throws you for another roll.  The stunts are great, the effects are great, and the story is also great.  This is a perfect summer movie to go watch with your friends.   So, go get your tickets, grab a soda and sit back and let the fun begin.",/review/rw0666851/?ref_=tt_urv

2 December 2001,halebopp3,10," Romance makes movie complete
","After seeing ""The Mummy"" in the theaters for the first time two years ago, I knew I would be hooked. I've watched it about twenty times since then, and as many people know, this movie does not get boring or less funny after watching it numerous times, in fact, I think it gets more and more thrilling each time. I began hoping for a sequel to be released, and when I heard that one was in the making, I was relieved that they weren't going to end this great storyline with just one film. When ""The Mummy Returns"" was finally released in theaters, it didn't recieve very many good reviews right away. I was dissapointed because I didn't understand how Stephen Sommers could direct such a great movie classic and then totally botch a promising sequel. I let the reviews get to me and I didn't see the movie while in the theaters. I waited until this past weekend to watch TMR on pay-per-view not expecting much due to the bad reviews, but I soon found out that, boy, were some of those critics wrong.",/review/rw0666851/?ref_=tt_urv
