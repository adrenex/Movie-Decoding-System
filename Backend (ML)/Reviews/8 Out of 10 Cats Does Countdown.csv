31 December 2016,jboothmillard,9," 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown
","This show started out as a bit of fun, a mashup show made for the 30th anniversary of Channel 4 in 2012, but it proved so popular that they it was commissioned for a series, and since then many more have followed. Hosted by Jimmy Carr, with permanent team captains Sean Lock (series 1-9) and Jon Richardsom (series 1-9), and Countdown lexicographer Susie Dent (series 1-9) in Dictionary Corner, and Countdown mathematician Rachel Riley (series 1-9) doing the letters and numbers, with Joe Wilkinson occasionally offering ""help"". The series is a mashup of satirical comedy panel show 8 Out of 10 Cats and long-running word and number game show Countdown, the show follows the usual game play of Countdown, but the bonus is the added banter, joke answers and rude words in play, for the teatime teasers and the final conundrum, the player mascots, Jimmy doing something funny to distract the players during the Countdown clock, alternative versions and music for the clock time, and so many other funny elements. Guests on the show, on the teams, as guest captains, in Dictionary Corner and for other reasons, have included: Kriss Akabusi, Tom Allen, David Baddiel, Bill Bailey, Aisling Bea, Rob Beckett, Jo Brand, Brett Domino Trio, Alex Brooker, Kevin Bridges, Kathy Burke, Adam Buxton, Clarke Carlisle, John Cooper Clarke, Roisin Conaty, Nina Conti, Victoria Coren, James Corden, Matthew Crosby, Greg Davies, Jack Dee, Rob Delaney, Natasia Demetriou, Danny Dyer, Joey Essex, Andrew ""Freddie"" Flintoff, Paul Foot, Rebecca Front, Mel Giedroyc, Rhod Gilbert, Lauren Goodger, Sally Gunnell, Rich Hall, Nick Helm, Adam Hills, Alex Horne and The Horne Section, Sharon Horgan, Russell Howard, Reginald D. Hunter, Jessica Hynes, Phill Jupitus, Miles Jupp, John Kearns, Humphrey Ker, Tim Key, Jamie Laing, Cariad Lloyd, Gabby Logan, Josie Long, Joe Lycett, Lee Mack, Jason Manford, Stephen Mangan, Sarah Millican, David Mitchell, Bob Mortimer, Trevor Noah, Dara O'Briain, David O'Doherty, Jono O'Neill, Richard Osman, Sara Pascoe, Chris Ramsey, Romesh Ranganathan, Vic Reeves, Adam Riches, Jonathan Ross, Antoinette Ryan, Katherine Ryan, Peter Serafinowicz, Sam Simmons, Jen Steadman, Isy Suttie, Liza Tarbuck, Dennis Taylor, Johnny Vegas, David Walliams, Holly Walsh, Seann Walsh, Henning When, Jack Whitehall, Josh Widdicombe, Claudia Winkleman, Jake Yapp and many more. It is funny, it is clever, you can play along with the game, and laugh loads at all the jokes during the game, you could argue it is better than both the original shows, a brilliant satirical comedy panel gameshow. Very good!",/review/rw5414125/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2016,cosmopath,9," A wickedly hilarious and witty take on an old classic
","What is there more to say than what was written in the title? The show's host Jimmy Carr is a quick thinker, which allows him to make incredibly funny jokes all while retaining the edgy, dark humour he is known for. The scripted skits that take place while participants are writing down their answers are crazily ridiculous. Resident team captains Sean Lock and Jon Richardson have such strong chemistry with each other that I'd have a hard time imagining comedians that would be better in their place. All the while there is still the classic rounds of Countdown being played that many know and love, all starring the same lexicographer Suzie Dent, and presenter/mathematician Rachel Riley.",/review/rw5414125/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2016,noahdam,9," Amazingly funny and cleverly done.
","8 Out Of 10 Cats does Countdown is and will always be, one of my favorite quiz shows. ",/review/rw5414125/?ref_=tt_urv

",I like it when Jimmy Carr laughs at his own jokes. Her her herrrrrrr,/review/rw5414125/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2021,payzillee,9," An odd mix of genres that works well
",I don't watch the original Countdown as I'm not really into quiz shows. But this is a little bit different. It's a panel show comedy blended with the Countdown quiz format.,/review/rw5414125/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2021,mcdflint,8," Very funny but.......
",A very funny show that always makes me laugh until Joe Wilkinson comes on. It might be me but I just don't find him funny.,/review/rw5414125/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2021,david-02796,10," Just fantastic
",When the hole world seems to be collapsing around you this is the most fantastic uplifting program it makes me cry with happiness.,/review/rw5414125/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2020,Ruskington,6," Great concept but the horse has been flogged
","The first two seasons of 8OOTCDC would rank as some of my favourite ever TV. The world's best game show injected with some dry British wit and a healthy dollop of toilet humour. David Mitchell and Joe Wilkinson are particularly good guests, although the unwitting star of the show is the highly charming Susie Dent who innocently tends to her lexicography in face of all the vulgarity around her.",/review/rw5414125/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2017,DavidYZ,3," Mixed-up clash of two very different shows
","This bizarre merge of 8 Out of 10 Cats and Countdown began when Channel 4 did mash-ups of various programmes of theirs. This is the only one that was turned into a series. It doesn't work most of the time, because 8 Out of 10 Cats is a lighthearted comedy show aimed at young adults - whereas Countdown is a serious show aimed the elderly.",/review/rw5414125/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2016,eddie052010,6," A mixed bag of a crossover show.
","Crossover shows are an interesting beast as popular programmes are combined and it is compelling to see how their individual styles play off one another to create something truly unique on its own. While there have been successful examples of such shows because of this, there have also been failures as the styles of the individual shows don't mix well together, creating something that can be tedious and awkward to watch. Therein lies the problem with this show: while Countdown is always enjoyable, the 8 Out Of 10 Cats element slightly suffers due to humour that is mildly amusing at best and completely unfunny at worst.",/review/rw5414125/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2023,destiny_west,8," Makes your brain work whilst having a laugh
","I absolutely love Jimmy Carr and he is well suited to hosting this show. Jon Richardson is just the icing on the cake, with his nerdy weirdness.",/review/rw5414125/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2022,gfmcniven,8," Great cast,mostly
","Great combo of a panel show and a game show,both aspects of the show works well with a great cast but....
There is one huge negative with this show and that's Joe Wilkinson. I can't stress enough how terrible this guy is, he's so cringeworthy that I dread every second he's on and he almost drains the life out of a great show.",/review/rw5414125/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2022,longthorp,7," Great show BUT
","Its a great show BUT the long winded story telling moments usually from the person next to susie is annoying, cant remember how many times i have skipped that bit, other then that, amazing show.",/review/rw5414125/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2022,mngvinc,1," Countdown for dummies
","If you struggle to compose words longer than four or five letters and cannot perform basic arithmetic without the use of a calculator, then this show is for you, dummy! Asides from the obnoxiously unfunny and uncharismatic ""celebrity"" guests who appear on the show ad nauseam, is the constant smutty, sleazy and sexist undertones to this awful show. Stick with the original, ""Countdown"" (No sleaze, no smut; actually intellectual)",/review/rw5414125/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2020,mickamicallef,1," Potty mouths
","Why do they have to use such filthy language. Cant people have fun without having such a potty mouth? Maybe the panel should all take a dictionary home, and find some new words",/review/rw5414125/?ref_=tt_urv
