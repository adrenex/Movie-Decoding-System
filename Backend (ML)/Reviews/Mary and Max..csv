26 June 2014,utgard14,6," What Might Have Been
","This is basically a tale of two movies. I know Hugh Jackman wanted this movie to be an adaptation of the classic Chris Claremont/Frank Miller comic book mini-series. You can see bits of that story here. But then you have this other stuff, far removed from that story, that seems to be studio-imposed and ultimately hurts what could have been one of the best comic book movies to date. The good stuff, the stuff worth watching this for, are the slower, quieter parts of the story. The Wolverine and Mariko parts, basically. But all of the special effects-heavy parts and the loud, flashy action sequences suck and take away from the impact the movie would have otherwise had. There's probably no better example than the different climactic battle scenes. Wolverine vs Shingen is a much more powerful, emotional scene than the shallow, garish stuff with Viper and a guy in robot armor.",/review/rw3753112/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2016,sam_smithreview,8," biased review of Wolverine fan
","I've been a fair fan of the series of the whole. Even the weaker installments I thoroughly enjoyed, so my review is already weighed in favor of this film. I will say even from a critics point of view I thought it was really well done. It's not the standard comic book fairy tale, but more of an intrinsic study of the Wolverine character. He shows a lot of depth and vulnerability in this outing, far more than previous installments. It's a risky but necessary move to see him operate on a balance challenge where he really is prone to death at any moment. The humor is matched well with the drama for an interesting viewing all the way through. All the supporting roles I found interesting as well. I really enjoyed the presence of Yukio who provided invaluable aide despite Wolverine's incessant protests. I found it nice to see his character finally develop some closure after all the time we've get to see him in all his cinematic installments.",/review/rw3753112/?ref_=tt_urv

","Despite the third act being drastically different in tone to the previous two acts (but it's still fun and enjoyable), The Wolverine is an incredible spin-off that's thrilling and emotional, showing the effects of the events of X-Men 3 on Wolverine/Logan. Hugh Jackman gives a reliably incredible performance as Wolverine once again. Hiroyuki Sanada and Rila Fukushima both give great supporting performances.

26 July 2013,Movie_Muse_Reviews,8," Character-focused 'The Wolverine' gives Wolvie the story he needed, not the dazzling blockbuster
","Throughout the course of the modern superhero era, one thing has stayed true: Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. After being a successful piece of the ""X-Men"" franchise for three films, Wolverine got his own solo gig in 2009's ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" which turned out to be a chaotic smear of superhero film with a cliché-ridden script.

11 January 2022,MissSimonetta,5," Pretty bland-- maybe the most forgettable X-Men movie
","I liked THE WOLVERINE fine enough while watching it, but after the movie ended, my opinion soured a bit. While this is more competent than the ORIGINS movie, it is far less interesting. ORIGINS had so bad it's hilarious elements, while this film is more generic and by the numbers, save for the hilariously dumb reveal with the samurai robot suit at the end. The highlight of the movie is the battle on top of the train, which required some resourcefulness on the part of Logan-- otherwise, the dull story and overly dark lighting make the movie a massive slog.",/review/rw3753112/?ref_=tt_urv

","Exploring a more mature subject matter in Logan's existential crisis, is great in theory.

Yet, another Superhero/Comic Book part 2 (in this case, Wolverine's second solo feature) that our hero loses their powers, the very thing I go see these movies for.

12 August 2013,Special-K88,," not much entertainment value
","Some time after the events of The Last Stand, this sequel of sorts focuses on Logan/Wolverine as a tortured soul living in isolation and haunted by vivid memories of his lost love. Now, having reached an emotional impasse, he travels to Japan to visit an old comrade. Once there, he quickly gets caught up in a complex political power struggle that, for the first time in his life, makes him truly vulnerable. Jackman, not unexpectedly, is formidable in the lead, and there are lots of visceral action scenes, but that does little to compensate for the faults; film's tone is grim, its characters—sans Jackman—are unappealing, plotting is convoluted, subject matter turns ugly, and the pace lags heavily after a strong start. Jackman effectively spits, scowls, snarls, and flexes his muscles in what has become his go-to role, but he has almost no support; too long, too dark, and too serious to really be fun. **",/review/rw3753112/?ref_=tt_urv

31 July 2013,g-boyle3,3," Maybe next time
","I've wanted to see a wolverine movie that was fast paced, action packed, with a good storyline that would be well received by critics for the longest time. In my opinion wolverine is by far the most interesting of the x men characters. However this was not the wolverine I was waiting for. Yes it was action packed and I honestly enjoyed the fight scenes, but it was just shocking. This movie was flaw central. It saddens me to know that this was truly Hugh Jackmans last attempt at Wolverine, because we all know he's just too old for another attempt. And no one wants to see him as wolverine fighting off the bad guys at 45, it would be unbecoming. The characters in this story were ridiculous. I could tell from the moment they met that Wolverine was going to get with Mariko, but part of me just would not accept it, up until that fatal night when they kissed. A kiss which lacked any conviction or real passion, it was laughable. The oddest on screen couple I've seen since Matt Damon and Michael Douglas in Behind The Candelabra. They were painfully awkward. The arch villain serpant lady was atrocious. The ostentatious villain that we never even learn why or how she came about to work for Yashida with undiminishing loyalty, or what her general goal was. Yashida himself was a tedious villain and we didn't really here much about his life after Nagasaki. Mariko's father was a perpetual imbecile I could not fathom why he was even mentioned in the movie his character had no real significance. My favourite character had to have been Yuriko at least her motives were clear, Mariko was sort of a sister to her and it was obvious from the outset she wanted a slice of the wolverine pie. Now that couple would have at least been believable because she was bad ass and fearless. Her psychic powers were a bit ridiculous though she didn't really foresee anything worthwhile did she. The fight scenes were enjoyable though especially with the deadly ninja assassins creeping through the night, descending from rooftops and snapping necks like nobody's business. Yuriko was pretty sharp too, I was never really worried for her character, she could hold her own.... she had enough sass. It's a tragedy though I truly believe that Hugh Jackman was the perfect wolverine he just didn't get the movie he deserved. Well my advice is to wait a few years until the stench from this movie clears and then find a 20 year old Hugh Jackman doppelganger and create a Wolverine with some substance. It can't be that hard it has so much potential.",/review/rw3753112/?ref_=tt_urv

","THE WOLVERINE is a second spin off from the X-MEN franchise centred around Hugh Jackman's titular character.

1 August 2013,ironhorse_iv,7," Wolverine is a good movie, bub. It's cutting edge.
","I was very impress on how good the movie was really is. It wasn't as good as 2003's X2, but it was a lot better than 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Still, the movie doesn't match up with any of the previous films very well. That's why the plot holes were so big in the film in this film. We're talking about a franchise who continuity is very washy where it goes, where it came from and what it being present right now. It seem like FOX's Marvel team doesn't know how to handle the X-franchise properly. At less, Disney's Marvel kind of fix the loose-ends of the previous superheroes movies for 2011's Avengers release. I would love to see Marvel under one company sooner than later. Add, Columbia's Spiderman and any licensed Marvel that belong to other companies elsewhere. I don't care who own Marvel, as long as the films are good and make sense. With that, say, I was under the impression that he visit Japan storyline takes place prior to his joining the X-Men in the canon after WWI. Like the comic and the previous movie, he fought in Europe during WWII. So how was he in Japan in WWII? Plus, how does Logan even have memory of the event, if the previous film showed us he took a bullet to the head that made him forget everything that happened to him prior to his operation post-WW2? It wasn't that big of a deal, since I know the movie takes creative license, which is pretty OK in my book. At less, he goes back to Japan just after the Dark Phoenix saga, so this movie fits in with the comic pretty correct there. The Wolverine, is loosely based on Chris Claremont 1982 four-issue spin off comic series that sent Logan to Japan, for which Claremont drafted then-rising-superstar artist Frank Miller. The characters have the same name, but it's doesn't follow the comic book so well. It doesn't work as an adapted as the comic book, but as a movie of its own. Chris McQuarrie, who wrote The Usual Suspects, has written the script, so that'll give you a good clue, it's worth watching. After the events from 2006's X-Men Last Stand, Logan (Hugh Jackson) lives as a hermit in the Yukon, tormented by hallucinations memories of Jean Grey (Famke Janssen). Was Jean just a personification of Logan's guilt, or is it really phoenix in his head with him? Logan then finds himself being seek out by Yukio (Rila Fukushima) who works for Shingen Yashida (Hiroyuki Sanada) who wants to offers to transfer Logan's healing abilities into his father's body. Allowing Logan, a chance to live a normal life rather than being curse with immortality. Logan hating the fact that he outlive everybody he has once love, agrees. Logan set out for Japan, once there, he finds that something malicious is being case as Yashida's doctor, Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) plans to use it for a ultimate weapon call the Silver Samurai, a suit made out of Adamantium metal. Logan refused, but Viper weaken Logan's body to the point that the first time in Logan's life, he might die from the poisoning of Adamantium metal in his body. If not the poison, he might die due to the large numbers of Yakuza and Ninjas set out to kill him. In my opinion, the movie's plot could have been better. The movie's plot moves really slow, it's not well spread out, and last a lot of sub-plot got in the way with the main. I really couldn't find Logan falling in love with Yashida Clan member Mariko (Tao Okamoto). There was a lack of chemistry between Jackman and Tao, their characters were well written had the chemistry but the actors did bring that to life. I know, based on the comics, Logan likes Mariko, but in my opinion, I thought Yukio made a better love interest in this film. Better yet, why even have a love interest. It's seems like any female character put into a comic book film is there only for a love interest arch. I wish Mariko had more to offer the film. Mariko remained the useless princess stereotype. It felt like watching a superhero version of Karate Kiba, a martial-arts film starring Sonny Chiba, released in 1973. About Yukio, she is a mutant with the precognitive ability to know when someone will die. Her power wasn't needed. Nor does it makes any sense, in the case of Yashida and Logan toward the end. Fans may hate what they did for Silver Samurai. Silver Samurai look like Super Shredder in my opinion. FYI. The robotic Silver Samurai is in the new comics, so it does somewhat works. What doesn't work is Viper. The model actress is so awful in acting. Her scenes were so cartoony with all those hissing sounds. Was it really all that necessary to include Viper as a mutant, when she works much better as an Captain America villain. While Hugh Jackson did great as Logan. I just wish to see Logan learn more about the Japanese culture. In the comic, he was being trained in martial arts. In the film, he isn't doing anything new. He seem like a fish out of water there. Critics says the film is darken in tone, in my opinion, it wasn't. The action scenes were good. Bullet train scene was over the top, but it was short. Don't watch it in 3D, it was pretty useless .In a mid-credits scene, there is a scene worth watching hyping X-Men: Days of Future Past. Overall: If you're watching it as an action flick, yes it's a good movie. If you're a fan of the Wolverine character and actually know something about this storyline, you'll be quite disappointed, just like the last X-Men. Still, it's fun to watch.",/review/rw3753112/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2013,Scarecrow-88,9," The Wolverine
","In this exciting Wolverine tale, Hugh Jackman returns as the brooding mutant with adamantium claws, still haunted by the loss of his beloved Jean Grey (the goddess, Famke Janssen) whose ""spirit"" visits him often in his dreams. He has been hermitting in some rural wilderness (where giant grizzlies and human hunters equally frequent), found while predisposed with barfly hunters (one of whom used a poison-tipped arrow to down a bear) by a highly trained fighter from Tokyo named Yukio (Rila Fukushima). Yukio has orders to bring Logan to Tokyo to ""say goodbye"" to her mentor (and the man who raised her), Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi). Logan had saved Yashida's life when Nagasaki was bombed in WWII. Yashida (who had developed a technological empire in Tokyo) is dying and wants to be immortal, offering a chance for Logan to die a human death in exchange for his eternal power. Logan is stunned by this but Yashida supposedly dies not long after the proposition. When Yashida's ""nurse"" (a chemist with a vast knowledge in toxins), Viper (the deliciously wicked, luscious Svetlana Khodchenkova, having a field day as the nasty, but delectable heavy) ""poisons"" Logan while he sleeps, causing him to feel pain and lose the ability to heal immediately after harm; when wounded, he'll need medical attention. And does he ever bleed and suffer during this movie! Yashida leaves his empire to his granddaughter, Mariko (Tao Okamoto), much to the disgust of his insidious son, Shingen (Hiroyuki Sanada, a nasty piece of work) who himself longed for the lofty power of such a position. There's an attempt to kidnap Mariko by the Yakuza, and Logan will take it upon himself to protect her. It seems everyone is out to either capture or harm Mariko and while vulnerable after Viper's handiwork, the Wolverine will still put up quite a fight, using his claws to full effect. Also showing up in the film is Will Yun Lee as a former childhood boyfriend (and disciple of the house of Yashida), Harada, and the sleazy Brian Tee as the arranged fiancé for Mariko, Noburo. Harada is handy with a crossbow, Noburo has political ties (and a taste for American hookers), and Viper has an agenda that will surprise both Mariko and Logan. Viper likes to use her acidic breath to spread a ""death kiss"" or leave marks on those that provoke her anger, even peeling away her skin at one point when suffering a bad fall towards the end.

","This is not another light and fluffy comic book super hero movie. This movie actually has depth and substance to it, and there are not fight scenes taking place every few minutes like in most comic book movies lately. It is more of a deep character study of the Wolverine.
