21 January 2023,dmansel,4," one of the most discouraging movies of 2023
","A cautionary tale that follows a family as it struggles to reunite after falling apart. The Son centers on Peter (Hugh Jackman), whose hectic life with his infant and new partner Beth (Vanessa Kirby) is upended when his ex-wife Kate (Laura Dern) appears at his door to discuss their son Nicholas (Zen McGrath), who is now a teenager. The young man has been missing school for months and is deeply troubled. Peter strives to take care of Nicholas as he would have wanted his own father (Anthony Hopkins) to have taken care of him while juggling his and Beth's new son, and at work an offer of a dream position in Washington. However, by reaching for the past to correct its mistakes, he loses sight of how to hold onto Nicholas in the present.",/review/rw8837560/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2023,hanleycaleb,8," Shocked by the reviews
","I actually really liked this movie. I believe it tells a good story about family as their son struggles with a mental illness. The biggest problem with this movie is that some of its line deliveries come off as weird and unnatural. Also there is a scene that is mentioned but we do not actually see it. This movie is not an easy watch. The movie gets to be very heavy at certain moments. Even with all of those problems the movie is carried by a great performance by Huge Jackman and Lora Dern. This movie gives great insight into what it is like to be battle with a mental illness. Some people may not like this as much as me, but this is a really good movie.",/review/rw8837560/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2022,hodafadl_888,8," Real and painful
","It felt personal somehow, when thinking of myself in all their places. It is so hard and devastating. I sometimes see that look in my father's eyes, and sometimes in my mother's or my sister's, sometimes I have these mixed feelings and the deep conviction that I don't desire to keep on living, but I don't know how anyone else can survive this, anyone else that's similar to Nicholas. Such a real and painful movie. I don't know why it touched me so deep, and why it made me cry so hard, it felt too personal. And it makes you think, what can anyone do really? What can we do, and is it anyone's fault?",/review/rw8837560/?ref_=tt_urv

13 September 2022,tshipton72,4," I tried so hard to like it.
",I came into the theater with my bar set fairly low due to reviews coming out of the Venice Film Festival. Even with my bar set at it's lowest setting I found this film never reaches its full potential. The Son could have been so great. Hugh Jackman's and Vanessa Kirby's performances were excellent. Sadly I found Zen McGrath's performance to be one note making it very hard to connect to the character. He continually had a crying face but no tears were shed. I found myself laughing in parts that were supposed to be serious and sad. Having experienced mental health issues personally and within my family over the years this film missed the mark. I left the theater feeling sad that this film could have been something great. When I should have been feeling sad for the characters.,/review/rw8837560/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2023,ferguson-6,5," son of a son
","Greetings again from the darkness. Writer-director Florian Zeller floored me a couple of years ago with his film, THE FATHER (2021). Adapted from Zeller's own play by screenwriter Christopher Hampton (DANGEROUS LIAISONS, 1988), the film starred Anthony Hopkins who gave a searing performance that provided painful insight into what living with dementia must be like - both for the sufferer and for loved ones. Zeller, Hampton, and Hopkins all won Oscars for that film, and they return for this follow-up ... a film that doesn't hold a candle to its predecessor, despite begging us to think otherwise.",/review/rw8837560/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2022,onderks,4," Where is the character development?
","The parents clearly were not equipped to deal with their sons mental illness and I was rooting for them to understand they needed to get him professional help and pay more attention. Then right at the end when it seems they do understand, they fall back into their old habits and take him home?!?! It is not like the signs were very subtle, he told them multiple times he found life to hard to experience. And if the parents learned how to deal with that, if we would see more development within the father through his relationship with his father then maybe there would have been something interesting happen.",/review/rw8837560/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2022,ylavinski,10," Amazing film. Must see for all couples
","I saw it yesterday the ZÃ¼rich Film Festival. It shook me to my foundation. It was like looking in the mirror for two hours. My own position in life: twice divorced successful father with four children, the way the son in the film looks, behaves, and even his passion - writing are strikingly similar to my younger son, now 27. I felt like someone recorded conversations with my children and spouses. It is word to word... The successful father is a curse for his children, or can be... The father of the father in the film is very much like my late father was. The mother in the film is exactly like both of my ex-spouses.",/review/rw8837560/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2022,katiefanatic-791-306918,7," I found myself on the stepmothers side.
","I'm officially old enough that I found myself on the stepmothers side. When an almost adult is behaving like such a child, you've just got to get on with life and ignore his whims. I suffer depression myself but I should add a disclaimer that I have a birth defect and disabled. I realized this film makes me have a hard time with empathy. I have actual problems, this kid was behaving like a brat. At some point, his father should have given up and focused on the new family he was neglecting. I kept waiting for this film to give me a reason to care about this kid and it just didn't. Wonderful performances by the adults concerned about their kid, it just wasn't warranted after a while. Add to that the very colossal mistake they made that turns this film into a real tragedy, you've got a mess on your hands. Hugh Hackman deserves the oscar for this film. He really did the best he could with the material as a father fighting for his son really hard, but I'm just not sure the whole picture is worth seeing.",/review/rw8837560/?ref_=tt_urv

29 January 2023,berndgeiling,5," A Depressed Son
","Unlike Florian Zeller's brilliant The Father the second part disappoints on many levels, except an emotional, but nevertheless predictable finale it's missing something. Authenticity. The real Magic just doesn't happen. They're not digging deep enough to make us believe in the devastating consequences of a clinical depression.",/review/rw8837560/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2023,Sees All,6," Collateral Damage from the Sins of the Father
","I was reminded of a movie from 1985 called TWICE IN A LIFETIME. In that one, Gene Hackman left his wife (Ellen Burstyn) for younger, more vivacious Ann-Margret. He lived happily after and everybody else accepted it. But I didn't believe it for a second. In this one, Hugh Jackman has left Laura Dern for somewhat younger Vanessa Kirby and started a new life with a new baby boy. Dern and their teenage son (Zen McGrath) were supposed to just suck it up and get over it. But they didn't. The son especially is in bad shape. This movie is a heck of a lot more honest than TWICE IN A LIFETIME. It is both painful and sad. When the son starts having serious emotional problems, they work it out so that he goes to live with his father and the new wife. Everyone tries to make it work, but it doesn't it. The story is brilliantly acted by the four principal players and Anthony Hopkins, in a dazzling cameo as Jackman's father. The trouble with this film is that there's really no place it can go. It's an untenable situation and no matter what anyone does, the past cannot be changed. Based on a French play, Le Fils, its stage roots show. It isn't claustrophobic, but it IS really talky. The actors handle the dialogue quite well, but their silent moments are every bit as powerful as their big speeches. Jackman, especially, gives a masterful performance in which he runs the gamut of emotions. His final scene is a real tear-jerker, but the part I liked best was when he danced. This is when filmgoers get a brief glimpse of Jackman the charismatic stage performer. (Please let him do more of this in future films!) This movie is a soap opera-a well-done soap opera, but nonetheless, that IS what it is.",/review/rw8837560/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2022,bernpicc,1," Worst acting, worst script.
","I'm embarrassed for these wonderful actors. I never realized how important a script is to making a good film. Good writing inspires good acting. Without it actors are stuck with just words. This film has some terrific actors who can only do so much with this bad script. The only reason I watched it to the end is because I'm a voting member of the Directors Guild. The pacing is slow and laborious. The outside shots are nothing I recognize as New York City. I also didn't know that these wonderful actors, Laura Dern and Hugh Jackman could be so limited by a bad script. Vanessa Kirby and Anthony Hopkins came off much better, maybe because they had fewer lines.",/review/rw8837560/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2023,nogodnomasters,2," Just Get Over It
","Peter (Hugh Jackman) and Kate (Laura Dern) are divorced. Peter has moved on with Beth (Vanessa Kirby) and the have an infant son. Kate shows up at their door and complains she has issues with Nicolas that she can't deal with. She asks Peter to help. Nicholas is dealing with depression since the divorce and is in a dark place. He moves in with Peter and Beth and Beth is not too pleased. Things start to go better, but suddenly turns worse as our more than moody teen goes off the deep end.",/review/rw8837560/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2023,Alexander_Blanchett,8," Hugh Jackman is The Son
","I think I am one of the very few people who really loved this and got emotionally very engaged to it. Yes it is inferior to ""The Father"" but that was to be expected as ""The Father"" was one of the true masterpieces of the last years. This is more conventional and straight forward.",/review/rw8837560/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2023,harveyjanice-36384,1," should come with a warning label
","Where to begin? Start with the script. The dialogue sounds like an after-school special. Paced like a snail on Xanax. Move along, for God's sake! Looking pensive and pained seemed to be the only direction given to the actors. ""I'm in pain!"" is the only line the teen offered to describe his depression...over and over. This kid's performance is just plain awful. How Laura Dern, Hugh Jackman and Anthony Hopkins got roped into this dog is a mystery, though Hopkins only logs about 5 minutes. By the film's conclusion, I didn't care what happened to any of the characters, I just wanted MY pain to end.",/review/rw8837560/?ref_=tt_urv
