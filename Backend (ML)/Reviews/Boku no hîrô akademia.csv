",I'll reserve my rating for now. As far as the pilot.... I've got mixed feelings.,/review/rw7593110/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2021,mspeed44,7," Petersen and Fox need more screen time!
","I've watched CSI since its beginning and looked forward to this 10 episode reboot because of Grissom, Sara and Brass. Disappointed. Brass for 2 episodes for a few minutes. Grissom and Sara get 8 minutes per episode to solve a crime that could set 1000s free.",/review/rw7593110/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2021,aarongallagher1,6," Rewatched original.
",Have watched 1st 6 episodes with high anticipation not having watched the original for quite a few years.,/review/rw7593110/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2021,yooniverse,3," Salvageable, but Mandeep Dhillon needs to go
","The cast seems like they can be salvaged and could start gelling, but Dhillon sticks out like a sore thumb. I liked her in After Life, but she's just awful here. She needs to be sent off.",/review/rw7593110/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2021,A_Different_Drummer,4," In a parallel universe...
","I am sitting in my chair watching in the proper sequence all the original CSI Vegas seasons with Grissom and crew. OK. I lied. That was not actually a parallel universe. That was a bulk DVD order from Amazon. But the point is the same. The point is that, because I am as familiar with the originals as if I were just watching them yesterday -- WHICH I WAS! -- I can do a solid compare & contrast. And this new series does not come close. The original not only had top-drawer production values, sure, but the personal dynamics were the glue. If memory serves, a survey done at the time found that, if Americans had been able to pick their ideal boss, it would have been Grissom. That was the magic. And the magic is gone.((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

18 November 2021,Whiskey-Jack,1," Not even close...
","I tuned in because of Grissom's return and to a certain extent, Sarah.",/review/rw7593110/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2021,jacquelinesandra-34671,1," Why?
","If in 2021 you can't make a CSI show accurate then there's a problem. I don't care to see the cast perfectly all made up , are they going to a fashion show or investigate a murder? That's why I prefer British tv shows, at least they are wearing the full gear and make things interesting. The writing is very poor, this show used to be great, what have they done?",/review/rw7593110/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2022,nsset,1," How does this awful show get these ratings?
","Everything about this is fake. The new cast are unwatchable, unconvincing, fake personas, bad makeup, unrelatable. Paula Newsome and Mandeep Dhillon are the worst of the bunch. I love strong women characters but omg these two are doing an awful job of convincing us or being relatable. Pity Grissom and Sara play second fiddle to this lot.",/review/rw7593110/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2021,confidential-67897,6," Ok in parts
",The major problem with this is that the actress they have chosen to play the lead is just a lead actress. She was ok in castle when she played a supporting actress but just isn't up to carry a show like CSI. Needs to be recast.,/review/rw7593110/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2021,telavivid,," Preliminary Judgement: Oy Vey
","As an ardent CSI fan, I have watched every single CSI episode in existence (including the spin-offs). So as far as the present series are concerned:",/review/rw7593110/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2021,yooniverse,3," If not for nostalgia...
","I'm watching it due to the return of Petersen, Fox, Langham, etc. But it feels like a hand-off to the new cast. The return of the original cast members provides some continuity while rebooting the show. But if you're not watching for the nostalgia, I wouldn't bother. Once the Hodges arc is done, will the original cast members stay on or be written out? The new cast is bland and woke with no personality or chemistry, so I wouldn't keep watching. CBS desperately needs to revive this franchise. What's next? CSI: Miami revival with Caruso and Procter? That could be fun, too...",/review/rw7593110/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2021,jdonalds-5,3," Not CSI
","My wife and I watched the entire original CSI series which was set in Las Vegas. We even own some of the original episodes on DVD. We never came to like CSI Miami mostly because of the odd behavior of David Caruso, but did also like CSI NY with Gary Sinise. We were excited to hear CSI would be returning in Vegas, and that some of the original characters and actors would be involved. CSI was a big influence on our video watching habits. But this new series isn't CSI. I don't know what it is but it misses on several fronts.",/review/rw7593110/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2021,marymcfarland-01866,4," 2nd Review with Rating 3 eps in
",Unfortunately....this couldn't hold my attention. I tuned in for Grissom and Brass...I never much liked Sara...and never gave a crap about Hodgins.,/review/rw7593110/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2021,tsidney,6," Disappointing
","I was soooo looking forward to this. I have the original series on dvd and it truly was my fave show. Lovely intro to Grissom. And then epi 2. Awful. He's acting like an old man. It's like he and Hodges have forgotten who they were at one time. Could be the writing too. There's no chemistry between any of them. They've lost the ""thing"" that made it such a special show. I will watch just cuz. But very disappointed.",/review/rw7593110/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2021,nichope,3," What's worse acting or writing
","Loved the original show, but with the combination of the new actors and new writers the stories have holes and gaps and the actors couldn't pull off a perfect script if the were given one.",/review/rw7593110/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2023,dklecan,4," did any of these actors take acting classes?
","I Love murder mysteries, police procedurals and British murder Mysteries and the old CSI. So I Was excited to see a reboot of CSI Vegas... one of my favorite shows.",/review/rw7593110/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2021,cujorocky,1," Lousy reboot
","Very inferior to the original. Lousy new actors. Boring, drab, unlikeable, uninspiring actors. Lead actress is awful. An Indian woman with a British accent so sharp its hard to understand her. A bland white guy. A very creepy coroner. And Gil and Sarah look like their own parents now. They are outsiders looking in. I
The scripts are crappy and unwatchable. To be blunt: it sucks.",/review/rw7593110/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2021,abcprivateemail,1," Supremely disappointed
","I was a huge fan of the original, especially the Gil Grissom days. Had high hopes for this reboot, but haven't been able to go beyond the first few episodes yet because I've been so disappointed by them. The returning characters are fine, but casting and writing of new characters was horrendous, and seems like they let a teenage boy do it. Not a single one has any gravitas like the original show did. They seem like charicatures. Writing of the introduction of those new characters and the serial Hodges plot (once again disappointed to see a reboot change a good episodic show to at least partially a serialized show... Picard did this previously) was equally amateurish. The new leader of the crime lab explaining how Sara was added to the team without problems had my jaw on the floor, stunned by how badly that was revealed. Character flaws or eccentricities are way too obvious and extreme, except for the leader who bores me to tears. I'll probably give it another chance if I get really bored some day, hoping that some writers got replaced or learned on the job, but for now, just really disappointed.",/review/rw7593110/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2021,dskaff,2," Cheesey. Not the old CSI
","Living off the old CSI reputation. Too cheesey. New actors don't have the same luster. When they finally wean Will, Jorja & Paul out, the show will die. And what's this Hodges...now you see him now you don't? The rest of the cast are always looking for a motel room and making eyes at each other. Silly!",/review/rw7593110/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2021,day25,9," Yay, it's back but....
","So happy when I saw this was back but I'm not so sure about the newbies. I love William and Jorja of course but are they gonna be regulars are is this just for a few episodes. If so, I would rethink the cast. Sorry but I Love the originals.",/review/rw7593110/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2021,holtdeborah,4," CSI Las Vegas, the reboot 2021
","So far I am not impressed, and was so excited, I was expecting all of the old csi's, and all these new people aren't very impressive. But hey maybe its just me, maybe its because I love the old cast so much. I almost cried. Its too many newbies to count. Actors I have no idea who they are. The end.. (and lots of filler ads sorry folks )",/review/rw7593110/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2021,libertysanders,," Blah
",I made it halfway through the episode and gave up. The new supporting cast is as weak as 3.2 beer. This is a pale imitation of the old show.,/review/rw7593110/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2021,pskurrie-28496,4," Bland
",OMG so bland. Ticks all the woke boxes I suppose.,/review/rw7593110/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2021,cmabernier,3," Die Hard CSI fan losing interest
","Never thought I would say this about CSI and the Vegas universe but this is just not gripping me in anyway except the slight interest on how it will turn out with the Hodges storyline. If Grissom and Sara weren't on the show, I would have stopped halfway through episode one with no regrets. I can't understand most of what Mandeep is saying she mumbles too much. Her partner is boring AF. Zero chemistry with anyone in the new cast. I'm glad it's almost over but if they bring in a season two. Clean house and read these reviews.",/review/rw7593110/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2021,srhona-23974,1," I was hoping for so much more..
",The acting is awful. The scenes between Sarah and Grissom are ridiculous. He found her ring that she was so upset about. No hug. No affection. The show is really beyond bad. No comparison to the original. None. Over and out.,/review/rw7593110/?ref_=tt_urv
