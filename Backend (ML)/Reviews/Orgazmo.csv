6 May 2019,Hitchcoc,9," Heartbreaking but That's the Real World
","I know that a lot of the criticism is that this movie didn't get down and dirty enough. Alzheimers is a horrible thing for the survivors to deal with. Perhaps it can only truly by dealt with in documentary form. Julianne Moore is utterly amazing and anyone who says this film isn't well researched did not read about her approach. Yes, there are things that could have been shown to make it even more frightening. We could have seen specific bodily functions affected. We could have seen more irrationality and pain. But it needs to be accessible. I believe if we are watching a fictional account, this is very well done.",/review/rw3169408/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2015,dhainline1,10," What Would You Do If You Began to Show Signs of Alzheimer's Disease?
","Julianne Moore's character of Alice Howland has to face that eventuality in the wonderful, heart-breaking movie ""Still Alice."". Alice is a 50-year-old woman with a charmed life. She is happily married to Dr. John Howland, played by Alec Baldwin. Their son, Tom is training to be a doctor, daughter, Anna is married, pregnant with twins, and a lawyer, youngest daughter, Lydia played by Kristen Stewart who has matured as an actress since the ""Twilight"" series, is an aspiring actress. All of the performers are great, but Kristen Stewart surprised me the most and she broke the Bella Swan type-cast trap. In her job as a language professor, Alice needs her brain in order to give lectures and write books. When her brain basically craps out on her during a lecture at the college, Alice is confused by why her sharp mind has suddenly failed her. Alice's memory lapses have her confused and upset. She goes to a neurologist who tests her memory. After much testing, the doctor says Alice has an inherited form of Alzheimer's disease she got from her late father. He tells her to have her children tested to see if their late grandfather gave them the faulty gene. Anna tests positive for the gene, Tom tests negative, and stubborn Lydia refuses to take the test. In the end, Alice gets worse and worse. Her twin grandson and granddaughter are healthy, but it is heart-breaking their grandmother won't remember them. Lydia takes up the reins as her mother's caregiver and the most heart-wrenching thing about the movie is how much this horrible disease takes away so much from its victims.",/review/rw3169408/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have a sister in law at age 66 with end stage ALZ and I myself have stage 4 terminal brain cancer at age 62. I haven't been able to adequately and satisfactorily articulate the effect of loss of memory as well as this movie did. I have lost everything, but I have memories that bubble to the surface that keep me going. Life is not about stuff. Life is animating memories.",/review/rw3169408/?ref_=tt_urv

2 April 2015,ketgup83,8," Julianne Moore is electrifying which is enough to make you watch the film
","Best part of watching a Oscar nominated film is that some unique constraint is always attached to it - be it direction , screenplay , story or acting. Now acting is what make Still Alice immensely watchable and Julianne Moore gives the performance of her life time.",/review/rw3169408/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2014,potter98,8," Still Alice
","Still Alice is a realistic and emotional story of a woman living with Alzheimer's disease. Julianne Moore successfully shows the struggle, confusion, anger, pain and isolation of having such a disease through her incredible performance. She allows the audience to see what having Alzheimer's could possibly be like. This film also has an amazing screenplay, a screenplay that is raw and honest. There is also a great ensemble performance from the cast, featuring Alec Baldwin as the supportive and loving husband. The movie definitely makes the viewer think deeply about aspects of life such as memories, family, loss and bewilderment which are all addressed in Still Alice. See this film for a moving story, but mostly for Moore's miraculous performance. It wouldn't be a surprise if she won Best Actress in the upcoming Academy Awards.",/review/rw3169408/?ref_=tt_urv

1 February 2018,TheLittleSongbird,6," The horrors of Alzheimers
","Saw 'Still Alice' to see how Julianne Moore's universally praised performance would fare and also to see how the film would do portraying an illness as cruel as Alzheimers.

19 December 2014,MattBrady099,6," Moore at her freaking best in this film
","Forgetting something has to be the most annoying and stressful thing that a person could have, but losing your memory by a disease and becoming coming pretty much brain dead is even worse and this movie plays it out very well, because the movie feels real and not fake like other movies that try to do that.",/review/rw3169408/?ref_=tt_urv

17 February 2015,miy66,9," Wow, Julianne Moore,
","This movie is incredible! It's script is not overly complicated and the story is simply told. Julianne as Alice really blew me away. Particularly the scene between her and Alec Baldwin, her on screen hubby John. Alice is saying she thinks something is really wrong, and he is not really hearing or taking her too seriously. She then starts to sob, and it's is so sincere I found myself having a cry in the theatre myself. There are a couple of moments like these as the nasty disease Alzheimer's really reveals itself. It's a lovely acted movie by all, but for me, Julianne Moore is simply outstanding and I really hope there's an Oscar in it for her. There are several scenes where the ugliness of Alzheimer's shows itself and you realise the incredible impact this would have on a family. Go see this movie for two reasons, Julianne Moore and to learn a bit more about this insidious disease!",/review/rw3169408/?ref_=tt_urv

","Julianne Moore's performance is the prime reason for watching this movie.

","Based on the novel by Lisa Genova, Richard Glatzner and Wash Westmoreland's Still Alice is the story of Alice Howland (Julianne Moore), a fifty-year-old Professor of Linguistics at Columbia University who has been diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. A strong and brilliant woman, whose identity has been strengthened by the roles she has played in life, is forced to create a new one based on the only reality she knows - the present moment. While Moore's understated yet powerful performance which has earned her a much-deserved Oscar nomination, convincingly conveys the tragedy of someone losing their identity, she never lets us forget who she really is behind her growing incapacitation.",/review/rw3169408/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2015,moonspinner55,5," Aside from isolated moments of moving human drama, surprisingly fraudulent...
","Directors and co-writers Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland, working from Lisa Genova's novel, do not have an attuned ear for everyday familial conversation. ""Still Alice"", about a (rather wealthy) 50-year-old linguistics professor named Alice who is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease, opens with a dinner sequence (at a posh restaurant with a gorgeous view) wherein none of the actors around the table resembles each other or who speaks in the same rhythm. It's important to note that the professor and her husband (who is usually on the couch 'working' on his laptop) have money and eat well; this affords Glatzer and Westmoreland the opportunity to push ahead with their melodramatic agenda and not have the characters be concerned about finance. Julianne Moore won the Best Actress Oscar for her performance as Alice; she's good, but then Moore has always been a fine, reliable actress. She doesn't do anything different here than in her previous films. Alec Baldwin, on the other hand, portraying Alice's rock-solid spouse, has used up all of his dramatic resources as an actor. He has played so many shady characters that he inadvertently invests this non-character with a suspicious undercurrent (he's always pursuing his lips in thought, or tossing back his head in fake merriment). Kristen Stewart is given the most screen-time of the couple's three grown children, and she's also the only one of the three who looks involved in the proceedings (it's a commendable, though forgettable performance). As to the narrative, we are offered some interesting facts about Alice's disease, the most devastating of which is that the gene is almost always passed down from the parent to the child. Alice's trips to the neurologist are far more gripping than her daily life speaking, walking, running, puttering about her homey digs in New York City or gazing at the ocean from her summer home in Nassau County. I don't know what world these filmmakers are from, but I would suspect it comes rent-free. ** from ****",/review/rw3169408/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2014,Cinnyaste,4," Ultimately Unaffecting

24 January 2015,john_seater,4," Routine, sanitized, ultimately uninteresting
