8 November 2018,TheMovieDoctorful,10," The Tragedy of Megan Fox
","Jennifer's Body depresses me. It doesn't depress me because of its more tragic aspects, as the film has plenty of levity. It certainly doesn't depress me because of a supposed lack of quality, as I consider the film easily one of the best Horror movies of the 2000s. Jennifer's Body depresses me because of how people reacted to it. How the marketing framed an LGBT Horror film directly for the consumption of men. How geek culture pre-emptively trashed the film solely for its leading actress, the notoriously angry, non-conformist, anti-Conservative and non-compliant Megan Fox. How male ""feminists"" sl*t shamed Megan Fox in reviews and trashed the film's fans as nothing but horny morons. That stuff gets under my skin. That stuff pisses me off. And for good reason, as the film we ended up getting is absolutely fantastic.",/review/rw5845344/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'm quite surprised by the voting the movie received. But then again it goes to show you, that there are quite a few different tastes out there. Jennifers Body isn't the best movie, not this year and definitely not of all time. But it's exactly what you should expect from a movie like this.",/review/rw5845344/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2013,ambrakay,8," Grossly mismarketed
","The writer, Diablo Cody, has stated that she never meant for this to be categorized as a ""horror"" film, which is precisely what happened. This movie is a fine example of a dark comedy. The dialogue is very quotable, and, if you have a twisted sense of humor and enjoy sarcasm (as I do), you will enjoy this movie. The ""scary"" scenes aren't scary; there is a lot of over the top gore. Essentially, this movie mocks teen horror flicks. It plays off of the emo trend to create ironic humor, and the laughs come when you least expect them. It also has a respectable soundtrack. If you've yet to see this, I recommend it as a rental for a night in. You will be entertained. Please realize that this is a comic gem full of snark and wit, and don't expect to be frightened. Sit back and enjoy it for what it is; entertainment.",/review/rw5845344/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2020,Avwillfan89,10," The forgotten horror gem

29 December 2015,paul_haakonsen,6," Actually not that bad...
","I have to admit that I was initially fearing that ""Jennifer's Body"" was going to be another generic teenage horror movie. But luckily it turned out to transcend mediocrity and be more than an average teenage horror.",/review/rw5845344/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2012,Coventry,6," Always double-check your virgin before sacrificing!
","Wow okay, I got to admit that this movie was not twice, not five times, but at least ten times better than I expected! Quite frankly, I deliberately ignored ""Jennifer's Body"" until I could watch it for free when it aired on TV. I assumed it would be just another lame teen horror movie, in the likes of the ""Twilight"" series or something, exclusively aimed at boys and girls in their puberty and revolving on the popularity issues of fresh-faced high school kids. That'll teach me to automatically assume that everything is crap nowadays! ""Jennifer's Body"" benefices from a fairly imaginative and smoothly written scenario – courtesy of ""Juno"" writer Diablo Cody – and contains surprisingly many moments of sheer old-fashioned gore horror. Additionally, the film has a compelling narrative and more than decent acting performances from the leads as well as the supportive cast. Cheerleader babe Jennifer and bookworm geek Needy attend a rock concert in the town's smuttiest bar, but only narrowly survive when the place burns to the ground. Jennifer joins the bizarrely alternative punk rock band members in their van and into the dark night, but when she reappears at Needy's doorstep later that night, she behaves disturbingly weird and hostile. During the next few days, when the entire town is mourning over the fire's casualties, Jennifer develops herself into an even hotter and more seductive girl than she already was, but actually now she needs the boys' flesh to maintain her beauty. For you see, the band guys were actually a bunch of Satanists who intended to sacrifice a virgin in return for fame & fortune. However, not being from around town, they were unaware that Jennifer is the town's floozy and therefore definitely not suitable virgin sacrifice material (""I'm not even a backdoor-virgin anymore"", she confesses to her friend). The ritual turned Jennifer into a lewd yet ferocious demon, and all the boys in town are extremely easy victims. I really like the concept of a satanic sacrifice going wrong, as well as all the creative sub plots and different story angles. ""Jennifer's Body"" is a 100% feminist accomplishment, as also the director is a woman (Karyn Kusama of ""Aeon Flux""). It's definitely not the greatest horror movie ever made, but I don't think any of these women aimed for that. It provides good, occasionally tense even, entertainment accomplished with the right mentality and enthusiasm.",/review/rw5845344/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2021,Calicodreamin,7," High School Succs
","A wild ride from start to finish. A unique storyline with a strange sexual grossness, and corny lines from the late 2000s. Seyfried and Fox are perfectly cast and sell this crazy mess for all its worth.",/review/rw5845344/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2021,bowmanblue,8," As if the teenage years weren't stressful enough
","I remember when I first watched 2009's 'Jennifer's Body.' I thought it was great. It was only when I looked online that I realised it had been a bit of a flop at the Box Office and was taking a critical mauling from the critics. Now, over ten years later, I've given it another watch... and I still love it!",/review/rw5845344/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2020,rehana-s-kazi,9," Underrated
",This movie has always been one of the best horror/dark comedy movies I have seen. It's underrated because the studio tried to objectify poor Megan Fox to market this movie after Transformers came out. The acting and movie are good. I cared about the characters.,/review/rw5845344/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2010,kdnor2011,7," Creepy, funny, and etertaining
","Jennifer and Needy have been friends since childhood. Now in high school, people can't believe that the two are friends, Jennifer, the hot cheerleader, and Needy the geek. All seems well until Jennifer drags Needy to a club to see a band. A fire erupts, and Jennifer is taken with the band. When she comes back, she seems different, she occasionally gets uglier, she always acts like a bitch, and she wears pink and acts all happy while everyone else is morning the loss of some of the students. Why does she act this way, because she has been possessed by a demon. The only way she is able to stay pretty and young is to feed on teenage boys. Now Needy must find a way to rid her friend of the demon, before anyone else is killed.",/review/rw5845344/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2009,jaddison383,7," The Incompletion of Great Premise...
","When Jennifer's Body was first announced to me, I met the idea with cautious curiosity. The idea of Megan Fox playing an evil high school beauty queen who eats the boys she seduces sounded... interesting, to say the least. When the trailer finally emerged, I got excited. Seriously. The combination of thrilling and funny hadn't been explored well at the theater in a long time.",/review/rw5845344/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2009,c_p_c,7," A worthy film not deserving of all the hate.
","It has been some time since I've written a review on this site, but I felt this movie and its current underwhelming performance at the box office warrants some good press. ""Jennifer's Body"" is a very entertaining film, and is sure to be one that many discover in its DVD release, which according to interviews, director Karyn Kusama has material she is anxious to release.",/review/rw5845344/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2010,TxMike,," Quite a good and entertaining horror comedy with a novel story.
","I happened to see two ""comedy horror"" movies back-to-back, this one and the Rodriguez ""Planet Terror"" movie. This one is better in every way. Even though ""Jennifer's Body"" is a parody it never goes for ha-ha type of funny. It is funny in the situations and the dialog, and how the ""teenagers"" handle what is a pretty serious situation, someone killing and eating teenage boys.",/review/rw5845344/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2018,BandSAboutMovies,6," Not bad...
","Jennifer's Body was written by Diablo Cody, who became known for the blog and book Candy Girl: A Year in the Life of an Unlikely Stripper, as well as the screenplay for Juno. Since then, she's done script revisions on the new Evil Dead as well as writing Ricki and the Flash and Tully.",/review/rw5845344/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2010,KieranCoughlan,8," There isn't anything wrong with a movie being fun
","Clearly this is a movie that polarizes opinion, but I'd urge anyone with a taste for black comedy to give Jennifer's Body a chance. Having finally seen it, I enjoyed myself so much that I was left a little mystified that so many people seem to hate it.",/review/rw5845344/?ref_=tt_urv

","7/10 - very campy, very funny, and memorable feminist horror comedy is Megan Fox at her best and is certainly worth of the cult following it has developed.",/review/rw5845344/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2010,michaelRokeefe,7," Hell is a teenage girl.
","It sure helps to have Megan Fox star as a newly possessed serial killer. Karyn Kusama directs this black comedy from the pen of Diablo Cody. Sultry and seductive Jennifer(Fox)and nerdy Needy(Amanda Seyfried) are BFF's and the two slip off to a tavern to see a rock band play. The tavern burns to the ground; the two BFF's survive, but Jennifer runs off with the band, who actually are a group of devil followers ready to make a sacrifice. Jennifer returns bloody and not exactly her hotter than hot self. Jen has an insatiable appetite for human flesh, particularly male flesh. Best friend Needy takes it on her own to stop Jennifer's reign of terror.",/review/rw5845344/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2021,FeastMode,7," misunderstood

26 December 2009,Sirus_the_Virus,8," I'd rather watch more of Jennifer's body than Twilight.
","Diablo Cody, after winning the Oscar for her first film Juno, returns with Jennifer's body. Jennifer's body obviously isn't perfect. But there is a ton to admire. Cody once again gives us the ultimate screenplay. There are lines like""Of course it's true I read it on Wikipedia"" or ""It's the best thing Jesus created since the calendar"". Those kind of lines are used in Juno. That was a brilliant film. Mostly thanks to Ellen Page's performance.",/review/rw5845344/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2009,neil-476,7," Well, what did you expect?
","Somehow I have my doubts as to whether Diablo Cody's Oscar for Juno's screen play is going to be joined by one for Jennifer's Body. Where Juno was a breath of fresh air, Jennifer's Body is a cheerfully trashy and utterly familiar high school teen horror with a dash of comedy thrown in.",/review/rw5845344/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2010,dejan8378,9," Better than what trailer shows
","Enjoyable movie, though not fits right in horror genre, but it doesn't even trying that, nor comedy since is more, witty, funny and smart than hilarious and in the end is more clever and emotional than usual. Unfortunately all that didn't leave much space for scares, tension, anticipation which are basis for the genre in which after all this movie belongs. Trying to much to redefine the genre and approach at all, the director and screenwriter has for the most of it succeeded, but still the before mentioned flaws are leaving a hole on the final product, a small one but it is there.",/review/rw5845344/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2020,Keemshave,6," Misunderstood and pretty underrated.
","By no means a great movie or even a very good one, but a movie that does not get credit for being an effect horror-comedy. As time goes on, I'm sure Jennifer's Body will be seen in a higher light and will gain more popularity in the film community. Megan Fox is actually very good in the film and shows that she does have some charisma that can be utilized in the right film.",/review/rw5845344/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2020,amberbowman-39964,10," Ahead of its Time
","This movie was released about ten years before it would be appreciated. It's a comedy that touches on the relationships between women and combating misogyny in everyday life. Fox delivers on dark humor and gives a refreshing performance that allows her to showcase the depths of her talent and subtlety. The movie overall is funny, dark and in a bizarre way heartwarming.",/review/rw5845344/?ref_=tt_urv
