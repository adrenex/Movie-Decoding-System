13 August 2006,cosmic_quest,5," Enjoyable but a bit too light-hearted
","Book adaptations rarely capture the excellence of the novel which they are based upon and though the same can be said for 'Stormbreaker', it still is a rather good film considering the fact it is mainly aimed at the pre-teen and young teen audience.",/review/rw2965344/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2010,TheLittleSongbird,6," Bright and breezy, but too predictable in terms of story
","Stormbreaker was a decent film; this is an opinion coming from someone who has little knowledge of the books. It isn't as innovative as Spy Kids, but it is decent. The special effects and the action are above average, the performances from Mickey Rourke, Ewan McGregor and Bill Nighy are great and Alex Petyfer is an appealing enough lead, the soundtrack is nice and the film goes along at a fast pace. However the storyline is very predictable and sometimes ludicrous, the script is a bit weak in places, I found Alicia Silverstone surprisingly irritating here and the cameos from Stephen Fry and Robbie Coltrane are too brief to allow them to shine properly.",/review/rw2965344/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2009,anthonyjlangford,6," A Novelist does not a screenwriter make
","Stormbreaker is the first film from Anthony Howowitz's successful Alex Rider novel series for Young Adults, think Cody Banks, Johnny English and James Bond.       ",/review/rw2965344/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2006,jrt_joe,1," What have you done?!
","I was so excited about this film. I absolutely love the books, and although the trailer of the movie implied a few silly changes had been made, I still thought it would be true to the heart of the book.",/review/rw2965344/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2020,ccoosthuysen,4," Someone sold their soul to get this made
",I watched this again after enjoying the series. The ensamble cast are a collection of incredibly famous and popular actors with a deep and rich talent pool. I can only assume that someone made a deal with the devil to get this made. The story has every trope and cliché you can think of. The acting is horrendous and most of the interactions make you cringe and roll your eyes so hard you could power a small English village with the static electricity generated.,/review/rw2965344/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2011,studioAT,6," Alex Rider's one and only screen mission
",The Alex Rider books have been very successful so therefore it is a shame that they couldn't have been converted into a franchise. All the signs are there in this film that the production company wanted it to be one but sadly box office takings meant that dream faded fast. As a stand alone film Stormbreaker is good but fans of the books will know there was so much more we could have seen in later films had they been made.,/review/rw2965344/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2006,lyndon_gray,9," Action packed fun for older children and adults
","I was at the World premiere in London and I was apprehensive about watching a film adaptation of a book as some of them work and others don't. This one definitely does. From the first minutes of the film, you know that you're in for a thrilling adventure. Alex Rider, played superbly by Alex Pettyfer, is very believable as a school kid thrown into the deep end by Bill Nighy who hams it up brilliantly as spymaster Alan Blunt. Alex Rider is a deadly weapon on two legs as you'll see as the film progresses. Marvellous Micky Rourke, plays the evil villain who keeps a very unusual and deadly pet and looks as if he's just stepped off the set of a Revlon ad (you'll see!!). There's lots of action, some love interest, but that's not overplayed and although some of the evil characters look as if they've been loaned out from Cirque Du Soleil, including Micky Rourke, they play their parts as they should be, comically but with a twist of evil thrown in. It all works very well but Alex Pettyfer is a revelation. He plays the part coolly, calmly and with a great deal of conviction. I think Sean Connery would be proud of him. The film throws in a few James Bondesque clichés and there is one scene in the film which will remind you of a particular person from Goldfinger !! All in all highly enjoyable, my 11 year old niece and 14 year old nephew and their friends really enjoyed it and I think you will too.",/review/rw2965344/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2018,areatw,6," Passable Bond-for-kids action flick
","For a relatively unknown spy action thriller, 'Stormbreaker' is a surprisingly entertaining film, even if it does try a little too hard to be the kids' version of James Bond. As you would expect, this film is full of gimmicks and never takes itself too seriously, with a bunch of over-the-top action sequence and a shallow plot that feels like it is almost entirely built around the action.",/review/rw2965344/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2006,sg2790,3," oh what a dud
",I was really excited about watching this film. Being one of the first action movies with a kid being the centre of it. But i was so disappointed. I longed for it to get better and be less cheasy and annoying but it didn't work...arrgh i was so upset This film could have potentially been a great success in my books if the lead boy opened up his shell a bit more. I felt his acting was a bit reserved.,/review/rw2965344/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2006,Bing5253,9," Great movie that's fun for all ages
","Stormbreaker is an action packed, fun movie that anyone can enjoy. It's only ninety minutes so you won't get bored. It involves some great acting performances from Alex Pettyfer, Ewan Mcgregor and many more. Stormbreaker can be silly or unrealistic at times but it just adds a bit of humour to the movie. It even has some great action scenes, some quick car chases and some big stunts. Stormbreaker is made even better by the all star cast including Mickey Rourke, Ewan Mcgregor and Bill Nighy. They all make Stormbreaker better.",/review/rw2965344/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2006,bopdog,10," Hilarious and thrilling! The Real Deal... Brilliant entertainment!
","I was amazed by the high quality of this movie, and by how much I genuinely enjoyed it. I don't know anything about the Stormbreaker comic books, video games, or other geek, dork, nerd or teenage fetishes. Thus, I was a bit hesitant to go, after reading so many reader posts on the IMDb message boards regarding such topics. Because I like and respect Bill Nighy and Steven Fry and Alicia Silverstone so much, I decided to chance it. I was a bit shocked, not just that I endured it, nor even that it was somehow 'OK', but rather by the absolute top-notch and 'Speilberg-esque' high quality it was! I'd only say that because of the bubble-gummer advance buzz, though. Without that, I'd have just said it was excellent and stupendous, etc.",/review/rw2965344/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2006,general-melchett,8," Not a disappointment, but not a masterpiece.
","The Stormbreaker books were a huge success, but the same cannot be said for the film - it didn't make much money at all. Stormbreaker is slick to look at - the action scenes are not of the same calibre as American-made ones, but they are pretty thrilling, and the Stormbreaker itself, as well as all the gadgets, are very well-made and advanced - another successful book-to-film adaptation. So what went wrong for Stormbreaker?",/review/rw2965344/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2006,Inferius,10," An Excellent Film with An Excellent Cast
","Many people who have read the Alex Rider series were looking forward to this upcoming film which projects the amazing adventures of the teen spy onto the big screen, however many people were afraid this would turn into another Cody Banks film and be given a bad image because of the recent teen spy films That fear can now be forgotten!",/review/rw2965344/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2006,Stampsfightclub,8," Conventional but highly enjoyable
","From reading the best selling novel by Anthony Horowitz i knew i had to see this film, basically because the book was so good. My theory has always been the film is never as good as the book because it takes away all the imagination and enjoyment (Harry Potter a clear example) but this film is really enjoyable, obviously not as good as the book but still highly entertaining for all ages. The story deals with young Alex Rider coping with the death of his uncle and then being inducted into MI6. It is a very typical spy adventure with all the conventions expected: gadgets, cars, stereotypes of villains, heroes etc but all of these elements combine well to conform to the different ideologies the film presents. Some action scenes such as the bike and horse chases are over exaggerated and unbelievable but the majority of the film mirrors the book well and promotes unhealthy but funny and enjoyable realism. The acting was surprisingly good. Many told me it wouldn't be but Pettyfer, Silverstone, Rourke and Nighy especially all perform well as the interesting characters conform to their different persona's.

22 December 2006,Jonas_fan11,10," One of the best movies I have ever seen!
","When I fist heard about this movie I have very high expectations for it and it has most definitely met those expectations! This is a very good movie if you like movies where there is very rarely anybody sitting down. This is a major action film! I just got it about three days ago and I have already watched about 3 times! This is not very much based on the book, but it is still a wonderful movie! If you don't like adventure movies you might not like this, but you probably will like it. I could never get tired of this movie! It is just one of those movies where you can watch this movie a lot of times and it will always seem exciting! I most definitely recommend seeing this movie as soon as possible!",/review/rw2965344/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2006,whassupwestcoast,10," Very much a fun adventure film.
","I loved the trailers for Stormbreaker. My favourite quotes were ""Alex Rider...teenager...spy"", ""He's no child ...he's a lethal weapon"", ""Never send a man ... to do a boy's job"" and ""Alex isn't a spy... he's a 14 year old kid"" ",/review/rw2965344/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2006,embemparrotlover,5," A teenage boy becomes a spy to track down the mystery behind the new Stormbreaker computers.
","I came to watch this film because I have been a fan of the Alex Rider books for many years. However, I was rather disappointed by the film. The main problem was that the film was very different from the book, with many parts of the story changed and with parts added. The ending was entirely made up for the film. I disliked the way that many of the actors chosen had no resemblance to how the character was described in the book.",/review/rw2965344/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2006,ben-804,1," Ridiculous..
","This was by far the most absurd film i have ever seen. I know spy thrillers are supposed to be a bit over the top, but this takes is to far. Missi Pyle's character was probably the worst, it was so cliché it hurt. Mickey Rourke was OK but again an absurd stereotype. I have not read the book but i doubt it had as many plot holes as the film. The only mild bit of comedy was the parody of Odd Job but it was pushed to far and ruined. The ""bad guy"" has no gain from his ""evil plan"" and the ""girl"" appeared like 10 minutes before the totally unbelievable ending. In short almost every actor lived up to his/her typecast and yet again Hollywood produced a movie i was offended anybody spent money on.",/review/rw2965344/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2006,Needfire,7," Film for teens that isn't full of coarse language or nudity
",It's getting increasingly difficult for parents and guardians to share the experience of going to a theatre to watch a film with their teens. This might be an answer to this dilemma as long as you and your teens are in agreement about spending quality time together.,/review/rw2965344/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2011,Leofwine_draca,4," Silly attempt at a youthful Bond
","If watching a cast of actors mugging their way through a vapid and disinterested kid-friendly adventure film sounds like your cup of tea, then you might just enjoy STORMBREAKER. Those viewers with a decent amount of taste, however, will surely find it as difficult to sit through as I did: it's one of those lowest-common-denominator movies, an utterly puerile and crass attempt at money spinning.",/review/rw2965344/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2007,robert-temple-1,9," Excellent family action film with lots of witty touches
","This is what is known as great fun for all the family, that is at least for the males of the family, of all ages. It is extremely funny and full of ironical twists and touches to amuse the older viewers, while the younger ones will miss most of that and concentrate on the action, of which there is a limitless quantity. The incomparable Bill Nighy steals all his scenes as a neurotic head of the secret service, complete with his copyrighted facial twitches and wry mannerisms. There are some really witty lines of dialogue and equally witty scenes and situations. Many of the characters are outrageous caricatures, a la Batman, but even when grotesque they are extremely funny. The action is staggering. How do they do it? Alex Pettyfer is excellent as the fourteen year-old (yes, that's right!) hero, and Alicia Silverstone equally so as his nanny 'Jack'. This is really entertaining, and there is no blood and gore despite all the frenetic action, which is quite an achievement! This was made to be suitable for kids, but enjoyable for adults, and it succeeds on all counts. It is set entirely in London and Cornwall, with terrific aerial shots and astounding helicopter action sequences. Alex Pettyfer riding his bicycle through London at great speed has got to be the most exciting and hair-raising bicycle film sequence of all time.",/review/rw2965344/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2007,bob the moo,," Reasonably OK ""Bond for kids"" but it needed to be a lot more fun to prevent it seeming silly at times
","When teenage Alex Ryder's uncle Ian dies, Alex not only loses his adult guardian but also learns how little he knew of his uncle's ""boring"" job. For, you see, Ian was a top British spy and very good at his job (well, apart from the last twenty seconds of it). Ian's final mission is not complete though and his employer Alan Blunt needs someone to complete the undercover operation. Realising that Ian had been grooming (sorry  ""training"") Alex, Blunt sends him undercover as a student computer geek into the organisation of American Darius Sayle and his mysterious and ""Stormbreaker"" devices.",/review/rw2965344/?ref_=tt_urv

21 February 2014,Vincentiu,," James Bond. different level
","not inspired story. but it is an adaptation.not new special effects. but oldies are goldies. a film like many, many others. Alex Pettyfer charm and his unrealistic experiences, fight scenes and presence of Mickey Rourke are good points for a teen story in which basic source of humor is the exercise to be serious. short - all action film ingredients. a great show. and that is all. a teenager James Bond and the surprise to not be real boring. not for new tricks or for great acting but for the complicity of public and enthusiasm of fans. a nice film. and beginning for a series. so, nothing new. but nothing disappointed.",/review/rw2965344/?ref_=tt_urv
