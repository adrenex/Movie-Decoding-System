30 November 2013,SnoopyStyle,8," Jeremy Renner intense
","Four friends Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert Magloan (Slaine) and Desmond Elden (Owen Burke) are robbers working the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston. In their latest job, they take the bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage and then let her go. Doug fake dates Claire to make sure she can't ID them. He's also having sex with James' drugged out sister Krista Coughlin (Blake Lively). Meanwhile they are being investigated by the FBI led by Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm).",/review/rw2379899/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2010,Movie_Muse_Reviews,8," Affleck's second matches realism of the first and the fine ensemble carries the rest
","Ben Affleck's second feature film as a director -- if nothing else -- proves he's no fluke. In all the ways his sincere and revealing debut ""Gone Baby Gone"" succeeds, so does ""The Town."" Both are Boston-based crime dramas that are both touchingly dramatic at times yet gripping at others. More impressive with his work on ""The Town,"" however, is that it proves he could just as easily go on to direct an action blockbuster as he could an Oscar-winning drama.",/review/rw2379899/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2011,TheLittleSongbird,8," Smart and taut, with some fine ensemble acting
","The Town was one of my most anticipated movies and while it wasn't quite as great as I thought it would be it was still very good with some outstanding areas. The sex scene I agree was over too soon and needed a more rounded finish, and the film does get sappy and draggy toward the end.",/review/rw2379899/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2012,theinaniloquent,8," ""Welcome to bank robbery capital of America""
","The Town... The movie is good, no doubt about it. It was well-acted, well-written, and all around just a fantastic movie. Problem is, albeit the fantastic directing, it's contrived. I say that with a sense of greatness though, because although being this, is actually does it in a good way. Ben Affleck - yeah, the actor! - directs, and deserves praise. Why? Well he actually made a good movie, simple and to the point. But instead of going on and on about how good (but formulaic) the film is, I'm just going to break down the good things, and why Ben Affleck needs to direct more movies.

20 January 2011,lekgolah,8," Great performances all-round and directing make this well worth watching
","Despite not having seen Gone Baby Gone, I've heard a lot of good things about Ben Affleck's switch to directing and so I decided to watch The Town, which put simply is about band robbers but to expand on that, the film is also about the leader of the group, played by Ben Affleck. ",/review/rw2379899/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2010,Simon_Says_Movies,8," One of the finest pieces of ensemble acting in years
","To say that The Town is everything Takers tried to be and failed at would actually be an insult to Ben Affleck's latest film. Mentioning that bland rehashing in the same breath would imply they even exist on the same plane, but the honest truth is this gritty Boston crime drama is something special and the best film of the early fall season.",/review/rw2379899/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2012,gigan-92,10," Definitely Watch the Director's Cut
","I just wanted to say that on its own, the theatrical cut is a pretty damn awesome movie. Watching the extended cut is 10X even better. Simply put you get to see even more of the fascinating characters. Jon Hamm, while definitely playing the asshole, does quite nicely Rebecca Hall and Blake Lively are pretty awesome, the two creating a nice foil. And Peter Postlethwaite, rest his soul, is awesome in it. Jeremy Renner will go down in history as one of cinema's greatest bad-asses, that's for sure. And Ben Affleck, what can be said of Affleck? He not only starred in this, but co-wrote the screenplay and directed it. An aspiring Clint Eastwood figure? While films such as this are a great start, he has a long way to go before creating such a legacy, and he I hope he continues to make more great movies.",/review/rw2379899/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2010,Matt_Layden,8," Ben Affleck has his comeback.
","A bank robbery goes a little different than planned when one of the robbers takes a hostage. Doug (Affleck) has to duty to check up on the hostage after she is let go, to see if she knows anything about the crew. Surprise, they start dating. Can he continue his life of robbing banks and have a love life? Will his crew accept that he is with her? Will she ever find out? This is The Town. ",/review/rw2379899/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2010,blackmambamark,8," Take a bow Mr. Affleck....you have certainly earned it.
","My Oh My how Ben Affleck has had a up and down career. Starting out as the cheesy yet funny guy in those Kevin Smith flicks, to the academy award winning writer of ""Good Will Hunting"", all the way back down to the pathetic string of acting he produced only 10 years ago. But there is a silver lining....with his directorial debut in ""Gone Baby Gone"", and his much improved acting in ""Hollywoodland"". Ben Affleck is beginning to once again prove his worth in Tinsel Town. Hopefully he can continue to feverish pace.",/review/rw2379899/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2010,Jerique,9," I'll see you again...
","I was wrong about Ben Affleck. I never believed that Affleck was ever a star. I never saw him as a director-type. I do admit I was wrong, though. Ben Affleck was truly incredible as Doug McCray, and I've never seen him work his acting at such a high level. As far as the plot of the film goes, it's very engaging. The trailer doesn't give this film justice as it's very intense and romantic at times.",/review/rw2379899/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2012,Lejink,8," Let's go downtown...
","I remember laughing out loud at the aberration of a movie that was ""Pearl Harbour"" and in particular Ben Affleck's ""Kinda, sorta, coulda..."" chat-up line and haven't even seen ""Gigli"", but it's fair to say that with this and his earlier effort ""Gone Baby Gone"" he's certainly found his métier, not only in front, but also behind the camera.",/review/rw2379899/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2010,Eternality,6," The Town is a generic crime-thriller that offers nothing more than two hours of average entertainment.
","I react with some measure of disappointment to Ben Affleck's newest feature, The Town. Starring himself, Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker, 2009), and Rebecca Hall (Vicky Cristina Barcelona, 2008), this crime-heist thriller is set in Charlestown, Boston, where every other day there seems to be an armed robbery happening. Produced by Graham King, who won the Best Picture Oscar for Scorsese's The Departed (2006), which is also set in Boston, The Town is a generic crime-thriller that offers nothing more than two hours of average entertainment.",/review/rw2379899/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2011,Hitchcoc,7," That Tug at Personal Morality
","I always get caught short on the idea of the glorification of someone whose life revolves around the deaths of others, whose ""occupation"" is to steal from those who have no say in anything. What I mean is, our hero is not there to dole out justice or to even a score, he's a two bit punk who happens to be smoother and more handsome than the others around him. In the process, he begins to become more human because of falling into a relationship. I know that this attitude would negate ""The Godfather"" or any of the wise-guy movies so popular over time. So I enjoy the development of the characters, even if I have not one scintilla of admiration for them. The ugliness of the Boston streets works well here as does the criminal element and the ""honor among thieves"" thing. What works well is Affleck's brush with true humanity. One last issue. I'm getting a little tired of the incredible amount of fire-power that these guys have and how little carnage there really is. Also, there seems to be a lot of carelessness in police work if we are to believe this stuff.",/review/rw2379899/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2017,areatw,7," Good balance of storytelling and action
","For a film with such a dull and uninspiring title, 'The Town' is surprisingly bold and original. It effectively balances an interesting and engaging storyline with some great action sequences. Heist movies are always at risk of being generic and repetitive but this one ensures that never happens with an original, convincing plot and an interesting bunch of characters.",/review/rw2379899/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2010,dierregi,5," Glorified gangsters rule
","This movie follows a well-traveled road: weary criminal wants to change life and meet a girl who might push him in the right direction. Obviously, only a ""last job"" stands in the way to living happily ever after.",/review/rw2379899/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2010,searchanddestroy-1,," Sort of poor man's HEAT
","I am disappointed by this film. I'll be straight, I expected better than that. I don't speak of the film it self, the story, characters, actor's directing, but by the fact that this screenplay is not faithful to the original novel. I read it a couple of years ago, and the movie should have been better than that. Especially concerning the very ending. The book's one is far better. I won't spoil it any further, especially for the IMDb readers who already know some of my comments and who also know what I love and what I hate in a movie. What kind of ending I prefer, for instance. ",/review/rw2379899/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2015,Leofwine_draca,6," Not as original as you'd think
","I'd heard plenty about THE TOWN, a film which lifted Ben Affleck from the doldrums and gave him a revamped career of sorts by revealing him to be an efficient director of modern-day thrillers. One reviewer on here even likens him to Scorsese. So what of this Oscar-nominated film, and will it really stand up to scrutiny? The answer is no, not really. THE TOWN turns out to be a very familiar and ordinary type of thriller that comes across as a Boston-set rip-off of Michael Mann's HEAT. Once again we follow the predictable story of a gang of bank robbers, with the running time split between their lives and loves and the actual heist scenes.",/review/rw2379899/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2021,Maelific71,5," Streetwise?
","This movie is a high 5 because of the acting and action. However, this script is ridiculous. It appears it's intention is to solicit sympathy for Doug (Affleck) all the while he's the worst of the lot. On top of that, absolutely nothing he does makes any sense; all of it being quite impossible if not very stupid. And yet, we are supposed to believe he's the ""smart"" one? The only decent person in the whole movie is Claire (Hall), but even her character is somewhat annoying. Exactly how is this beautiful, intelligent, and caring girl single? And this ""idea"" which surrounds her is absurd. Love at first sight? Life altering experience? It's silly. By the way, is Doug trying to get her thrown in prison? And that ending! Does anyone doubt she immediately turns over the gift to the FBI? Clearly, if she doesn't it leads to only one place for Gods sake.",/review/rw2379899/?ref_=tt_urv

Later, the friends Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck), James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert 'Gloansy' Magloan (Slaine) and Desmond Elden (Owen Burke) find that Claire also lives in Charlestown and they decide to monitor her steps.

25 January 2011,ScottDMenzel,8," ""The Town"" proves that Ben Affleck is not only a gifted actor, but also has a great eye for directing.
","In ""The Town,"" Ben Affleck plays Doug, the brains behind an Irish mob that robs banks and plans heists all around the Boston area. After their last huge bank job, Doug learns from his colleague, James (James Coughlin), that the female bank manager, Claire (Rebecca Hall) from the bank lives a few blocks away from where the mob meets. This is when Doug decides to investigate Claire and see what she knows about him and the other members of his crew. Along the way, Doug falls in love with Claire as the FBI is slowly investigating him and his fellow mob members to see where they are going to strike next. It's only a matter of time before the FBI comes after Doug and it's now up to Doug to decide whether it's the mob life or love....",/review/rw2379899/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2011,bkoganbing,8," Robbing A Shrine
","In The Town Ben Affleck got to do another big screen tribute to his home town of Boston and even better got to shoot a good deal of this film at his beloved Fenway Park.

12 December 2010,thesar-2,3," Get Outta Town
","Get Outta Town Let me start withI wasn't a big fan of The Departed, and I liked American Gangster a whole lot less. Both seemed to try and grab the Oscar, and hard, e.g. trying too desperately.

19 September 2010,ferguson-6,6," Monster of Green
","Greetings again from the darkness. Ben Affleck proved himself to be a talented director with ""Gone Baby Gone"". Here, he once again shows he is best suited behind the camera. He has a real feel for setting, scenery, actors and camera angles. Unfortunately, this story based on the Chuck Hogan novel ""Prince of Thieves"" is just a bit too formulaic to stand out from the crowd.",/review/rw2379899/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2011,michaelRokeefe,8," Award worthy crime drama.
","Ben Affleck directs, co-writes and stars in this riveting action-filled crime drama. The Charlestown neighborhood of Boston is known for turning out crafty armed robbers; generation after generation. Doug MacRay(Affleck)is a career bank robber planning his next hit. One of his crew is childhood friend Jim Coughlin(Jeremy Renner), who is quite volatile and obviously has a very short fuse. During the latest heist a bank manager Claire(Rebecca Hall)is kidnapped. Creating a major problem is the fact that Doug falls heavy for Claire thus causing doubts of judgment from mad dog Jim. That is not the worst; a head strong FBI agent(Jon Hamm)has MacCray and the recently fired bank manager under surveillance. Some very good car chases and gun battles. A strong supporting cast features: Pete Postlethwaite, Blake Lively, Owen Burk and Chris Cooper.",/review/rw2379899/?ref_=tt_urv
