5 July 2018,drael64,3," Misses every target
","It's not funny, the characters aren't charming, and worst of all for a thriller - there's no suspense. Even the sound tracking lacked punch. The characters also lack believability - they don't convince anyone they are criminals, hackers, grifters or anything of the sort. I can't really think of anything good to say about this film - it'll genuinely put you to sleep.",/review/rw4199087/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2018,eddie_baggins,2," A lifeless and charmless attempt to reimagine the Ocean's series
","To be fair, I don't exactly think I'm the target audience for Ocean's 8, an all-female update on the successful Ocean's franchise that was headlined by the likes of George Clooney, Matt Damon and Brad Pitt, but I like to think I'm a cinemagoer that's always up for a good fun time at the movies but that's something that is inexcusably and notably absent from this charmless, lifeless and DOA female-centric heist caper.",/review/rw4199087/?ref_=tt_urv

","Well, yes. what else was behind this ""idea"". Money. What's wrong with that, you may ask? Look at the movie. That's my answer. Not a moment of originality let alone truth. Very dispiriting because Cate Blanchett is an actress I truly admire and I felt uneasy, uncomfortable seeing her in the midst of this misguided money grabbing scheme - pun intended - An all female cast of glittering names, a power force on their own, right? So why not make sure they get a script and an idea that is worthy their talents. Within the last two years there's been a sort of abrupt stop and there are only reboots - Will & Grace, The X Files for heaven's sake, Baywatch, not to mention the comedies with Amy Schumer one a remake of ""Shallow Hal"" the other one with Goldie Hawn. Goldie Hawn! and they can't come up with a vehicle that is at least funny. Talking about Goldie Hawn, Overboard was remade, and Flatliners. The brilliant Melissa McCarthy made about a hundred films, can you remember one? Okay I stop. I love movies, I always have that's why I notice that something is going on, I don't know what but I don't like it. I don't like it at all. What I've been doing after every depressing movie I go back and heal myself with a vintage comedy, it always works.",/review/rw4199087/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2018,loufalce,1," Lesson Not Learned
","The return of the all female Ghostbusters., this time in an inept 'empowermet' caper of eight woman criminals attempting to pull of a robbery at the 'Met Gala'.Has more in common with the original 1960 Sinatra-Ratpack film than the other three, but that is not saying too much. The women primp, preen, ad try to look good as eye candy in a comedy that has no laughs, or a thriller that offers no thrills. You can pretty much dial it in in a film that is predictable from start to finish. Only James Corden offers some laughs-though not too many as a detective investigating the case. I don't really want to get on a rant, but making a film for the sake of making a movie about women criminals to appease the 'me too' and 'empowerment' crowd is just an excuse to further exploit those who are calling for more 'fem-centric' movies . I can understand if the film was attempting to tackle real social issues, but all it is is fluff, kind of like an extended TMZ story. A total waste of time and talent, especially from Bulloch, and Hathaway who have had better roles. Do yourself a favor. If you really must see it, wait about three weeks until it is available at Redbox! Another P.U. movie review from Lou.",/review/rw4199087/?ref_=tt_urv

","Well, Clinton lost the presidential election because people don't like women (or sth like that, despite the fact that 50% of the voters are female) and people vote down Ocean's Eight because they don't want women as heroes and blabla, the p.c. crowd will argue.",/review/rw4199087/?ref_=tt_urv

8 June 2018,kjproulx,6," Disappointing When Comparing The Previous Films
","Regardless of the concept, I've always been intrigued every time a new heist movie makes it to the big screen. The sheer notion of watching a group of people flawlessly pull off something that most people would be crazy to attempt is quite entertaining for many reasons. Ocean's 8 is the latest film of its kind to hit theatres and with the weight of the previous trilogy on its shoulders, there was a high bar to meet. I'm a huge fan of the previous remake of Ocean's Eleven and while neither of the sequels quite match the quality of it, I was hoping Ocean's 8 would steer this franchise in a new direction. While I did enjoy watching this movie, for the most part, I did find myself pretty disappointed by it as a whole. I can't quite recommend this movie as a great film, but if you're a fan of the franchise, here's why you may find some enjoyment in its latest addition.",/review/rw4199087/?ref_=tt_urv

16 June 2018,matthewssilverhammer,4," Drowns in Lazy Mediocrity
","My first mistake was revisiting the ineffably great original trilogy so recently. Because of that, Ocean's 8 comes across like a frozen food dinner version of a lovingly-created, homecooked meal. Sure, all the ingredients are there, but any needed salt (cool jazz score, sporadic cleverness, dry humor, hip performances by a stacked cast) seems to be there more for preservation than for flavor. Where the original films effortlessly float on their Rat-Pack-esque coolness, Eight forces it, dropping the hilarious subtlety and riding on lame laziness.
Sandra Bullock plays Debbie Ocean, sister to master criminal Danny Ocean. After getting out of prison, she calls together a hodge-podge group of differently-skilled women to aid her in stealing a priceless necklace that adorns the neck of an A-list Met-Gala-attendee. As expected, we spend the majority of the film meeting the crew. Other than some colorful performances from the cast, it's all largely unremarkable until the heist itself, which is a welcome bit of throwback-fun. Unfortunately, unlike the best of the series before it (11 and 13), there's little-to-no emotional heft to their plight. I spent most the 2 hours waiting for another cameo, and asking, ""Why exactly are we rooting for these people again?""
Honestly, the conception of an ""all-girl Ocean's movie"" is just such a lackluster and unnecessary jumping-off point for a movie. Not that women can't or shouldn't star in an action-comedy-heist, or that the movie doesn't address the obvious question (""Why only women?"") to decent affect. I just wish Hollywood would trust more women filmmakers to start their own unique projects instead of simply forcing them into mediocre, half-baked remakes / spin-offs of proven moneymakers.",/review/rw4199087/?ref_=tt_urv

10 June 2018,esweet-154-191260,7," Just relax and enjoy it!
","The theatre was near full and there were more than a few large groups of girls and women who were clearly out on the town for the night. I read the poor IMDB reviews while waiting for the movie to start and perhaps that lowered my expectations, however, the movie was great. These sorts of things shouldn't be compared to their priors, like a new partner, you take them for what they are in the present. Were there better heist movies yesterday, sure there are. This was another decent heist movie, it hit all the notes a heist movie should, including a slight of hand surprise twist at the end. You leave feeling good, what more could you ask for. Nice to see a couple original oceans characters brought back for cameos and a lovely surprise with you trying to place the older wealthy women gala guests popping up near the end, Marlene, Ethel (Coma), Diana. The theatre emptied out with everyone happily chattering away. No academy awards here but that's nothing any sane person is expecting.",/review/rw4199087/?ref_=tt_urv

","So as I was watching the film I did realize, I did not really like the remake of Ocean's 11.

10 June 2018,rannynm,9," Fun, light weight summer film. Very enjoyable
","I happen to be a fan of heist movies, don't ask why. Maybe it's their Robin Hood aspect in many cases. This one differs from most with it's all female cast of thieves spearheaded by the charismatic Sandra Bullock and filled out with a veritable who's who of women - Cate Blanchett, Mindy Kaling, Rihanna, Sarah Paulson, Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway who steals the show. The plot is a romp, the costumes are absolutely breathtakingly gorgeous and the jokes work. If you are looking for a lightweight summer movie, this is it.

8 June 2018,Brandon_Walker_Robinson,6," Weakest spot is in the writing, strongest is in the Hathaway.
","In this soft reboot--outside of a character connection, the idea of a heist/recruitment, and some scenes that they clearly wanted to serve as a mash note to O11--it really did not feel too much like O11. In fact, its plot felt more like Tower Heist with a tone closer to O12 and a deliverance that played out a bit like Logan Lucky. It opens up with a score similar to that of what David Holmes used in the past, but outside of the different score bits this film has an actual soundtrack as well to give it its own style (personally, I would have preferred an ""only score"" flick).",/review/rw4199087/?ref_=tt_urv
