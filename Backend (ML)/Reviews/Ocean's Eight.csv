30 November 2021,TxMike,," Unconventional love story, a man and his pig.
","I'm not sure what I expected but what I got surprised me. I like Nic Cage but I don't always like the choices he makes. This role is a good one. He is a wilderness man in Oregon, the state with the best hunting for truffles. He lives in a very rustic cabin, gets supplied delivered weekly, in exchange he provides top quality truffles. We see him early making a rustic mushroom tart, we get a sense of what his former career might have been.",/review/rw8827382/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2021,blanbrn,9," Tough, raw, and gritty film of loss, pain, and sorrow.
","""Pig"" is without a doubt a film that's clearly different and away from some normal film norms, still even as the story is that of a lost pig the movie connects with themes of drama and emotions. Set in the rural Oregon wilderness Rob(in a good well done performance from Cage) is a lonely truffle hunter who lives life rough raising his own food and living like a hermit rarely getting out and even so and then he gets drama from his old rattle trap truck. However his beloved pet pig keeps him going, then the world is turned upside down when Rob's pig is kidnapped. This then takes the film on a past journey of things, and people that Rob remembers as he does a search and travel in the big city of Portland looking for his pig. The film is raw and gruff with Nicolas looking his rugged best with long hair and a beard, however Rob's character is that of a fighter as he searches bars, restaurants, and homes of people from the past just to find his pig. Still even though this story involves a lost animal the drama, pain, emotion, and sorrow matches that of any human story. Overall ""Pig"" is one eye opening touching painful film that shows how when connection and attachment is lost it brings sorrow.",/review/rw8827382/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2021,Quinoa1984,10," An astonishing and assured debut with a stunner of a Cage turn
","An astonishing and assured debut; Pig may get you into the theater with the veneer of a darker/darker hued John Wick (by way of, hmm, how's about Leave No Trace, that works for me), but it's much more than that suggests. This is a rather devastating and deeply emotional film about loss, of self and others and the toll that takes, and how it shows ultimately much more courage to reach into someone else's soul, especially if it's a person who wronged you, than to go about the usual revenge narrative. I won't say how this happens, but it's a film that earns its tragic countenance and the look of the film itself (as I told my wife on the way home, the color choice almost looks like a truffle).",/review/rw8827382/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2021,jdesando,," One of the best films and performances of the year.
","""Pig"" is a title so unimpressive that you may ignore what is arguably one of the best films of the year. Additionally, Nicolas Cage does his finest work since Leaving Las Vegas, for which he won the Oscar playing a troubled drunkard. Forget his hack work of late-this is his real deal.",/review/rw8827382/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2022,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7," The truffle shuffle.
","Comparisons to 'John Wick (2014)' are both apt and, perhaps, misleading; in many ways, 'Pig (2021)' is the antithesis of the revenge thriller. It isn't about vengeance, it's about love, loss, grief and gourmet cooking. In fact, the protagonist comes face to face with the people who whack him in the head and steal his pig in the movie's opening movement surprisingly early on, showing no desire to hurt them and instead being wholly focused on recovering his lost pet. It's generally a quiet, contemplative and purposefully counter-intuitive affair that subverts almost every expectation that comes with its set-up and the fact that it stars Nic Cage. Cage is remarkably restrained here, delivering a heavy yet nuanced performance that's actually rather affecting. Some of his conversations hit surprisingly hard, even if some of them are rather difficult to hear (the dialogue is oddly quiet and muffled at times). On top of its more straightforward narrative, the film has plenty to say about commerce vs creativity, compromised dreams, self-imposed isolation, gentrification, monopolisation, regret, companionship and the necessity of being able to 'move on'. It's purposefully unsatisfying, which is actually oddly satisfying if you think about it. It's relatively realistic yet still retains its own sense of low-key style. It's also really sad overall. It isn't consistently gripping, but it's always interesting and generally entertaining, too. It's an accomplished piece of work. 7/10.",/review/rw8827382/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2021,kosmasp,8," Cages best friend
","Can Pigs be Pets? Or are they more a ""workforce"" of sorts? On the other hand, one may argue here it is more the role of a friend that the pig inhabits. Which makes the relationship between Cage and his quite furry four legged friend interesting to say the least.",/review/rw8827382/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2021,MOscarbradley,9," One of the best films of the year.
","""Pig"" is a movie that wrong-foots you at every juncture; even the opening moments hint at a totally different film than the one that follows. Is this a period piece, a western like ""First Cow"" or will it be a thriller with a 'Die Hard' hero, (and in recent years Nicolas Cage has played his fair share of those)? Actually, it's neither although there are elements of both in first-time writer/director Michael Sarnoski's sublime scenario which is an original screenplay of the utmost originality.",/review/rw8827382/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2021,Gordon-11,," Good mystery and suspense
","Nicholas Cage has been in many bad films on recent years, but I must say he's successfully turned it around with the recent few films. Pig is actually really good, with mystery and suspense throughout the film. Things are mostly explained, but some critical plot elements are left to the imagination and observation. I find it a pleasurable and engaging watch.",/review/rw8827382/?ref_=tt_urv

18 July 2021,arkhamj,9," ""We don't get a lot of things to really care about.""
","What a beautiful movie. Not everyone is going to love it, I've seen some of the reviews here, and frankly, they didn't understand what the film was going for. Seldom has there been such a raw portrayal of love and caring for the things that really matter, and decluttering life of all the unnecessary BS. A film that doesn't treat it's audience like idiots, letting you paint your own picture while still wholly understanding the message. Reserved and much more than skin deep, Nicolas Cage delivers a painfully Oscar-worthy performance. Go and see this movie!",/review/rw8827382/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2021,Rena24,8," Phenomenal...Just Phenomenal!!
","This movie brought back life to Cinema! And it's absolutely stunning, touching, real and Authentic. In a world of plastic CGI and ultra unrealistic movies which you can absolutely not relate to, this one is a breath of fresh air that will touch the inner most part of you heart. I felt it as tears rolled on my cheek's (I miss you dad). Kudos to the entire production team and welcome back Cage ; we have waited for this from you for a long time. Thank you so much.",/review/rw8827382/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2021,CinemaClown,," Pig Is Not What You Think It Is Going To Be
","With a setup akin to John Wick and the ever unpredictable Nicolas Cage in the starring role, Pig knows what the viewers would be anticipating going into a story like this and even plays into their expectations during the first half by giving the impression of a revenge-thriller that may unleash & explode at any time, only to dismantle & subvert it completely as it enters its final act.",/review/rw8827382/?ref_=tt_urv

20 July 2021,whitetowel-74786,7," Cage pigs out in Portland...
","While i'm certainly not on the 'Pig is a masterpiece' bandwagon, this is still an oddly engaging low key indie-flick with decent cinematography, sharp editing and an aptly atmospheric score, further boosted by the brilliance of Cage and a solid supporting cast, including the wonderful truffle pig itself!",/review/rw8827382/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2021,aidanratesmovies,10," Shockingly Brilliant
","There are very few times I have watched a film and feel like a complete emotional mess, and even fewer where I have been left speechless- but somehow Pig manages to accomplish both. It may seem a bit average at first, mediocre even, but as Pig paces itself to tell its fantastic story- you are soon treated to a film full of wonderment and surprise- that is as simple as it is brilliant. It will probably be overshadowed, as the film is a small release and wasn't released for awards season, but Cage deserves an Oscar for his performance in this film- in easily one of the best performances i've ever seen from him. First time director Michael Sarnoski makes his debut in this film, and also wrote the film, which I have to admit is one h*** of an achievement. The film is so well crafted under Sarnoski care, that it feels incredibly personal, and most importantly- incredibly grounded- which is a total breath of fresh air from many of the blockbuster films today. The cinematography is subtle and somber, and the music is excellent. The whole film feels like something that shouldn't work, that shouldn't have even been made, but it does, and its easily one of the years best.",/review/rw8827382/?ref_=tt_urv

","Robin Feld (Nicolas Cage) lives in a shack, lacks hygiene, and literally lives with a pig. He makes a modest living hunting truffles, or at least the pig does. His pig is pig-napped and Robin returns to Portland in an attempt to get it back. His side kick is Amir (Alex Wolff) the young man who buys his truffles.
