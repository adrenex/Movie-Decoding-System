6 August 2021,iamianiman,8," The Dumbest Squad Just Made the Greatest DCEU Film EVAHHH!!!
","Remember when James Gunn was 'temporarily' fired by Marvel Studios and we were all disappointed by the decision? Well, it turns out that was a blessing in disguise when Warner Bros. Booked him for a slot of this movie and months later, he was reemployed by the giant-sized company for GOTG 3 and he just killed two heroes with one stone. 2021's The Suicide Squad is indeed, THE Suicide Squad that we all deserve!",/review/rw7745480/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2021,hotrobinproductions,8," The ""REAL academy award winning"" Suicide Squad
","I remember as if it was yesterday my utter disappointment in 2016 when I purchased my tickets to watch Suicide Squad back then. No hate towards David Ayer, the studios definitely meddled with his film to the max, I would LOVE to see his version but nonetheless, what we got was such a terrible film.... Fast forward 5 years & Warner Brothers turns the tables and makes what is probably one of the GREATEST comic book movies of all time. The film is very ballsy, violent & full of heart. The characters are eye candy & I'm VERY happy that James Gunn kept what worked in the original. Because it was a bad movie but there were some good in it. This film James really respects David Ayers film by keeping what worked while just sticking to what needed to be done. The R Rating was needed, I'm also glad the studio acknowledged that. I'm VERY Tired of seeing studios go for a PG-13 rating so they can get more views. Like cmon now, grow a pair please. Sony doing it with Venom & all other types of examples of studios fearing the R Rating... I think ever since Joker Warner Brothers has discovered that they can really get the same numbers if not more regardless, Then Birds Of Prey happened, which I enjoyed too. BUT my point is ALL of this led up to this movie RIGHT HERE. So again, kudos to Warner Brothers for the R Rating!!! Now first things first, The action is GREAT & the twists are even more magnificent. The Comedy is SPOT ON, and lands when it needs to, the use of dark comedy and balance of character development is done so well that it doesn't feel out of place or that one is taking over the other. BloodSport carry's this movie, his performance was SCREAMING Will Smith for me, (meaning the role just looks like it was meant for him because he had daughter issues too) but I gotta say, Idris Elba grew on me more than Will Smith did. His performance is GREAT and he has amazing chemistry with another character and it just feels special. Polka Dot man was absolutely hilarious yet gave me a bittersweet taste in my mouth, but in a good way. King Shark was an amazing joy to watch on screen. Peacemaker was awesome too. Now what I mean by awesome is off their importance, performance and role in the movie. Some of these characters are not like able... mind you... and some things will happen over the course of events and make you not like characters more and that's where this movie shines. It's VERY unpredictable. And when you feel like you think you know where the movie is going it pulls the rug from under you hard. Very enjoyable ride. When it was over I wanted to watch it again.",/review/rw7745480/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2021,colinfew,8," Happy surprise!
","This movie is surprisingly fantastic. Much has been said about it so I want to just add my two cents about universe building in movies. From the very first scene, Suicide Squad made it clear what it was. You understand the world you are in and the rules in place, or lack there of. It then follows those defined rules throughout. Comic book movies can take many forms from gritty realism like Joker all the way to off the wall zany like we see here. As long as the movie follows it's own rules, viewers are willing to go wherever the director wants. What an absolute blast of a good time this one is.",/review/rw7745480/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2021,krisnadexter,8," Fun From Start To Finish
","I have to admit I don't like the first Suicide Squad. And Birds of Prey is a bit boring. So when Harley Quinn come back for the third time I don't have high expectations. No offense to Margot Robbie, her performance is great but the story from both movie is just not that good.",/review/rw7745480/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2021,Aziz24,8," THIS IS HOW A SUICIDE SQUAD FILM SHOULD BE
","Before I talk about the film, let me talk a bit about DCEU. The difference between DC and Marvel (and why Marvel is more successful than DC) is the people behind them. The people/company behind Marvel (Disney) know and plan everything. They even planned this whole MCU thing ever since 2008's Iron Man. They know what they are doing, where they are hiding with the characters, stories, and films, and how to do right, and that's why their Universe is more successful. But, for DC the people/company behind it (Warner Bros.) are ruing this beautiful universe that's filled with great characters by bringing the wrong people to direct/write their movies which brings chaos to the films of the DCEU. Or they create issues with the right director like Zack Snyder (which we all saw how he was was building that big/creative universe in Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021) and where it was going). However, this time DC chose James Gunn to write & direct this film which if you're not familiar with, he directed Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1 (2014) and Vol. 2 (2017). And this is the second proof (after Snyder's) that when having the right person/people behind a film, he/she will kill it. And THIS IS HOW ""The SUICIDE SQUAD"" STORY SHOULD LOOK LIKE. And that's all thanks to James Gunn.",/review/rw7745480/?ref_=tt_urv

","As ""The Suicide Squad"" (2021 release; 140 min.) opens, Savant is released from prison and joins the rest of the Suicide Squad to go on a dangerous mission on a island called Corto Maltese. Soon enough, things go wrong, very wrong. But then we learn that another Suicide Squad team is getting onto the island. What the heck is going on here? We then go to ""3 days earlier"" as Bloodsport is cleaning the prison's floor. At this point we are 10 min.

","And that's basically it. There is not a huge deal with this movie, because is an idiotic movie with nothing to offer other than laughs and gore. As a fan of the ""Saw"" saga, you aren't amusing me with fantasy violence where bodies explode and we rarely see any real suffering. It's graphic, but it's not really that violent (except for Harley for like... 10 seconds).",/review/rw7745480/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2021,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,3," Meh
","I like James Gunn movies. But I think you really need to be a comic book fan to really appreciate this film. I watched it twice and I could not get into the ridiculous characters like King Shark, Rat Girl and Pok-A-Dot Man. The comedy wasn't there for me. Perhaps I am just too old for this film. But it seems to be doing well here on IMDb so I guess I am missing out on something.",/review/rw7745480/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2021,kevin_robbins,3," The first one was much better than this.
","The Suicide Squad (2021) is a movie we saw last week in theatres. The storyline follows a ""suicide mission"" on an island that needs to be executed and those who would execute the mission faces impossible odds. They need to infiltrate a base and destroy it. The base houses aliens set on world domination and has thousands of troops protecting it. Based on the odds and those selected for the mission, what could go wrong? This movie is directed by James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy) and stars Margot Robbie (Wolf of Wall Street), Idris Elba (The Losers), Michael Rooker (Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer), John Cena (12 Rounds), Viola Davis (The Help) and Pete Davidson (The King of Staten Island). The storyline for this is very straightforward and the action scenes are appropriately over the top. The dialogue is funny and pretty clever and the film starts off very good. I really enjoyed the introduction of the characters as they are rolled out and the mission begins...and then the movie entirely falls apart. The focus on one character at a time as they executed their action scenes was terrible. It just become blatantly bad. I'm not sure if it was an artistic attempt or DC Universe sabotage by Gunn. The initial villain was very good and the movie should have probably stopped there; unfortunately, they decided one more super villain was needed, and it was an abomination. Overall there were aspects of this film that were entertaining and this film had some potential, but trying to be too stylish and creative sunk the ship of this having any hope of being good. The first one was much better than this. I would score this a 3/10.",/review/rw7745480/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2021,jindann,1," Redefines what pure garbage is
","Unfortunately this is no guardians of galaxy. The story is totally empty and idiotic where it bitterly fails trying to humor the audience by bringing the dumbest elements in movies ever possible, it's doubtful if a 5th grade child would find this funny. The first suicide squad was silly but watchable, birds of prey is terrible, but this sequel is so much worse, it redefines what pure garbage is. The suicide squad is just incredibly gross and stupid beyond imagination, with awful acting and directing I couldn't find a thing that's even worth commending. What's actually funny about this movie is the ridiculous amount of paid or moronic reviewers and critics overrating this trash at a 7-10.",/review/rw7745480/?ref_=tt_urv

6 August 2021,kuner-59029,2," Complete garbage
","I expected this to be bad, but the final film exceeded my fears. James Gunn struck gold with the first Guardians of the Galaxy, and the attempt to repeat that formula is apparent here - only it's amped up to the nth degree. The plot, if one can call it that, is one long exercise in subverting expectations. But Gunn is no M. Night Shymalan and no Monty Python either. This is pure randomness and lack of structure masquerading as subversiveness and edginess. I found myself reminded of the old Ren & Stimpy cartoon show at times, the bad later seasons, not the good early ones. Trying so hard to be edgy that it just becomes cringe worthy.",/review/rw7745480/?ref_=tt_urv

6 August 2021,joiningjt,9," Sorry I dont see it,the evil monster from barney??some decent gore but story was bland!!
","I think people are biased cause it's a James Gunn so its supposed to be amazing as all his other films are. This didnt have the great story, I didnt feel the emotion. I liked the gore but if it was a pg 13 it would have been a 1. I give it a 3 for gore. The action was decent but I've seen much better. No character development at all and I usually dont want any but it was needed here. For over 2 hours I should have felt something and I didnt . I didnt connect with any characters , come on you think there was a star lord? A drax? Not any better than the 1st film I liked will smith and Margot in the 1st film better. Sorry you have this one wrong!!!v oh and the Terrible CGI monster looked he was from barney cartoon . Not good go back to marvel!!!!",/review/rw7745480/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2021,Beyondtherain,8," Thought it wouldn't be that good but It was horrifyingly epic. I ATE MY WORDS.
","I didn't go to the Cinemas since I thought it would be mediocre. So I watched it at home. The movie overall was nice, when they got to that acapella battle in the Rain storm with no music and King Shark just ripping a guy in half while roaring, I was thinking, I should've went to the Cinema to watch this! That was some straight Victor Crowley, Hatchet, Horror sh**. Nice work, Gunn! King Shark was actually great. The rest of the characters i don't even remember sadly lol...The Polka Dot color guy was also great! I can't complain about the gore when Gunn also made Slither (2006) üòÇ Dont like gore?

11 January 2022,Leofwine_draca,10," High energy
","I really enjoyed this ensemble superhero movie, the diretor's best since his similar GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY. It has the same fun, anything goes kind of vibe, and the CGI effects are out of this world. This one's a DIRTY DOZEN style men-on-a-mission flick, as a group of refreshingly quirky heroes land on an island to take down a corrupt regime and their dark scientific experiment. The script zings, the violence and bloodshed are amped up, and the camaraderie works. There's nothing not to like about this engagingly high energy production.",/review/rw7745480/?ref_=tt_urv
