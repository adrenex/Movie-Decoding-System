21 May 2006,Buddy-51,6," reasonably entertaining time-waster
","You'd think Michael Douglas would have learned his lesson by this time, but apparently he hasn't. For even after all the trouble he had with an adulterous romance in ""Fatal Attraction,"" here he is in ""The Sentinel"" playing the role of Pete Garrison, a veteran secret service agent who's having an affair with none other than the First Lady of the United States. Even worse, when it is discovered that there may be a mole secretly operating in the service, the finger of suspicion begins to point directly at Mr. Garrison. Is he truly the undercover operative working to bring down the President, or is he merely a tool being set up as a convenient fall guy in a plot to rub out the nation's chief executive?

18 January 2007,claudio_carvalho,6," Reasonable Idea, Terrible Screenplay
","The veteran agent of the American secret service Pete Garrison (Michael Douglas) saved the life of president Ronald Reagan in the past and became a legend. Presently he is responsible for the personal security of the American president Ballentine (David Rasche) and the first lady Sarah Ballentine (Kim Bassinger), with whom he is having a love affair. When his informer Walter discloses that there is a traitor in the secret service and a plot to kill the president, his former friend David Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland) and the chief of the secret service William Montrose (Martin Donovan) are in charge of the investigation and all the agents are submitted to a polygraph test. Due to his situation with Sarah, he is compromised with the results and accused of treachery. He escapes, and in spite of chased by the secret service, he conducts his own investigation trying to find the responsible.",/review/rw1344334/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2007,rmax304823,5," Nothing New Here.
","It practically defines the words ""routine thriller."" Pieces of the plot are taken from ""In The Line of Fire"" and ""The Fugitive"" and probably others. It's about a Secret Service agent (Douglas) who is framed as part of a very real plot to assassinate the president of the United States. It's hard to imagine why Michael Douglas, who has both talent and a high salary, should be chosen for this undemanding role. The producers had a good chance to hire some talented but lesser-known figure, saved money without sacrificing quality, and wind up with the same results. And the director doesn't add much. The camera seems always to be moving. It jerks and spins jiggles and racks and zip pans and goes unexpectedly and unnecessarily into step motion. Now a real novelty would be if they held the damned thing still.",/review/rw1344334/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2006,DICK STEEL,7," A Nutshell Review: The Sentinel
","At first glance, this film looks like the Keifer Sutherland series 24 for the big screen. With the focus on a plot to assassinate the President of the United States, a race against time, and plenty of Secret Service agents, the agency under the spotlight in The Sentinel.",/review/rw1344334/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2006,aharmas,8," Exciting and Intelligent... Most of the Time
","There was some hesitation from my part about what this movie had to offer. For starters, the casting didn't seem right. Kiefer Sutherland had already done very well in ""24"" and the preview didn't seem to offer anything challenging to him or the audience. Eva Longoria appeared out of place, and the rest didn't seem very interesting.",/review/rw1344334/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2006,Movieguy_blogs_com,6," It is too much like 'In the Line of Fire' only not as good.
","In 'The Sentinel' Michael Douglas plays Pete Garrison, a veteran Secret Service agent. He is being investigated by David Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland) when it comes to light that there may be a traitor in the Secret Service who might be involved in an assassination plot. But David takes his investigation rather personal because he also feels Pete had an affair with his ex-wife. Agent Garrison must now prove his innocence and protect a President that everyone else believes he is trying to kill.",/review/rw1344334/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2007,CuriosityKilledShawn,1," Pointless, Z-movie garbage
","The Sentinel represents everything about the soul-lessness of Hollywood and the saddening lack of imagination present in so many movies these days. I cannot possibly think of one good thing about it, it's all so generic, so factory-made and so lazy assembled that it really only exists as an infomercial on how to make money from the unsuspecting, undeserving public.",/review/rw1344334/?ref_=tt_urv

24 August 2019,masonsaul,5," Average action thriller
","The Sentinel is an average action thriller, the plot is extremely predictable with no surprises and derivative of other action movies that have come before it.

10 March 2017,zkonedog,4," Stock Political Film Fare
","The opening scene of ""The Sentinel"", which shows the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan, gives this movie a feeling of gravitas and importance. Sadly, the direction and overall general production value of the experience fails to live up to that opening scene and instead produces little more than stock fare for this genre.",/review/rw1344334/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2006,ccthemovieman-1,9," An Entertaining Political Thriller.....Period!
","I enjoyed this film. I thought it was an excellent political thriller about something that's never happened before - a Secret Service agent going bad and involved in an assassination plot. Unfortunately, for Michael Douglas' character, ""Pete Garrison,"" they think HE's the mole but he isn't. ",/review/rw1344334/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2006,dlevin-4,6," The director should stick with TV
","This movie had all the potential in the world to be a modern-day ""In The Line Of Fire"", with great suspense, story, acting, action, etc... but the Director missed the ball. Every action and suspenseful scene was missing the added element that separates TV-movies from box-office blockbusters. It's hard to put into words, but watching all the action and suspense scenes felt like I was watching a mid-budget USA or TBS movie. The cast was great and them combined with a good screenplay and overall plot saves this movie from being a disaster. There was too little character building as well, especially for the 'bad guys'. The story was still good and the movie overall will still be entertaining, but needless to say, I was disappointed.",/review/rw1344334/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2009,thesar-2,3," Not many were sentimental for 'The Sentinel'
","It saddens me to rate a movie with a lot of my favorite actors, locations and genres, i.e. Douglas, Sutherland, Washington, D.C. and political thriller, but 'The Sentinel' really hits a low. It's like they had a great idea up front, signed the right cast and had some great city shots and then took a holiday letting the remaining crew improvise the rest. And I wish I could blame it on yet another bland performance from Basinger (not only do I feel she's one of the worst actors in Hollywood, but I'm still steaming more than a decade later that she was the only one, and definitely the only bad actor in the film, to win an acting Oscar for 'L.A. Confidential.') But she wasn't the only problem. Sutherland, who I love as Jack Bauer on '24' once again playsÂ…Jack. I miss his old 'A Time to Kill' or 'A Few Good Men' days. Douglas certainly took a hiatus from acting and phoned this one in. Plot: Someone, some Secret Service traitor, wants the President dead and Douglas is (haphazardly) being framed. Will someone believe him? Actually, no spoiler here: as quickly as they came up with that subplot half-way through, it's over before you know it. And why did someone(s) want the President dead? Is that to be revealed in the sequel? Too many plot holes, too many doors opened and never closed and too predictable 'The Sentinel' is. If you only see one movie a year, you may not know who the mole is, but anyone who's familiar with these types of movies or even just seen one 'Law & Order' episode you'll know in the first few frames. Was it terrible? Not really, the cinematography was good, and despite Sutherland playing Jack again, he's still got it.",/review/rw1344334/?ref_=tt_urv

23 April 2006,ferguson-6,6," The First Lady ... That's Rational
","Greetings again from the darkness. Slightly above average political thriller with SURPRISE ... Michael Douglas wearing an expensive suit! Directed by Clark Johnson, who was so fine as Meldrick in ""Homicide: Life on the Streets"", this film had real potential to travel down roads no other film had touched. In the end it is a bit disappointing because it gives up too soon and takes an all too familiar plot turn.",/review/rw1344334/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2006,oshram-3,5," Basically well done but very familiar
","The plot of this film, a little bit of a stretch, focuses on Pete Garrison (Michael Douglas), a Secret Service hero who took a bullet for Reagan (damn it!) as he becomes embroiled in what looks like a plot to kill the president. In fact Garrison does have something to hide, and it's up to fellow agents Breckenridge (Sutherland) and Jill Marin (Eva Longoria) to try and figure out what. As soon as Garrison realizes they're on to him, though, he goes missing, and so a cat and mouse game ensues between Breckenridge and Garrison to find out what exactly is going on and who is guilty of it.",/review/rw1344334/?ref_=tt_urv

","I saw this film for the first time the day before yesterday (July 5th, 2006), since it took it a long time to reach Israeli theaters (where big studio products are released simultaneously with the US, and lesser products are spread across the release date calendar). Frankly, I can see why.",/review/rw1344334/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2006,TabareVazquez,5," Great potential ruined by terrible screenplay
","""The Sentinel"" is an average-at-best action drama that does not come remotely close to reaching its potential. The entire movie feels rushed, with random details about each character's past thrown at you in a poorly-written screenplay. The revelation of the true bad guy in conspiracy films normally elicits at least some form of surprise or intrigue; instead, in ""The Sentinel"" the character is far too obvious and the scene reveals a tangential and unexplained back story that should instead be much more central to the plot.",/review/rw1344334/?ref_=tt_urv

25 April 2006,vanofam,7," Gordon Gekko goes Secret Service
","It's been 19 years since Gordon Gekko used ""Wall Street"" to let us know that greed is good. Now, Michael Douglas takes the GG persona and morphs it into a Secret Service agent, Pete Garrison. Guess what? It works! This is a solid political thriller that kept me guessing. The detail work in showing the security precautions taken by the SS on behalf of the President and First Lady was likewise intriguing. All the leads were pretty good but, try as I might, I could not accept Eva Longoria as a Secret Service agent. Whereas Jodie Foster just made you suspend belief and really think she was FBI agent Starling in ""Silence of the Lambs"", you do not get the same feeling with Longoria. Nevertheless, this is a fun film, escapist entertainment with the Beltway as the backdrop.",/review/rw1344334/?ref_=tt_urv

5 September 2006,nalders,3," Bland.
","Michael Douglas and Eva Longoria were badly miscast in this, although in the latter case I can give her the benefit of the doubt. The problem could as easily been with the script. Kiefer Sutherland plays second fiddle to Douglas, basically channeling Jack Bauer from an alternate universe. Kim Basinger is... no longer suited to this kind of role. I formed that opinion watching ""Cellular"", and solidified it here. I nearly gagged when I thought that she and Michael Douglas were going to have 'old people sex' in some graphic form. This marks the only time I have EVER checked the back of a DVD box, seen ""PG-13"" and said ""Thank God!"" As to the fundamentals, everything is bland and ambiguous. Acting from the rest of the cast is adequate. Dialogue is unimpressive.",/review/rw1344334/?ref_=tt_urv

18 April 2006,iohefy-2,9," Finally a good script
","Went to see the preview of The Sentinel last night and was pleasantly surprised by the excellent script (which is rare these days) and an exciting movie with many twists and turns. Michael Douglas and Keifer Sutherland are excellent in their parts. The ladies in the movie were there for their looks and the acting was just so so on their part. If you want to see an exciting movie I suggest that you go see this fine film and you will certainly get your moneys worth for the two hours that you spend in the theater. This is one of the best things that I have seen Michael Douglas do in a few years. I do not know if I would buy the DVD when it comes out, but it certainly was worth going to see at the local movie theater.",/review/rw1344334/?ref_=tt_urv
