30 November 2008,stensson,9," Sensational
","Young Swedish director Ruben Östlund made a strong debut with ""Gitarrmongot"". It was a very personal way of narration. In ""De ofrivilliga"" he gives even more promises.",/review/rw2304030/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2008,FunkyFred,10," Sheer perfection!
","Brilliant film by Ruben Östlund and the cast! This is sheer perfection from the first frame to the last one, and the battle for next year's Best Swedish Film Award seems to be decided. Here is the best Swedish picture in years. It displays in five parallel stories how people reject from speaking up when they have the opportunity, due to more or less rational fears, and once the right moment has slipped away it becomes multiply difficult later.",/review/rw2304030/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2011,johnnyboyz,7," Impressive and immersive, despite its approach to its material, film looking to dot the I's and cross the T's in regards to an array of seemingly random modern-day Swedes.
","Involuntary is the rather brilliant in places, fascinating throughout, Swedish drama which takes its lead from something like Short Cuts, or the more recent Babel or Crash, and explores the lives and times of a handful of disparates the film believes are, in actual fact, connected by an underlying item or theme. The film attains a similarly sized level of accomplishment to those examples, in what is a piece that probably weaves in and out of more plights featuring more people to that of the mentioned films, but comes out just as much-a worthwhile effort. The good news is, above all else, that it's a lot shorter than something like Magnolia, and as a result, a Hell of a lot more interesting for more of the time.",/review/rw2304030/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2010,JohnSeal,3," Intolerable
","The influence of Gus Van Sant at his most self-indulgent is in evidence throughout this dry as dust collection of filmed scenarios. The camera doesn't move. Shots are deliberately framed in such a way that heads are cut off. The sound is ambient. The characters are shallow and uninteresting. If there were such a thing as a Swedish Dogme manifesto, Involuntary could be an example of it. As it stands, it's merely an example of how not to make a film, unless you want to limit the audience to folks who are convinced that the lack of a story and technical ineptitude are the mark of genius. It's hard to believe this was Sweden's official entry for the Academy Awards in 2010.",/review/rw2304030/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2010,tom-3160,8," Raw but brilliant
","Brilliantly simple in its story, yet it engages you right throughout, Simple doesn't necessarily mean it is not deep and meaningful. This film with its raw truth and its meaningful exchanges, I'ts a typical low budget foreign film, in that it is brilliant(though some of the low budget films are not).",/review/rw2304030/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2010,johno-21,3," Best foreign film? No. Worst foreign film? A contender.
","I recently saw this at the 2010 Palm Springs International Film Festival. After 25 years the effects of the radiation fallout from Chernobl that drifted over Sweden are now evident as it must have affected the minds of the committee who selected this drivel as Sweden's official submission to the Academy Awards as Best Foreign Film. The chances of this being one of the five nominations are slim to none. This film deals with five different stories that have nothing to do with the other except that they all take place in Sweden and all deal with alcohol to some degree. There is a man who accidentally gets hit in the head by a bottle rocket, two school girls who get drunk, an actress on a bus trip, a teacher whom none of her peers at the school really care for and a group of young straight men who enjoy homo-erotic behavior. The film is shot from unusual camera angels that give the viewer a sense of eavesdropping in on ordinary mundane conversations. After about five minutes, this technique gets pretty old and after about 10 minutes it becomes evident that the stories are going nowhere and people start walking out of the theater. Lessons learned from the film include; if you hit yourself in the eye with fireworks you should not self-treat it but see a doctor immediately and don't be shooting off fireworks under the influence of alcohol, if you are a teenager don't get drunk and pass out, if you break something it's best to confess, if you don't seem to fit in then learn to have an interest in your co-workers or maybe look for another job and pretending to be gay is not emotionally healthy. I would give this embarrassment to the Swedish film industry a very generous 3.5 out of 10, as low as I personally go on reviews, and recommend it to no one.",/review/rw2304030/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2009,ozjeppe,6," On-target snapshots of social awkwardness, male pride and a sad alcohol culture.
","A teacher who witnesses a colleague strike a pupil gets ostracized by the other teachers. The elderly host at a posh party is injured but refuses to have medical attention. A stout bus driver refuses to go on driving unless the one who vandalized his bus steps forward. Two young teen girls go on a drunken, out of control-spree with friends. An all-male party weekend in the country has unexpected sexual repercussions... Five very different Swedish stories with one big common denominator: peer pressure and the situations it puts people in.",/review/rw2304030/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2014,eblien,5," Swedish stubbornness and fear of conflicts
","I really cannot stand all these Swedish pretentious and self-righteous movies, but I still keep watching them in hope that something good may come out of it. After all they gave us The Emigrants (Moberg) in the 70's so there still might be hope.",/review/rw2304030/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2018,krocheav,," Involuntary Viewing Only For This One
","Difficult to believe this was chosen as the 2008 Swedish entry at Cannes and as best foreign language film at the A.A.! Must have been a lean year. Perhaps director Ruben Ostlund should have stuck with making Ski films - as this could be watched in 2 x speed and nothing would be missed. Boring, static single camera setups that when not cutting off people's heads - concentrates on feet while 'attempting' to tell a simple story. It looks and feels like something intended as a series of short, educational vignettes, that were then found to be highly unsuitable for school use so, strung together for Cinema or TV. Any interest is quickly killed off by overlong scenes that ramble aimlessly with very little point of view to sustain its 100 min run time. Only the easily pleased lovers of cheap experimental or student style works could find much interest. One story involving a bunch of young men on a drunken weekend could have easily been dropped and is especially vulgar. Such an unpleasant disappointment.",/review/rw2304030/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2009,Cuddleworthy,8," Östlund improves himself
","""De Ofrivilliga"" presents a new take on movie-making I personally haven't seen before. Östlund basically uses nothing but still cameras that show the entirety of the scene from a distance or an angle that surprises you, never zooming in on the actors facial expressions. The theme is admittedly rather hard to explain; it handles the awkwardness that follow those defining moments where a small decision leads to growing consequences. It's an hilarious movie, dark and hopeful at the same time. You can tell Östlund has sharpened his pen since his previous feature movie, ""Gitarrmongot"". The dialogue balances so delicately on the thin line of becoming ridiculous or indifferent without ever falling over to either side. ""De Ofrivlliga"" craves your attention in order to mesmerize you the way it's meant to, and you will be required to give it. If you've ever seen and appreciated any of Roy Andersson's movies you'll love it.",/review/rw2304030/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2013,OJT,5," Interesting about Swedish stupidity and stubbornness

4 June 2009,mappedyr,8," Very touching
","I was really surprised by this film. It consists of 5 independent stories and though they are completely different they share something common to human beings. Well ""Short Cuts"" was great and I can really recommend ""Fyra nyanser av brunt"" in the same genre. But ""De ofrivilliga"" has something extra. I bet you can recognize some of the awkward situation described in this film.",/review/rw2304030/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2011,MidoriFiore,1," Pretentious
","Ruben Östlund must be one of the most self important directors working in Sweden today. He is angry on Hollywood for making films people are entertained by. He wonders why his film don't speak to as many people as films about cowboys and aliens when his films are about everyday life. The answer is quite simple. Most people goes to the cinema to be entertained and Ruben Östlund's film douse not entertain. Entertainment can be achieved by many emotions, happiness, horror, sadness, thrills, chills and joy. The one emotion a director is never allowed to evoke in his audience is boredom. To bore an audience is the worst crime an entertainer can commit and Östlund commits this crime.",/review/rw2304030/?ref_=tt_urv

","For the last few months i've stumbled upon quite a few Swedish movies, and for me, personally, it's a grand discovery!
I love and appreciate low budget movies. For me, producing more with less always seemed an outcome of cinematic expertise. 
That kind of Minimalism makes this movie great. 
The themes and situations displayed in this movie are so relatable, and i bet you'll find your self giggling (for a wide Spectrum of reasons: from sympathy to embarrassment). 
It's light and have a natural flow, the acting is very authentic and sensitive. 
The script is superb, and the camerawork also contributes to the ""Ostlund experience"", together forming an honourable picture.",/review/rw2304030/?ref_=tt_urv

31 August 2010,taliabo,," unbiased reviews
","The camera angles were interestingly different. Made you think about the conversations and not focus so much on the shallowness of what I call: eye candy syndrome, which Hollywood so likes to depict. One thing that did disturb me when reading reviews was that a few of the very positive ones contained the same misspellings. That is hardly a coincidence. Back to the film: There seemed to be too many thematic subplots going on, despite other reviews that seem to say: ""hey, that mirrors life"". But generally, the film was entertaining and was an interesting diversion. The homo-erotic male-bonding deal with the guys seemed a bit contrived. I couldn't figure the rhyme or reason there.",/review/rw2304030/?ref_=tt_urv
