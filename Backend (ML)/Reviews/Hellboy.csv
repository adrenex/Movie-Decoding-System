1 August 2018,CreativeSpark,7," It's not perfect!
","Tonight I choose to check this film out. Honestly, anything A24 releases is always good! That said, I really liked this film. However, it's not perfect. I really didn't understand the main characters initial motivation for why he was doing, what he was doing, girl aside. His thirsty choices didn't really make much sense to me.

1 September 2018,nehpetstephen,4," Stylish but shallow
","If given some other writer's screenplay and a directive to restrain himself, director Elijah Bynum could probably make an excellent film. It's true that he blatantly rips off other directors here (Martin Scorsese and P.T. Anderson, most notably), but in doing so it's undeniable that he has proficiency and panache with a camera and, more importantly, a fine ability to work with actors. I'm sure he'll earn an opportunity to direct a second picture soon; although this movie was a critical failure, I can see this being a big hit with the teenagers it's clearly intended for.",/review/rw4299470/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2018,kjproulx,9," A '90s-esque coming of age story goes dark
","When a story focuses on a central character coming of age, I'm immediately hooked. With the addition of the backdrop of the film being set in the 90s, that only added to my excitement. Hot Summer Nights is one of A24's latest distributions and this studio has had quite the track record over the last few years. Personally, I believe this film will be one of their most polarizing releases of 2018, but I think it's a fantastic little indie gem. If you enjoy stories of an innocent youngster who gets swept up in something they think they can handle but really is about to ruin their life, then this film is absolutely something I would recommend to you. Here's why I highly recommend Hot Summer Nights, but also why that recommendation may come with an asterisk for some viewers.",/review/rw4299470/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2021,kosmasp,7," Hot and steamy
",Well not exactly ... although with Timothy seems to like summer movies. In this one he is into girls though. And some other (illegal) stuff of course too. Very well shot and with quite the interesting cast. Maika is as mesmerizing as ever ... but you also get a few other bit players who do an excellent job.,/review/rw4299470/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2020,questl-18592,5," Blah Summer Nights
","Solid acting and interesting visuals can't save this from being a fairly generic coming of age story that's a bit too artsy for it's own good. Hot Summer Nights is basically every other coming of age movie just with a fancier coat of paint on it. It's not a bad movie at all, but I do feel conflict watching it. Chalamet is obviously a talent but he's not able to save this from how by the numbers it is. Throw that in with how overly stylized they went with it and I just found it obnoxious at times.",/review/rw4299470/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2018,bkoganbing,6," Sand dunes, salty air, and drugs
","I guess you could be forgiven if you thought everyone on the Cape Cod peninaula
was toking up after seeing Hot Summer Nights. It seems to be more popular
than salt water activities.",/review/rw4299470/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2018,westsideschl,5," Had Potential
","Small town local young heartthrob Cannabis seller teams up w/nerdy reject to expand his business. Nerd ends up over his head while also chasing the local female femme fatale. Acting was good; backdrop tunes were OK for the '90s setup. 
Problems: A lot of wasted time on scenes that didn't contribute, i.e. overhead shots of a beach as well as a hurricane, and the sense of it being a hot Summer, none played a role in the story. In fact the hurricane, Bob, technically was a bust for a hurricane. A lot of the important character background was written & edited poorly, just sporadic bits here & there which made the story flow disruptive & confusing. Drug scenes, and party scenes were all pretty predictable. 
Major problem: The ending for all major characters went no where, and the death which occurs towards the end, could have been prevented knowing it's coming, and they have a gun. Didn't make any sense.",/review/rw4299470/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2017,oaksong,9," Not your usual coming of age story
","Daniel is bright but probably not given enough work to keep him interested in school. Summer's about to start and his mother decides to send him to live with her sister on the coast. He falls in with a crowd that isn't that ambitious and decides to raise the level of play, so to speak.",/review/rw4299470/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2018,rockman182,6," Hot Summer Nights (2018)
","This film should have everything going for it. A coming of age film featuring two of the hottest young leads of today. An 80's feel and vibe that should have made it a hit with people who like to feel that wave. It should really have been a film that I could enjoy. Unfortunately, I felt like Hot Summer Nights just got weaker as time went on and falls into genre cliches and fails to impress all around. Side note, Maika Monroe has my heart, good lord.",/review/rw4299470/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2018,ferguson-6,5," sprinkles and epsom salt
","Greetings again from the darkness. Crime, Romance and Bromance battle it out in the summer of 1991, accompanied by music from the 1970's, influenced by classic films of the 1980's and 90's, and starring 4 rising young stars of today. The debut feature film from writer/director Elijah Bynum comes across as the work of a film and music fanboy concerned with not leaving out any ideas in his only opportunity to make a movie. He shows enough here to likely justify another chance, but we can't help but wonder if assistance from a mentor might have fine-tuned this into a nice little gem, rather than a blip on the resume of the shooting stars he's working with.",/review/rw4299470/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2018,apryla-58795,5," I feel kinda ambivalent about everything BUT Alex Roe
",Timothee Chalamet was the reason I wanted to watch this. I think he is very talented and has a great onscreen presence. So I have to say I was really disappointed in this film. I've liked all the films I have seen him in so far but honestly I didn't think his performance in this was that great. Something was missing.,/review/rw4299470/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2018,Darth_Osmosis,8," Awesome!
","It's hard to describe or categorize.. but maybe something like if you mixed together an offbeat coming of age tale, teenage crime drama and a love story.. set it in the early 90s and gave it a sublime soundtrack! It's intense and oozes style, seriously it's great go see it!",/review/rw4299470/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2018,MovieCriticOnline,2," Really bizarre..
","The main issue I have is the lack of focus on the time period. The clothes felt 80s. The music 70s, sometimes early 80s, and worse Scorsese 50/60s music. But it actually took place in the 90s. It's a real problem when you have people making films from a period they weren't part of.",/review/rw4299470/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2018,stskotty,9," SO MUCH MORE THAN I EXPECTED
","I wasn't necessarily excited about movie before watching it. I was expecting a sort of knock off of a coming of age comedy set in a specific time period, throw in some sex and music and you have a run of the mill flick I've seen versions of a hundred times before Let me assure you this is not that! What an absolutely unique, fun spin on an age old story The director takes this film to unexpected places and the 3 young lead actors are without a doubt the Hollywood A-list of tomorrow.
If you are trying to decide if you want to watch this or something else do yourself a favor and watch Hot Summer Nights. It's completely different from what you think it will be in the best possible way",/review/rw4299470/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2022,injury-65447,4," A movie that thinks it's cool
","This movie was annoying. It is smug, strutting and stylish. It thinks it's incredibly cool but actually it is boring, basic and derivative. Definitely style over substance.",/review/rw4299470/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2019,Sean_Biggins,1," There's not much to this movie
","First off, I was wondering how they EVER got the rights to use Bowie's Space Oddity but I just checked and it was the only song Bowie ever recorded that he didn't own the publishing rights to. What a shame.",/review/rw4299470/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2018,phd_travel,2," Cliched story with an unappealing cast
","The romance of the couple vs disapproving brother is a familiar story. If the cast was more appealing it might have worked. But here they all don't look right. Alex Roe isn't cool or dangerous looking. He's just like an
Average Joe from South London. 
Maika Monroe isn't too alluring just druggie type. No chemistry with the too wimpy looking Timothy Chalamet who isn't up to playing teen romantic lead. The violence feels contrived. The obtrusive music and dark lighting don't help. And the jumping back and forth is so confusing.",/review/rw4299470/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2020,resireg,5," Pretty much the movie convinces you that using/selling drugs is the key to have sex.
","The movi is not all bad. It gives us an idea about the summer hollidays in the Massachusetts coast, and actually the movie started in an amazing way. I felt like the joyride was beginning, but suddenly, the kovie centers on a few chatacters that we are supposed to root for. Essentially the main character is a friandless loser who has the brilliant idea of becoming a drug dealer, so in weeks he becomes rich, start sleeping with the hottest girl in town and becomes friends with the local Don Juan.",/review/rw4299470/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2020,JustOneOpinion,5," Was ok until the end
","Despite some reservations about a few characters I was enjoying this movie; until the ending. Made the movie worthless to me. Hunters character seems to be turning a corner with his life then the next minute just accepts death without even the slightest fight, literally! Daniel just leaves, running for his life, with no knowledge of what's happened to Hunter; so apart from realising he has to run because of his stupidity and ego, I don't see the coming of age part. About the only bit that was ok was McKayla leaving, that was understandable. The kid narrating was a little weird though, but definitely not the worst part. Honestly my favourite thing from the whole movie was the song Fading Like A Flower by Roxette, and they only play a few lines of it. I think the actors where good but I have no interest in watching it again.",/review/rw4299470/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2021,gpcheng87,6," Story told well, but without purpose.
","5 for meandering story with no meaningful ending, 6 for the acting; everyone did well. Beautifully shot. Great soundtrack. Basically, this movie is probably what happens when you bump into an old acquaintance and they're like, ""Oh, hey, did you hear about that guy from wherever from way back when? Well, let me tell you..."" The friend launches into a long-winded story that you end up listening to over beers and smokes and at the end, they finish with, ""...and no one knows, bro. It's anyone's guess."" You're left heading home wondering if that was a waste of time - it was told well, but what was the point? There wasn't a lesson, or resolution, or even an opinion/point made. For me, this immediately seemed like an attempt at a version of ""The Virgin Suicides"" (1999). Entertaining enough; worth a watch.",/review/rw4299470/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2020,adamb-49813,6," A romanticized Summer compilation with some depth
","Enjoyable coming of age/crime flick probably most suited to a younger audience. The story telling was lazy with lots of jump cuts, kind of like a highlight reel of the ups and downs of Danny's summer. You really don't see any relationships develop or get to know any characters in depth. The whole movie is more like a romanticized compilation showing only start and the end of the journey with no middle. That said it started out very superficial and over the top but ended surprisingly heavy and went against a few of my expectations.",/review/rw4299470/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2021,harrylosborne,5," Jumbled, disorganised, and not that engaging
","I have a love-hate relationship with A24 and their films of varying qualities, but I respect them for producing films that otherwise would not receive the acclaim that they deserve.",/review/rw4299470/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2018,baileywiley,7," Hot summer Nights
","This coming-to-age film starring some pretty decent talent with the likes of Maika Monroe and Thomas Jane, is about a boy who becomes entangled in a world of drugs, money, and corruption during one summer in Cape Cod, now going into this movie I saw nothing but the one trailer that was released of my knowledge, and was pretty much stoked. I'm a big fan of these underground goodies not enough people talk about, also the sheer fact you had the likes of Maika (It follows), which was reason enough to get me to watch it because that was a great film, and i was throughly surprised not only with the films setting, and plot. This film has great cinematography and a all around 80's feel to it from the clothes that these kids wear all the way to the drive in movie theater. And performance from all the cast is quite well from a Timothy who did well playing a shy, awkward kid. To Thomas Jane's Odd Cop role. 
It's a movie that I'll reconsider watching again, maybe even owning on blu Ray. Because the rewatchability is there",/review/rw4299470/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2020,kerrodnolan,3," What even...
","Besides Timothée Chalamet being among the incredibly small minority of positives in this film, 'Hot Summer Nights' feels like it's having an edgy identity crisis. The direction doesn't know whether it wants be either a modern, ""mature"" coming-of-age story; or if it wants to be a Martin Scorsese crime drama. And the blend of those two approaches is painfully awkward, with awfully amateur execution. Finally, just to dig into the wound which is this lacklustre feature, the rest of the cast could not be any less convincing in their performances, causing me to care about those characters even less -- and they were criminally forgettable, just in the screenplay alone.",/review/rw4299470/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2018,BeneCumb,7," Exploitation of a fine actor in a trivial story
","Timothée Chalamet is definitely among the new finest young actors (as e.g. River Phoenix was) and I think he is worth have an eye to him. Alas, obtaining fame does not come from profound works only; for wider audience, one should appear in movies dealing with more ""timeless"" topics, often providing ""been there, seen that"" feelings. So is Hot Summer Nights where coming of age, drugs, partying, love and affection, etc. are depicted in a rather lopsided manner, from the perspective of the young only, raising questions e.g. Where were the police and relatives, how could such a drug business could be unseen? The inevitable solution came too abruptly, and the ending could have been more sophisticated as well.",/review/rw4299470/?ref_=tt_urv
