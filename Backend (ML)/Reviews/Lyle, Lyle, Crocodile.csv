3 October 2015,claudio_carvalho,4," How to Destroy the Past with the Mediocrity of the Present
","In 1984, fans of sci-fi with action were surprised by ""Terminator"", one of the best films of this genre in the cinema industry. Followed by the excellent sequel ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" (1991), the franchise apparently ended in 2003 with ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"". However, in 2008, it was released the series ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles"" that also worked well showing how Sarah and John Connor survived along the years. In 2009, the exhausted franchise was revived by Hollywood with ""Terminator Salvation"". ",/review/rw3625140/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2015,TheLittleSongbird,3," A once classic film series hits rock-bottom
","The first two Terminator films are among the best of their genre and are brilliant films also in their own right. Rise of the Machines started the series' decline and had its faults but also had some good things that made it better than its reputation, while Terminator Salvation although with its moments was even more disappointing. While not a complete disaster, the latest in the Terminator franchise is the worst yet and sees a once classic series at rock bottom.",/review/rw3625140/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2015,sentient-74528,1," They finally lost it
","The Terminator franchise started with a low-budget thriller film that introduced a very interesting and compelling story about a woman who is a target of a ruthless man from the future that turns up to be a cyborg. It was a simple yet good story and a good piece of science fiction. Why was it a good film? Well, for starters, the bad guy, i.e the terminator, according to Kyle Reese, doesn't feel pain or pity, can't be reasoned with, can't be bargained with. It was the perfect killer, and almost invincible. So there you got all the elements of a good story.",/review/rw3625140/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2020,fraser-simons,7," Little bit dumb but pretty fun
","Pretty contrived and cheesy but the acting wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. It's fun, has plenty of action and throwback Easter eggs. It won't blow you away but it's a decent action flick. If it had a better script it would have had more potential.",/review/rw3625140/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,imseeg,3," The WORST edition of the entire series!!!
",How low can they go?,/review/rw3625140/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2020,MR-ODIN,," Genisys
","Not quite as bad as i thought it would be, Terminator: Genisys brings back the nostalgia of the first two films. It even has the same old-school vibe to it. But when you get to its core, Genisys is simply a rehash of the first two masterpieces, which are so good there was no point in revisiting them.",/review/rw3625140/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2016,fairdraconica,1," This film re-writes the original thing and turns it into a stupid joke!
","Worst Terminator ever and a mockery of everything that was credible before! The very first Terminator had that awesome tragic vibe and hopelessness about it, when Kyle Reese (the scarred, traumatised, thin man, grown up starving and surviving, as best as he could, in the world destroyed by war) was the only hope of the oblivious humanity, and even he didn't believe in himself, but made his ultimate sacrifice through pain, suffering and death, nonetheless. He and Sarah were just two regular human beings, children of their worlds.",/review/rw3625140/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2015,madmaxwell93,1," The absolute worst in the series
","There is really nothing to say about this film besides that it's a complete slap in the face to anyone who is a fan of the Terminator franchise. The plot is very tedious and the script is poorly thought out. For instance, nothing in this movie makes any sense whatsoever. And oh yes, I am going to spoil it for some folks.",/review/rw3625140/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2015,prospectus_capricornium,5," Way Below James Cameron's Terminator
","The newest entry to the Terminator franchise, strives with towering efforts to reclaim the glory of its two James Cameron-directed predecessors, but miserably fails to deliver even a faint hint of wit and sense, in the wake of its convoluted confusion-infested time-travel narrative.",/review/rw3625140/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2015,ivo-cobra8,1," The Worst awful Terminator film I have ever watched. Been a Terminator fan my whole life since my childhood and we get this?

26 June 2015,Finfrosk86,8," Speaking as a Terminator-fan: Excellent. At times perfect.

6 December 2018,dpolwatte,6," Terminator Genysis
","A destruction of a franchise trying to reboot it and failing for the third time.
If you look closer Mr. James Cameron finished the franchise in the second. And many tried to re boot it twice creating spectacular failures. The third however is another same scenario film that establishes the same losing streak. Like I said a lot funds wasted for something useless without any premise.",/review/rw3625140/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2015,abyboom-1,5," Once again Hollywood shows us how difficult it is to make a good Terminator movie
",The Terminator movies (sans TS - I am not even sure if it's part of the cannon) are basically chase films with the element of time travel thrown in to create unique Sci-fi protagonists and antagonists.,/review/rw3625140/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2015,Lambysalamby,7," Though flawed, it was better than I expected...
","The new Terminator wasn't terrible! I'm surprised. Though it had its flaws it was much better then Terminator 3 and Salvation... and I actually enjoyed it mostly. I probably won't be watching it like 30 times like Judgement Day, but its not like I expected it to ever live up to Cameron's work....",/review/rw3625140/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2015,jarekczarnecki,1," WOW, IMDb rating is a joke
","I am so disgusted with this movie and its rating that I have decided to sign up here for the first time and write my opinion. There is no way this movie is a 7.0/10. Not even close and it never will be. If this is a 7.0 then Salvation is a 14.0/10. James Cameron should be ashamed for even entertaining the idea that this movie is good. He has made me realize that everyone can be bought for the right amount. I hope he got paid a lot of money to say ""If you are a terminator fan, you will love this movie"", because he has lost a lot of respect with that statement. Hope it was worth it James!",/review/rw3625140/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2015,bryank-04844,3," Don't allow another 'Terminator' movie to be made unless James Cameron comes back to write and direct.
","The year is 2015 and we have our fifth 'Terminator' film, titled 'Terminator Genisys' or simply 'Terminator 5'. I'm going to start by saying that there should NOT be another 'Terminator' film made unless James Cameron returns to write and direct it. There have been three 'Terminator' movies since 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day', all of which were made by people other than James Cameron. How did they turn out? Let's just say they were less than stellar.",/review/rw3625140/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2015,e-1529,2," An insult to the franchise
","I'm a big Terminator 1 and 2 fan. They are 2 of my favourite sci-fi movies of all time. Terminator 3 and 4 were decent but both quite dull and not even comparable to their predecessors. Terminator 5 is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There are no words to describe how awful this is. They couldn't have made it any worse even if they tried. Everything from the acting to the script to the special effects is absolutely laughable. And yes I did start laughing at some point, thinking 'what the hell is going on here?'. The people who wrote the script should be fired, the actors should go to acting classes and Arnie should apologise to the fans for this monstrosity. This should have never been made. What a joke of a movie.",/review/rw3625140/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2015,ceejay-cj,3," Another two hours of a dead horse being flogged sold to the public by Hollywood.
","The story ended with T2, Cameron told all the story needed and moved on unlike fans of this sorry forced franchise and the three studios that each picked up the rights and made one contrived cash-grab after the next before passing it on one after the other like a dirty whore. ",/review/rw3625140/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2022,elliotjeory,5," Special effects were cool. Theoretically.
",And I did like Emilia Clarke as Sarah Connor however I find Jai Courtney irritating and I call him the franchise terminator because he killed the Die Hard franchise too. Also the third act was a let down. A real anti climax. Best thing was J. K Simmons. The travelling robots line is hilarious.,/review/rw3625140/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2015,marrich2009,1," Hollywood soup for the catatonic
","Against all odds I was amazed I made it to the end of this movie. I only wish I could go back in time and tell my wife to talk me out of the suggestion I made to see Terminator Genisys. The original Terminator movie is a cult classic and yes, the remade scenes entertained me on a nostalgia level but as for the rest of the script, it played out like an episode of neighbours. The acting was terrible, the casting was terrible, the action sequences...If I said, give me $170 million dollars for me to take a dump and then I'll feed it to the masses and make a profit, you'd think I was insane - yet Hollywood does it again. Another 3 dimensional turd (yes I sadly paid the extra for the 3D which only really amounted to feeling like someone was actually shi**ing in my face) served up for the intellectually bereft to eat popcorn too. I don't know where these great reviews are coming from, but they're certainly not from Ireland, because in my cinema there was a general feeling of agitation and boredom about an hour into the movie. ",/review/rw3625140/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2015,moviexclusive,7," If you can accept a revisionist sequel, you'll enjoy this fine piece of summer popcorn entertainment that perfectly captures the spirit and tone of the James Cameron originals
","Three sequels and thirty-one years after James Cameron's seminal man-versus-machine science-fiction, 'Terminator Genisys' attempts to make the franchise relevant for a whole new generation by re-setting the clock. So here is as much advice as warning to fans – you'll do well not to cling too stubbornly to what you already know if you are going to appreciate the liberties which the filmmakers have taken in order to invigorate this aging series.",/review/rw3625140/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2022,Xstal,6," Terminal Extermination...
