9 August 2002,Kaserynofthegyre,," An oasis of wit
","Dinnerladies is uniquely british and unsurprisingly does not travel well beyond these shores.  There is little physical humour and the references are primarily based on UK culture and the north of England in particular. However, it is also the best example of its type I've ever seen. Victoria Wood's dialogue is fantastic, (Alan Bennett is the only other writer in her league in this regard).  The staging is restricted (effectively one set, two rooms) the plots are secondary and contrived because they are of no real significance.  It is all merely backdrop for the characters Ms Wood creates and the way they speak to, across and around each other.",/review/rw5877481/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2020,Sleepin_Dragon,9," What a wonderful comedy.
","Dinnerladies ranks as one of the best comedies of all all time, it's as witty, hilarious and all out lovely as it was when it first aired.",/review/rw5877481/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2003,Benguin,," Charming and delightful
","'dinnerladies' (sic) was a short lived but concise series which was a delight to watch. The scripts were quite simply charming. Victoria Wood's attention to character detail is so well refined, there is little like it elsewhere in the land of situation comedy. Even series which clock up over a hundred episodes do not have the brilliance or depth of character as can be seen here.",/review/rw5877481/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2003,Markhoni,," Charming comedy which did not outstay its welcome
","A whimsical observational comedy from Victoria Wood. As another contributor said, not a million miles away from the works of Allan Bennett. It featured a mixture of Wood's 'repertory company', familiar from her other shows such as Duncan Preston and Celia Imrie and talented Northern English character actors such as Sue Devaney and Thelma Barlow (both veterans of the long-running soap 'Coronation Street') The main characters were richly detailed, the lesser ones caricatures, but very recognisable types. The one false note, I feel, was struck by the character of the heroine Bren's alcoholic, fantasist mother who made occasional raucous appearances. She was a grotesque figure, out of the wilder reaches of Charles Dickens, and seemed to have been included merely to give an opportunity for Wood's old pal Julie Walters to overact shamelessly. Victoria Wood bravely decided to end this popular show after only two series while it was still fresh (like the dinnerladies' bacon butties).",/review/rw5877481/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2019,ygwerin1,8," Cooking with gas
","Brilliant stuff, I've always loved Victoria Wood and everything she's ever done. After watching her TV shows there's some of her repertory company, co-star Julie Walters, Celia Imrie, and Duncan Preston. I've never watched Coronation Street as I am not a fan of soaps, but I recognised two of its regulars (Anne Reed and Thelma Barlow) though I didn't know the actresses names. It was good to be introduced to actresses who were new to me, Shobna Gulati and Maxine Peake, as well as to Andrew Dunn.",/review/rw5877481/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2000,Richpq-2,," The (hilarious) lives and loves of a group of dinner ladies
","It might not sound like an amusing premise, but believe me, it's funny. This is a great show from Victoria Wood, with a wonderful ensemble cast, including Celia Imrie and Julie Walters, which has got to lead to some laughs. As well as humour it's got its more serious moments, making it all-round great entertainment. Definitely one to watch.",/review/rw5877481/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2007,simon3818,10," This is excellent.

11 April 2014,gee-15,9," A funny and hopeful sitcom
","Let's see...during the course of this series you have a woman who is implied to be in an abusive marriage, a man gets cancer, two people die (one of them a main character), a woman gets divorced and has a nervous breakdown, another woman has a baby out of wedlock and abandons him (temporarily). All of them end up losing their jobs...and this is a comedy.",/review/rw5877481/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2003,messynessie,," Great! Fab! Hilarious!
","I absolutely love this show! It's the highlight of my week, watching it on a Friday night. It has me in hysterics from start to finish. I've heard a lot of people say they don't like it, but I just can't see why. It captures men and women perfectly, and that's REAL men and women, not just stereotypes. The way Tony just gives up when the girls start talking about PMS or blokes, the way Dolly criticises Jean in practically every other sentence, the way Bren and Tony never quite get together and you really want them to, the way Stan won't go in the ladies loo... Hilarious every time! Ok, it hasn't got MUCH staying power, as they talk about mostly current issues, but I hope it goes on for a good long time. I f every comedy was as good as this, the world would be a much happier place. Victoria Wood is a comic genius and totally underrated. She totally understands real people's thoughts and feelings! If only Friends was this good...",/review/rw5877481/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2000,jenny_r81,," Bitter Sweetness
","The way in which ""dinnerladies"" is presented is enough to endear you to the show on its own. Each of the characters are simply that - their own little character more often than not in their own little world. The humour comes from their interaction and their experiences, and Victoria Wood's unique writing style.",/review/rw5877481/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2006,hayley0688,10," This is British comedy as it ought to be!
","Those who make any form of negative comments about this hilarious comedy should have their heads tested. This program is British comedy at its best, capturing the dry wit and sarcasm that is such a common feature of the great Englishman/ woman. Victoria Wood's writing is pure genius and the incredibly talented actors who surround her deliver those classic lines with impeccable timing. Victoria Wood resists the temptation, that so many ""comedians"" succumb to, of using slap stick to gain laughs. By capturing the charming characteristics of normal everyday people, particularly the Northern culture, that we can all relate to, Wood is 100% successful in producing a comedy which proves that British comedy shows ARE the funniest in the world.",/review/rw5877481/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2005,kenpitcher,," The wit and charm of Dinner Ladies
","I have watched on DVD hundreds of times All the episodes of Dinner Ladies. Those who did not like or maybe not quite understood some of the humour, check it out again, there are a great many hidden gems as to the brilliant mind of Victoria woods writing. ""He played my body like a pinball machine. I lit up, paid out, and no tilting"" was the brilliant line of Bren (victoria wood) mother (Julie Walters) describing her relationship with her young man. It was everyday folk, talking about everyday issues. Hidden behind the charm and the humour the show showed its emotional side, with Bren giving up her holiday to help her mother financially, single mothers, and redundancy. The show lasted two series. I look with great hesitation Victoria Woods next project.",/review/rw5877481/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2005,IridescentTranquility,10," Life In A Northern Canteen
","Dinnerladies is a really excellent comedy. I have watched it over and over again and never seem to be able to get tired of it. The important thing here is that everyone has a life of their own. Taking as a starting point a scene many people might see every day - a canteen in a factory and the people who serve in it - might sound like a very boring idea, but the fact that Bren, Dolly, Anita, Twinkle and Jean are dinnerladies is really only secondary to the plot.

5 April 2005,Sabrejetp,," What do the residents of Coronation St. watch for light entertainment?
","It's no secret that Victoria Wood is a fan of soaps and it's clear that as a child she spent a lot of time watching popular TV, as did most of us. dinnerladies, which at the time of broadcast was presented as a revival of the sit-com has plenty of soap-opera aspects as well, and is all the better for them.",/review/rw5877481/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2007,Moviefan54,9," Another example of great British humour
","I love this show. I had heard of it before when Shobna Gulati went to ""Coronation Street"" to play Sunita. Her biography said that she had previously appeared in the highly-rated ""dinnerladies"". ""dinnerladies"" began broadcasting on Vision TV in Canada in June, and I was pleased to see Thelma Barlow, whom I had known as Mavis Wilton in ""Coronation Street"", as part of the cast also.",/review/rw5877481/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2003,Dissector,," Watch it again in 10 years REPRO
","with regards to the comments on this TV show by REPRO, all I can say is watch it again in another 10  years, remember it took that long for ""Monty Python"" to be appreciated around the world, but don't worry about being so far behind in your appreciation, the rest of the world catches up with the Brit humour EVENTUALLY, just remember ""Are You Being Served"" ""Keeping Up Appearences"" and ""Benny Hill""  are just a few examples.",/review/rw5877481/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2014,alistairjwalker,," Brilliant
","It is just brilliant. Doesn't date other than a few references, the characters are beautifully drawn, other than Brens mum who is just a grotesque, but remarkably it still works. I love the limited set, I love the repetition of lines used like catch phrases (I fell off a diving board in Guernsey) and I love the wordplay (I don't mean cucumber, sounds like cucumber, suffragette thats it).",/review/rw5877481/?ref_=tt_urv

16 February 2005,sheerbliss,," Finest Wood!
","This is truly Victoria Wood at her finest! The ensemble cast at once amuse you with gentle comedy, belly laughs & an enduring quality that has you involved with the characters lives so you end up crying with them as well as laughing - so true to life! If you live in the UK then you will have come across an example of each of the characters in your own lives which I feel is the real secret behind the attraction of this series. We can relate to it and recognise someone that has crossed our paths at sometime or, if we are brutally honest with our selves, something of our own personality in any one of the solidly acted characters. This show has all the ingredients of a good British comedy....as well as the touch of drama needed to make us care about the characters....more than that though it is also a love story, a gentle struggle to seek that 'one person' who you know is right for you but it takes a lot of courage & day to day living to make it come true unlike the 'fairy tale' romances we are usually presented with. Who amongst you out there has not had feelings for someone & struggled with yourself & convention to do something about it, just like Tony & Bren? Who hasn't worked with someone with the naivety of Anita who can drive you up the wall with her stupidity but at the same time engenders a feeling of being a real friend? And as for Dolly and Jean? They epitomise many, many ladies we ALL know! Victoria Wood has yet again managed to highlight the complexities of human characters & frailties but with an observational humour that makes her such a master at her craft. We can laugh with them, we can cry with them, we want them to have a happy ending but at the same time we are sad for ourselves because we know that their success means no more of the series for us!!",/review/rw5877481/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2006,beresfordjd,10," Genius writing and superlative performances.
","Victoria herself said that Dinnerladies looked old fashioned against the Royle Family but I believe that its format is its strength. I remember watching the first series and thinking this is not as good as I expected from Victoria Wood but you have to watch it again because now I think both the series are genius. Fantastic scripts (apparently there is not an ad-lib, everything is tightly scripted) written brilliantly. It rewards repeated watching and just gets funnier every time you see it. The performances are fantastic from all the cast-special mentions for Andrew Dunn, Duncan Preston, Celia Imrie, Shobna Gulati, Anne Reid and the fantastic Thelma Barlow. Maxine Peake (brilliant actress) was so lucky to get the part of Twinkle as her first acting job. Even the small appearances are wonderfully observed and performed.",/review/rw5877481/?ref_=tt_urv

","When this series first aired in 1998, me being only 10 years old it didn't grab me as an audience member, but by the time the second series was airing on BBC (I forget which year) I had grown up sufficiently and maybe I was only about 13 or 14 but I've always been old-headed as my parents say so this sitcom really appealed to me.",/review/rw5877481/?ref_=tt_urv
