6 June 1999,Raskolnikov,10," Hidden Treasure
","Phillip Kaufman's loving examination of Anais Nin's relationship with Henry and June Miller is an enthralling journey.  In the film Anais is inspired by Henry and June to descend into a world of debauchery that fuels her erotic writing.  We the audience see Henry and June through the eyes of Anais, which may mean it's not exactly as they really were, but rather a romanticised version of them.  This is NOT a biopic of Henry Miller, which is the foolish mistake that some reviewers seemed to make on the films release.",/review/rw1273930/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2007,lastliberal,8," I've done the vilest things - the foulest things - but I've done them... superbly.
","Anaïs Nin is hailed by many critics as one of the finest examples of writers of female erotica. She was one of the first women to really explore the realm of erotic writing, and certainly the first prominent woman in modern Europe to write erotica. Henry and June is based upon her life in Paris around 1931, and her relationship with Henry and June Miller. This relationship strongly influenced her as both a woman and an author.",/review/rw1273930/?ref_=tt_urv

30 December 2004,Idocamstuf,8," An enchanting and overlooked film
","Director Phillip Kaufman stirred up quite a bit of controversy when this film was first being released, most likely because of the intensity of the love scenes, but after watching the DVD I am now thinking that this film could have maybe slipped by with an R rating. The film faired poorly at the box-office, but seemed to have received generally positive reviews. The best element of this film is the atmosphere, which truly resembles the time period in which the film takes place. The story of the romance between the two writers is interesting on its own, but the great acting gives it a boost. Overall, a highly worthwhile film that will come as a pleasant surprise. The 6.3 rating is too low. I would say it deserves at the very least a 7. Ill give it an 8.",/review/rw1273930/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2010,smatysia,8," Great role for Maria de Medieros
","A lot was good here. One of the thing that was ""bad"" was almost certainly deliberate -- the contrast between the coarse, gross facial features of Fred Ward, in juxtaposition with the extremely delicate visage of Maria de Medeiros. One thing that could have been better: the ""baldness"" of Fred Ward. I don't know him, and don't know if he's bald, but this looked like a very bad make-up job. Surely they could do better in 1990. Or did Miller shave the top of his head and pretend to be bald? I don't know, but I doubt it. In spite of the title, the movie is really about Anais Nin. This was a fine performance by Miss de Medieros, and is worth watching for that alone. It won't appeal to the car chase-and-explosion crowd, but it's not for them anyway. I don't see what made the difference from an ""R"" rating.",/review/rw1273930/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2008,Galina_movie_fan,8," Anaïs Nin: ""Something is always born of excess - great art was born of great terror, great loneliness, great inhibitions, instabilities, and it always balances them.""
","""Henry & June"" (1990) by Philip Kaufman which is based on the book by Anais Nin is a wonderful film, a rare and admirable example of how an art-house erotic film should be made. It tells an interesting story that concerns the famous and scandalous American writer Henry Miller during the period of work on his first major work, ""Tropic of Cancer"" in 1931 in Paris and two women without whom the book would not have happened. One of them is his wife, June Miller, who is a constant presence under the different names in all Miller's works. The other - Henry's (and June's) close friend, lover, and confidant, Anais Nin. The film is an adaptation or mediation over the Anais Nin's journal which she wrote for 60 years and described in it the intimate details her inner world, including experiences with sexuality, and the meetings and relationships with prominent bohemian personalities of literature and art, who came from around the world to Paris, always known as the Mecca for creative individuals. Nin said about her life long writing in diary, ""This diary is my kief, hashish, and opium pipe. This is my drug and my vice."" Anais met in Paris provincial but talented non-conformist Miller and his exotic, sensual, and irresistible wife June (Uma Thurman never looked so attractive, as in this movie) and began affairs with both of them that would change their lives and influence enormously both Miller's and Nin's literary work. Anais is also known and praised as one of the first and the finest female writers of erotica. One of the reasons for film's success was director/writer Philip Kaufman's ability to delicately transfer to the screen the erotic intense atmosphere of Nin's writing as well as the spirit of Bohemian Paris in the beginning of the 1930s.",/review/rw1273930/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2005,moonspinner55,5," Nudity doesn't necessarily equate with eroticism
","In 1931 Paris, French authoress Anaïs Nin, doing a study on D.H. Lawrence, finds herself intrigued by different variations of sexuality; she and her husband Hugo Guiler are drawn into friendship with Americans Henry Miller and his volatile bisexual wife, June. Miller, the unpublished New York writer just on the verge of a breakthrough with ""Tropic of Cancer"", sees Anaïs as a sexy child and has a half-hearted affair with her, but June Miller's feelings seem to go much deeper. Maria de Medeiros as Nin has a marvelous face and graceful manner that nearly manage to keep this handsome but unenlightening sexual odyssey together. Director Philip Kaufman hopes to be as uninhibited as his characters but, despite an NC-17 rating, his sexual sequences feel truncated (and when nudity is trotted out--as in the whorehouse sequence--it fails to stand in for true eroticism). Fred Ward, always worth a look, seems held back as Miller, restrained, and he's not helped by a bald plate which at times looks unconvincing; Uma Thurman has a smaller role as June, and Kaufman allows her to pose and smolder a bit too much, but she's looser on the screen and brings the narrative some much-needed danger. The picture has a lot of ambiance and is briskly paced and fancifully told, but it just doesn't succeed at being a risk-taking exploration of human sexuality simply because Kaufman takes so few risks. ** from ****",/review/rw1273930/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2002,zenlunatic,7," Maria de Medeiros as Anais = Perfect
","If you're drawn to this film as a Henry Miller fan and expecting the Paris of Tropic of Cancer, you'll be let down.  This film is a character-driven drama and therefore it is not intended to reproduce Miller's vision. Instead, the film focuses on (then) newly revealed excerpts from Anais Nin's diary.  Four characters: Miller, Anais, June (Miller's wife), and Hugo (Anais' husband) complete the love square within which fairly complex relationships play out.",/review/rw1273930/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2010,mjneu59,4," Art can be agony
","Philip Kaufman tries to recreate 1931 Paris in much the same way he successfully recreated 1968 Prague in 'The Unbearable Lightness of Being', and with roughly the same ménage-a-trois. But in trying to make lightning strike twice he apparently lost sight of the difference between sexual liberation and self-indulgence, and what was meant (again) to be an uncensored celebration of life and love resembles, here, something not unlike '9½ Weeks' for egghead intellectuals. Perhaps avid Henry Miller fans will appreciate all the highbrow eroticism, but for most of the film the characters do little else except agonize over Art and tell one another what geniuses they each are. Kaufman's luck with casting is unimpaired (Uma Thurmon's June Miller calls to mind Greta Garbo doing an imitation of Mae West), but his direction is almost comically self-conscious, built around a visual scheme of tight, TV screen close-ups and an oh, so naughty depiction of libertine Paris which pales next to Alan Rudolph's similar but more colorful portrait in 'The Moderns'. Posterity will remember the film for its groundbreaking adults only NC-17 rating, a distinction hardly earned by such tame soft-core entertainment.",/review/rw1273930/?ref_=tt_urv

She has an affair with the bombastic bohemian Henry Miller (Fred Ward) and his wife June (Uma Thurman). They form an intriguing love triangle as he writes his first novel 'Tropic of Cancer'.

29 August 2005,pderocco,2," I wish I was back in high school...
","when this sort of thing seemed so cool. In all fairness, I only watched the first three quarters of this movie, but that's all I could stay awake for. Does anyone find all this talk about ""liberation,"" ""inner self,"" and so on, at all convincing? Just about every line lacks verisimilitude. Let's back up the TiVo for a minute... ""I've never been with a woman I could be so sincere with."" (I need to remember that one next time I'm in a bar.) ""Everybody says sex is obscene. The only true obscenity is war."" (Heavy, dude.) ""I saw your true nature when you were dancing out there."" (Another good pickup line.) ""I'd love you at eleven--I love you now--I will love you at a hundred."" (I'll be asleep at eleven.) Is this how Henry Miller really talked? Or is it merely how Anais Nin really wrote? Even her own lines: ""I've been dying to write something about it--about how necessary this book is for our times. You gave us a blood transfusion."" No actress could pull such a line off gracefully, and Maria de Medeiros is no exception.",/review/rw1273930/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2011,D_Burke,4," ""Henry & June"" Is Not As Great As It Thinks It Is
","Why is it that movies that are groundbreaking and controversial because of their prurient content are almost always never really great films to begin with? ""Deep Throat"" (1972) was the very first hardcore porn film that modern-day audiences went to see in droves, yet it was not a good movie, and was far from erotic or sexy. ""Fritz The Cat"" (1972) was the first animated motion picture to be rated X, yet it was a series of vignettes with a character who was really a jerk.

1 January 2006,ayn5242,3," To call it pretentious would be a kindness.
","What, I wonder, is the superlative of pretentious. Yes, I know that it's 'most pretentious,' but that doesn't seem dramatic enough to describe this very long, long journey into total self-congratulatory eroticism. The film is based on portions of Anais Nin's diaries -- she wrote something like 9,000 pages, and you don't need to read more than a tenth of those to know that you are in the hands of one of the most self absorbed women who ever walked the planet. For one who is supposed to have been all about Art, she really seems to have been all about Anais. Nothing else much mattered. And this film, which is supposed to focus on her relationship with Henry and June Miller, really is all about her.

20 June 2010,TedMichaelMor,10," ""Basque Song""
","Phillip Kaufman's ""Henry & June"", like other films he directed, emerges as an ensemble performance and, following a rubric from Anaïs Nin, he ""moves from the dream outward."" Phillip and Rose Kaufman collaborate on his films. They co-authored this screenplay. Kaufman's son, I think, took part in its creation. Add the influence of the great cinematographer Philippe Rousselot and auteur film editor Dede Allen to subtle (though sometimes robust) acting, perfect casting, and music defining time and mood, location that mirror the time and world of the actual events, and yet one still barely begins to grasp the elements of the ensemble.",/review/rw1273930/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2006,zetes,9," Artful and sexy
","Philip Kaufman is a director whose films are hard to connect. He's made three of my all-time favorite films, Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978), The Right Stuff (1983) and The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1988). His follow-up to The Unbearable Lightness of Being is perhaps too similar in focus and subject. Henry & June, much like TULB, is based on European literature and set in Europe, very artful in its creation, and about sex. Actually, this film is all about sex. A lot of people don't seem to like it because it doesn't seem to have much point other than the sex. But I think there's a place for erotic art, and, damn, this film is one of the most erotic works ever made. I bet you a dollar you can't make it through without touching yourself at least once. I never found it boring; I was utterly absorbed by the beauty of it all. Maria de Madeiros, whom you will remember being pleasured orally by Bruce Willis in Pulp Fiction, is the star (she plays Anaïs Nin). I have to wonder, watching this movie, why she didn't become the biggest star in the world. She certainly is one of the sexiest women ever to appear on screen. Her eyes are maddening. It almost doesn't matter for this film, but she gives quite a good performance, too. Uma Thurman is also quite sexy, and also gives a fine performance. I'm not a big fan, truth be told, but this is one of her best performances. I was less impressed with Fred Ward, who plays Henry Miller, and Richard E. Grant doesn't quite pull off an American accent. I don't know. I don't think I can ever see him as anyone besides Withnail again. Kevin Spacey is also good in a small supporting performance.",/review/rw1273930/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2003,domino1003,9," 13 years Later...
","I am still affected by this film. I worked at the theater that had shown it and was surrounded by the controversy. It got the first NC-17 rating ever (Which is pretty much a kiss of death, like the film ""Showgirls.""). The reason for the rating? An erotic picture of a woman and an octopus!(True story!). Anyway, this was a pretty intense film, and the triangle(Henry, June, and Annis)was pretty interesting, too. The one who stole the film though is Kevin Spacey(Early in his career)as Osbourne, the writer that's obsessed with naked female contortionists. I liked the feel of 1930's Paris and the cinematography. Watch out for a cameo by Gary Oldman as Pop (He was married to Uma Thurman at the time.).",/review/rw1273930/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2004,Quinoa1984,8," Certainly is erotic, and sublimely bizarre at times, but the acting is a little off too
","Philip Kaufman's NC-17 rated (the first with the rating) Henry and June chronicles the romances and times of Anais Nin (Maria De Medeiros, pre-Pulp Fiction territory), an author who mostly chronicled her passions and emotions with the opposite sex, as well as her imagination in her times in Paris.  She is with the banker Hugo (Richard E. Grant) when Henry Miller (Fred Ward) comes into town with some friends.  He hasn't been published yet, and is in a give and take, sensual relationship with June (the totally gorgeous Uma Thurman), but it becomes clear that he has as much feeling for Anais as she does.

","I really enjoyed seeing Henry and June again on the satellite  15 years after its release. The relationship between June and Anaïs - and between both of them and Henry is dark, sensual, and at times, graphic. This is a very ""steamy"" movie for its time.

","I loved this picture because it has beautiful cinematography and settings of Paris. But that's not all, Uma Thurman has so damn beautiful as the wife of Fred Ward who charms the young, naive, but tricky Anais Nin played superbly by Maria de Mardieos. Fred Ward as a little weird as the American writer who charms Anais. Uma was great with her thick New York accent and her beauty.

24 January 2006,hall895,5," Who knew sex could be so boring?
","Henry & June is all about sex. People have sex, people talk about sex, people write about sex, people dream about sex. While the film certainly has plenty of sex it lacks other essentials, most notably a plot to tie all the sex together. The story, such as it is, unfolds in 1930s Paris and is told from the perspective of young French writer Anais Nin, based on her secret diaries which aren't very secret anymore. Young Anais really likes sex. Who in this movie doesn't? Not completely satisfied with her rather dull banker husband Hugo, Anais is intrigued when struggling American writer Henry Miller shows up. She is even more intrigued when she meets Henry's wife June. Suffice to say Anais doesn't spend much time thinking about her husband after these two show up. Which for you the viewer means...more sex. Heaven forbid we let a silly little thing like plot get in the way of all this sex.",/review/rw1273930/?ref_=tt_urv
