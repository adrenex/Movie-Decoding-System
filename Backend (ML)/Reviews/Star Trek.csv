19 January 2018,kckidjoseph-1,8," Piercing the Soft Underbelly of the American Legal System
","In ""Roman J. Israel, Esq.,"" a drama written and directed by Dan Gilroy with Denzel Washington in the title role, the American legal system and the people who must somehow operate within its confines are exposed for what they are: an uneven mix of good and bad, with the tilt toward one or the other dependent as much or more so on the moral compass and grit of the individual as on circumstance, no matter how imposing or seemingly impossible they might be.",/review/rw4085599/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2017,statuskuo,7," The Ghost Of Sidney Lumet Lives!
","For a split second there, you are watching ""Q&A"" or any of the other political dramas Sidney Lumet was famous for. Despite what reviewers have said here, this is mature movie that exists in a different time. And it is tragic that it is lost in the dummies of 2017 society.",/review/rw4085599/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2017,ferguson-6,6," Keep on Truckin'
","Greetings again from the darkness. Denzel Washington is one of our most iconic actors and he's put together a remarkable career, including 8 Oscar nominations and two wins. He's had his Al Pacino SCARFACE comparable with TRAINING DAY, his Robert DeNiro GOODFELLAS comparable with American GANGSTER, and here he gets his Dustin Hoffman RAIN MAN as he plays the titular Roman J. Israel, Esquire. It's a role that lacks Denzel's usual cool factor, but it's one in which he dives head first.",/review/rw4085599/?ref_=tt_urv

",This is a BRILLIANT journey from the perspective of someone utterly detached from any personal connection to those around him.,/review/rw4085599/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2018,Top_Dawg_Critic,7," Interesting story, told poorly but acted by Denzel brilliantly.
","This film was Dan Gilroy's second directorial debut, and although his forte of experience is writing, he failed that department, and did better in his directing (camera work, but not his choice of editing).",/review/rw4085599/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2019,OneAnjel,8," character study that punishes the doubter
","I initially wanted to condemn the film as reverse racist after the flag pin remark but I decided to give it a bit more time and ended up watching it to the end. Some say they were disappointed at a slow plodding film that misused the talented Denzel and slapped them with a crappy ending. We were not watching the same film.
Here Denzel portrays a man with every possible thing against him: he's a black man with a presumed Muslim last name, who has an almost autistic nature because of his savant abilities which has repressed his ability to be financially successful because he has no real interest in money and prefers to pursue truth instead. Once scene depicts him well when he appears to be rambling and then slaps us with the conclusion bringing it all together: there is no way to retain purity. Bam. We are hit with Roman's plight.",/review/rw4085599/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2018,imseeg,7," No drama. No fun. No action. No suspense. Still it is very intelligent and fascinating.
","What we have here is a portrait of an idealistic lawyer with autism, played by Denzel Washington. The lawyer loses his sheltered job and is now forced to take care of himself despite his huge autism handicap. Will he survive or will he break down?",/review/rw4085599/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2017,bramaniblue,10," Be true to thine Self
","I found this to be some of the best work Denzel has done. I thought he hit the nail on the head in terms of helping his viewers feel empathy for the character. I have to be honest here. I strongly believe that if you are in your sixties and of African-American heritage this may really hit home on many levels. In general it is a film about holding on to our core values, then forgetting them to join the rest of societal madness only to realize that you were not alone in your view of the world. Restoring your original core only to pay the price of deserting it in the first place. Everyday we see people forfeit family,love and life for materialistic gains and other power trips. This is also about the change of values from one generation to another in today's world. This is a film with a message that has and will go over a lot of heads judging by some of the bad reviews I've read. Awesome sound track consisting of 60's and 70's soul and rock. Excellent character portrayals by all bar none.",/review/rw4085599/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2018,SnoopyStyle,6," one bad turn
","Roman J. Israel, Esq. (Denzel Washington) is socially awkward and an idealistic legal savant. He works behind the scene while his well-known work partner William Jackson excels in the courtroom. When William falls into a coma, the two-man practice falls into hands of George Pierce (Colin Farrell). George is a capitalist lawyer more concerned about the money than anything else. Roman tries to find another job but non-profit organizer Maya Alston only has volunteer positions although she very much admires the old school social justice warrior. He grows tired of the struggle against the world and decides to indulge in the corruption.",/review/rw4085599/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2017,fletcherc21,6," A Character Study, but Not Much Else
","Denzel Washington stars as Roman J. Israel, Esq. a mildly savant criminal defense attorney whose life is turned upside down when his longtime law partner passes away. Suddenly the passionate civil rights attorney who thanks to his fiery demeanor should stay far away from an actual courtroom, is left looking for a job. He is forced to settle for working for George Pierce (Colin Farrell) a successful defense attorney, whom Roman views as a profiteer who doesn't care about his clients. The entire ordeal breaks Roman, who sells out his ideals and loses sight of who he was.",/review/rw4085599/?ref_=tt_urv

29 November 2017,kisssara,10," Extraordinary Film
","Probably the best film I have seen this year...and most definitely, Denzel Washington's performance, among the greatest I have ever seen. With this film, he is our most gifted American actor today. Last year at the Golden Globes his mannerism were so idiosyncratic...he must have been still deep inside of this character...most likely, still filming Roman. This film affected me greatly. I am so moved by this character's eccentricity, wit, grace and soul. Brilliant writing and direction. I want to see this picture again.",/review/rw4085599/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2018,Prismark10,4," Breaking the code
","Roman J Israel, Esq has a tour de force performance from Denzel Washington. He was Oscar nominated in playing an idealistic social rights lawyer who is great in doing the background stuff but terrible in dealing with people, advocating at court and doing things like plea bargaining. In fact Roman might have a great brain, almost a savant but his people skills in a modern world holds him back.",/review/rw4085599/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2017,planktonrules,6," Surprisingly flat.
","Back in 2014, Dan Gilroy made his first full-length film, NIGHTCRAWLER. For a freshman effort, it's truly amazing as it was one of the best films of the year and was a deeply disturbing but rewarding film to watch. Because of this, I was excited to see a preview showing of ""Roman J. Israel Esquire"" as the Philadelphia Film Festival. Plus, many were excited because Gilroy managed to get the services of Denzell Washington to star in this film. Sadly, the film was a bit of a disappointment.",/review/rw4085599/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2017,rgkarim,6," To See, or Not To see.... That is the Question.
","The legendary Denzel Washington is associated with so many legendary roles that will forever live in the hearts of millions. And like many people, when I see he a movie of his about to release, I get excited I'm in store for another masterpiece. Enter Roman J. Israel Esq, a movie that from the trailers, held potential to be an interesting biography of a powerful legal, pro- action character that was certain to stir up trouble. Will it be powerfully emotional to fill your eyes to the brim with tears, or something else? Robbie K here to give you some insight into yet another movie this holiday season, let's get started.

25 February 2018,gradyharp,10," 'The real enemies aren't the ones on the outside, they're on the inside.'
",California writer/director Dan Gilroy addresses more contemporary hot coal issues in this fine film and makes us sit up and pay attention - even if the direction of the film is a bit haphazard. The film remains very powerful primarily due to the soaring performance by Denzel Washington as an idealistic defense attorney whose philosophy includes human rights and extends beyond that to themes of morality and the flaws of our current legal system. ,/review/rw4085599/?ref_=tt_urv

23 May 2018,justin-fencsak,6," The trailers don't do justice to this film
","This film is so underrated. Denzel Washington plays the main character of the movie, a criminal defense lawyer. When the film premiered, some footage was cut for timing reasons, which can be seen on the dvd. It didn't do well at the box office due to minimal promotion yet it's finding new life on home media.

31 December 2022,ElMaruecan82,7," In a time of systemic prejudice, the problem isn't the prejudice but the system...
","You can already tell from a title where the story will take you. If it's the name of a character like Dan Gilroy's ""Roman J. Israel, Esq"" you might be in the safe side if you anticipate a character study. The eponymous protagonist, played by Denzel Washington, is a lawyer as the Esq. (abbreviation for Esquire) indicates. With his Don King-like hairdo, he looks like a man who stuck in the early 70s, a time that meant business in terms of political activism. In a way, he's an anachronistic individual but his ideals are still relevant in a prejudiced time where law procedures advocate plea bargaining for African-American defendants, because a trial wouldn't benefit them.",/review/rw4085599/?ref_=tt_urv

21 October 2020,nicholls_les,3," Messy and made no sense
","I watched this all the way through, hoping that at some point it would all make sense! It didn't! Although, Denzel was his usual good self, as with Tom Hanks, I have never seen him act badly, even in a bad movie.
But, the main character starts off as appearing autistic, possibly a Savant, and then becomes a completely different person towards the end. The decisions made were strange and the story was very disjointed. Not one I would watch again for sure.",/review/rw4085599/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2017,george.schmidt,9," An implosive FALLING DOWN; Washington is rock solid in this uncompromising character study.
","ROMAN J. ISRAEL, ESQ. (2017) *** 1/2 Denzel Washington, Colin Farrell, Carmen Ejogo, Amanda Warren, Tony Plana. Washington is rock-solid as behind-the-scenes partner of a law firm who is suddenly thrust from his complacent employment when he loses his job as a reliable, savant-like parable of virtue and a relic of the '70s as a civil rights advocate and public speaker, stymied by the 21st century no thanks to the unlikely set-up with slick attorney Farrell while also trying to change his own life in the process. Written and directed by Dan Gilroy with aplomb and skill in this somewhat implosive 'Falling Down'. Washington completely chamelonizes himself with Israel's bad 'fro, schlumpy walk and questionable fashion yet embibes him with the skills of being right among the wrong even as it threatens all he has stood for. Uncompromising.",/review/rw4085599/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2020,MadamWarden,1," Please shoot me for watching this swill!
","This is a movie about a disaster of a person and an even worse lawyer. He literally can't do anything right. He gets his young client killed because of his incompetence and foibles. He refuses to compromise on anything and yet doesn't appear to do anything of value throughout the entire film. He has an amazing memory, a Savant and a mysterious history where he was supposedly greatly successful. But he is corrupt and weak. An awful human being. Miraculously, after he should be fired and disbarred, the slick law firm rewards him after the mother of the son he got killed forgives him. She earlier warned him him sternly not to mess up. I guess getting her son killed was cool.",/review/rw4085599/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2018,Michaelmarvin79,10," DO NOT LISTEN TO THE BAD REVIEWS!!!
","This is an amazing movie with 2 of the best actors on the planet! Sometimes you must have a little bit of smarts to understand the movie ... Just because a good movie like this doesn't have explosions, and gunfire does not make it a bad movie!!! Anybody who has been involved or worked in the legal field will love this movie. Also it has a message that...yes on paper we have rights, but when judges, prosecutors, police, some lawyers abuse their power and go against what this country was founded on! 100s of thousands of inmates arcross our country are falsely accused and wrongly convicted... our forefathers built our court/ justice system to have certain procedural rules and laws to prevent those things from happeng... so anytime you get a chance to learn about our country and let DENZEL explain it to you with the magic of film..... I'll take it everytime! Watch the movie it's awesome!",/review/rw4085599/?ref_=tt_urv

","Being on a roll watching and reviewing as many 2017-2018 films as possible, especially those that garnered award nominations and wins, 'Roman J. Israel, Esq.' was another film on my to see list as part of those quests. Part of me was intrigued in seeing it, liking Denzel Washington as an actor, but the trailer/advertising didn't grab me and some of the lukewarm/mixed reviews made me slightly apprehensive.
