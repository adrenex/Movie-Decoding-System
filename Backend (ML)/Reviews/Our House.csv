3 November 2006,jluis1984,8," An underrated jewel
","After the box-office failure of ""Memoirs of an Invisible Man"" in 1992 forced him to work in TV (with the movie ""Body Bags""), director John Carpenter returned to his roots in the horror genre and began working in what would be his return to the big screen with the 1995 horror film, ""In the Mouth of Madness"", a movie that would become the third and final part of his Apocalypse Trilogy (an unrelated series of horror films started with ""The Thing"" and followed by ""Prince of Darkness""). Together with writer Michael De Luca, Carpenter crafted a film that pays honest tribute to the genre's original root: the written word.",/review/rw8535403/?ref_=tt_urv

4 May 2020,azathothpwiggins,," The Town At The End Of The World...
","The stories of H.P. Lovecraft can be summarized in a simple equation: Mankind + Ancient, Inescapable Horrors = Utter Doom. With IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS, Director
John Carpenter uses the dread-filled atmospherics of Lovecraft, in order to pay homage to the writer.",/review/rw8535403/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2001,BaronBl00d,," In the Mind of John Carpenter
","What a treat of a film this was.  It is witty, intelligent, and scary.  The basic plot premise is anything but basic as the line between reality and fantasy is almost indistinguishable through most of the film.  What is going on?  Who really knows...I'm not sure even director John Carpenter knows. But what we do get is a guessing game of what is real and un-real in a very stylish, sophisticated, almost bizarre fashion.  The film opens in a mental asylum with protagonist Sam Neill being put in a padded cell whilst in a straight-jacket.  The setting is larger than life.  The characters around Neill are caricatures for the most part.  John Glover plays a doctor(Doctor Saperstein...a possible homage to Rosemary's Baby) with complete camp. David Warner, another doctor, begins talking to Neill and asking him about what happened.  The rest of the film then details what Neill did working with regards to a lost author named Sutter Cane.  The plot is much more complicated than that and may take subsequent viewings to fully understand WHAT can be understood.  The end result is at the very least a very gratifying one as Carpenter constructs a dream-like story that has obvious roots in both the fiction of H. P. Lovecraft and Stephen King.  The acting is good all around...Neill is excellent as John Trent.  He makes a very believable presence in a sea of un-reality.  Julie Carmen is also very good in her role.  Look for Charlton Heston as a publisher and Bernie Casey in a cameo as well.  Kudos to Mr. Carpenter for bringing his visions of horror to the silver screen once again.  This may be his best film...certainly his most thought-provoking and sophisticated.",/review/rw8535403/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2005,willywants,8," An unexpected treat
","Insurance claims expert John Trent (Sam Neill) Goes off on a search for missing horror author Sutter Cane (Jürgen Prochnow), convinced his disappearance is a hoax. Once Trent goes looking for the missing author, he's lead to Hobb's End, a supposedly fictional New England town, to discover that something very wrong is going onand Sutter Cane is responsible. ""In the Mouth of Madness"" came as a delightful surprise to me.",/review/rw8535403/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2013,jcbutthead86,10," A Scary And Frightening Film And One Of The Best Horror Films Of The 90s. Another Carpenter Classic.
","In The Mouth Of Madness is a scary and terrifying film and one of the best Horror films of the 90s. Filled with great direction,wonderful performances and great special effects In The Mouth Of Madness is John Carpenter at his best.",/review/rw8535403/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2018,BandSAboutMovies,10," Have you watched Sutter Cane?
","After The Thing and Prince of Darkness, this is the third and final part of John Carpenter's Apocalypse Trilogy. It's a film that plays with the very notion of reality, how fictional characters perceive themselves within a narrative and issues of creation itself. It's a natural next step after Prince of Darkness, playing with many of the same themes.",/review/rw8535403/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2007,Quinoa1984,9," Carpenter at his most surreal, most sickening, and, in his own devilish way, most self-deprecating
","I think In the Mouth of Madness falls into that column of John Carpenter films that fans of his will either like a lot or wont, and I could understand the points made for the latter. It is a little hard to get into, at first, as being a very strong film based on the sharply timed shocks and paranoia of Carpenter's horror as a director as well as the ideas presented by the writer, and it does veer into going into the same wild level of deliriousness that soon enough becomes the lead character. But it's a work as well where Carpenter is testing himself, and succeeding in a carefree but controlled way, where he goes for having his cake and eating it too. He gets to throw up on the screen some grisly (and, as a possible tip of the hat to the groundbreaking effects from the Thing, a sometimes funny knock-off) special creature effects and with some masterful displays in editing through the images of abstractions into the character's subconscious, while questioning what he's doing all the time, or at least the genre he and others (notably Stephen King) make their bread and butter.",/review/rw8535403/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2000,CuriosityKilledShawn,10," Black Magickal
",This review contains some slight spoilers. Many people say that John Carpenter does either GREAT or VERY BAD films. I think his only two duds were Escape from LA and Village of the Damned. But he is one of my two fave directors (David Lynch is the other) and this is one of his best movies.,/review/rw8535403/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2012,hellraiser7,10," The Doomsday Book
",The bizarre thing sometimes about writing and reading fictional books are they are always about heightened or different realities. Each of the characters that are written and involved in the action depending on how their written feel like regular people despite whatever role their suppose to play. In a way these things are practically creating a certain existence and when we read or write these stories we suspend our disbelief because depending on how much we enjoy the story we want to almost believe it's real.,/review/rw8535403/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2007,claudio_carvalho,7," Changing the Reality
","The efficient and skeptical freelance insurance investigator John Trent (Sam Neill) is hired by the publisher Jackson Harglow (Charlton Heston) to find where the famous writer Sutter Cane (Jürgen Prochnow) might be. After writing a series of best-sellers in the horror genre, affecting the reason and causing disorientation, memory loss and paranoia in the readers, Sutter has simply vanished near the release of his new novel, ""Horror in Hobb's End"". There is a mass hysteria of his anxious fans waiting for the new release, and John believes that his disappearance is a strategy of marketing. John follows his instincts and travels with Cane's editor, Linda Styles (Julie Carmen), to New Hampshire seeking for the apparently fictional town of Hobb's End. While driving along the night, Linda reaches the Hobb's End, and John discloses that Sutter Cane has unleashed a powerful evil force in the black church of the mysterious town, and his twisted imagination is changing the reality and perception of those that read his novels.",/review/rw8535403/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2012,DustinRahksi,7," One of Carpenters best.
","This film is by far one of the best horror movies I've watched in a couple of months, and I watched a lot. This film succeeds in suspense and thrills, I actually jumped a couple of times. The plot was really good, there was an in-pending sense of doom.",/review/rw8535403/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2005,MovieManiacX,10," One Of Carpenter's Best!
","I gotta say that when I first saw this movie, it blew me away. It's not as good as The Thing, but it's a great horror movie. It has everything that makes John Carpenter the master of horror. He is one man that can still scare the crap out of me.",/review/rw8535403/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2017,MonsterVision99,6," A great start that leads into a more mediocre movie.
","I have been somewhat disappointed by Carpenter this year, ""The Fog"" was pretty good, a bit flawed, but still highly enjoyable. ""Prince of Darkness"" had some mediocre and dull parts, but had some great concepts, a good atmosphere and some good effects. ""In the Mouth of Madness"" has some of the same problems ""Prince of Darkness"" had, and much like ""Prince of Darkness"", it has many good elements that save it from being completely mediocre and elevates it.",/review/rw8535403/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2006,ODDBear,8," 2/3 brilliant, final third not so brilliant
",It's hard to go deeply into the story of In the Mouth of Madness without spoiling it. It's best to know absolutely nothing at all. That was my experience with this film and I was completely blown away. The story is very original and inventive and also has a good critique about the influences of the horror franchise.,/review/rw8535403/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2015,siderite,8," Carpenter does Lovecraft!
","Carpenter is a genius of horror movies. They are not just mindless boo scares and gory torture porn, they have a story, they draw you in, they make you part of it. That is why In the Mouth of Madness is ironic, since it is about people getting drawn in someone else's story.",/review/rw8535403/?ref_=tt_urv

2 January 2020,I_Ailurophile,10," An absolute masterpiece of horror
","Let's be clear: There are many types of horror. Some horror movies want to be ultraviolent gorefests. Others are all about jump scares. Still others care little for getting visceral reactions from the audience & opt for simply telling a story with unnatural, supernatural, or paranormal elements.",/review/rw8535403/?ref_=tt_urv

12 February 2001,zmaturin,," John Carpenter delivers again.
","""In The Mouth of Madness"" is one of John Carpenter's better flicks. It features the usually bland Sam Neill in a surprisingly good and likable performance, and is packed with oodles of intriguing concepts and spiffy details. The music is good (it was cowritten by Carpenter) and the movie has a great look. There are also lots and lots of ginchy make-up effects, and while some are better than others (the kid who turns into an old man looks like a kid wearing a Spencer's Gifts Old Man mask and fright wig), but the sheer abundance of them make this unique.",/review/rw8535403/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2009,joshi_3592,10," Pure genius! Freakiest thing I've ever seen, but still made me laugh somehow.
","I don't want to spoil anything so i'll keep this short. It's about an insurance investigator (Sam Neill) who seeks out to find a famous horror writer after his books seems to have a very odd effect on his readers, only to actually find the village in his novels. Suddenly it seems like his books are coming true. Now I'll stop there and leave the rest for you to see. This movie is both a tribute to the genre (and maybe a slight parody) and literally an existentialism story(you know what I mean when you finish the movie). This movie is scary, horrifying, intelligent, well written, well acted, and also somehow a bit funny. (Warning, this is not for the light hearted, freakiest thing I've ever seen, but still made me laugh somehow)",/review/rw8535403/?ref_=tt_urv

24 March 2014,Hey_Sweden,8," Reality isn't what it used to be.
","Veteran filmmaker John Carpenter gets a lot of flak for the admittedly spotty latter half of his career, but can still take pride in this stylish bit of mind-bending, nightmarish insanity. It does lose a little something once the mystery elements are de-emphasized and the lunatic imagery takes over, but there is something here for a variety of horror fans, those who crave imaginative effects work and those who simply enjoy the idea of imagination run amok, as characters end up in a place where fantasy and reality are no longer distinguishable from each other. It also utilizes a doomsday theme, and is the final film in what the director calls his ""Apocalypse Trilogy"" (after ""The Thing"" and ""Prince of Darkness""). The visual effects are simply spectacular, with the renowned KNB group obviously having a ball coming up with assorted gore and creature gags.",/review/rw8535403/?ref_=tt_urv

11 September 2022,ladymidath,10," One Of The Best Lovecraftian Horrors
","I have watched John Carpenter's Apocalypse Trilogy comprising of. The Thing, Prince Of Darkness, and In The Mouth Of Madness. They are all excellent. In The Mouth Of Madness really does pay homage to HP Lovecraft with horrifying imagery and an incredibly intense story. The special effects are great and all the cast, especially Sam Neil is wonderful. I always love actors like Charlton Heston,Jürgen Prochnow, and the late David Warner and they all do an excellent job here. Julie Carmen is wonderful as well and her intensity really adds to the scenes she's in. You don't have to watch the entire trilogy, although you would be missing some great films if you don't, this can be seen on its own and as its own thing.",/review/rw8535403/?ref_=tt_urv
