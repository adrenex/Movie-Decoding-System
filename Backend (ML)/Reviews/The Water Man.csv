","titular four and half decades and we meet them less than a week before a party to celebrate this special anniversary. That morning, Geoff receives a letter in German which over the next few days provokes a profound re-evaluation of their marriage. Although based on a short story of only 12 pages by David Constantine, the cinematic translation has all sorts of subtle changes, notably adopting the female rather than the male viewpoint.",/review/rw3342999/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2015,ilpohirvonen,7," The Sudden Emergence of the Past
","Andrew Haigh's latest film ""45 Years"" (2015) is one of the big film events of this year and not least because of the memorable performances of its two leading actors, Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay. It's a very simple film, granted, but exceptionally good as such. Both performers do an excellent job. Haigh's narrative is character-driven and never self-aware. All seems to be subjected to what is going on inside these characters. The film has been shot in the beautiful English countryside whose unreliable and unpredictable weather plays an integral role in the drama of untold memories, hidden emotions, and their appearance. It is a moving film about time and the complex relations between the past and the present. ",/review/rw3342999/?ref_=tt_urv

","William Shakespeare wrote (Sonnet 116), ""Love is not love which alters when it alteration finds, or bends with the remover to remove: O, no! It is an ever-fixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken."" Though Shakespeare would not admit impediments to the marriage of true minds, Kate and Geoff Mercer in Andrew Haigh's (""Weekend"") 45 Years find that their marriage may be on shakier grounds than they thought when a letter arrives in the mail that causes them to question the truth of their lifelong connection. Winners of the Silver Berlin Bear at the 2015 Berlinale, Charlotte Rampling (""The Forbidden Room,"") and Tom Courtenay, (""Night Train to Lisbon"") deliver remarkably enduring performances as the childless couple looking forward to the celebration of their 45th wedding anniversary until it is upstaged by an unwanted reminder of the past.",/review/rw3342999/?ref_=tt_urv

13 May 2017,Imdbidia,8," You never get to know anyone
","45 Years is a almost a theatrical film, with not many characters and a slow-burning, subtle but powerful exploration of couple dynamics, the nature of love and trust, the weight of the past on the present, and who truly are those people with whom we share our lives. There is also a pointy finger to the social fa√ßade that many couples show to the world, which is not always as rosy or perfect when they are behind closed doors.",/review/rw3342999/?ref_=tt_urv

22 December 2015,ferguson-6,8," My Love has Gone Away
","Greetings again from the darkness. Relationships are messy and complicated. Even the best ones. Even those that last 45 years. Writer/director Andrew Haigh (Weekend, 2011) understands this and delivers a film not about older people, but instead about the secrets, the doubts and the regrets experienced by anyone and everyone who is part of a committed relationship. His message is delivered through the extraordinary performances of Tom Courteney and especially Charlotte Rampling.",/review/rw3342999/?ref_=tt_urv

9 December 2019,monimm18,9," Brilliant and poignant
","At first I thought this movie was a bit slow or contemplative. No such thing, actually. Every moment has its own precise purpose, depicting and, at the same time, uncovering the truth about the 45 year long marriage of Kate and Geoff. The film starts with the couple, or rather just Kate, planning their 45 year wedding anniversary. Geoff seems a bit of an aloof guy, disinterested and irritated about everything and everyone, but Kate has the quiet loving patience of a woman who learned to see the good man underneath the grumpy appearance. Geoff perks up significantly when he receives news of the recovery of the body of his former girlfriend, Katya, who died in a tragic accident in Switzerland before Geoff ever met his wife. The news seems to agitate him to the point of arousing Kate's suspicions. As the film progresses Kate's fearful investigations reveal that Katya was also pregnant with Geoff's child when she died, and she begins to understand how much Geoff loved her. We realize that he told her very little about Katya, hiding from her how important Katya was to him and how completely shattered he was by her death. But most of all, that he selfishly spent 45 years married to a woman he took for granted and didn't allow himself to truly love or even enjoy life because he was emotionally stuck in his past tragic experience that he subconsciously grieved about for the rest of his life. In a poignant moment, Kate tells him what she learned and how hurt and confused she was about being married to a man who, she feared, might have been dishonest and not loved her as much as she thought. Her words seem to have a catalytic effect on Geoff, who maybe realizes he has had 45 years with a wonderful woman that deserved much more. As if truly seeing her for the first time he offers her heartfelt reassuring words and from that moment he behaves cheerfully and attentively towards her, including holding a speech filled with loving gratitude at their anniversary party. Kate seems willing to believe him, until the coup de grace - the dance. While planning the anniversary party Kate chose ""Smoke Gets In Your Eyes"", as the opening dance song, because it was what Geoff chose as their wedding song 45 years ago. As the couple danced, we hear the lyrics and we see Kate paying attention to them too, as if for the first time. They're the words of someone grieving for their lost love, and in the context of what she learned about Katya, Kate finally faces the cruel and irreparable truth: her husband's choice for their wedding song was about his grieving for another woman, and the 45 years of her marriage were spent with a man who longed for someone else.",/review/rw3342999/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2015,Turfseer,2," Critics flummoxed by lugubrious tale of aging couple beset by negligible crisis
","With nary a critical word to be found amongst the fawners in the film critics' pantheon, 45 Years has gone on to receive a surfeit of undeserved approbation in such places as Metacritic, with an unbelievable ""metascore"" of 94. My first reaction to this onslaught of film critic stupidity was simply to ask, ""How can this be?""",/review/rw3342999/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2018,lee_eisenberg,10," How well do we know anyone?
","I always expect a stellar performance from Charlotte Rampling, and ""45 Years"" doesn't disappoint. Like Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"", it reminds us that we can't fully know anyone. In this case, her character's husband (Tom Courtenay) learns that the body of a woman with whom he was once in a relationship has been found in a melting glacier in the Alps, and it starts to dominate his life, threatening the couple's relationship.",/review/rw3342999/?ref_=tt_urv

","After his breakthrough indie drama WEEKEND (2011), UK director/writer Andrew Haigh has been occupied to produce and direct HBO's high-profile gay series LOOKING, which woefully gets shortchanged after two seasons, with a special TV movie wrapping up the loose ends, coming this year, which is also directed by Haigh. Then, there is 45 YEARS, the official follow-up of WEEKEND, which deservingly wins her first-ever Oscar nomination for the acting legend Charlotte Rampling, although, both Rampling and Courtenay have been honoured with a Silver Berlin Bear for their excellence.",/review/rw3342999/?ref_=tt_urv

6 January 2016,Lubezki,9," Beautifully restrained, ultimately heartbreaking
","""45 Years"" is a great demonstration on how to evoke so many layers of emotion and inner turmoil with a fairly simple filmmaking approach. These types of stories have been told lots of times and probably a bit better (Mike Leigh promptly comes to mind). But what director Andrew Haigh does here which provides the film it's gut wrenching sensation is that he writes these characters with so much depth and naturalism that the events that slowly unravel begin to make the film more and more despondent as it goes on.

27 September 2015,MOscarbradley,10," The best film of 2015 so far
","I have no doubt that in 70 years from now Andrew Haigh's new film will be as highly thought of as ""Brief Encounter"" is today. ""Brief Encounter"" dealt with a love affair that wasn't and the effect it had on a conventional middle-class marriage. ""45 Years"" is set within similar territory but here the disruptive love affair is, arguably, all the more powerful and its effect all the more devastating. It takes place over six days, Monday to Saturday, and begins when husband Geoff receives a letter in German informing him that the body of the girl he loved 50 years before, and who died in an accident in the Swiss mountains, had been found, presumably preserved in ice just as she was the day he lost her, and ends up at the party held to celebrate Geoff's 45 year marriage to Kate.",/review/rw3342999/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2016,paul-allaer,8," Towering performances from Charlotte Rampling AND Tom Courtenay
","""45 Years"" brings the story of Kate and Geoff, an elder English couple. As the movie opens, we see Kate doing her morning walk with the dog in the countryside of England. When she returns, she brings in the mail, which includes a letter for Geoff. It turns out to be a letter from the Swiss authorities, informing him that they have found the body if his ex-girlfriend Katya after more than 50 years, perfectly preserved in the ice and snow of the Swiss Alps since 1962. This is devastating news for Geoff, and it causes him to reflect and speak out to Kate about Katya. How will this affect the couple's upcoming 45th wedding anniversary party? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.",/review/rw3342999/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2016,StevePulaski,4," So quiet and unmoving, it might as well be a silent film about a public speaker
","Andrew Haigh's ""45 Years"" revolves around Kate and Geoff Mercer (Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay), a retired Norfolk couple looking to celebrate their forty-fifth wedding anniversary at the Assembly House in Norwich. Their plans to have a large gathering for their fortieth anniversary were hindered when Geoff underwent serious heart-bypass surgery, but now the two are planning the best event they never got to have.",/review/rw3342999/?ref_=tt_urv

25 October 2015,JohnnyWeissmuller,8," A Rare Gem of a Movie
","Kate and Geoff live a quite and seemingly normal life in the country until Geoff receives a letter informing him that the body an old girlfriend, whom he travelled through Switzerland with, but was lost in climbing accident, has been found preserved in a glacier of ice. This happened before he met Charlotte Rampling's Kate, who immediately raises her eyebrows at the clarity in which Geoff, played by Tom Courtenay, recalls his time in the Swiss Alps. She's more concerned with arranging the party for her anniversary than digging up the past, but that's what spurs Geoff into life, as he picks up old habits and develops a fascination with his loft. In stark contrast, suspicion and jealously soon begins to grow in Kate, who feels pushed aside in favour of someone she didn't even know. ",/review/rw3342999/?ref_=tt_urv
