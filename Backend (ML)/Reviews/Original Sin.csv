6 May 2007,lastliberal,8," One of my favorite films
",Some movies have a good story that is made great by the casting. This is one such film. It has a cast to die for and makes what could have been an interesting film superb.,/review/rw6598569/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2019,UniqueParticle,10," ""Mirror in the Bathroom""
","Perpetually phenomenal every time I see it! Among one of John Cusack's best roles, I would've loved to have seen this in theaters, and I hope it gets a rerelease via fathom events at some point. This has one of the best soundtracks, an exquisite cast, some badass moments, and some fairly good writing. Really deserves praise and appreciation! I'm always intrigued by this sweet hitman movie whenever I get a chance to see it.",/review/rw6598569/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 1999,SKG-2,10," Consistently surprising and entertaining
","One of the complaints about movies these days, and justifiably so, is that they're predictable.  This movie is not predictable, and I never thought I'd be able to say that about a movie with four credited writers.  Every time you think you can guess where it's going, it throws a curve.  It was also very funny, which is nice because good comedies are becoming a rare species. John Cusack continues to show what a great actor he is as hitman Martin Blank.  He doesn't wink at the audience, saying, Oh look, I'm a hitman, but plays him as normal, with the right amount of misgivings and tenacity. Minnie Driver is quite good as the woman he's still obsessed with (although she was good in GOOD WILL HUNTING, she should have been nominated for this performance), and Alan Arkin and Jeremy Piven were good, as ever, in support.  The surprise, however, is Dan Aykroyd.  Just when I was prepared to write him off forever, he comes through with a great performance here. The soundtrack is terrific too, avoiding the cliched 80's songs to provide a fresh, and compatible, score.",/review/rw6598569/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2019,K3nzit,9," A classic in my book
","Man, I really love this black comedy. It's very well put together, with many great performances and a dialogue that is very well-written. The action is brilliant aswell - you'll definitely see some cool stuff here. The soundtrack consists of many nice tunes from the 80's, that lift the film even higher. Well, you just can't go wrong with this one - A classic in my book.",/review/rw6598569/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2001,jellyneckr,," A '90s classic!
","Although not nearly as popular as it deserves to be, GROSS POINTE BLANK has become an increasingly respected cult flick in the year following its theatrical release and it's not hard to see why. The movie is probably the only film on earth that is able to blend comedy, graphic violence, and romance together perfectly, which is what makes it such a classic. John Cusack is excellent as Martin Q. Blank, a hit-man who attends his ten-year high school reunion. At first he doesn't want to, but decides to go since he has a case there and he wants to see his old girlfriend Debbie (Minnie Driver) again. This dark comedy is heavy on exciting action, suspense, gunfire, laughs, and fun, but it doesn't have not quite enough character development for my taste (a bit more on how Martin became accustomed to killing would have been nice). Still, GROSSE POINTE BLANK was one of the best films of 1997 and one of the better comedies of the 1990s. There were rumors of a sequel happening for a while, though the chances of that happening are slim to none. Too bad.",/review/rw6598569/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2000,Greg Lord,8," Firing Blanks & a little romance
","I love this film! Starring John Cusack, England's patriotically-named Minnie Driver, plus Dan Ackroyd, Alan Arkin & Joan Cusack, Grosse Pointe Blank' is funny, clever, action-packed & has a great eighties soundtrack.",/review/rw6598569/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2007,eastbergholt2002,9," Great Movie
","I love this movie. Grosse Pointe Blank is smart and witty and has a stunning 1980s soundtrack. Martin Blank (Cusack) is an angst ridden international hit-man who has stopped enjoying his work. He searches for meaning in his life and returns to Grosse Pointe, Michigan for his 10th year High School reunion and one last job. Blank meets his mom, some old friends and discovers that his childhood home has been knocked down to make way for a convenience store. He ponders his life choices and has recurring dreams about Debi Newberry (Driver) the girl he stood up on Prom night. ",/review/rw6598569/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2001,bob the moo,," Wonderfully fun comedy
","About the same time as this film was made there was a spate of hitman focused comedy dramas (from Leon to Coldblooded) so this risked being viewed in the same way as these.  This is strictly a comedy - there's no deep soul searching here, the analyst is also in it for comedy value.",/review/rw6598569/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2006,gavin6942,9," Hilariously Light and Fluffy, Yet Dark Comedy
","Sometimes one bad apple ruins the whole thing. One drop of taint makes the best things in life go bad. An this movie was full of potential taint. It could have been Minnie Driver (the weak point of ""Good Will Hunting""). It could have been Dan Ackroyd (whose comedic routines can go from great in ""Ghostbusters"" to stupid in ""Coneheads""). Or maybe it could even have been the fact the writers and director really have no prior experience in making a big film. But the potential taint never happened and this film came out almost flawless.",/review/rw6598569/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2006,DICK STEEL,8," A Nutshell Review: Grosse Pointe Blank (1997)
","I've keeping my run of John Cusack movies with each trip to the library. Not that I'm on the lookout for his old movies deliberately, it just happens. Not that I'm complaining, but he's always been one of the few who play characters so diverse, it's almost impossible to stereotype him. He's fast becoming one of my favorite actors, besides Morgan Freeman, and Denzel Washington, amongst others.",/review/rw6598569/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2007,tieman64,," I killed the president of Paraguay with a fork. How have you been?
","Directed by George Armitage, ""Grosse Pointe Blank"" stars John Cusack as Martin Blank, a neurotic hit-man who has spent the last ten years of his life stuck in an existential rut. As such, Blank spends most his time contemplating the meaning of life, reading magazines titled ""making sense of creation"" and brooding about the perceived pointless of all existence. If life has no worth, Blank muses, then why not profit from killing?",/review/rw6598569/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 1999,Noir-5,8," I'm drawing a complete...
","Good movie. Particularly the part where John Cusack is using the frying pan to put his point across to the bad guy on the kitchen floor. It's hard not to belly laugh. I thought it took cues from 'Blue Velvet', with its uncommon blend of humour and ultra-violence.",/review/rw6598569/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2021,safenoe,9," School reunion nostalgia
","I love Grosse Pointe Blank and its subtext of the high school reunion with everyone benchmarking themselves against each other. The casting is perfect, with John Cusack born to be in this movie.",/review/rw6598569/?ref_=tt_urv

Fantastic sound track to a black comedy.",/review/rw6598569/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2020,imseeg,7," Original mix of romantic comedy and violent gangster shootouts.
","John Cusack (hit man) has got a violent feud with Dan Akroyd (another hit man). In between there is a budding romance with Minnie Driver and when I say "" in between"" I mean literally in between the shootouts and sometimes even DURING the shootouts. Hilarious.

13 February 2011,classicsoncall,7," ""Don't kill anybody for a few days. See what it feels like"".
","No angst driven plot here over one's choice of profession; even when Martin (John Cusack) is seeing his shrink (Alan Arkin), I never got the idea that he was all that overwrought about killing people for a living. The absurdity of the film occurs at the Ultramart shoot-out with a clueless clerk oblivious to the gunfire and smashing merchandise around him while absorbed in his own games of violence. Cleverly done.",/review/rw6598569/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2007,Howlin Wolf,8," Hit men need love, too...
","... but where to find it when even your own therapist is afraid of you? We all have feelings that maybe old friends are quietly judging us when there's a meeting after a long time and we're invited to share what we've accomplished in our lives; so imagine how persistent that sense of awkwardness must be if it turns out that you've become a professional killer. In such a position, is it possible to rectify past mistakes, or will you always be marked out as a loner following a lethal agenda?",/review/rw6598569/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2016,writers_reign,6," Hit And Miss
","On the whole this is an enjoyable romp which contrives to blend nostalgia with violence and romantic comedy in a fairly harmless way. Lead John Cusack who is invariably good value, scores as a hit man accepting the clichéd 'one last job' before retiring to raise alfalfa, being talked into attending a ten-year High School reunion in his home town in which, of course, he hasn't set foot in those same ten years, after walking out on his girl, Minnie Driver, plus everyone he knew. The weak link in the plot is the fact that he fails to open the envelope containing details of his latest 'contract' until virtually the last moment when he discovers - a touch too neatly - that it is, in fact, Driver's father. If you can get past that you'll probably enjoy the movie.",/review/rw6598569/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2020,jaimhaas,10," This is the much better version of KILL BILL not to mention it came FIRST!
",Why does that weirdo Tarantino get so much credit when he rarely puts out anything original? This so much better than the ordinary comedy with a hitman twist. This delivers Cusack is a premium actor and the supporting cast is just as good. Put his one on your list of all-time greats.,/review/rw6598569/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2020,z-gorey,8," Entertaining, well written, great cast.
","Absolutely enjoyable movie with a great 80's soundtrack. Action, romance, comedy. If you're a John Cusack fan this is one for the list. I'm not a fan of Minnie Driver but even she is tolerable in this flick. Basic premise; a hitman goes to his high school reunion.",/review/rw6598569/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 1999,MrsRainbow,9," I bought it for $5
","Great soundtrack, solid cast, and so many offbeat moments make this a great watch. I love the scene where Cusack and Driver meet for the first time in 10 years. Weave back and forth warily, kiss frantically for five seconds, and then withdraw and stare again. It's very hard to pick a best scene but I would choose Cusack talking to Driver's father before they head out to the reunion. Love the dialogue. And I'm not a child of the 80s.",/review/rw6598569/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2007,ccthemovieman-1,1," Public Is Smarter, More Moral Than Film Critics
","When it comes to movies, the public usually will give you a lot better idea about the merits of a film. I can't recall how many times I have seen a ""critics favorite"" be a piece of garbage while another film the critics dismiss was a big hit and a good movie to watch.",/review/rw6598569/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2021,sjanders-86430,10," Great screenplay
",Minnie Driver is a deejay in John Cusack's Grosse Point Blank. She has been waiting 10 years since he deserted her at their high school prom. Dan Ackroyd wants to form an assassin's union. The film starts out with an assassination gone wrong and Cusack opts to go to Detroit for his high school reunion and a last hit. There Dan Ackroyd and others are trying to kill him. The high school dance is very unique for an assassin film. Cusack holds a baby and feeds it. Strange. But soon after there is the most memorable shootout where a house is completely destroyed. This is a memorable film. Joan Cusack plays a wonderful assistant and delivers the best performance. Ann Cusack is also in the film. It was filmed in L.A. Jankiewitz wrote the story. Alan Arkin is great as Blank's psychiatrist.,/review/rw6598569/?ref_=tt_urv
