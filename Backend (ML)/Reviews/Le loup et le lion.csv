25 March 2016,lesleyharris30,7," Consistently Fun,
","Red 2 is a good movie with a reasonably well developed storyline and a terrific cast. It's a lot of fun, simple as that, the whole cast seem to be enjoying themselves and because of that I had a fun time watching it, it's a lot funnier than the original, does not take itself as seriously, much lighter on character development. The story is very simple and straight forward, but a star studded cast that includes Bruce Willis, John Malcovich, Helen Mirren and Anthony Hopkins make this a very enjoyable two hours. I did feel the story was really lacking in depth, it just seems to move along piece by piece, no moment is really significant or gratifying for the audience, it never tried to make this sequel stand out on its own. I did not enjoy the love issues which erupt between Frank and Sarah as a result of Catherine Zeta-Jones' character, it all felt very forced and created an annoying persona for Mary Louise Parker, making her nowhere near as cool as or likable as she was in the original, she was a strong character then, here she is simply a love interest. It certainly has its flaws but Red 2 mostly makes up for it with its pure fun and optimistic cast, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or comedy. ",/review/rw3100016/?ref_=tt_urv

","The retired CIA agent Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) is in love with Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker) and enjoying their normal life in two. Out of the blue, Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich) meets Frank in the supermarket and tells that the Wikileaks has released the information that they had participated and know the whereabouts of the Nightshade, a portable nuclear weapon that was smuggled in pieces and hidden in Russia. Now the top agents on the world are under contract to seek them out to know where Nightshade is. ",/review/rw3100016/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2015,jackmeat,7," Enjoyable action flick taking the good from the first
","My quick rating - 7,1/10. The over the hill spies are at it again. The first movie was thoroughly enjoyable and I have to say this sequel is on par with the first. Quality action scenes edited together very well to keep the motion going without getting lost. Actors put in enough character to drive the spy-game storyline through enough to make you care about it and not just sit back and watch guns blaze. Anthony Hopkins character was exceptionally well done and was a needed jolt into the flick for sure. It is a rare occasion that you can say the sequel may have been better then the first but.....",/review/rw3100016/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2013,gradyharp,10," 'Its important to enjoy life while you still can!'
","RED 2 equals or even surpasses RED! This is a movie for people who enjoy sitting back and being entertained by fancy camera work, a story that has a plausible plot, smart dialog (Jon and Erich Hoeber), astute direction (Dean Parisot), and most of all a cast of some of cinema's finest actors who look like they are having such a great time you don't want the at times rather silly movie to end.",/review/rw3100016/?ref_=tt_urv

","Red 2, a sequel to the popular Red, has Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, Mary Louise Parker, and John Malkovich back in the saddle, with Willis, Mirren, and Malkovich again dragged into their old jobs.

4 April 2014,vipcorp-954-708527,6," Entertaining
","Red 2, like the original Red, is not meant to be taken seriously. In many of my other reviews I come down hard for ridiculous plot lines and lack of believability, but this flick was never intended to be taken seriously on any level. It is a comical take on action/spy movies and so it matters not what liberties are taken.",/review/rw3100016/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2017,Tweekums,8," Silly but lots of fun
","This sequel sees retired agents Frank Moses and Marvin Boggs in trouble again when an article on Wikileaks mentions them in connection to a Cold War mission known as 'Operation Nightshade'. Shortly after Marvin warns Frank he is apparently killed and Frank is captured and is threatened by Jack Horton who says he will torture his girlfriend, Sarah, if he doesn't say what he knows about Nightshade. Before long he is rescued by the not so dead Marvin and the two of them, along with Sarah, head off to find out the truth behind Nightshade. It won't be easy though; the CIA have hired contract killer Han Cho-Bai to hunt them down and MI6 has asked their old friend Victoria to hunt them down. The story will take them to Paris, London and Moscow and will involve finding a long hidden nuclear weapon. The protagonists will find themselves working with some unlikely allies and one of the people they trust prove to be the most dangerous.",/review/rw3100016/?ref_=tt_urv

30 November 2014,classicsoncall,10," ""Two shots, here, and here. Drag the body in there and repeat as necessary.""
","The first thing I was looking for here was to see if they found a way to bring Morgan Freeman back to life from the first film. Instead, John Malkovich is killed off and resurrected, then teamed up with Bruce Willis, Mary-Louise Parker, Helen Mirren and a new cast of characters to bring adventure, romance and danger to this unpredictable assassins flick. I have to admit, I get a kick out of this kind of mindless fun when the writing is creative and the dialog complements the action with wit, sarcasm and self deprecating humor. The set up is perfect with Marvin Boggs (Malkovich) enticing Frank Moses (Willis) back into the espionage game by reminding him that he hasn't killed anybody in months. From there, it's pretty much non-stop nonsense in the way of chases, explosions and martial mayhem until the hero team saves the world from Red Mercury and restores the world's balance of power back to normal. I wouldn't normally rate an action flick this high, but RED 2 distinguishes itself for it's sheer audacity in attempting to make the unbelievably absurd look like just another day.",/review/rw3100016/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2013,rlsmithcarter,6," Will definitely see again!
","If you liked the first RED, and understood what it was and what is wasn't, you should be completely entertained by RED 2. We were lucky enough to see an advanced showing before the naysayers started spreading their naying and we walked out of the theater last night laughing, quoting, and discussing the movie - always a good sign! This is not a movie that needs to be over-analyzed... as my husband said, ""It was exactly what I was hoping it would be."" which is, more interesting characters played by top notch well-known actors getting into all kinds of far-out situations. Great lite summer fare and we will definitely be re-watching this one again when it hits the premium cable channels (just like we have with RED).",/review/rw3100016/?ref_=tt_urv

14 October 2013,Uriah43,5," Failed to Live Up to the Hype and Level of the First Movie
","""Frank"" (Bruce Willis) and ""Sarah"" (Mary-Louise Parker) are just trying to lead ordinary lives when ""Marvin"" (John Malkovich) appears out of nowhere and is subsequently killed right in front of them. After the funeral Frank is arrested and taken to a facility to be interrogated about a top-secret project he supposedly had knowledge of in his former capacity as a CIA agent. Unfortunately, while being interrogated, a group of trained assassins break in with the intent to kill him. He manages to escape and this results in a race by certain governments to either kill him to contain the information or to capture him in order to acquire the information. Now, although this film wasn't necessarily bad, I personally believe that it failed to live up to the hype and the level of the first movie. For starters, there were too many characters thrown in with not enough film to go around for all of them. That said, I liked the addition of both Catherine Zeta-Jones (as ""Katja"") and Anthony Hopkins (""Dr. Bailey Evans""). But Byung-hun Lee (as ""Han Cho Bai"") wasn't needed and his performance was too clich√©d and unpolished. Likewise, the reintroduction of ""Victoria"" (Helen Mirren) and ""Ivan"" (Brian Cox) was too obvious and clumsy. Further, the main characters who made the last film a success weren't given the material that played up to their strengths. For example, Frank wasn't the baddest character on the block-Han Cho Bai was--and it diminished Frank's status somewhat. Likewise, Marvin wasn't nearly as crazy or funny and Sarah seemed to lose the two things that made her special in the first film-- her innocence and vulnerability. So essentially what we had was a collection of characters thrown against the wall to see which ones would stick. And some things just didn't seem to work. In short, it wasn't as good as the first movie. I rate this movie as average.",/review/rw3100016/?ref_=tt_urv

12 November 2013,A_Different_Drummer,4," Another Sequel ... That Really Isn't...
","Some assumptions. You saw RED. You liked RED. Combine the first fact and the second fact and we end up with a third assumption. You are checking out RED2 because you are expecting something akin to RED1. Foolish viewer. You have fallen into the most common trap that viewers are snared by these days. You have assumed that Hollywood works in a logical manner and sequels are extensions of what went before. Wrong. Hollywood, historians of the future will note, is a giant cash flow machine run by individuals so wealthy that, more often that not, they will tinker and toy with the workings of the machine just to make themselves feel more important than they actually are. This deep dark secret is the key to why so many sequels bare so little resemblance to the films that started the franchise. (Another analogy would be a xerox of a xerox of a xerox. By the time you get to the 3rd xerox usually made in some obscure place like Canada for 1/3 the budget of the original -- and it shows -- any similarity to the original is merely coincidental.) Which brings us to Red2. Red1 was a clever action film, built on a great premise, that worked especially well because of our familiarity with talent. Familiar talent. Old friend talent. Talent that releases happy juice -- serotonin -- in the brain when we watch. Red2, aside from being overlong, inconsistent, and based on the wacky ensemble comedies of the 60s, along the lines of ITS A MAD MAD MAD WORLD -- is a comedy with occasional moments of action. Big difference. The real surprise in the film, and a pleasant one at that, is Mary Louise Parker, the only actor in the project who looks like she is having fun, and the actor who consistently steals scene after scene from much more seasoned names. As she ages, and she ages well, she is developing ""cartoon eyes"" and she uses these time and again in the film to salvage scenes which otherwise would not be funny at all. There are so many things wrong here, I would exceed the IMDb word limit if I listed them all. Here is just a friendly tip to the producers if they ever try anything like this again. When you are casting a Russian agent (Zeta-Jones in Red2) it would be surprisingly useful to find someone that can actually do a Russian accent. Only for the terminally bored or fans of Ms. Parker.",/review/rw3100016/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2014,kosmasp,7," Older but not more relaxed
","Maybe a bit wiser though. We get some new characters in this, a bit of a typecasting takes place, but it does pick up where the first one left off. Did you like the first one? If you remember it and the mix of fun and action, try to imagine this amping it up a bit. Bruce Willis is most charismatic, when he is with his back against the wall, something the movie is very aware of.",/review/rw3100016/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2013,siderite,7," Better done than the first, but less funny

18 July 2013,FCivish,10," MUCH better than some would have you believe
","If you liked the first RED, you will like this second in the series. Trust me on this. It was funny, witty, snappy, lively, sarcastic, engrossing and entertaining. I literally walked out of the movie trying to figure out what stick the critics have up their butts, since it was IN NO WAY inferior to the first film. Period. Now, you could quibble with the first film, if you want, but you could quibble with almost any movie. You could complain about inconsistencies, impossibilities, character schtick, etc. etc. etc. But none of those were significant problems in the first, and none of them are problems in the second.",/review/rw3100016/?ref_=tt_urv

25 December 2015,ssarkca,9," Red was awesome, Red 2 tops it off...
","Both films take the bad-ass top secret hit-man genres off the grid, incorporating a feel for regular folks, in their regular lives, doing regular things, who happen to be top notch hit men, and adding a special flavor of comedy, to a new level. Plot twists galore. You expect one thing to happen in a scene and it doesn't. Adversaries become allies, good guys become bad guys, bad guys become good guys, the plot twists ya to death. Great writing here, and excellent acting, especially from Mary Louise Parker, unbelievably hot for a 51 year old woman lol. I will prolly watch this at least 10 times again. Ya gotta watch them in order from 1 to 2 to catch the humour bits.",/review/rw3100016/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2013,griffolyon12,4," Not Worth Your Time
","Every year there's always a parade of seemingly unnecessary sequels, the thing with Red 2 is that I thought that the first Red had a good enough concept with fun enough characters that it would be a blast to revisit them. Boy, was I wrong. Red 2 is just a boring movie that tries too hard. None of the action is real exciting, none of the jokes ever really work, and all of the actors just seem bored here. While Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren are all back as retired secret agents on the run, the film lacks the wit and charm of its predecessor. Not to mention the fact that the plot makes little to no sense, is bloated with too many underdeveloped characters, and therefore I just don't care. Honestly, this is the first movie in a long time that I seriously thought about leaving the theater after about midway through. The only shining light is Anthony Hopkins as a deranged mad scientist, other than that, Red 2 is a complete misfire.",/review/rw3100016/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2014,lee_eisenberg,7," ready, set, fire
","When I saw the original ""RED"", it was a bit of a shock to see tough guy Bruce Willis and high-brow Helen Mirren co-star. Like its predecessor, ""RED 2"" is not a movie that you can take seriously. It knows exactly what kind of movie it is, and so it goes all out. This time, Bruce Willis and his band of weirdos have to locate a missing nuclear warhead. There's no realism here, just two hours of gunfights. But this movie is basically a joke, so it's OK. The aim is to entertain, and it succeeds 100%. As before, John Malkovich's character is the best one in the movie. Above all, it's fun to watch the gaggle of characters travel all over the place in their task. It would be a fun movie to experience were there not the risk of getting shot to death.",/review/rw3100016/?ref_=tt_urv
