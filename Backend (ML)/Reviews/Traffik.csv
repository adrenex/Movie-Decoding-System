7 May 2015,bob-the-movie-man,9," X-rated for sheep
","Based on Thomas Hardy's classic novel (which I much shamefully admit I have never read), Far From the Madding Crowd tells the tale of Bathsheba Everdene's rags-to-riches rise to become a farm-owner in rural Dorset in the 1870's, the title coming from the fact that Dorset is a long way from the hustle and bustle of London ""200 miles away"" as the opening title incorrectly declares - the longest direct driving route I could find was 155 miles!

","Greetings again from the darkness. If you have read Thomas Hardy's 1874 novel or seen director John Schlesinger's 1967 (and far more energetic) screen adaption starring Julie Christie, or even if you are a High School Literature student with the novel on your summer reading list, you will probably be interested in this more modern-day thinking approach from director Thomas Vinterberg (The Hunt). It's more modern not in look, but rather in the feminist perspective of Bathsheba Everdene (one of my favorite literary character names).",/review/rw3331558/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2016,SnoopyStyle,7," Carey Mulligan classic performance
",Bathsheba Everdene (Carey Mulligan) is an independent Victorian woman. Her neighbor sheep-herder Gabriel Oak (Matthias Schoenaerts) abruptly asks Bathsheba's hand in marriage and she politely declines. His herd falls off a cliff. Her uncle dies leaving his large failing farm to her. She hires Oak as her shepherd/manager. She impetuously plays a Valentine joke on her neighbor William Boldwood (Michael Sheen) and he asks to marry her. She rejects him and embarrasses him. Fanny Robbin (Juno Temple) worked for Bathsheba's uncle but ran away to marry Sergeant Francis Troy (Tom Sturridge). She mistakenly goes to the wrong church leaving Troy heartbroken. Bathsheba falls for the dashing soldier and marries him but soon finds that she has made a mistake.,/review/rw3331558/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2015,Sleepin_Dragon,9," An emotional, sensuous and passionate adaptation
","It is rags to riches for the beautiful young, Bathsheba Everdene. She's inherited her late Uncle's farm, and has gone from a life of manual labour to one of property and wealth. An impulsive, head strong young woman, she attracts a lot of male attention, before and after her wealth. She has a pick of three suitors (most of whom keep wanting to buy her a piano!!) There's William Boldwood, a handsome, charismatic mature man of wealth. There is the rugged Gabriel Oak, a handsome sheep farmer who's gone from a farm owner to an employee of Bathsheba, and finally there is the charismatic young officer Sergeant Francis Troy. She seems unaware of the effect she has on her potential suitors, causing deep passion in all three. She makes her choice and has to live with having a Master.",/review/rw3331558/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2015,shawneofthedead,5," A decent adaptation of a problematic novel, which awkwardly tries to find a feminist angle where there isn't much of one to begin with.
","How do you solve a problem like Bathsheba Everdene? It's a question that has plagued literary enthusiasts since 1874, when Thomas Hardy first introduced her to the world in one of his classic novels, Far From The Madding Crowd. Today, 141 years later, that same question haunts Thomas Vinterberg's sumptuous, smart adaptation - one that tries valiantly, but doesn't wholly succeed, in celebrating the strength of a character that was always somewhat illusory to begin with.",/review/rw3331558/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2016,JamesHitchcock,7," Solid, well-made period drama- but not the definitive version
","This film, by the Danish director Thomas Vinterberg, is the first cinematic adaptation of Thomas Hardy's ""Far from the Madding Crowd"" since John Schlesinger's famous version in 1967. The story is too well- known for me to set out the plot at any length, but it revolves around the adventures of Bathsheba Everdene, a young female landowner in Victorian Dorset, and the three men who love her. These are Gabriel Oak, a humble shepherd, William Boldwood, a neighbouring farmer, and Frank Troy, a sergeant in a cavalry regiment. ",/review/rw3331558/?ref_=tt_urv

7 August 2015,westsideschl,6," Moral Corruption
","More accurately should be titled and presented as ""Femme Fatale"". Adaptation from literature to film allows for alternative interpretation; a differing emphasis on events and motivations; additions and deletions to make it a more contemporary, all this because film does not convey to an audience the same story as text from which it came. They are two different beasts. With that thought it's apparent that Everdene uses people to her own end. She will step on whomever if they are a hindrance to her self (ishness) means, whether Troy, Oak, Boldwood or any others. We see it repeatedly though out the film with her allegiance changing with the tide of fortune. Not to downplay or excuse the dogged pursuit by males, but more so then that they are just a product of their times. ",/review/rw3331558/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2015,troyputland,8," Far from the Madding Crowd
","Far from the Madding Crowd, a well respected novel with an adaptation already to its name, hasn't got much new ground to cover. This 2015 film, starring Carey Mulligan, upholds the book's reputation. Bathsheba (Mulligan) is a headstrong farm owner who meets three possible suiters in a short space of time; Gabriel the farmer, William the nobleman and Frank the soldier. All bear distinctive qualities. All wish Bathsheba to marry them the moment they lay eyes on her. FftMC favours one man over the rest. We're smitten before even given the chance to decide. Mulligan's the charismatic, leading lady, making decisions that come at a price. Schoenaerts, Sturridge and Sheen add flavour to this period drama, their personalities and dialogue capturing what action cannot.",/review/rw3331558/?ref_=tt_urv

",This has always been one of my favourite books & films and I was keen to see what they did with this a second time around. But what I want to say after seeing it was 1/see the first film 2/read the book. One of the most essential points to film was left out altogether in that when Bathsheba sent her 'joke' valentine to Boldwood she wrote the words 'Marry Me' on it. It wasn't the roses-are-red etc that got Boldwood in a twist it was the two words she wrote on the card. We get no sense of the quandary and deliberating over this that went on within Boldwood for some time before he made his move (and his ultimate obsession) in this film as we do in the first.,/review/rw3331558/?ref_=tt_urv

27 May 2015,inkblot11,10," Exceptional and exquisite, go far and near to see it
","Our tale is set in 1870's England, as imagined by the classic author Thomas Hardy's book of the same title. Far from London, in the western countryside, lives a capable shepherd, Gabriel Oak (Matthias Schoenhart) who has managed to save enough to rent his farm and buy his sheep. One fateful day, Oak spies a beautiful maiden, Bathsheba Everdene (Carey Mulligan) on horseback. This maiden, an orphan, has come to stay with her aunt and labor hard in her nearby farm. Smitten almost at once, Gabriel soon proposes to Bathsheba, promising a good life and a ""piano"". Alas, she turns him down, despite his great looks and manner. She declares she is not ready to be any man's property. Soon after, their fortunes are reversed. Gabriel loses his flock tragically, because of an over-zealous sheepdog. After selling everything he owns, he must vacate his house and look for work. Meanwhile, Bathsheba inherits a farm from her uncle and decides to run the place herself. It has a large beautiful house and successful fields. Amazingly, Gabriel comes by, helps put out a fire, and is hired as her shepherd. However, he is keenly aware that, because of his poverty, Bathsheba may never look his way again. There's more. B suddenly gets two more suitors. One is a neighboring, rich, confirmed bachelor, Mr. Boldwood (Michael Sheen), whose heart was broken long ago. That is, until Miss Everdene arrives and impetuously sends him a valentine. Not long after, a redcoat soldier, Frank Troy (Tom Sturridge) meets Bathsheba in the woods and becomes strongly attracted to this independent woman and, alas for Gabriel, visa versa. Who will, if any, our headstrong heroine choose? This film could hardly be more exceptional or exquisite. The cast is superb, starting with Mulligan and Schoenharts, and continuing down to the smallest role. Then, the story is a heart touching masterpiece, as Hardy put down on paper, and this film brings to a wider audience. Add on glorious scenery, beautiful costumes, and a superb direction and the film watching world is enthralled. This reviewer knows it will be the best film she will see all year and, as soon as it is released on DVD, will be first in line. So, movie fans will be well advised to go far and near to garner a cinema seat.",/review/rw3331558/?ref_=tt_urv

","I can only suppose the writers read two random lines from every 20 pages of the book and then, boom! came up with a movie script. I gave 'Far from the Madding Crowd' 4 stars for the great photography and good acting but all that can't save a movie from a poor script that lacks depth and doesn't have time for character development.

3 May 2015,postmortem-books,6," An entertaining 2 hours - but does it beat the 1967 version?
","Although I have given this - it would appear - a miserly 6 out of 10 it is only because I can still recall the Schlesinger 1967 version which, for me, eclipses this version on a number of levels. Carey Mulligan, however, is the high point and she certainly presents a Bathsheba Everdene who any man could easily fall for. Her inherent beauty is perfectly fashioned and she sucks in empathy and admiration every time she appears in a scene. My main problem is with Matthias Schoenaerts who, too frequently, is portrayed rather too much as a lumpen farmhand. I think a professional critic has likened his dialogue with Michael Sheen's William Boldwood as rather like Ralph and Ted's dialogue from ""The Fast Show"" and once you have that image in your head its difficult to watch any of their scenes together. Schoenaerts doesn't even attempt a Dorset accent and on occasion a mittel-European phrasing creeps into the dialogue. A miscasting would be my opinion. Bates in the 1967 version was - and remains - the perfect Gabriel Oak. The story was condensed somewhat and there were some plot lines that weren't sufficiently developed to allow for complete understanding. Tom Sturridge's Sgt.Troy was duly dastardly and the ""sword"" scene was atmospherically achieved but where one could understand a woman falling head over heels for Terence Stamp's Troy it was a little tough to see why this Bathsheba could be so infatuated as to be taken in so completely. Maybe I'm nitpicking and I'd say to anyone who was thinking of seeing this: go ahead and enjoy the story and beautiful scenery. Its not a wasted 2 hours by any means. But then get the digitally remastered 1967 version being released on June 1st and then compare the two.",/review/rw3331558/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2015,askJarv,9," Classic Drama/Romance
","Warning: I watched this on a flight so not necessarily a visual treat... Set against lovely backdrops of the country side and telling a classic story, Far from the Madding Crowd is the best period drama I've seen since Pride and Prejudice. As a tale, FftMC's characters are as true and real as they ever are - whilst the gender story isn't as important as it might once be (although it's not entirely irrelevant no matter how much I'd like to hope it would be) and the politics of the era hopefully something of the past, this story still explores the plight of love and trying to be true to yourself under outside pressures which, I feel, remains as true today as it ever did. The soundtrack does manage a few mis-steps, but is generally lovely and the overall package feels very polished and beautiful. Casting is solid and the script manages to be modern without losing any of the charm of the classic. The story itself, if you don't already know it, is touching and heart warming - human and full of love and mistakes - and just prefect as a result.",/review/rw3331558/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2019,fly-supergirl,4," If you haven't read the book, this movie will look very silly
","I have to start with the pros: very good visual production, costumes, music and acting.
Now the cons: the script is really bad. And considering it's based on a book already written, this movie feels like a very swift summary of the novel, a trailer, without any in depth analysis of why things happen, how each character feels about what's happening and no real purpose for anything.... Halfway through the movie I felt disconnected, wishing it to be over, not caring for any character and considering it a waste of time. Probably there was not enough time to include all the action in a 2 hour film, as it usually is, but maybe some unnecessary long scenes could've been shortened for the sake of introducing new ones.
Nevertheless, I really want to read the book now, to see whether there's a better development in written than on screen.
I've seen better period dramas adapted from novels , this one didn't do it's job, in my opinion.",/review/rw3331558/?ref_=tt_urv

","Every now and again movies take our breath away in the most simple, unexpected ways. This movie staring Carey Mulligan does so in spades. Based on the 1874 novel by Thomas Hardy it's the story of one woman's determination to be a contrarian in a man's world. She is pursued by 3 different types of men who are smitten with her. The beautiful settings, the rich costumes and the acting are all first rate as it hearkens back to a time when being a woman typically meant being a wife and mother. Mulligan who always brings depth and elegance to each role she does is simply exquisite as Bathsheba. A woman who celebrates her own direction and often does so alone.

","Though in her own words she has become accustomed to being on her own and refraining from succumbing to marital bliss, Bathsheba Everdene (Cary Mulligan) has been able to successfully live off her inherited land on her own without a husband and no intentions of ever looking for one. Her reason simply put by refusing to be another man's prize and that her comfort zone is clearly on independence and liberation. Thomas Hardy's ""Far From The Madding Crowd"" tells the romantic story of a self-sufficient young lady from 1870 England like Bathsheba Everdene and how even through her love for freedom and independence of marriage, she still has suitors attractive to her and want to win her heart in hope for marriage.
