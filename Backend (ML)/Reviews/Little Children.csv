8 January 2008,claudio_carvalho,8," The Future Can Be a Different Story
","In the suburbs, the boredom Sarah Pierce (Kate Winslet) lives a dull marriage without love with her selfish husband Richard Pierce (Gregg Edelman), who is successful in his career but with awful sexual habits. She spends the mornings with her daughter Lucy (Sadie Goldstein) in the playground observing the behavior of the suburban mothers with their children. When Sarah sees the frisson caused by the handsome ""househusband"" Brad Adamson (Patrick Wilson) in the other women, she decides to talk to him. Brad tells her that he has failed twice in the Bar exams for lawyer and he is financially supported by his wife Kathy (Jennifer Connelly), who is a documentary filmmaker. He omits that Kathy is a woman that gives all her attention to their son Aaron (Ty Simpkins), refusing to have sex with him. Sarah feels trapped in her unhappy life and has an affair with Brad, who is the opposite of Richard, in the afternoons. Meanwhile, the pervert Ronnie J. McGorvey (Jackie Earle Haley), who was in prison for indecent exposure, returns to his mother's house and feels the prejudice of his community against his presence, especially from the retired policeman Larry Hedges (Noah Emmerich) that is trying to force Ronnie to move away from their neighborhood.",/review/rw4320724/?ref_=tt_urv

","""You couldn't change the past,"" the narrator of Little Children tells us at the movie's close, ""but the future could be a different story."" The lives of the men and women who live in the very paragon of bland suburbia appear to be crunchy (and even somewhat unforgiving) on the outside, but inside they break, well, just like a little girl. A veritable sea of emotions, from love, despair, neglect, and hate churns below their pristine, everything-in-its-place veneers.",/review/rw4320724/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2006,A_Roode,9," Thoreau had it right.
","I was walking home the other evening having just watched this at the theatre. Two guys were ahead of me on the street and had just seen it as well. Not intending to listen in on their conversation ... I did anyway, *LOL*. One asked his friend what he thought about the movie and the second took a moment to think about it. His answer? ""Twisted man, too twisted!"" Thoreau wrote in Walden that ""the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation."" In 'Little Children,' we see that quiet desperation played out to full effect by desperate housewives, ex-cons and damaged loners. A deep study of loneliness, 'Little Children' is morally ambiguous and doesn't judge. It uses humour, it uses dread, and it is a film that is at times quirky, intelligent and ultimately fascinating.",/review/rw4320724/?ref_=tt_urv

23 September 2006,Chris Knipp,9," Fine sexual drama with a small uncertainty of tone
","Todd Field's Little Children's screenplay was written in collaboration with Tom Perrotta, on whose eponymous novel it's based. Perrotta wrote Election's, Bad Haircut's, and Joe College's funny, ironic screenplays before this. But though mildly satirical at times in its vision of middle-class white infidelity, this second film (at last) from the director of the powerful 2000 In the Bedroom, with its themes out of Cheever or Updike, also moves toward the solemn and the shocking.",/review/rw4320724/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2006,Flagrant-Baronessa,8," Evokes genuine interest
","Relationship drama is on the menu and Todd Field is the waiter, with expert skill and neat presentation. 'Little Children' zooms in on suburbia, navigating the world of desperate housewives and husbands. The dish proves a pleasant diversion, with crisp performances and a tasty centre.",/review/rw4320724/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2006,ClaytonDavis,10," Love the Children
","The acclaimed director of ""In the Bedroom"" brings a brand new type of adulterous love tale. Todd Field co-adapts Tom Perrotta's novel and never leaves the source material unattended. The film is multi-layered with subtle undertones and illustrious questions wrapped into a parable of two people Brad Adamson (Patrick Wilson) and Sarah Pierce, (Kate Winslet) individuals that feel so disenchanted with existence that they find ""comfort"" in one another. Brad is married to Kathy, (Jennifer Connelly) a beautiful Documentary film maker that pushes her husband to pass the Bar Exam that he's successfully failed twice. She sends him on nightly trips to the library to study where Brad often gets sidetracked into watching a couple of young skaters, skate around. Sarah is working on her dissertation and retires to the playground everyday with her daughter Lucy, to reminisce with the women of the neighborhood. Sarah is married to Richard, an awkward man with underlying motives and fantasies. Although his vanishing in the film is as awkward as he is.",/review/rw4320724/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2007,axlgarland,10," Perversely Yours
","Bedrooms still play an important part in Todd Field universe but this time there is an outing, intellectual and emotional, that overwhelms in the apparent patina of familiarity. ""Little Children"" sizzles with an uncomfortable sense of impending doom. Kate Winslet, through her later day Madame Bovary, gives us a character that is recognisable and never seen before at the same time. Powerfully honest to the point of self destruction and yet, her feelings seem so clear and pure, so innocent. Kate Winslet in a superlative performance, invites us to believe that a human being can inhabit that contradiction without seem absurd. Patrick Wilson's courage without brains or vice versa is an uncomfortable pleasure to watch. Jennifer Connelly has one of the most chilling domestic moments I've seen in a long time: a moment of realisation at a dinner table. Contradictions, perhaps, are at the centre of this wonderfully conceived universe, Weary of domestic bliss. compassion for a child molester. Jack Earle Haley's psycho is not played for sympathy - he is a horrible character. He and his mother, the great Phyllis Somerville - are a realistic version of a Hitchcockian coupling. Adult entertainment, yes entertainment too, of the first order.",/review/rw4320724/?ref_=tt_urv

20 June 2007,he_who_leads,8," An Enaging Film with Focus
","'Little Children' is one of those movies set in suburbia that explores men and women dealing with strained marriages, the politics of parenting, inertia, loneliness, fidelity/infidelity and dangers lurking beneath the surface. When not done well, films like this can appear to be overblown soap operas. When done right, like this one is, it is something to sink your teeth into and enjoy.",/review/rw4320724/?ref_=tt_urv

","Greetings again from the darkness. Where the heck have you been, Todd Field? Last seen directing 2001's excellent ""In The Bedroom"", Field delivers another remarkable drama with ""Little Children"". He proves again his insight into real people and real relationships is a bit eerie and almost tough to watch as we often recognize ourselves in his characters.",/review/rw4320724/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2007,Quinoa1984,10," Field proves himself to be a veritable force of importance in the drama genre
","Maybe I'm a sucker for this kind of arena of drama, dealing with adulteries and infidelities, or at least when then they're done with a level of believability that doesn't cross into soap operas. But going into Little Children, that's really all I expected to see. I got that, but I also got more than I would've hoped for: Little Children is one of the best examples in American movies of the dysfunctional suburban complacency and need for escapism since American Beauty (if not, perhaps, the most accomplished in dealing with fractured characters). The 'little children' of the title include a married man, Brad, and a married woman, Sara (not married to each other of course, played by Patrick Wilson and Kate Winslet), an ex-cop turned 'community-action' watchman (Noah Emmerich), and a sex offender/flasher (Jackie Earle Haley). Their lives become undone by nothing except from themselves, or each other, and never do the characters seem unrealistic or detached via melodrama. Field has a real knack here- and continues it from his breakthrough In the Bedroom- of cutting to the core of suburban discontent in the characters, though this time it's showing through (major) flaws and all, these are fully realized human beings who can't be turned away as mere clich√©s.",/review/rw4320724/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2006,soccer.goalie@verizon.net,10," Amazing!
","Out of all the ""Oscar Bait"" films I've seen this year, this film beats them all. Little Children is an unbelievable masterpiece about what it means to grow up.

8 January 2007,zetes,7," Great setup, no payoff
","An oddly toned film. I have been able to avoid the more intense discussions this has aroused, and I was barely at all aware that the film had comedic tones. As far as I can figure, the film posits suburban and married life in the realm of the Twilight Zone, via a deep-voiced, omniscient narrator. The narrator is something that most film audiences don't care for, but I don't think Field and novelist/screenwriter Tom Perrotta would have been able to capture the tone they did without it. So I personally thought that worked. I think the tone is really what makes the film memorable. The movie's steeped in awkwardness, but, at least for most of the film's run, it isn't awkward itself. The story begins well, and the characters are excellently realized and performed. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson play the primary caregivers to their toddler children. They grow closer as they meet repeatedly at playgrounds and the public swimming pool, and soon begin an affair. The film's major subplot deals with a recently released sex offender (played by Jackie Earle Haley) who is being hassled by a former police officer (Noah Emmerich). Haley's loving, elderly mother (Phyllis Somerville) tries desperately to protect her son. The main plot and the subplot tangle together in the end, and there is an attempt to relate the subplot to the main plot (as per screen writing 101), but it feels mighty forced. In fact, pretty much everything fizzles by the film's very weak ending. The strong story that had been built up, alas, has no satisfying resolution. I still think it's mostly a very strong film, though, with great direction by Field.",/review/rw4320724/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2011,MBunge,4," I never thought I'd want more of Jackie Earle Haley and less of naked Kate Winslet
","This is a movie about responsibility and being a grown-up that would make a 40 year old want to get a fake ID and set something on fire. It's too long, too transparent, thematically archaic and features the most superfluous narration in cinema history. There's clearly a lot of care and effort being put into this film. Unfortunately, it's all in the service of a plodding story that should have never made it to the big screen. It should have been taken out behind the barn and shot.",/review/rw4320724/?ref_=tt_urv

","Life in suburbia, since Ira Levin's THE STEPFORD WIVES, has been torn apart at the seams and hung to dry. It's no secret that within every happy home (that is more than likely to be overvalued into the seven digits, depending on the city and neighborhood where you live in) there will be some drama being played out, whether it's acknowledged or not.",/review/rw4320724/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2006,cnewf,7," very smart about Little Adults, with odd screw-ups
","This movie does a wonderful job of representing the undertow of confusion and stuckness that threatens to pull people under. It cuts among interlocking stories that each center on someone who is about to dive down beneath their established life, and for entirely normal, believable reasons. 45 minutes into the film, all the main characters have thrown themselves into the vortex, creating the uneasy fear one feels for people who are about to risk everything they've deliberately built up in order to end a sense of suffocation that is much less concrete than the secure surface of their lives, but somehow more real. This is strong suspense film about that crucial question of whether or not our own happy lives actually make us feel alive.",/review/rw4320724/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2007,Spaceygirl,9," Compelling
","""Little Children"" is quite simply put, brilliant. It helps that the source material is top-notch but ""Little children"" has a cracker of a script! While Kate Winslet, as usual, turns in a fine performance as an embittered housewife it is Jackie Earl Haley who puts in a tour de force. He practically chews up the scenery when he's on screen. I can't remember where I've seen him before, but it was a long time ago. Kudos to whoever cast him in this role. The story is a simple one and one can imagine this making a good play as the locations are simple and few. While other films make a big show about ""cinematography"" and special effects, ""Little Children"" simply gets on with what's important. Storyline. Dialogue. Acting. I can't imagine why ""Little Children"" was overlooked at this years Oscar. In my opinion, it stands its own against ""The Departed"" et al. Update: Having seen the exalted ""Little Miss Sunshine"" with Supporting Actor Winner Alan Arkin, all I can say is, Jackie Earl Haley was robbed!!!! What a travesty of justice!!!",/review/rw4320724/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2008,Chrysanthepop,," A Movie About Little Grown-Ups That Would Have Worked Better As Two Movies
","My friends advised me against watching 'Little Children' as they found it very boring. Having liked Todd Field's previous film 'In The Bedroom' and knowing that it had Kate Winslet and Jennifer Connelly (whose works I very much admire alongside their beauty), I decided to watch it anyway. The poster was a put-off as the tagline stated: Twin Peaks meets Desperate Housewives. I hate such taglines where the movie concerned is being compared to other films, TV series or whatever. On top of that, I am no fan of 'Desperate Housewives'. However I found the trailer appealing as it gave the impression that it was a dark film about a married couple (Connelly and Wilson) and the other woman (Winslet), it appealed to me. Only later I will find out that I've been deceived.",/review/rw4320724/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2007,robert-temple-1,10," They Don't Come Better Than This
","With this film, Hollywood finally came of age. This is as devastatingly real as any indie or foreign film has ever been. Todd Field, screenwriter and director of the amazingly powerful 'In the Bedroom' several years ago, here exceeds himself, and has made a major masterpiece. Why did it only get Oscar nominations? It should have won them! Surely Kate Winslet has never delivered a more spectacular performance. The screenplay is one of the most brilliant in years, especially considering the way it successfully embraced a multi-stranded storyline. No tightrope-walker ever pulled off a more breathtaking display than this film, which could easily have fallen over the edge, but didn't. It was right on target, in every scene, and with every agonising heartbeat. The performance by Jackie Earle Haley is a once-in-a-lifetime achievement. He need never do anything else again, he has made history with the most naked performance ever. To do what he did took the most enormous courage. Patrick Wilson was perfection itself in his role. To call this one of the best films in years is not enough. How many weeks does it take to recover from the emotional shredding involved in watching it? The bubble-wrap has been ripped off of life here, and we see what beats beneath, and it is raw. This film ranks with 'La Strada' and other such classics. The technique of the ironic narrator works well, is used sparingly, and is perfectly judged. One is tempted to use the word 'perfect' to describe everything about this film. But why not? The music is especially good. The editing is crisp. Is there any flaw? I think not. The film contains an amusing discussion about 'Madame Bovary' by Flaubert, which is often said to be the most perfectly crafted of novels. One might apply the phrase 'perfectly crafted' to this film, which is Hollywood's very own 'Madame Bovary'. They should teach this movie in film schools. Can Todd Field possibly go on directing after penetrating the magnetosphere? Is there any level higher? Let's hope so. Don't keep us waiting too long, Todd.",/review/rw4320724/?ref_=tt_urv

12 July 2010,moonspinner55,6," Unsympathetic portrait of small town lives which never quite achieves its contradictory ambitions
","Another fascinating, flawed film by writer-producer-director Todd Field, who co-adapted the screenplay with Tom Perrotta from Perrotta's novel. Handsome stay-at-home dad in a stifling suburb, slowly and quietly being emasculated by his documentary-filmmaker spouse, has an affair with an unfulfilled housewife in the neighborhood; meanwhile, a sex-offender recently paroled has moved into town and is being harassed by an ex-policeman, who has his own tragic history. An occasionally effective tapestry of dramatic storytelling, yet one waits in vain for big, revealing scenes that never arrive. An even headier problem may be that this particular group of troubled (and selfish) people are never made embraceable to the audience...are any of these characters worth caring about? Field intertwines the smaller bits of the plot--the minutiae--together successfully, but he is unable to chart a satisfying course through the culmination of events, thereby reaching an unrewarding conclusion. There are rich, intuitive moments and performances, but the film derails at a crucial point in the story--with about 10 minutes left on the clock--and this leaves the audience feeling somewhat emotionally deprived. **1/2 from ****",/review/rw4320724/?ref_=tt_urv

","The reason I was interested in this film is because its screenplay was partially written Tom Perrotta, who wrote the book ""The Leftovers"" that was later adapted into perhaps my favorite TV show of all-time.
