27 July 2014,Eagles409,10," Hilarious Show
","This show tows a fine line with its comedy and definitely succeeds. One of the hardest types of comedy is to have someone that is completely obnoxious, but that you still love. This show has 2 main characters that are in reality awful people, but you want to spend time with them. The writing for the show is brilliant and the 2 main characters are perfect for their roles. This show sort of takes the romantic comedy and just flips it so that everything they say is the opposite of what you would normally expect. I hope people will check this show out and give it a chance, it is definitely different and in a very good way. I can't wait for the next episode.",/review/rw6910469/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2023,Supermanfan-13,8," Better Than Expected!
","I just had the pleasure of watching You're the worst and I'm blown away by how much I liked it. It has to be one of the least talked about great comedies of all-time. FX should've done a better job promoting this because it was hilarious. It's actually more of a dramedy than just plain comedy. The cast is what makes this show so special, it was perfect. There's not a weak character on the entire show. I got hooked from the very first episode and it just continued to get better and better and had one of the best, most fulfilling endings I've ever seen. If you scroll down you'll see that just about every review is positive and that's because of how good this show is. If you haven't seen this yet please give it a try. You won't be disappointed!",/review/rw6910469/?ref_=tt_urv

29 December 2019,Gernot S.,8," Not underrated, but under-known
","Sad to see how few have rated (and therefore, I assume, seen) the episodes. This show is really something. Not for everyone: every single character tests our sympathies, time and time again. Yet the balance between comedy and drama is done amazingly well. Some complain that there are long stretches without much to laugh about, but that's the great thing. It makes it highly unpredictable.",/review/rw6910469/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Such an underrated comedy!
","You're the Worst is one of the most unique, underrated comedies ever. It's the perfect non rom-com. It's the perfect mix of comedy and drama. It was good enough to go five incredible seasons but still didn't get nearly the exposure it deserved. You'll fall in love with all the characters and want to binge watch the show once you start. Chris Geere and Aya Cash lead an overall great cast that all have great chemistry between each other. The dynamic between the characters on this show is what makes it so special. This show delivers on just about every episode and does what most shows fail to do and that is deliver a great finale. It's the perfect ending to a great show!",/review/rw6910469/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2014,robin_should,9," Makes me laugh, even out loud.
","So, I have watched all 3 episodes and each one has surprised me by making me smile from start to finish and make laugh out loud on several occasions. I love all the main characters, this has not happened since way back. The unwanted chemistry between Jimmy and Gretchen is great to watch. How two people not interested in a relationship try to not connect, but find themselves being pulled into something they can't escape and can't explain. Whether it will continue at this high quality is up to the writers because the actors are doing a great job. The British/American mix worked on ""Episodes"" and I think here it goes one step further. I think I would have found an American male a bit too pretentious and not quite as believable as Chris Geere.",/review/rw6910469/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2022,interestingstuff,7," First couple seasons are the best
","This is your typical FX show in that the show starts great with a promising first season, peaks in the second season, stalls in the third season and starts going downhill starting fourth season and completely fails in the last season. Since this pretty much happens with every FX show ever, there are no surprises with this one either.",/review/rw6910469/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2022,jennfinn,10," A Complicated Love Story.
","Aya Cash is a great actress and she is so underrated. Chris Geere is Jimmy and I can't imagine anyone else playing him. Their chemistry is electric, they make a great couple who have many flaws but they see past them.",/review/rw6910469/?ref_=tt_urv

",As someone who is a big comedy fan I can tell you that comedy that Comedy is supposed to make you laugh you laugh and this show is hilarious it's hilarious and does the job well the job will if you need a laugh this is the show to watch Although the characters are also relateable And the acting is very good And the 3 leads are really good together Even though they give each other hard time they still are Friends I had a great time with this show. I still watch the show today and Recommend it. The 2 leads are good together you hope that it works out But it's also hilarious They break up and make up several times Throughout the series.,/review/rw6910469/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2020,bgar-80932,8," Great show
",The show follows Jimmy and Gretchen in their will they won't they relationship. Both are a mess. Jimmy has a huge ego and is an alcoholic writer. Gretchen is also an alcoholic with mental problems and a PR person for a funny rap group. The overall cast is great too when you add in the roommate and family/friends. They're all pretty funny in their own ways and when there's episodes without focusing on the main couple it doesn't feel out of place in the slightest. It's a really good show and I'm not mushy but I for sure was rooting for them to get it together in the end. I would for sure recommend this. The end was great/heartwarming too and worked in a way that would only work for their relationship.,/review/rw6910469/?ref_=tt_urv

20 November 2021,tonyfromlg,10," the best.
","You're the worst is a dark romcom based around characters you really shouldn't like, but can't help too . This show had me laughing out loud, tearing up, and angry at some points. Other reviews say season 1 was its prime and the rest is a gradual decline. That is nothing but misconception. The story development that shows in the final 3 episodes(s2) alone connects so much together. The character development by the end of season 2 all makes so much sense and is almost perfect. The darkness turn of all the innocent seeming storylines comes off perfect in a comical way. This show is nothing short of brilliant. Great binge as well.",/review/rw6910469/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2020,abondgirl,10," My favorite Guilty Pleasure
","I retired early a few months ago and I binge watched all 5 seasons within a few weeks. It was my favorite show. I know, at Age 58, I am not the target audience. I'll admit there were times I wanted to give up on it because the characters - especially Gretchen - could be extremely unlikeable. However, I found that even skipping it for a day or two, I really missed the show. I watched the final 4 episodes today and LOVED The season finale. I love the characters and I miss them already. I wouldn't recommend this show to everyone - the more conservative people may not care for the shock value. However, for those viewers, like me, who love a quirky show with fun plots, good acting and believable characters, this may be their new favorite also. I am very sad to see it end.",/review/rw6910469/?ref_=tt_urv

13 September 2014,noveltyfriend,10," One of the most well written shows on television
","Most sitcoms take a little time to find their voice, but You're the Worst has been strong since the pilot. It was instantly one of my favorite shows on TV and has only gotten better. It has plenty of funny one liners and silly situations, but it's real strength is creating interesting characters that have depth. This is the kind of show most networks would probably ruin by demanding the characters come off as more likable or moral. But FX has been bold enough to let shows like Louie, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia and Wilfred create strong characters who may not always be likable, but are always interesting.",/review/rw6910469/?ref_=tt_urv

8 August 2014,mplusc,9," You're the Worst if You're Not Watching One of the Best New Comedies
","""You're the Worst"" is one of the funniest dark comedies I've seen in a long timeI really hope more people catch on to this hilarious gem, FX picks really fantastic programs and personally I believe ""You're the Worst"" is above and beyond in a different league entirely than Anger Management, Louis, The League, and I'm a very loyal ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" viewer, but I'll be honest, I really really look forward to Thursday Nights because of this new FX series. I hope more advertising & word of mouth spread quickly b/c this American written dark comedy is pretty special...(no joke, it's not a re-make of a British series!) It's definitely NSFW humor which makes it even better. Shameless fans, It's Always Sunny In Philly Fans, anyone who appreciates crazy, hilarious, I can't believe they just said that on TV humor get on board :) Thursday Nights, FX...lets keep this one ALIVE! Creators, writers, crew, actors, you are a breath of fresh air. Cheers :)",/review/rw6910469/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2014,leftbanker-1,10," If it doesn't hurt at least a little it isn't funny. This show is funny.
","If you don't like this new series it's probably because you're too stupid to understand the jokes. Don't beat yourself up about it because the good news is that intelligence and a sense of humor count for very little in modern culture so you're probably doing just fine...unless you are ugly, too. Stupid, no sense of humor, and ugly would be a tough go in any culture.",/review/rw6910469/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2014,t-alonzo,10," Brilliant
","Laugh-out-loud funny, sadistically truthful, witty and well-crafted banter, incredibly interesting characters. Everything I could ask for in 22 minutes of needed escape time. I'd watch Jimmy and Gretchen reading an Applebee's menu. Kether Donohue's Lindsay could/should have been the headliner for her own show. I had a hard time understanding Edgar in the beginning - Ross from Friends anyone? Missed the mark on him completely. He's fantastic. Anxious to see where they go with these two 'sidekicks'. Another great F/X series. (Side note - Dennis Leary can't get back soon enough...) Slowly pulled us into the first episode. By the second, we were hooked. It's one of the first shows pulled up on the DVR. Thank you Mr. Landgraf. Keep 'em coming!",/review/rw6910469/?ref_=tt_urv
