1 October 2013,eselim9175,8," Just Very Funny
","If you haven't watched this then give any of the episodes a go. It is just pure entertainment, there is not supposed to be a point to any of it other than to make you laugh, (which it repeatedly succeeds in doing). It is slick, has fresh tight scripts moves along at a pace and you don't really need any prior knowledge of the characters to enjoy each episode fully. Don't expect the main protagonists to develop over time. This isn't one of these get to know the characters and feel empathy with them over a course of a series things. Ultimately comedy is about making you laugh and this one manages to do that with its absurd set-ups and excellent dialogue. Co-written by Jack Whitehall, he deserves credit for creating something which is very enjoyable.",/review/rw3703409/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2023,annafarrell,1," What happened!
","I loved all the previous seasons of bad education and gave it an 8. Season 4 is just horrible. Jack Whitehall is not even in it anymore and nothing makes sense. The former students seem to be teachers. It makes no sense, it's not funny, it's just cringe worthy. I couldn't even get through the first episode, what utter drivel! To think I was looking forward to watching this all day, what a downer. I wish I had a character counter so I would know when to stop whinging. Maybe there's an app for that? Aah I see there's a little red counter on top here, that's really appreciated. In short, cringeworthy drivel.",/review/rw3703409/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2012,Ideophobe,8," British banter at its finest, and failest: School life; slice of life comedy.
","I'll give this terrible education an 8; a score given almost entirely on the value of dialogue. In every concept this show is plainly, used, but the stereotypes stay fresh with a stream of static wit. Banter fights back and forth from start to finish. The character palette is too robust to ever stay looking at one color for long. Characters are stably defined, and growth among any of them is highly unlikely. But as they interact, the extreme envelopes them as you get to sit and watch these kids ride toward utter nothingness mislead by a teacher who seems to be skilled in absolutely nothing but responding to any situation, anywhere, instantly and in the worst way possible. I suggest checking it out if dialogue is your thing the British have been doing it a long time. ~Ideophobe",/review/rw3703409/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2019,krtyhb,10," Brilliant
","A fantastic British sitcom. Enjoyed it from start to finish. It's stupid, rude and childish. If you like the Inbetweeners, you'll like this.
The end of the 3rd series is heartfelt but still wamingly comical.
Definitely one of those series I could watch repeatedly",/review/rw3703409/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2023,nicklea-13392,1," First thee seasons great - season four rubbish
",I won't bother repeating all the good things everyone else has already said about the first three seasons. If this were just a review of those seasons then I would easily give it a 7 or 8.,/review/rw3703409/?ref_=tt_urv

1 January 2015,snipermurph01,8," Funny short series with an emotional ending.
","Don't be fooled by the title, Bad Education is everything but bad. The characters (although somewhat clich√©) are all lovable and in many ways relate-able. An example would be the flamboyantly eccentric Stephen (or indeed his alter-ego Stephanie). The show takes place in a typical British secondary school filled with dodgy teachers, and even dodgier pupils. All the funny scenarios and wacky situations will make you think ""(sigh) if only my school was really this funny""",/review/rw3703409/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2020,MotherOfCats91,10," Better than A.P. Bio
",I recently discovered this series on Netflix and found myself laughing out loud and therefore hooked by the first episode which isn't always the case with comedy series. When I was watching it I realized how similar it is to the American comedy series A.P. Bio (which came after Bad Education) but funnier; so if you're a fan of A.P. and comedy series in general you should try Bad Education.,/review/rw3703409/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2019,benowen-91207,5," Poor man's inbetweeners
","It was granted that E4's the inbetweeners would get some rip offs because of its huge success, and while bad education isn't the worst (let's not forget about the us inbetweeners) it still really isn't good
A lot of it comes from the story lines and characters, more specifically Jack Whitehall as the lead. I know cringe comedy is like Britain's trademark but you still need to have charisma for it to work (like Ricky Gervais as David Brent).
I give this show props for not being a complete copy of the inbetweeners and having some genuinely funny moments but it's a miss other than that",/review/rw3703409/?ref_=tt_urv

7 March 2019,ashleys-mackenzie,7," Funny but terrible soundtrack
","Very typical Jack Whitehall so funny. However, the horrible and jarring soundtrack transitions that go from a whispered decibel to screaming in your ear make it difficult to enjoy. 100% NOT recommended if you are using headphones or live in an apartment complex or don't want to experience action-sequence transitions.",/review/rw3703409/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2015,StormSworder,2," An example of what's wrong with most of today's ""comedy""
","Ever wondered why there have been no great British sitcoms to rival the glories of the 20th century? Or no new icons on a par with the Trotters, the Warmington-on-sea gang, the boys from the Dwarf, Victor Meldrew or Tony Hancock? It's simple really. The great comedy writing teams of old were from blue-collar backgrounds. They knew the masses and they knew what made the man in the street laugh.",/review/rw3703409/?ref_=tt_urv

","Bad Education follows Alfie Wickers, an infantile young teacher who deserves, and gets, very little respect from those around him. He has a class of assorted children, mostly more confident and adult than he is. Banter ensues. The end.",/review/rw3703409/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2017,jboothmillard,7," Bad Education
","This was one of the last really popular sitcoms to be broadcast on BBC Three before it was shut down and taken online, I was really thankful that it was repeated before I missed out on the opportunity to watch it. Basically the series takes place at the fictional Abbey Grove School, in Watford or Tring, Hertfordshire, and it focuses on posh, newly graduated secondary school history teacher Alfie Wickers (Jack Whitehall, also writing). Alfie is a bigger kid than the kids he is teaching in Class K, his students include teacher's pet Joe Poulter (Ethan Lawrence), tough guy Mitchell Harper (Britain's Got Talent's Charlie Wernham), wheelchair-bound rude boy Leslie ""Rem Dogg"" Remmington (Jack Binstead), inappropriately flirtatious Chantelle Parsons (Nikki Runeckles), camp Stephen Carmichael (Layton Williams), the studious Jing Hua (Kae Alexander) and outwardly fiery Cleopatra Ofoedo (Weruche Opia). Throughout the series, the mismatched youngsters give him a hard time and take the mick, but often they can relate to them, banter with him, and become his good friends. Also throughout, Alfie is constantly trying to impress his crush, openly bisexual biology teacher Miss Rosie Gulliver (Sarah Solemani), trying to appear ""cool"", often his efforts turn into embarrassing situations or humiliation for himself, the students or the teaching staff. Alfie also has to contend with the the teaching staff, including eccentric headmaster Shaquille Banter ""Simon"" Fra$er (Mathew Horne), and meet the expectations of the deputy heads, including demanding dictator Isobel Pickwell (Michelle Gomez), ruthless yet cringe-worthy Professor Celia ""Pro Green"" Green (Samantha Spiro), and his own father, dramatically inappropriate Martin Wickers (Harry Enfield). Also starring Jack Bence Jack Bence as Grayson, James Fleet as Richard, David Bradley as Ennis, Roger Allam as Maurice Hewston, Lethal Bizzle as Rapper and Colin McFarlane as Politician. Whitehall gives a fantastic performance as ""the worst teacher ever to grace the British education system"", the supporting cast members, young and old, all do great as well, Whitehall's writing is brilliant, all three series are both cringing and hilarious, it may have had the critics being negative towards it, but I found a very entertaining and funny comedy show. Very good!",/review/rw3703409/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2015,afaqqwe,10," Jack Whitehall knows how to make you laugh
","Jack Whitehall as a school teacher, and a really funny school teacher, that is why it's called ""Bad Education"" I guess. Jack has this posh accent and he cracks silly funny jokes and the story in every episode is funny. Jack having a crush over Miss Gulliver, who is her colleague. Miss Gulliver is pretty and funny by the way. Students are fun too. Especially the character of Joe, Joe is cute and Joe's chemistry with Jack, will surely make you laugh even more. This show might take you back to the school and you'll miss your school memories and the class fun and you might start wishing your school teachers were Miss Gulliver and Jack. I wished that Miss Gulliver and Jack were my teachers. I wished they created more seasons and more episodes. I wished It was a never ending show. Although non of my wish came true but still I watched this show many times over and over again. And I bet you guys would watch it over and over again too. Jack Whitehall deserves the credit to make shows really fun and he is the co-writer too. this show makes me say ""Thank You Jack Whitehall!""",/review/rw3703409/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2017,erawillmoth,10," Well, I thought Bad Education was Fantastic
","Considering Bad Education is 'just' a sitcom and therefore not typically expected to have complex characters and plot lines, I think the writing and casting of the series was and remains fantastic. Not only is there witty and well-delivered dialogue, as mentioned in other reviews, but it touches on sensitive issues in an admirable way. Let me expand on this, because it is debated hotly and largely disputed, especially for this show.",/review/rw3703409/?ref_=tt_urv
