4 October 2022,Supermanfan-13,8," One of the best crime shows!
","Criminal Minds is about an elite squad of FBI profilers that investigate the country's most twisted cases and killers. They try to analyze how to get a step ahead of these killers to catch them before they kill more. This series was so good that it went 15 seasons. Not only the 15 seasons but even though it's only been off the air for a short time, people have missed it so much that they're bringing it back later this year with the same cast. The characters are all very well written and developed throughout the show. The writers also keep the shows fresh and that's not an easy job after 15 seasons. I'm looking forward to it returning later this year.",/review/rw4046885/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2022,natehzick,8," Looks very promising
","(2 episodes in) This review is subject to change over the course of this season. As someone who just couldn't finish those final seasons of criminal minds since the quality took a bit of a downturn, trust me when I say this has been as good as the trailer hyped it up to be. Will it be anything special? That remains to be seen, but so far there is a solid foundation and it's a breath of fresh air for the BAU.",/review/rw4046885/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Miss It!
",I really have to say I actually miss Criminal Minds more than I thought I would. I watched all 15 seasons and even watch the reruns when they're on. I'm glad that they're bringing it back to Paramount Plus later this year. It's a show that is a little darker than your average crime show on network tv. It follows the B. A. U. (Behavioral Analyst Unit) as they hunt the country's most dangerous serial killers and rapists by anticipating where and what they'll do next. Any show that lasts 15 seasons has to be pretty good. If you love crime shows and don't mind a darker and gruesome tone then give this show a try.,/review/rw4046885/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2022,oscarjneklund,8," Good criminal series! ðŸ”Ž
","Be careful, you will end up watching 15 episdoes in a row, haha. No but this is very addicting, especially when there is a cliffhanger. A good show with great actors, personal favourites: Morgan & Reed! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡²",/review/rw4046885/?ref_=tt_urv

22 February 2016,candelach,6," Used to be a good series
","Criminal Minds started out really well. A little bit of psychological and sociological background being introduced to the general public to get a grasp on criminal profiling. The episodes were entertaining, the characters relatable yet realistically flawed. However from season 6 on, this series just spiraled downward. The cases lost the grip they had had on the audience, became dull and left you cold. In an attempt to make up for unimaginative cases and the routine that had set it when watching the team profile, gore and violence was increased and to even it out cheesy background plots for the characters were added. Sometimes it's just better to quit while you're ahead.",/review/rw4046885/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2022,luvbnadad-57874,10," The bar of it's category
","This show and the cast over the years Were superb it always hit right in the heart, mind and gut with the episodes and their real feel. I will say it also disgusted me along the way each season with it's in your face realism, but the reality is what they do and who they go after.",/review/rw4046885/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2019,socrfan-60834,4," Rubber stamped scripts.
","The profilers, out of thin air, magically know the age sex and past of way too many of the people they're chasing. Profiling is one thing but this gets way overboard. And the conclusion always has a hostage with a gun or knife to their neck. Plus how many times do we need to hear someone call out in a dark building ""hello is anyone there"" or say they're calling the police and turn their back so they can get hit. Instead of good scripts the writers take too many liberties and too often the easy way out.",/review/rw4046885/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2017,hellebenzon-26367,10," Not a fan anymore
","I was a hardcore fan for 11 seasons. I've seen every episode, but this last season is absolutely the s'worst. I don't know if they got new writers, or the writers are just totally out of touch with the fanbase, but it has become ridiculous and soap-like. The Reid-line has taken forever, and it's really painful to watch. I think, I'll drop the show, and maybe pick it up again later, when they maybe get it back to it's former standards. But I fear, that this is it for Criminal Minds. With the downfall, I'm not sure it will survive for a 13th season.",/review/rw4046885/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2021,Imme-van-Gorp,10," It's very intriguing and just absolutely never boring. Every episode manages to capture me completely.

3 November 2022,redinnevada,9," Takes a lot to give this much
","After binge-watching all 15 seasons in anticipation of it's renewal, there''s only one MAIN review a show of this caliber should have. Fifteen years. 324 episodes. ~19440 minutes.",/review/rw4046885/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2022,felipeperez-23313,9," So far, so good.
","Off to a good start, but as I recall the Original started off great and was unlike any show on television at the time. Let's just hope that the writers maintain quality story lines and not too far fetched themes. With so much television on both television networks and streaming platforms it's hard to pick and choose which ones will turn out to be good quality shows and which will be trash and end after just one season. Seasoned shows like the Original Law and Order and CSI Las Vegas are decent but not as good as the Original's. But so far Criminal Minds Evolution seems to be just as good as the Original. Only time will tell.",/review/rw4046885/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2006,hippo_butt2000,," Diving into minds of lunatics and psychopaths has never been more entertaining!
","Truly a great series worthy of praise. Many may say that this is a 'rip-off' of CSI but I've watched CSI and it caught me on for a bit, but after a while it just seemed to closed. Where CSI guides you through the story and gives a picture perfect ending and how you're supposed to perceive it, Criminal Minds lets you explore and judge for yourself. It doesn't preach too much and the stories are engaging and suspenseful! Excellent writing and great performances from the stars. It may begin clichÃ©, but if you stay long enough it is a rewarding and entertaining view, and I don't feel it's going to let down any time soon. Give it a chance, or just watch episode 7 'The Fox'. It shows the best writing and acting in the show so far, in my opinion. Diving into minds of lunatics and psychopaths has never been more entertaining! Fantastic!",/review/rw4046885/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2022,malcolmjohnston,9," Back to basics
",Being a massive fan of the early Gideon seasons of Criminal Minds and sadly watching the show grind itself to a halt with to heavier cast I watched the first episode with some trepidation.,/review/rw4046885/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2022,geddzik,8," Good show...for a while.
","Good show. Lost most of its appeal when Hotch and Morgan left. Straus has got to be the dumbest and most annoying character and she's only in a dozen or so episodes but every one she's in, she's annoying. The best seasons are the ones with most of the original cast. When JJ left the first time it was bad so they brought her back. Same with Prentis. And the second time she leaves is another down hill where they started bringing in dumb characters to replace her. Only to bring her back when Hotch was forced off and by then it was too late, the show was already done for. Watch seasons 1-7 maybe 8, after that just give up.",/review/rw4046885/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2012,Galina_movie_fan,10," Criminally entertaining
","The drama/mystery/thriller ""Criminal Minds"" is truly an amazing show. I started only watching it couple of months ago, and I can't believe that it took me so long to discover it. This is the show where each episode reminds me of my favorite book on the subject of finding the serial killers by trying to get inside their minds and to think the way they do, and equally terrific adaptation, Red Dragon by Thomas Harris/Manhunter by Michael Mann. Again and again the team of the brilliant profilers, fly from their headquarters in Quantico, VA to different locations all over the country to put their minds together and complete the profile of the mysterious unsub (unknown subject) and to prevent the next strike which would be deadly. This is a very difficult, demanding and exhausting job where the lives of innocent people are at stake and every minute, even second matters. This job takes its toll from every member of the team. Often they have to make very difficult choices and more than once they face the deadly danger not only to themselves but to those who are the closest to them. ",/review/rw4046885/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2015,bogymel,6," Enough is enough already
","So I've been watching this show ever since it's beginnings and all I can say is that I'm sick of it... 5 seasons would have been enough. But since I have a mild OCD that urges me to see things to an end, I can't stop watching.",/review/rw4046885/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2020,Vaxi,5," Why did you have to destroy this great series?
","This used to be great series. These days, terribly boring. Poor script, over acting. The new characters are boring. I don't even remember their names. Penelope Garcia has been made an annoying freak. Why are you trying to remake the chemistry of Derek Morgan/Penelope Garcia to Garcia and this CSI geek? The new ""beyond borders"" agent talks only about his children. Why did this series have to be ruined? The last 5 seasons have been so forced. Thomas Gibson and Shemar Moore were too big losses for the series. Good thing this ended, though 5 seasons too late. And in the end all the agents are smart like Reed. JJ is even a sharpshooter (she was an FBI liaison)",/review/rw4046885/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2022,karynislay,10," OMG OMG OMG!! GIVE ME MORE PLEASE
","Thank you TV God's for bringing my all time #1 SHOW back to me and the rest of their deserving fan's. I'm so excited for this show to return, how I yelled the names of the cast members as I saw them and screamed when I noticed certain ones weren't there yet. The emotional ride of knowing these characters, how I feel like I've known them for twenty years plus. Their ups and downs, loosing Gideon Hotchner and Mr. Sexy himself Shemar Moore, watching the casting director weave in the new cast perfectly mixing them with the seasoned cast. This show delivers just like it did the first time! When something is done right it's just that RIGHT. Perfection is what you call this I'm counting the minutes till the next episode, it has me thinking is this even possible could it really be an UNsub like this out here. OMG OMG OMG!!",/review/rw4046885/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2019,rcpotatosoup-40764,7," Seasons 1-7 are really good. Season 8 started a decline that it never recovers from.
","Either way - watch the whole show. It's still good TV. Seasons 1-7 are incredibly good, with interesting cases and heartfelt character driven episodes. The problem came with actors having contract issues or getting kicked off the show entirely. The writing is still really solid but it gets too messy in the later seasons.",/review/rw4046885/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2017,jolinefehr,3," I need to quit you Criminal Minds
","I have watched every single episode of Criminal Minds up until this past season. I have enjoyed the intricate plots, the character development, the story lines. I have to say that over the last year, the whole feel of the show has completely changed. Too many character departures, too many new character faces, and now Reid in jail? Come on Criminal Minds. I just can't anymore. I am not enjoying it at all anymore and I couldn't finish the season. So, now I have decided that I have to quit you. And in all honesty, I don't know if I'll miss you.",/review/rw4046885/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2022,Laura_Ratings,8," Thrilling
","Absolutely adore this show. I've watched it for years and it it's still a great watch. Not all of the episodes are as great or as strong as some of them, and some may also not be as logical, but most of them are well done. The only thing I recommend everyone should ignore is the amount of times they go into a dangerous place either with limited protection (bullet vests) or by themselves. There's some inaccuracies and flaws that don't allign with what the work probably looks like in real life, but once that's ignored it's honestly a really good show!",/review/rw4046885/?ref_=tt_urv

25 November 2022,tsvetomir-38028,9," My first review of this new chapter in Criminal Minds and the show as a whole
",Amazing start to a new chapter of Criminal Minds! I am so far no doubt satisfied with the new episodes and I hope this stays like this throughout this season. I have loved the OG Criminal Minds however I hope under this new management the series can have it glory back. I've been rating TV shows and movies between 6-10 and I hope to rate every episode 8-9 this season too. I do see potential in this change of management and hope that more series will be made after this one ends. Penolopi is back! Let the magic commence.. You will not leave this show when we all love you! And the other characters of course except for the killers.. We don't like you at all.,/review/rw4046885/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2018,rillau,," Without Hotch, the show suffers
","Hotchner is the legal mind, and the one to keep everything together. The show now suffers without him. ""Wheels up in 30,"" just doesn't sound the same coming from others. Don't get me wrong, I like the other characters, but Hotch was the glue. Egos need to let it go and do what is right not what you can do to throw the playground tantrum to get what you want. No respect for people with money using that as a means of getting their way...childish!!! Hotch started on this show and his character was the most interesting. He needs to be back on the show or I feel the show is going to reach a slow demise.",/review/rw4046885/?ref_=tt_urv
