25 July 2019,bkoganbing,6," Meet The Russos
","Blossom was the name of the youngest sibling of the Russo family played by
Mayim Bialik. Puberty had kicked in with her, but she was a smart kid. She also
had a best friend played by Jenna Van Oy who would lead her astray, but never
too far.",/review/rw8463302/?ref_=tt_urv

11 November 2001,mathhater4life,," This and Full House every weekday
","I am only 15, so I don't really remember this show when it originally aired. But a few years ago (I was maybe ten) they used to play it every week day after I got home from school. I started watching it and soon it was just a daily habbit I couldn't break. Although, the fashions & some of the antics are completely outdated..whenever I see it it brings back good memories. This and Full House every weekday...and they were shows that made me feel happy.",/review/rw8463302/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2001,famousgir1,," This Is Such A Classic Show!
","Blossom is definitely a classic show, which will be remembered forever by all those who watched it. The show is about teenager Blossom Russo, played brilliantly by Mayim Bialik. She lives with her father, Nick (Ted Wass.) and her two brothers, Joey (Cute Joey Lawrence.) and Anthony. (Michael Stoyanov.) and has a boy crazy 'chatterbox' best friend, Six. ( Jenna von OÃ¿.) The show follows Blossom's life, with her ups and downs, her boyfriends and of course, her family life and much more. There's a great cast in the show, including, the special guests that have appeared. I love the theme song to the show too. It's really great. One more mention to the brilliant Mayim Bialik, who is a fantastic actress. (And, has a GREAT great sense too.) I hope to see more of her in the future. Blossom is an award winning 10/10 show.",/review/rw8463302/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2002,louisemcmahon,," i loved this show!
",i discovered blossom when i was at home years ago off sick from school and ever since i was hooked!  I loved the character of her brother joey. he always made me crack up just because he was so dumb! i also really liked the character vinnie in show (purely because of his good looks!!) i'm surprised that most of the people i talk to either dont like the show or havent even heard of it!  I love it and still watch the re runs whenever they were on.,/review/rw8463302/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2005,analyst12,," Striking in its day
","Here's the short version: though it looked like many of its contemporaries (such as Full House and Family Matters), Blossom got to tackle several groundbreaking issues, which is ultimately what defined the show as a series.",/review/rw8463302/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 1999,canto-3,," I really adore this one!!!
","I must to say. This show is one of the best shows ever done. The actors are amazing and the histories are excellent. The characters are very well developed through the show, and each episode is best than the other.",/review/rw8463302/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2006,Gacrux,10," Quite possible the greatest achievement in the history of mankind
","If aliens landed on planet earth I would give them four things to help them understand humanity: #1- Marcel Proust's ""Ã€ la recherche du temps perdu."" #2- Beethoven's ""Symphony No. 9 in D minor, opus 125."" #3- Da Vinci's ""The Last Supper."" #4- The complete series of NBC's ""Blossom."" Now why would I say such a thing. To provoke a strong reaction or elicit a chuckle? That is but 10% of the reason why. This is a criminally underrated show. The dialogue took your average sitcom to the intellectual woodshed and the fantasy conversations gave it a whuppin' with the leather strap of self-referential meta-fantasy. We are not dealing with simple characters here. We are dealing with Jungian archetypes taken to a depth that most people can't understand. Joey is perhaps the greatest example of ""Puer Aeternus"" I've ever seen in my lifetime. And his ""whoa."" Whoa. It's existential. Like ""if a tree falls in the woods..."" The answer is ""Whoa."" If you want challenging TV drama I suggest you delve into the labyrinthine complexities of the world we privileged few know as... ""Blossom.""",/review/rw8463302/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2004,amanda_adams122000,," One of the best sit-coms of the 90's
","It was not only funny, but a lot of the situations that Blossom went through was what I experienced as a teenager growing up and therefore I could relate to. It had a positive message in educating young people about issues such as alcohol, drugs and teenage pregnancy. It also showed what it's like for a single father to raise three children and his fear for the dates that his daughter brings home and above all how to overcome their problems as a family unit. Many stars fade out past their teens, but Joey Lawrence's career has esculated further as a result of Blossom's success so it couldn't been all that bad for him, playing a complete dimwit.",/review/rw8463302/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2008,jmarieinca,9," One of my all time favorite TV shows
","I loved this show because I was a teenager at the time and now in my 20's I still love it because it brings back memories. Looking back now, I related to Blossom's situations and I have/had a huge crush on Joey Lawrence, especially when he blossomed! This show has good values, and is family oriented. I also like the guest stars on, but I don't know names, their faces look familiar. I especially like the Paris episodes when Blossom goes to try find her mother and the Beach Blossom Party episodes - they stand out the most to me. I think his Joey' real-life brothers are on one of the episodes, too. I wish this TV show lasted longer, at least until '96, this show is a blast to watch over again.",/review/rw8463302/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2003,swedensm,," A good mother/daughter show.
","Blossom wasn't supposed to be ""MacBeth"". Okay, there was a lot of fluff and silliness in the show -- sometimes embarrassingly so. But I had three teenage daughters during it's run and the show opened a lot of opportunity for us to talk about important things.",/review/rw8463302/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2006,Petey-10,," Wow!
","Blossom Russo's (Mayim Bialik) mother has left the family.She has to share the house with men, the father Nick (Ted Wass) and two brothers, a recovering drug addict Tony (Michael Stoyanov) and the dummy Joey (Joey Lawrence).Her best friend is Six (Jenna von OÃ¿), who could talk incredibly fast.A boyfriend for a couple of years was Vinnie (David Lascher).Carol (Finola Hughes) became Nick's love interest and she had a daughter called Kennedy (Courtney Chase).Barnard Hughes was the granddad Buzz Richman.Blossom ran in the years 1991-1995 with a spectacular cast.Mayim Bialik was born for the role of Blossom.The show was pretty darn funny but it also dealt with dramatic subjects.It did it with style.I became a huge fan of the show in the mid 90's.It's a shame they haven't showed it here in about ten years.I sure do miss it.",/review/rw8463302/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2002,yonko,," Terrible!
","This show was horrible! I can't believe they actually show reruns of this pathetic show. Whatever happened to reruns of What's Happening? Blossom wasn't funny, it was corny, and it had terrible plot. Yes, folks, this show was even worse than Full House. This show belongs in the sitcom grave yard. I used to pray for this show to get cancelled.",/review/rw8463302/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2014,RavenGlamDVDCollector,8," blooming cute
","This is cute, it is like so cute. Before I go on, be advised my review is simply based on just having seen the 1990 pilot episode, and the 1991 first episode (which is quite confusing, what with the cast change / whole set-up change)",/review/rw8463302/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2022,tiffanyhuggins-58151,9," Love this show!
","I actually just discovered ""Blossom"" for myself a couple weeks ago. I guess I'd heard it referenced before on other TV shows and I knew that Miss Amy Farah Fowler from Big Bang Theory (another favorite show of mine) actually played the role of ""Blossom"" herself. So I finally decided to give it a watch. I didn't think I would like it because I honestly don't care for 90's TV and movies much at all, with the exception of Friends. Boy was I wrong! I absolutely adore this show! I binged all 5 seasons in a week and am currently re-watching season 1. This show transcends the time period in my opinionation ðŸ˜‰ even though the clothes and a few catch phrases do give the time period away every now and then, but I don't mind with this show. It's really great and highly underrated.",/review/rw8463302/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2002,insomniac-rod,," not bad...
","I've been watching the re-runs of ""Blossom"", and I feel guilty because I like it. This show has good acting, kind of funny plots, and a beautiful and skilled lead .. uhm, actress. Watch ""Blossom"" if you don't have anything else to do.",/review/rw8463302/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2000,cupcakeX,," Up there in re-run heaven
","From the absolutely non-catchy theme song to the interesting assortment of characters (a druggie, a moron, another moron that wants to sleep with the first moron, etc..) to the lame storylines (Will Blossom have sex? was the topic of at least 10 episodes) Blossom never ceased to underachieve. The Russo's were like the Cosby's except for being less funny and in more need of therapy.  Mr. Russo always went on about his dead wife and Joey Lawrence became the main character by default because the other characters were uber-Urkels. It was a sign of its times.  Blossom, while credit is given for creativity, often wore what looked like scraps from the fabric store stapled together for the maximum defect.  I see it on re-runs every now and then but why? Maybe if you want to see why NBC was always suffering low ratings in the years before ""Friends"" and ""Seinfeld.""",/review/rw8463302/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2005,ladies_pinch,," I love this show!
","This show was and still is really, really funny so many people give it bad reviews saying how it wasn't funny and was corny! Sure it was a little corny but that was part of its charm! I mean all sitcoms are a little corny even really successful sitcoms like friends ad will and grace are corny every now and again! I never really watched it when it first aired seeing as that was in 1991 (and i was a baby!!!!) But i watched it on British channels as i got older and i really loved it! Even though it was a little dated by the time i saw it, it didn't matter it was till funny! I saw it ages ago on Nickelodeon but its off the air for now!!! Put it back on Nickelodeon!!!!!! Even though it was called 'Blossom' Joey was really the star of the show! Even though he played a really dumb character, but he was so funny and so hot! I even say his catch phrase 'WHOA!' Any way i miss the show and can't wait to some British channel puts it back in the air ! (HINT HINT NICKELODEON!!!)",/review/rw8463302/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2003,adavis,," Wouldn't even last a full season in this day age
","If this show was created today the major networks wouldn't touch it. It would be another horrible WB sitcom that runs a season or two. When they came out with the list of 50 worst shows of all time this show should have been on it. Around this time producers were obsessed with making Mayim Bialik a major star, because of her 10 minute role in the movie Beaches. A real sign that this show wasn't as popular as the E network and Entertainment Tonight made it out to be was when they made a TV movie and it placed in the bottom 5. Another sign was the actors have not done much since the show ended. Joey Lawrence's new show only ran 2 seasons and I just saw Bialik for the first time in while on 7th heaven. In late 80's and early 90's the theme for sitcoms was to be really sappy and luckily that has changed.",/review/rw8463302/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2009,jhu262,9," Great show
","well Mayim Bialik went back to school and got her PhD in neuroscience at Yale or Harvard she was accepted at both, she hasn't done too badly I hear she getting back to acting slowly she is a very Bright Young Lady joey Lawrence is still acting but with not much success but he was very good on Blossom as was Ted Wass and the girl who played Six. This show was thought provoking and had dealt with serious issues I think it was a very good writing show I'm glad it has finally been released on DVD way over due i hope they release the rest of the series soon They need more shows like this that are well written and acted And less of Hanna Montana and Disney",/review/rw8463302/?ref_=tt_urv

","I've watched this so many times times over the years, and it never gets old. I always enjoyed Blossom, especially in this day and age where the world is so different from how it was 30+ years ago, Blossom gives that early 90's vibe which just feels so nostalgic yet so amazing. The show itself is extremely underrated, and really hilarious. I highly recommend this show, absolutely love it!",/review/rw8463302/?ref_=tt_urv
