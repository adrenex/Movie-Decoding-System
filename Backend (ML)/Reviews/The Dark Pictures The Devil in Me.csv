29 June 2005,hu675,8," More for the Fans of Rowan Atkinson.
","A clumsy daydreamer by the name of Johnny English (Rowan Atkinson), who works for the Secret Spy Agency. When all the British Top Spies are killed, they asked Johnny to take over the case to investigate a mysterious rich evil french man by the name of Pascal Sauvage (John Malkovich). Johnny's only help is from his loyal partner (Ben Miller) and a beautiful, mysterious spy woman (Natalie Imbruglia) could help bring Sauvage to Justice.",/review/rw0984274/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2004,claudio_carvalho,7," A Very Funny Parody of 007 Movies
","Johnny English (Rowan Atkinson) is a bureaucratic employee of the British Secret Service, who dreams to be a charming agent. His dreams come true when all the British agents die, due to the lack of security in a funeral where he was the responsible. Johnny English, with the support of his assistant Bough (Ben Miller) and Lorna Campbell (Natalie Imbruglia), fights against the evil Pascal Sauvage (John Malkovitch), a powerful French who wants to be the king of the United Kingdom and transforms England in a great prison for all criminals of the world. This silly story is a very funny parody of 007 movies. Rowan Atkinson is very hilarious, as usual, and it is impossible not laughing with his stupidities. The singer Natalie Imbruglia is very beautiful, the unknown Ben Miller is the efficient assistant of Johnny English, and John Malkovitch, with a ridiculous French accent, complete the funny cast of this comedy. My vote is seven.",/review/rw0984274/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Good
","I'm sorry I just can't dislike movies with Rowan Atkinson, he always makes me laugh no matter how bad the script is. If you're not a Rowan Atkinson fan you will probably be bored.",/review/rw0984274/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2006,BJJManchester,7," Patchy but likable Spy Spoof
","The talented Rowan Atkinson expands his character from a series of TV adverts shown in the UK in the late 1990's onto the big screen.So does the transfer from two-minute sketches adapt successfully into feature-length narrative? The answer surprisingly is quite well,although the film does have flat spots and gags that somewhat misfire.The plot and incidents that take place are an obvious mixture and borrowing from the NAKED GUN and AUSTIN POWERS series of parodies,but what is refreshing is that the character of Johnny English is mostly free of the occasional mugging that was witnessed in the above films,and also Atkinson's MR BEAN creation,which was of course wordless but did sometimes engage in some rather messy slapstick.There is some messy slapstick here,but Atkinson's interpretation is closer to his greatest comic character of Edmund BLACKADDER,with his sometimes cynical and sarcastic tone,though he has traits of bumbling incompetence like Mr.Bean,though not total idiocy which makes English more sympathetic.A lower budget than the AUSTIN POWERS series means there are fewer elaborate set pieces,but some scenes work very well and there are some witty exchanges of dialogue.There's decent support from Natalie Imbruglia,Ben Miller and Tim Pigott-Smith,but John Malkovich is the most amusing as the villain with his cod French accent.It is encouraging to see a comedy which underplays it's scenes these days,rather than performers shouting and screaming in a desperate bid to force laughter out of an audience.That said,some scenes in the film don't always come off,perhaps because they are understated too much,but the best bits are very funny(especially the final scenes)and further sequels with this character would be most welcome.",/review/rw0984274/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2020,briancham1994,8," Outrageously funny
","This film has a lot of physical comedy that works on a basic level, just like the famous Mr. Bean series. All of these skits made my grandmother chuckle even though she does not know English, which is a good sign. Rowan Atkinson makes the plot come to life.",/review/rw0984274/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2007,Dingataca,," Classic comedy!
","Silly as hell, but funny as anything! Rowan Atkinson once again shows the world his talents - impeccable comic timing, style, a little bit of cheekiness, and superb acting. This movie is a personal favourite of mine, and I reckon it is perfect to watch anytime you feel low or need some cheering up. The man who brought you Bean (1997), now brings you Johnny English, a parody of James Bond. I loved Bean, and I love this one just as much, if not more. Ignore the pathetic critics that rate this as crap, because it most certainly isn't. It is a piece of comedy that you will not regret seeing - I recommend this to anyone. Heck, even my grandmother liked it! (And that's saying something) ",/review/rw0984274/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2005,benjajamim,10," I can't stop laughing...
","Allthought I wouldn't rate it as a well thought artistic piece of art in the cultural aspect (such as a Kubrick movie, for example) Johnny Enlighs is probably the funniest movie I've ever seen. If you are in the mood for a good laugh out of a not 100% stupid movie, then, only then, its a must see. I saw it a year ago and I still remember Johnny's face and actions. I must admit that really stupid movies make me sometimes angry, this is not that kind of movie that has no sense at all, it has a clear setting, and a great cast (perfect cast if you're talking about Johnny's selection). Probably better than the Mr. Beans, ""Johnny English"" is a must see for those who laugh easily. Another very important hint: don't watch it alone. Watch it with someone who makes you laugh. The last hint: if you don't laugh, probably BlockbusterÂ® gave you ""Lost Highway"" instead of ""Johnny English"", a pretty uncommon mistake.",/review/rw0984274/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2003,PlanecrazyIkarus,," Yet another movie that would have been better off without a trailer
","Johnny English starts off a little bit like Bean: For some reason, wildly constructed, Rowan Atkinson ends up in a position that is far beyond his capabilities. Where Bean turns from Museum Guard to Museum curator impersonator, Johnny English turns from male Monneypenny-alike mission planner to James Bond replacement.",/review/rw0984274/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2009,TheLittleSongbird,6," Patchy it is, but surprisingly enjoyable
","I will say that Johnny English is patchy, but it is enjoyable, and there are some very funny moments. To anyone who hasn't seen the movie, I will warn you, don't expect too much from the screenplay, it is very simplistic, and the plot is predictable. And the whole film is very, very daft, and I can't count the number of scenes that I deem as extremely silly. I do think the Coronation Scene is hilarious though. There are some nice locations, some good effects, and a number of funny scenes. The acting is not Oscar-worthy, but everyone seems to be enjoying themselves. Natalie Imbruglia looks gorgeous, and does do well. Tim Piggott-Smith and Oliver Ford-Davies have little to do, but they do shine in the few scenes they are in. John Malkovich hams it up to a tee as the villain of the piece Pascal Sauvage, but holding the film together is Rowan Atkinson in a rather unsophisticated but fun role of Johnny English, and he breathes life into a film that could have been embarrassing and forgettable, but his sheer entertainment value makes it worth seeing. All in all, unassuming and definitely not Oscar worthy but not a bad film by all means. 6/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw0984274/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2006,ccthemovieman-1,6," Lightweight Bond Spoof
","This James Bond spoof, headed by British comedian Rowan Atkinson, was okay....a fair amount of laughs but not enough to add this film to my collection. Atkinson reminded me a bit of Benny Hill, a more famous English comedian who also doesn't speak much but lets his actions and facial expressions garner his laughs. Both are likable guys.",/review/rw0984274/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2003,filmfreak-5,," Nothing but Mr.Bean with lines..
","Hmm....what can be said about this film? I was amused many places, but the plotlines were so predictable you could tell all the things meant to be funny was about to happen, way before the climax of the amusement took place...sad, very sad....Johnny English is a strange character - he has his moments where he seems a little intelligent and he has a big talent for coming up with excuses, but apart from that, he is immensely stupid - stupid to a point where the fun stops. I know Rowan Atkinson spoke out that English was completely new character of his, but it is NOT - take Mr. Bean, add speaking lines and you've more or less got Johnny English. If he HAD to repeat his old characters, I would much rather see an agent of the Edmund Blackadder caliber! THERE would be something to have fun with!",/review/rw0984274/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2003,Spleen,," It's certainly not a great movie, but to say it's vastly superior to the Austin Powers series is to pay it too small a compliment.
","It's not just that the jokes are funnier (there's one explicit poo joke, which is one too many, but still: it's just the one) or that Rowan Atkinson is a far better performer than Mike Myers, or anything comparatively trivial like that. No. The real difference is that ""Johnny English"" has its heart in the right place. Part of this difference is the fact that it has a heart at all.",/review/rw0984274/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2007,mjw2305,7," It's damn silly, like it should be!
","After Johnny English (Rowan Atkinson) is put in charge of security at a gathering for all the British secret agents, things go badly wrong and he is suddenly the last of his profession left alive. When the crown jewels are mysteriously stolen, he and his sidekick, Bough (Ben Miller) must investigate. The prime suspects are the French entrepreneur (John Malkovich) and the beautiful Lorna Campbell (Natalie Imbruglia), he must find the guilty party and save the nation's pride.",/review/rw0984274/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2019,Hey_Sweden,7," No comedy classic, but quite agreeable nevertheless.
","Veteran comedy star Rowan Atkinson is in very fine form here in the title role, a bumbling office functionary with the espionage organization MI7. He becomes the unlikely hero who must take on a wily French villain named Sauvage (John Malkovich). But he won't have to go it alone: he has a sidekick named Bough (Ben Miller) and a sexy mystery woman (singing star Natalie Imbruglia) who keeps turning up. Sauvage and his minions manage to pull off the theft of the Crown Jewels, but naturally they're not going to stop there; Sauvage has a loftier ambition in mind.",/review/rw0984274/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2003,DarrylEvans2,10," Very painful - I laughed so much!
","Well, I think my One Line Summary says it all really. Johnny English is one of the best British Modern Comedies to be made in a long time. While not very original, the movie takes the material that made Mr. Bean and James Bond so good, and combined them into a 90 minute comedy that never once fails to impress.",/review/rw0984274/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2022,georgedarwell,7," A Great Mr Bean James Bond Parody

30 August 2003,michaelchenma,," surprisingly funny
","I wasn't a big fan of Rowan Atkinson and didn't have a lot of expectation out of this film, but it really cracked me up. First of all, you need to understand ""Johnny English"" is not a British version of ""Austin Power"". I found ""A.P"" ridiculous in general and didn't always appreciate their jokes. But Johnny English is one of those better made spy topic comedian films.",/review/rw0984274/?ref_=tt_urv

23 March 2021,kosmasp,7," The best since Inspector Clouseau
","Anyone aware of the Pink Panther movies is aware that I am being glib here.

2 September 2003,jantoniou,," Some fun, some dull
","This is one of those movies peppered with those occasional gut-busting scenes that we have come to expect with a comic actor on the order of Atkinson, but is substantially more full of a lot of disposable humor in the form of English's bumbling; for example, going to the wrong building, going up the ""poop shoot,"" Sauvage's coronation (which is probably the best/worst example of this) etc.  It comes across as strained and ultimately worthless for comic effect.  I despise the kind of humor that is stretched much too far to be funny.  It is so telegraphed that mid-way through the movie you can invariably anticipate exactly WHAT he is bumbling into and whatever vague humor it had is butchered.  It becomes excruciating. ",/review/rw0984274/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2003,Gideon40,10," Great spy spoof
","Johnny English is a great comedy that makes fun of virtually every aspect of super spy thrillers, from the car to the female secret agent who eventually falls in love with the protagonist. The movie concocts a ludicrous plot as a vehicle for the gags that will ensue, and it integrates these gags into the plot quite well. They got the right man for the job, too. Rowan Atkinson is excellent at portraying the completely incompetent Johnny English, who's sidekick, Boff is actually a better agent than he is. Yes I know, the whole sidekick-better-than-hero thing has been used before, but without Boff, the plot probably would have never advanced because English fumbles literally EVERYTHING he does on assignment. So Boff is to just move the film along while English's job in this film is to provide the laughter.",/review/rw0984274/?ref_=tt_urv
