23 August 2003,grendelkhan,," Not the truth, but still inspiring.
","Make no mistake, Cool Runnings is not the true story of the Jamaican Bobsled team.  It is inspired by it, but this is not a documentary.  Still, despite that, it does capture the spirit of the team and the derision they faced. In a fun and entertaining way, the filmmakers displayed the true lesson of the team:  if you have a dream, go after it, no matter what anyone else says.",/review/rw2198329/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's probably a word game that has been used many times before, but ""Cool Runnings"" is a very 'cool' movie that offered me a lot of fun and laughter. And since this is a comedy and not a documentary, that's all I'm asking of this movie.",/review/rw2198329/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2004,Okonh0wp,7," Pretty fun sports movie
","This one of those family-oriented sports movies that I have fond memories of from my elementary school days. Off the top of my head, I can name The Air Up There, Iron Will, and the Mighty Ducks in this category as well. They weren't masterpieces, per se, but they were pleasant, fun, and sometimes inspirational. ",/review/rw2198329/?ref_=tt_urv

",One of John Candy's best movies.  An excellent cast makes this a real feel good film telling the story of the first Jamaican bobsled team and their efforts to overcome the prejudices of a previous all white sport.  You'll enjoy every minute of this flick and have a better understanding of what it takes to join the Olympic movement.  For the entire family.,/review/rw2198329/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2003,cobram-1,10," Feel the rhythm, feel the rhyme, get on up, it's bobsled time.
","Just saw this movie again on HBO, haven't seen it in almost a decade, and was surprised at how much slipped by me the first time. It's only sad point is to be reminded of what a loss we movie lovers suffered with the death of John Candy. Imagine what he could have done with a little more time on this mortal coil. This movie is uplifting; it's about the human spirit, its strengths and weaknesses. It explores the parent-child conflict, superstition, ambition, love, hate, patriotism and a gamut of other themes. The story telling is good, the camaraderie authentic, and the celebration of life inspiring. Follow your dreams, wherever they may lead you. When things seem impossible, just remember that there's a Jamaican bobsled team.",/review/rw2198329/?ref_=tt_urv

3 July 2005,shrav86,9," Funny, strong and endearing characters
",I remember watching this movie when I was a kid and loving it. It is one of those feel good movies that you think is corny but somehow avoids that label. The characters are funny and endearing. John Candy balances the broken side of his character along with the inspirational side of his character very believably. Doug E Doug has some hilarious dialogs. You feel yourself rooting for the team with more feeling than you expect. The director does well by not focusing on the racial aspect of the movie and converting it to just another movie of black vs. white. Obviously you cannot expect any brilliant acting or movie making but all in all this movie is a must see for families. Four Jamaicans in a bob sled is more entertaining than it looks.,/review/rw2198329/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2004,rossrobinson,10," fantastic
","I think cool runnings is a fantastic movie, since this movie was made in 1993, i have grown up with this movie because i enjoyed what i saw that was put into the movie and i thought it was fantastic, the way the actors were with the characters, playing them perfect. My heart goes to John Candy as i heard years ago that he passed away and died froma heart attack. He was such a great actor and had so many fans, besides him doing a great performance in cool runnings, my other favourite movies with him in it have got to be Splash, Home Alone, Uncle Buck, i think those movies are fanastic, the great movies of the 1980's and 1990's i feel as though that these are the favourites for those who liked this movies. I give cool runnings 10 out of 10 because i think it is fantastic. God bless you John and thank you for the great performances you made in the movies you starred in.",/review/rw2198329/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2000,rupie,7," cool movie
","This entertaining movie, based on the true story of the Jamaican Bob Sled Team's (yes, you heard right - Jamaican Bob Sled Team) participation in the 1985 Winter Olympics is a funny film with a warm heart that moves to an inspiring ending. The story, about a group of Jamaican athletes who were prevented from competing as runners and so sought a different (!) venue in order to participate, has many funny moments. The late John Candy, of whom I am no fan, is very good here; his role as the coach with a checkered past calls for some real dramatic work as well as comedy. The team is a very likeable bunch (with varying acting abilities) and the viewer is rooting for them all the way as they demonstrate great courage in snatching their own kind of victory from the jaws of defeat; the ending is a real lump-in-the-throater.",/review/rw2198329/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's 1987 Jamaica. Derice Bannock (Leon) fails to qualify for the Olympics 100-metre dash in Seoul when Junior Bevil (Rawle D. Lewis) falls and trips him and Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba). He is devastated and told to wait for another 4 years. He sees Irving Blitzer (John Candy) in an old photo with his father. Irv is a former medal winner friend of his father who is now a bookie living in Jamaica. He has the idea to start a Jamaican bobsled team with his bumbling push cart friend Sanka Coffie (Doug E. Doug). Along with rich boy Junior, angry Yul, and Irv, they head to the Calgary Winter Olympics. This is simply a fun movie. It's mostly due to the characters and the actors. Doug E. Doug delivers the light hearted humor. There's a real good-nature charm to this movie. It follows a familiar formula.",/review/rw2198329/?ref_=tt_urv

","As inspirational sports dramas & comedies go, ""Cool Runnings"" is quite agreeable. It introduces to us some truly endearing people, and delivers a solid amount of fish-out-of-water chuckles. Ultimately, it may not tell the *true* story, but it does its job so well that this aspect is hardly a quibble. There really is something to be said about its message of following your dreams, and dealing with all of the potential obstacles in your way.",/review/rw2198329/?ref_=tt_urv

31 October 2007,lee_eisenberg,7," Long live Jamaica!
","When I saw ""Cool Runnings"" the first time, I mostly cracked up at the line about drawing a line down the middle of Yul Brynner's head (cut me some slack; I was nine years old). Nowadays, I understand that the movie did focus on a real story and so at least had that value. While it was silly at times and did try to pull at emotions at times, I still consider it a pretty admirable movie. John Candy (who would have turned 57 today) plays one of his slightly more serious roles as the Jamaican bobsled team's manager; I always say that these movies show what we lost when he died. But among other things, I just like to see Jamaica. I mean, the country that gave us calypso and reggae also had a bobsled team! All in all, a pretty good movie.",/review/rw2198329/?ref_=tt_urv

","Cool Runnings is loosely based upon the actual Jamaican bobsled team that competed in the '88 Olympics in Calgary, Canada. It is an inspiring story about a small country with no ice to speak of qualifying for the Olympics in bobsledding. In this dramatization, not only did they have environmental challenges, they had many other challenges as well. ",/review/rw2198329/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 1999,HouseofMogh,10," Plea to recognize this film, man!
","This is a very underappreciated and little known movie. I give it a ten or a 9.5 though. It is great. It's a true story about the Jamaican bobsled team (how ironic). But unlike all the other sports stories where the team always kicks but in a glorious win, this is different. It also is fun to watch because of the Jamaican dudes speaking like surfers and saying ""man"" all the time. So, see this movie. Vote for it and try to get it onto the top 250.",/review/rw2198329/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Cool Runnings"" is one of my favorite movies. I watch this movie a lot. It makes me laugh. I think it is one of John Candy's best performances. The story is amazing and unthinkable. Some true story movies can end up being really bad, but ""Cool Runnings"" is a great success. During the final run down the track, a moment is displayed where the director knows to turn off the funny, and let the movie become serious. That is an awesome moment. I will continue to enjoy this movie for many years to come.",/review/rw2198329/?ref_=tt_urv

","The screenplay is intelligent, focused and clever. I much enjoyed this film, mostly because of the convincing characters. I am aware of much of the criticism around this movie, claiming it is bad and not worth seeing. To all those who have said these things, I have to ask: What film were you watching? With style, charm, and humor to spare, this film was among the top echelon of movies from 1993. I laughed and was moved and all of that good stuff. At the end of the day, it's a fun, entertaining film. Wonderful movie, and I should know, I practically grew up on it. An excellent and difficult production, bolstered by great performances.",/review/rw2198329/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2014,ironhorse_iv,7," Feel the rhythm! Feel the rhyme! Get on up, its bobsled time! Cool Runnings is a cool movie! No problem, man!
","This underdog sport movie is sure to touch you and lift your spirit. It's nearly a perfect family film. The film is loosely based on a series of true events of the first ever Olympic Jamaican Bobsled Team during the 1988's Calgary Winter Olympic Games. The movie by director Jon Turteltaub takes a lot of creative liberties in the story, recreate a movie infusing enough humor, heart and charm to make this story, very entertaining. The movie tells the story of four Jamaicans athletes, seeking a new way to make their country proud after failing the Olympic tryouts in track & field. All four, find the way in, through an ex-bobsledder named Irving Blitzer (John Candy) whom was banned from the sport, due to cheating. Now, living in shame, in Jamaica, Irving has become an alcoholic has-been. The team enlists his services to be their coach, and soon we find ourselves that maybe Team Jamaica might have a chance to make it to the Olympics, after all. The comedy was funny and enjoyable as each archetype character brings in a lovable trait in that makes it worth watching. First off, there is Derice Bannock (Leon) who dreamt of Olympic grander even if it's takes him losing his Jamaican identify by copying the Swiss team to do it. Then there is Junior Bevil (Rawle Lewis) whom lives under the strict watch of his wealthy father who doesn't wholeheartedly support his Olympic goals as a sub-plot. Third is Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba) who lacks a good education but makes up for that with physical strength and macho attitude. He is often mistaken as a thug. Last person in the team is Sanka Coffie (Doug E. Doug) whom may not be the best athlete of the four, but carries the most heart and pride in being Jamaican. The bobsledders portrayed in the film are fictional, but at less, the movie could had more realistic names for the four characters than naming one out of a pot of coffee, and an old Western actor. It's like naming a fast runner, Usain Bolt. Wait a minute, the last one is really his name. Haha. In the film, the team is formed by Jamaican sprinters after failing to qualify for the 1988 Summer Olympics. In real life, the Jamaican Summer Olympic Trials would have occurred following the Winter Olympics in Calgary. Irving ""Irv"" Blitzer is a fictional character as well; the real team had several trainers, none of whom were connected to any cheating scandal. In the sport of bobsledding, adding weight to the sled is perfectly legal. Both two and four-man sleds have minimum and maximum weights. As of this writing, the character of Irving Blitzer did nothing wrong. John Candy is amazing in the role, and it's sad that he died so soon after this movie. The villains of the film, if you can call them 'villains' are the East German team lead by arrogant leader, Josef (Peter Outerbridge) who treat the Jamaicans with serious scrutiny. Like the cartoony Jamaican stereotypes, the East German portrayal in the film are just outlandish racist. The only thing missing is the pencil thin mustaches for them. In real life, the East German team was very supported to the Jamaican bobsled team. There were somewhat true things about the film that worth noting. They did indeed turned up in Calgary without a sled. The nightclub fight didn't happen, but they almost start a riot there, when their singer got carried away and tried to sing a country song during a fund raiser for the sled. They were disqualified by the Olympic committee, but able to gain appeal. It was because the lack of training and whole thing about not having a sled. Not because cheating. Without spoiling too much of the ending, the events that happen are way different than that in real life, but the crash footage was the real life footage shot that day in 1988. The movie is so sport clichés that it's predictable to watch. The slow-building standing ovation is an example of this cheese formula. The film's depiction of such bobsledders carrying the sled over the line on their shoulders for dramatic effect works. This film in a masterful way shows that what matters is not always the victory but just being there and participating. Throughout the course of the movie we see the team prove to the world through their persistence that they are just as good as any other team, regardless of where they come from. They learn to become a team, learn to take pride in their culture, and do a lot of self-discovery. Even if the film itself, verges on being a bit mushy. Great morals that children will pick up on. There is some mild use of profanity, and few violent, but for the most part, it's worth watching with your children. The humor works, and the soundtrack is perfectly suited to support the mood of the movie. While the film was made by Americans. I think Jamaicans can find this movie, interesting to watch. Without this film; there wouldn't be much of a Jamaican bobsled program. The Jamaican national bobsled team still represents Jamaica in international bobsledding competitions even today. One of the original bobsled team member even won a Gold Medal in the Olympic in 2006 for Canada. International fans would love it for its Olympic source material, and the use of supporting your culture. So ya mon, it's a good movie!",/review/rw2198329/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2010,TheLittleSongbird,8," A little clichéd and predictable, but a well performed and nice Disney feel-good film
","I admit it sports movies are not my thing, but I have enjoyed some, namely Remember the Titans and this. Cool Runnings may be clichéd and predictable in terms of plot, but it is very nice to watch and it is fun. It is often very funny, and heart warming. The film is well filmed and directed, and the bob-sleighing scenes were definitely the best element of the film. They are quite inspirational and guaranteed to have you cheering. Then there are the performances, while I was most impressed with the bob-sleighing I was even more impressed with the spirited performances from the entire cast. The best was John Candy who was both hilarious and endearing, shame that sadly died not long afterwards, he was such a talented actor. In conclusion, nice and fun film. 8/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2198329/?ref_=tt_urv
