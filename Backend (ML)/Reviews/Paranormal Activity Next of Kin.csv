3 June 2010,Tweekums,7," An interesting idea cancelled too soon
","When I saw this series advertised I thought it looked interesting and so it proved to be. In the opening episode everybody in the world suffered a simultaneous black out during which people saw what they would be doing at the same time several months later. The story follows the activities of the FBI office in Los Angeles as one of their agents saw himself in front of a board detailing an investigation into the cause of the blackouts. There is a fairly tangled web of things seen in the future. The agent's wife saw herself with another man who turns out to be involved with a science project that may have caused it, another man sees himself in Afghanistan with his daughter who he believed had died some time before and some people had no flash forwards, which they take to mean they won't be alive then. Having seen the future they must determine whether this is an unavoidable destiny or can their knowledge allow them to change the future.",/review/rw2507923/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2010,silmaril-6,9," don't let it end
","It's a shame if they cancel this show after just one season. It has a lot of potential on long run. Clever and interesting story with ability to last for at least 3 seasons, fine characters and acting (with one exception - although I highly appreciate Joseph Fiennes, I just can't figure out what happened to his acting skills here, he's so artificial, unconvincing and sometimes annoying with his face expressions?!) Not the best show on the Earth (there's no best show on the Earth if you ask me;) but better than many more that last for years. They should give this one better chance, I'm still confused about really big break at the end of 2009, I don't think it did this show any good. Overall 8.5 and I really hope they'll change their mind and let us enjoy at least season 2",/review/rw2507923/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2017,gridoon2023,8," Gripping, intelligent and compulsively watchable - unbelievable that it didn't get a second season
","Start with an intriguing premise, explore its philosophical implications and sci-fi paradoxes (is it possible to change the future or are our efforts to change it already part of it? do people see things as they happen, or do they make them happen because they see them?), add a pinch of quantum physics (does observation shape reality?), sprinkle with action, humor, romance, drama, twists and conspiracy theories, and you get this gripping, compulsively watchable show. It has 22 episodes, but it never feels like it's grinding its wheels; if anything, it needed more. Well-acted by all, with Courtney B. Vance the standout with his quietly commanding voice. It boggles the mind that it didn't get a second season - the executives shut it down at its prime. *** out of 4.",/review/rw2507923/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2010,dmny92,8," Excellent, too bad ABC killed it too early
","I wasn't expecting much from it at the beginning, but it turned out to be great. Good story, enough mystery to keep you interested, good performances.",/review/rw2507923/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2018,samanthacato,8," Even in 2018, I Still Feel Robbed...
",I have just revisited watching Flashforward and I still feel robbed. Characters were still in the middle of developing. Storyline still had the potential to evolve. And we are left with an amazing cliffhanger at the end of the first and only season. Too much time has passed and I feel using the original cast would be asking too much but surely devoted viewers who love this genre of program deserve some form of closure. I think it's time for someone to pick up the mantle. I wonder is was man enough to do the job. Bring back Flashforward.,/review/rw2507923/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2009,johnnymacbest,9," The pilot episode and the overall concept alone has got me hooked.
","Wow. Who would've thought that in the history of TV, a show such as Flash-Forward, a sci-fi show of all things TV, knocks ""Survivor"" off the top spot in the ratings!! Amazing. People are finally getting a show that clicks with viewers amidst the sea of chaos of soulless Reality/Gameshow crap of today's airwaves with such an impact of drama and mystery-tinged bravado with exceptionally good acting performances from Joseph Fiennes and Courtney B. Vance. David S Goyer of BB and The Dark Knight lens his pen to ensure that the series is both epic and captivating and it's because of this that I'm hooked. The female leads are not bad either but could use a bit of polish that's bound to improve in future episodes. But on top of all this is the show's concept which is really cool and has me anxious to see the next episode. Some may complain about the slow build up but I'm glad for it because it lets the audience become acquainted with the characters and their experiences during a worldwide cataclysmic event and the plot moves at a steady pace without leaving too much out of the main story. It's a little rough around the edges but I say here's to ABC for delivering a intriguing and exciting piece of TV that has yet to reveal itself in a grand and spectacular fashion.",/review/rw2507923/?ref_=tt_urv

1 May 2021,kemms95,10," THIS IS THE BEST SHOW EVER
","Can't believe they canceled this, while other absolute rubbish shows run for ten seasons! What a shame!!!!! Great actors and unbelievable plot. I watched this even though I knew it was a cliffhanger ending and there were no more seasons, which I have never done before. And I have never written a review either, but this show deserves 10+ STARS.",/review/rw2507923/?ref_=tt_urv

29 October 2010,dromasca,7," please bring it back!
","It's for the second time that one of my favorite science-fiction series is canceled after the first season. Luckily it happens once every 15 years. Last time it was 'Earth 2', a space travel saga on an alternate Earth world which was not too happy to receive visitors. This time it's 'FlashForward', one of the fest of the few science fiction TV series that were left last year on screens, of course, excluding Lost which is also over and was in a league of its own.",/review/rw2507923/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2010,sina765,," Shocked to see FlashForward being canceled... One of the Best shows ever
","I really liked the show and actually I thought it could be a replacement for LOST... I think FlashForward had a great storyline and it could become one of those famous TV shows if people had supported it a little... when I found out that it is canceled I was shocked and surprised to see such a perfect show canceled. I am really frustrated. I just want to say that I am really sorry for American audience who are only interested in black and white... Little Gray makes thing interesting and adventurous... How come you like TV shows like GLEE, ONE TREE HILL which have very boring and lame story line but not TV shows such as FlashForward which got a little mystery in it... I hope you change this attitude and be little more supportive of these shows which lots of efforts and time are spent... U SHOULD BE ASHAMED ....",/review/rw2507923/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2021,roxmewild,8," Great Sci fi concept shame abc lacked forsight!
",I stumbled upon this Sci fi show on Amazon and to be honest I normally won't bother to watch any show that only has 1 season for 2 reasons. Either the show is garbage and so not worth the watch or more upsetting that the show was really good but never given another season!,/review/rw2507923/?ref_=tt_urv

6 March 2014,hellraiser7,8," A peak into tomorrow
","The strange thing to me about the future is we always imagine it but never really see it, it's not until we decide to make it a reality that it's real. This is a show that was a blip that slipped under the radar. This show just has so much and wanted to do so much, it's true the show isn't perfect but for the sum of it's parts I thought it worked.",/review/rw2507923/?ref_=tt_urv

14 October 2013,JezzaN1,9," Excellent TV show, heavily underrated
","I personally, was disappointed that there was not a second (or even third) season to this excellent series. I have always loved texts, be it books, movies, TV series with intriguing and mind bending concepts.. this certainly fits the bill. The entire world blacking out for two minutes and seventeen seconds, seeing their respective futures, and taking actions to ensure / change their future is an intriguing topic, and one that I thought was executed quite well.",/review/rw2507923/?ref_=tt_urv

","Put simply, this show is/was on point. It was gripping and intriguing, full stop. Yeah, sure, there was an episode here, and maybe there, where one can come down on the acting/plot if they REALLY wanted to; but apart from that, this show is fantastic. ",/review/rw2507923/?ref_=tt_urv

29 September 2009,dnlawyer,9," Flash Forward was surprisingly good
","I thought the opening episode was awesome. I try not to go into new shows trying to make comparisons to other shows I've seen. I just try to take in what I'm experiencing there and then and if you do that, I think you'll find Flash Forward's opening episode pretty good. The concept is great and they have a great cast of actors. What I especially liked was the suspense of it all, what everyone ""saw"" themselves doing, who they were with, who they weren't with, and so forth. And lastly, is this a supernatural type of story? A natural disaster or phenomenon of sorts? A deliberate event or experiment? Who knows! The natural fear exhibited by the cast is also fairly realistic, when you place yourself in their shoes. I imagined myself in the same situation... what if you caught a glimpse of yourself 6months into the future? What if you didn't like what you saw? Scary....",/review/rw2507923/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2011,softballchick_st,," i love flashfoward and i miss it
","when i first heard about this show, i questioned on how it would turn out. after the first episode, i was hooked. i could not wait till the next episode because of the suspense that the previous episode had left me with. when i heard that this show was not going to be on again, i questioned why. this show was amazing and there seemed to be nothing wrong. i just don't get it. i wish the show would come back on. it is hard to believe that they left everybody who liked the show questioning what would happen next and then there being no ending. this has been one of my favorite shows to watch and it was the only show i watched on Thursdays. like i said, it was a show that it would take a while for most people to like, but i liked it right away",/review/rw2507923/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2012,rich-stryker,10," Best TV show in years
","I am so engrossed in this program I can't wait to watch the next episode. I really want to blitz the whole series instead of watching ones-and-twos at a time. The characters are OK and the acting is nice but the storyline is what has gripped me from the beginning. Apparently, the show diverges from the actual book thus making it different enough so that you can read and watch without being disappointed. I really appreciate the fact that it is a one season series because that means the same writers are on the show and the whole story can be watched in near relative time to the plot.",/review/rw2507923/?ref_=tt_urv

",what is wrong with these networks why must they cancel every good show it shows a lack of respect for there viewers who do watch the there shows surely this program cant be doing that bad that they can justify cancelling it and in such a way that leaves you with unanswered questions...think i may have to confide my self to reading the book instead. Its almost not worth watching anything because it will just get canceled after a while but yet all the other crap on TV manages to stay on i personally thought it was very good was hooked from the beginning watched the first 10 episodes and have just finished watching the last 12,/review/rw2507923/?ref_=tt_urv
