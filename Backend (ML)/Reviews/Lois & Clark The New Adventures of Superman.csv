22 September 2011,BA_Harrison,8," Sometimes more is more.
","Given the choice, I prefer my action films to be as brutally realistic as possible, but if film-makers are insistent about going down the cartoonish violence route, they might as well go the whole nine yards, as in Shoot 'Em Up, a relentlessly OTT slam-bang actioner that starts out all guns blazing and doesn't call it quits until writer/director Michael Davis has thrown every possible crazy idea he can come up with onto the screen.",/review/rw2432862/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2020,Offworld_Colony,7," A live action cartoon;
","An irreverent send up of action movie cliches that also manages to revel gleefully in them. It's got Clive Owen completely drenched in dedication, its got a bad guy that can't even give a good monologue, its got guns that only need reloading when it's convenient, its got one liners that laugh in the face at the very concept of a one liner.
It's got a dark sense of humour but in the same sort of way that something like South Park does; It's harmless, with creative action and some truly laugh out loud gags.
It's an indie-rock response to the seriousness of Bourne and the veneered ugliness of Bond. It acknowledges the silliness of action with all its love and heart. And post John Wick, I'm thinking it's time for more. Shoot Em Up is the Garth Merenghi pastiche of action rather than the Scary Movie parody. This film is not for everyone but it is for me.",/review/rw2432862/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2008,bob the moo,," Utter nonsense but yet it works as a both a pastiche and tribute to gun-crazy action movies
","Smith is minding his own business when he sees a heavily pregnant woman being pursued by an armed man. He defends her honour and, in the ensuing gun battle, he delivers her child just before she is shot. He flees with the infant but finds that the target is none other than the baby itself. Turning to a lactating prostitute for help, Smith remains a target for an increasing number of killers under the instruction of violent family man and contractor Hertz.",/review/rw2432862/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2019,Tweekums,9," Over the top violence that delivers thrills and laughs aplenty
","As this film opens our protagonist, known only as Smith, is sitting at a bus stop eating a carrot; a heavily pregnant woman runs past pursued by an armed man. Smith goes to her aid. More gunmen turn up and he dispatches them as the woman gives birth. As they flee she is killed and he is left holding the baby. One might think that was the end of his problems but it soon emerges that the killers are targeting the baby! Smith enlists the help of Donna, a prostitute who is lactating, to care for the baby and together they try to escape. Smith uses what few clues he has to figure out why anybody would be so desperate to kill this baby. All the time the killers, led by a man named Hertz seem to be closing in on them leading to numerous shootouts in a variety of locations.",/review/rw2432862/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2007,Duellist,10," Thin on plot, thick on action
","I rated this movie a 10 in the context of other action movies; it's nowhere near a 10 when compared to classics like Casablanca, but in it's genre, it accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do.",/review/rw2432862/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2008,gradyharp,8," If you've got it, Flaunt it!
",SHOOT 'EM UP is well named: this is a whompingly good action movie that is as much parody of its genre as it is a good story. It never for a moment takes itself seriously and it is played by a strong cast of top-drawer actors having a terrific time. Writer/director Michael Davis has found his niche and let's hope their will be more dark comedies that are as much fun to watch as this one.,/review/rw2432862/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2007,Insane Ian,9," Take it for what it is
","Wow. Shoot 'Em Up is exactly what it claims to be. An action movie. Balls to the wall, no holds barred, but nothing more. And that's exactly what you get. Don't go expecting high art...SEU doesn't take itself seriously enough for that. But that's exactly what makes it work. It KNOWS it's over the top, and doesn't try to hide it. Clive Owen's Smith character is the Bugs Bunny to Paul Giamatti's Hurtz Elmer Fudd. The film takes the best cartoon elements, makes them flesh, and still kicks in that over the top craziness. Bad puns that are so bad they're good, action sequences that there just for the sake of having an action sequence, and the wildest sex scene ever...it's amazing. It's the funniest, coolest, most amazing mix of stunts, bad one liners and paper think plot lines.",/review/rw2432862/?ref_=tt_urv

1 April 2009,jotix100,7," Let him eat carrots!
","If spinach makes Popeye stronger, carrots prove to be the source of strength for Mr. Smith, the hero of this highly charged movie of action that never gives the audience a moment to relax! I say that based on what happens on the screen during its 86 minutes running time. This has to be one of the fastest movies in years, bar none.",/review/rw2432862/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2007,unscripted1,8," Gun Porn At Its Best
","I wasn't really sure what to make of this movie before I went to the advanced screening. I heard from a friend of mine at the Chicago Tribune (she's female, and you'll see why that matters in a second) and she said, ""It was so stupid! It was like, BANG BANG BANG, EXPLETIVE EXPLETIVE EXPLETIVE, BANG BANG BANG! Then gallons of blood and we move on."" For some reason, the little boy in me that loved the scene in Predator where all of the soldiers shoot at open woods for a complete minute, got very excited. She wasn't kidding, either, that's just what this movie was. Don't worry about the plot, it's not really a concern. Don't worry about the script either, the lines are so over the top and shallow that you know a man wrote this script without allowing anyone to comment on it.",/review/rw2432862/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2008,dead47548,6," Absurd fun.
","A film that aims to be a parody on the extremeness and over-the-top tendencies of the action genre, and succeeds in becoming entertaining and exhilarating. I doubt there will be a more entertaining piece of work this year. It was so over-the-top and hilarious. Some of it did go a tid bit too far for me (the firefight while jumping out of a plane, the fact that there wasn't a single cop to be found) but all of the wild absurdity combined with an encompassing metal soundtrack and perfectly choreographed action made it one of the funnest movies I've ever seen. The clash of Clive Owen and Paul Giamatti certainly added a great stride to it, with Clive's deadpan hilarity and Giamatti's winning charisma. It's this extravagance and extreme unrealism that makes the film entertaining, but can also be a flaw from time to time. But it is absolutely impossible not to have an uproarious time watching Clive Owen shoot an umbilical cord to separate it from the mother, kill numerous people with a simple carrot, and (in my favorite scene of the film) have raunchy sex with Monica Bellucci whilst laying out an endless supply of armed hit men. Certainly something I could see myself re-watching time and time again.",/review/rw2432862/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2007,joe_momma9,," The most fun you will have at the movies
","As I stated above, this movie is a fun ride. The script was probably written by a 13 year old kid who plays a lot of video games, but that's why it's great. You can just kick back, turn your brain off for 80 minutes, and enjoy. It is the ultimate guy movie. And for the one liners: as cheesy and lame as you could ask for. Shoot Em Up was made to entertain the 20 something action junkie, so if you aren't one, you will no doubt hate this flick. But for the rest of us, who all have that 13 year old immature video gamer still inside, you gotta see it. I think Clive Owen might be the first true action star Hollywood has had in a long time. One other enjoyable feature: great soundtrack. Shootout scene with Motorhead's ""Ace of Spades"" in the background: you can't ask for anything better. I give Shoot Em Up 8 out of 10.",/review/rw2432862/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2020,ma-cortes,7," A wacky and disconcerting action thriller well packed with fun , high body count and violence galore
","An amusing film including thriller, noisy action, punches , and excessive violence with tongue deftly in cheek. This demystified as well as amible action movie deals with a man named Smith : Clive Owen takes care of a baby who he gets during a shootout. He joins forces a beautiful prostitute : Monica Bellucci and both of whom are mercilessly by a suspicious nasty : Paul Guilfoyle . Along the way chases and shootouts take place on and on until the unexpected finale . He isn't name , no past , nothing to lose. It's a better investment than a crib ?.

He follows the couple, kills the man and helps the delivery of the baby in the middle of a shootout while a gang of hit-man tries to shoot them up. The woman is killed but Smith saves the baby, escaping from Hertz (Paul Giamatti), the leader of the killers.

16 February 2009,unbrokenmetal,8," Baby Oliver has a difficult childhood, indeed
","It's astonishing to see that a movie which is so simple can be misunderstood so often. This is not a violent action movie, it is a nihilistic comedy. Best comment I've read here is entitled ""Knowingly Absurd, Self-Consciously Ridiculous"". Hits the nail, umm... carrot on the head. That is not only shown in the over-the-top action scenes, but also in the dialogues when Bellucci asks Owen: ""Is there anything you don't hate?"" or Giamatti's mobile phone always rings when he is - ""sorry, I'm just busy"" - killing someone. Clive Owen is better than ever, a tired pro, explained so little that we don't even find out his character's real name. Just Smith then. Monica Bellucci is over 40 now and perfectly cast as a prostitute whose best days are over but she still is very... motherly. Wouldn't have worked as well with a younger actress. Paul Giamatti is an excellent opponent, a lunatic who thinks killing everyone is the best solution for finding peace. There shouldn't be too many movies like this, because in the end it's a cynical way of filming, and the art of creating characters with a certain depth shouldn't vanish, but once in a while a ride like this is terrific fun and a guilty pleasure. Extra point for the powerful soundtrack courtesy of Motörhead, AC/DC, the underrated Midnight Movies and more.",/review/rw2432862/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2018,bowmanblue,9," Too much fun for words
","I'm lobbying for a new film genre to sit alongside the existing ones such as drama, science-fiction, horror and comedy. The new category I'm proposing would be 'Snakes on a Plane.' Besides the obvious Samuel L Jackson film, this genre should be populated with films that tell you everything you need to know about them from the title, thus giving you everything you need to know about whether or not you will enjoy them without sitting down to watch. 'Shoot 'em Up' falls into the 'Snakes on a Plane' category perfectly.",/review/rw2432862/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2007,george.schmidt,9," What's up Doc? Gleefully over-the-top, tongue-thru-cheek adrenaline pumped ode to the action genre; Owen's vehicle to iconism
","SHOOT 'EM UP (2007) ***1/2 Clive Owen, Paul Giamatti, Monica Bellucci, Stephen McHattie, Ramona Pringle, Greg Byrk. Over-the-top, tongue-thru-cheek action-packed piece of pulp fiction that has no qualms about going the extra yard for ludicrous content with this overstylized, hyperkinetic homage to the genre with laconic every(anti-)hero Smith (Owen at his uber cool best gleefully enjoying every silly, macho moment) getting neck deep in a heinous plot involving the hit assigned to a newborn infant for the nefarious deals of a corrupt politician and the evil Hertz (Giamatti relishing his scuzz-ball villain to the hilt) out to do the dirty deed. Along for the ride is zaftig Amazonian, lactating hooker-with-a-heart- of-gold Donna Quintano (sex goddess Bellucci at her most luscious) in league with her paramour to save the baby at any cost. Relative newcomer filmmaker Michael Davis pulls out all the stops and gets the heart pumping with new fervor even while you're thinking how ridiculous it all seems. Think a Tarantino film meeting a Bugs Bunny Looney Toons cartoon (replete with Smith's carrot munching and original usage as weapons!) A true guilty pleasure for the popcorn crowd.",/review/rw2432862/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2007,badger_gal29,8," Hilarious comedy, unrealistic action
","People who rate this movie poorly obviously do not realize that it is a comedy. If you go into it hoping for awesome action and realistic events, prepare to be disappointed. The entire movie is just completely ridiculous action sequences that not only would never happen but never COULD happen in any possible way. It's as if someone took every action scene that got cut from other action movies for being too outrageous or physically impossible and jammed them all into one movie. That is what makes it so funny! There were scenes with no dialogue that had me rolling with laughter. There aren't any dull moments either with someone getting shot pretty much every 10 seconds. The movie was not what I was expecting, but ended up SO much better. It's just plain fun!",/review/rw2432862/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2007,icebond,10," Simply Awesome. Crank on Steroids
","Lets get one thing out of the way straight away. Shoot em up is easily the most outrageous, the funniest and most balls out Action film ever made. Saying that, its not for everyone. Firstly its silly and calling the events that unfold over the top is a huge understatement. The film doesn't take itself seriously for a second. The action is almost cartoonist in nature and there are at least 5 jaw dropping scenes and by the end of this film you will never look at a carrot the same way. Like I said, its not for everyone, some will love it, others will loathe it. Regardless of which camp you fall in, I think pretty much everyone will agree after seeing this film that the Broccoli family must have been asleep during Clive Owens Bond test screening. This guy has more Bond in his left arm than Daniel Craig in his entire body and the best thing? He doesn't even try, like a certain other Scottish actor you may recall. In fact this review is pretty pointless. This is the only film you'll see Monica Belluci get shagged during a shootout. Enuf said. Go watch it",/review/rw2432862/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2007,fezrok,9," Fantastic Fun
","Think about the title of the movie, because if you don't like that than just stay home. This movie lives up to its name in a fresh, fun and humorous way. Clive Owen is great as Mr. Smith, the coolest action hero I have seen in a long time. Paul Giammatti is witty and surprisingly enjoyable to watch as the bad guy. If you take this film too serious than you will not like it. Yes, it is a ridiculous film filled with non-stop action that would never be humanly possible, babies being thrown around but yet staying protected by the humorous Mr. Smith. This film was so fun and yes over the top, but if you expect anything more you probably will be disappointed. The violence was very extravagant, but what else did you expect from this title? It is the sort of violence that doesn't really bother you in a film. It's flashy and well, it's entertainment. Just like this movie, it was entertaining and I loved it.",/review/rw2432862/?ref_=tt_urv

","Some of the comments left by people on here show just how clueless movie goers can be. As if you can't tell that there's a slight tongue-in-cheek feel to the movie. Doesn't the stupidly high kill count or OTT methods used to kill people make that obvious to you? Does a movie with the title ""Shoot em up"" sound like a serious piece of work?

5 September 2008,Scarecrow-88,8," Shoot 'Em Up
","Basically ""Shoot'Em Up"" is an 80's film using today's modern technology. Replace Arnie or Bruce Willis with Clive Owen and baby in tow and you have this film. Owen's carrot fixation is even put to good use pulling triggers and stabbing the villains in the eyeball or through the mouth and out the back of their necks. See how Owen kills special ops assassins while having sex with ""hooker with a heart of gold"" Monica Belluci(..she even climaxes as he blows one of these heavily equipped villains through a window). There are a great many stunts where Owen is allowed to create on his feet using his artistry with guns. There's a neon sign he uses to tell arch-nemesis Paul Giammati F-U. Just watch how Owen uses his gun to keep his baby protected on a merry-go-round. Or, when he's in a weapons factory, with Owen elaborately creating a method using strings to develop a labyrinthine maze where baddies carrying machine guns fall prey to gun fire when they turn corners(..even if this is the most ludicrous action sequence ever designed, it's a dream come true for action fans). And, the greatest trick of all..pulling off an anti-gun message in such an insanely violent action film! The way the film finds escapes for Owen is a thing of cinematic genius..no matter how many times we roll our eyes at such absolute nonsense.",/review/rw2432862/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2007,Blackace,8," An Action Packed Ride From Start To Finish.
","There was a screening of Shoot 'Em Up during the San Diego ComicCom 07 at the GasLamp Theater. My cousins and I almost didn't get to see it because the nim-witted box office staff decided ticket stubs would be needed to get into the theater even though we had Shoot 'Em Up passes directly from New Line Cinema reps. Because ticket stub holder got in first, we ended up sitting in the top seats of the theater, which turned out to be a blessing. Clive Owen actually attending the screening and sat right behind my cousin. Hehe!! As for the movie, it's one of the best action flicks of the summer. The director wanted to make a John Woo style film and he succeeded with this goal. The gun battles are terrific. Clive Owen plays Mr. Smith. A man in the right place at the wrong time. In the opening scene he watches as a killer chases a pregnant woman into an alley with a gun. Not one to stand and let a woman get killed, he takes action to protect the woman and her baby. What follows is a series of misfortunes and narrow escapes as pieces of the plot are put together. Why was this man trying to kill this woman? What does the baby have to do with this crazed hit-man (play by Paul Giamatti) who's after him? Will Mr. Smith's call girl squeeze DQ (played by Monica Bellucci) help him? All these questions are answered in the movie. Just when you're about to take a breather from the action, it revs up again and takes off. Even though the plot is a little thin, it's unique as well. I'm not going to give any of it away either. The only real downside is the action isn't realistic in some of the scenes. Things happen to perfectly for our hero, whereas in real life he most likely wouldn't have made it to the end of the movie. You know what I'm talking about? The movie is still very fun to view and weighing in at only 90mins, it won't take up your whole afternoon. This is a must see for fans of John Woo and action films. I'm going to see it again with the wife when it gets released in Sept. I rate it 8/10.",/review/rw2432862/?ref_=tt_urv
