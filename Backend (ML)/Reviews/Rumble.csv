13 March 2021,Sir_AmirSyarif,6," Pretty basic but totally harmless and fine and, at times, even moving
","Based on Rhonda Byrne's bestselling self-help book, Andy Tennant's 'The Secret: Dare to Dream' is a basic family drama at its core. It's about as clich√©d as it gets. However, the movie itself is totally harmless and fine and, at times, even moving. And despite telling a story that basically deals with exploring the power of positive thoughts, the writing never gets preachy or overbearing. The performances from Katie Holmes and Josh Lucas are both effective with the rest of the cast also putting in fine performances.",/review/rw5959201/?ref_=tt_urv

2 August 2020,Gordon-11,," A romantic film for grown ups
","It is a romantic film for grown ups. It is not a comedy, but a film about real people and real lives. I enjoyed it.",/review/rw5959201/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2020,emmanuellebarone,8," A feel good movie with some elements of 'The Secret' but not forceful

5 August 2020,sonrisaparatu,10," Just What the World Needs Now
","Such a delight to watch a movie about the law of attraction and the power our thoughts have over the outcome of our lives. I've been a fan of Josh Lucas for a long time, so it was a nice surprise to see him in this film. Katie was good to see too. I pray more see this and embrace the idea that our world can be full of peace and love, if we collectively come together to envision that outcome. It's important to recognize we are all connected and pray for the same love.",/review/rw5959201/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2021,jonclynch,8," Not for cynics!
","Seriously, how cynical and jaded do you have to be to hate this movie so bad you give it less than 5 stars? OK, so it's not a blockbuster and it is predictable, but it gives a spot on message for the times. It's the perfect antidote to the current pandemic age, and a refreshing change to the ultra-violent trash currently filling the minds of our screens today. We enjoyed it as a family without having to worry about anything inappropriate or upsetting. Just enjoy it for what it is- a feelgood movie that encourages us to be better. What's so wrong about that?",/review/rw5959201/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2020,dashingmusic,7," It was really pleasant
","It is really not amazing but it's pleasant and nice. Some movies make u wanna press the fast forward button but u kinda just breeze through the dull moments.
Nice cinematography on some of the scenes and as for The Secret, it's kinda existed in the movie but not forced through.",/review/rw5959201/?ref_=tt_urv

14 August 2020,timeofourlife2012,10," Really good movie!
","I thought the trailer for this looked really good and I always liked Katie Holmes and Josh Lucas but the movie looked really good from the trailer and it did not disappoint. I don't usually rent any movies for $20, but me and my mom really wanted to see it and thought it was worth it and it was! The acting was very good, and I loved the story. It really inspired me too and I just recommend this movie, especially if you may be going through a hard time. It lifted my spirits for sure.",/review/rw5959201/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2021,raynab-82613,8," I enjoyed this movie, would watch with kids
","If you are looking for a good family movie, this is it. It's positive message is a reprieve from what we are hearing in the world right now. Some holier than thou critics find this movie corny but I like feel good movies and I thought this was worth the watch. It's WAY better than watching the news or some other demoralizing movie or show.",/review/rw5959201/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2020,lavatch,8," Two Little Ships Passing in the Night
","""The Secret: Dare to Dream"" is a heartwarming drama that seeks to demonstrate the theme that ""life is a miracle."" The message was only minimally Christian in its orientation, as the focus was on a benign universe always willing to open doors for those perceptive and courageous enough to walk through them to discover genuine happiness.",/review/rw5959201/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2020,dogsdesert,10," We all need a little hope
","Rented this movie on demand. 2020 has been a dump of a year for pretty much everyone, and I'm really feeling it. Albeit a little predictable, this movie was hopeful, and there was a kindness in it that we just haven't seen this year. If you want to watch something that makes you smile, and remind you that good is out there, it's perfect. The actors are great.",/review/rw5959201/?ref_=tt_urv

2 August 2020,paulsamuel-48177,6," Law of Attraction applied ??
","Was waiting for this movie ever since I heard about it. Got to see on the same day it got released.
Being an ardent Secret follower and fan, the law of attraction and the major Secret nuances were very mildly sprinkled or applied overall.
I would say that, this movie was a decent love story with fantastic cinematography, good performance by the all the major actors. The major cons of this movie is the casting which made a great impact. Starting from Katie Holmes, josh and the kids, everyone played their part very well and we could just move into their story.
The background score also needs to be mentioned and went well with the movie. Though the story was straight forward with a predictable climax, never felt bored.
Felt that the law of attraction could be more applied or showcased and depicted in the movie. The impact was very meagre in this and couldn't satiate Secret fans.
But it's a complete family entertainer and could feel the positivity when the movie ends. It was so light and cheerful!!",/review/rw5959201/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2020,TxMike,," Pleasant movie with Holmes and Lucas.
","I'm sort of a kid at heart when I watch a movie filmed in places I have been. A key location in this one is Middendorf's seafood restaurant in Manchac, just north of Laplace where I used to live.",/review/rw5959201/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2020,samanthanmurdoch,8," Feel Good Movie

1 August 2020,habakukofice,4," A tedious romance lifted by a good cast
","I had no idea when I watched it that this was meant to be a sequel, or that it had any mystical implications, because it really is just an empty, Hallmark style, film about a love triangle.",/review/rw5959201/?ref_=tt_urv
