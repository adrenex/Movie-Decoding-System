30 January 2023,gamblor-20245,1," Designed for Shock Value
","Parents and their children are put into scenarios strictly designed for the greatest TV shock value that have little to nothing to do with actual parenting. They're not even real life scenarios that would ever actually happen and don't shown anything except kids acting like kids. Big surprise, they do stupid things and make bad decisions because... they're kids.",/review/rw8851860/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2023,jupitersboba,10," A Show Everyone Should Watch
",I truly enjoy this show. It highlights different parenting styles and how each may have negative and positive aspects. This show brings up really important conversations as well.,/review/rw8851860/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2023,wdzandbn,5," How can you compare when tests are different
",How can you conduct a study/ test when all families are not conducting the same test. There is a huge difference between jump off a high dive with no safety harness vs climbing a rock wall with safety gear. The test has no control to accurately compare. Both tests has a fear of heights but one has to do more with physical ability vs taking a leap of trust. I feel the producers did different test for half the parents because they were afraid to lose ratings then actually conduct a test to compare the different parent techniques. So how can viewers see / difference in talking a kid to jump versus talking a kid to climb a wall?,/review/rw8851860/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2023,katherinemount,2," This should not have been a competition show
","The idea of this show is really clever and could be a seriously helpful tool for future or current parents to bounce ideas and learn possible better child caring practices. HOWEVER, the fault in this show is that not only are the parental styles competing, (even though some are SO similar) but they have the parents judging one another.",/review/rw8851860/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2023,shelleyalevin,5," Kind of ridiculous and unfair
","How can you put a 7-year-old and a 16-year-old through the same challenge and expect it to be a fair comparison? The driving test and the stranger pickup test in particular stand out. Just think of yourself at 7 versus 16, it's beyond apples and oranges. The show is a really interesting concept but the execution is deeply flawed. Among the pro aspects, Ali Wentworth is charming and funny and bright and there is real valuable diversity among the parents and types of families and child raising philosophies. But they need to takes ages of the children into consideration when putting them against each other.",/review/rw8851860/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2023,future-01584,3," Stranger test
","This show is great and I love seeing everyone interact with each other. The problem I have is with the Stranger Test. This test was traumatizing and poorly conducted by network. You put 3 of 4 families in scenarios that they would NOT put their children in. The Wynne family(no disrespect) 'passed' but how would the kids do if they got separated from you in a crowd or a mall or park..maybe the parents should have been able to intervene so kids could see how their parents reacted to a stranger at the door. That should have been the test..not to terrify the kids about strangers in their own home. In your own ways parents you are all raising respectful, knowledgeable and durable lil humans that will be assets to this world!",/review/rw8851860/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,sheed-61588,10," Honest Review
","The show is great and shows you a mixture of parenting styles, good and bad. Parents cannot shield thier kids from everything but they can give them the proper tools to succeed and this is what the show does. I like the fact that they are letting the parents give one another open criticism and challenging each person to become better parents and think about thier choices. I can help add some of the skills off of the show. Some people are real sensitve and don't like to see thier kids struggle and let them quit, watching some of of these parents push thier kids and encouraging them to keep going is something I enjoy watching.",/review/rw8851860/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2023,jhfqbthk,2," seriously flawed structure and leadership Parents 10, producers.,,,get a clue please
","Your blowing it Dr. Brown. Parenting like love is not competitive it is creative. This show uses well intended dedicated parents, for the growth of no one. Most offensive is the premise that trust is only for the immediate nuclear family, that the world is full of predators (Dr. Browns words)and children who trust huggable neighbors have somehow failed. That is an insult to the whole process. Well intended or not, this show is folly. Parenting is collaborative, parents don't compete they share and grow. They all desire the best outcome. I learned in facilitating hundreds of parent seminars that the wisdom in the room is collective not at a podium. Likely this show is in the can already. I challenge you to set aside the ego and bring your A game with a better formatted approach. Anything but a win win process fails children in play. For their sample do better. Please.",/review/rw8851860/?ref_=tt_urv
