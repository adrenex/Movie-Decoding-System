17 March 2017,asifahsankhan,8," Just because you're invited, doesn't mean you're welcome.
","""Get Out"" takes the initial premise of ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" and then twists it with ""The Stepford Wives"" to create a compelling, thoughtful critique of white power. Peele, of course, isn't arguing that white people are out to hypnotise black people. Instead, Get Out is a stinging criticism of the white liberalism that carries itself as empathetic towards blacks, but that empathy only extends as far as white control. Peele isn't taking aim at Neo- Nazis and other whites who would angrily shout the n-word. They're a lost cause. Instead, he's looking at those who profess their lack of racism, but only do so if they can maintain their dominance over black people in the most insidious manner possible. As Chris pointedly notes to Rose at party full of white people, ""Has anyone here ever met a black person that didn't work for them?""",/review/rw3652966/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2018,TheLittleSongbird,9," A more than welcome yet uneasy visit
","'Get Out' was very highly recommended by a friend, also a fellow film enthusiast, and the subject matter of the film really interested me. Add to that a very promising trailer, the award nominations and wins and mostly positive word of mouth (even with the very vocal detractors), and interest was higher.",/review/rw3652966/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2018,Java_Joe,8," Creepy, unsettling and very well done.
","I'll say right off the bat, I didn't really know who Jordan Peele was coming into this movie. I knew he had a show with Keegan-Michael Key and was a comedian of sorts. What I didn't know was that hiding underneath all that was a genuine fan of classic horror just waiting to get out. ",/review/rw3652966/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2017,ramair350,9," Lives up to the hype
",I decided to see this film at the theater after hearing some of the hype (which was basically that it is an excellent horror film that is told from the perspective of a black man).,/review/rw3652966/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2017,Sleepin_Dragon,10," Simply put this film is outstanding
","I think it was watching The Last Blair Witch film that I first saw the trailer for this, and while I enjoyed that film, leaving the Cinema it was my memories of Get Out that I left with, I'm so often disappointed by films, having seen wonderful looking trailers, finally a movie that kills of that thinking.",/review/rw3652966/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2017,Movie_Muse_Reviews,9," A rare triple-threat genre film
","Horror tension, mystery tension and racial tension blend together into a gripping and formidable nail-biter in ""Get Out,"" the astonishing directorial debut of Jordan Peele. The former half of the comedy duo ""Key & Peele"" has found a way to both honor and subvert the thriller and horror genres in a way that's unmistakably modern. ",/review/rw3652966/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2018,Hitchcoc,8," Had Me on the Edge of My Seat
","This is no perfect movie, but it shouldn't be criticized strictly for racism. The fact is that there exists a group of evil people that have developed a way to use kidnapped victims for scientific purposes. Their motivations are really quite personal and self serving. But unless you are willing to accept that this can be done, then it's no movie. Much science fiction is based on things that are impossible. The bad guys seem to be interested in picking on black people for some reason. But the plot says they do. Peele uses black humor (excuse the term but I mean it in the general sense) and manages to get some of his own experiences to tell a story. I thought it was unique, interesting, and entertaining.",/review/rw3652966/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2018,southdavid,7," Smart genre mingling effort.
","As you may guess from the submission date, I'm reviewing ""Get Out"" several months after its cinematic release. Unfortunately, the months of glowing notices have generated an anticipation in me, which no film could possibly have lived up to. ",/review/rw3652966/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2017,SnoopyStyle,8," fresh take on horror
",Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) and Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) have been going out for about 5 months. They go to visit her affluent parents in the country. Her father (Bradley Whitford) insists that they're Obama supporters. Her psychiatrist mother (Catherine Keener) hypnotizes Chris to stop his chain smoking. Her brother Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones) is a douche bag. They have a neighborhood get-together. It starts with some awkward comments. There is something more to the supposed upper-class liberal white social circle.,/review/rw3652966/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2017,Movie_Reviews,8," Thriller seen from fresh eyes
","Fantastic! I would not call it ""horror"" but certainly ""thriller"" with some comedy thrown into it. This Jordan Peele fellow has managed to bring something new to this genre and I certainly hope he'll do more thrillers.",/review/rw3652966/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2017,intelearts,9," 600th Review: As Lingering and Effective As You Would Want It To Be
","Get Out is full of touches and surprises, strong acting, excellent direction, and above it, it's a ride, a trip to a place Hollywood doesn't normally go - it offers a unique experience - and in this age of copycat, cookie cutter safe choice cinema, it stands out by a mile.",/review/rw3652966/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2018,Special-K88,," director Peele takes you on a different kind of journey
","A unique and effective blend of horror film and social commentary if there ever was one! Young black photographer Chris Washington is understandably nervous about going to spend the weekend with the parents of his sweet white girlfriend Rose Armitage-who for reasons unbeknownst to him has yet to tell her parents that he's black. They set out on their trip and...well the rest is really left for the viewer to discover. Writer-director Jordan Peele shows master craftsmanship by taking this simple premise and expanding it in many different directions, incorporating elements of racism, comedy, shock and awe, and wisely never taking things too seriously. The climax is a bit formulaic and over-the-top, but the journey is effectively unnerving and features much stronger acting than you would expect for a film of this genre. Not for everyone, but refreshingly unconventional and worth the viewing experience. ***",/review/rw3652966/?ref_=tt_urv

9 September 2018,areatw,4," Flat, predictable thriller with glaringly obvious plot twists
","'Get Out' is a disappointing and highly overrated movie that fails to meet even the most basic expectations of a horror/thriller. It lacks any real scares, is generally ineffective in its attempts to be creepy, and many of the would-be thrills fall flat due to the fact that the plot is, for the most part, completely predictable with many of the plot 'twists' glaringly obvious.",/review/rw3652966/?ref_=tt_urv

13 December 2017,st-shot,7," Guess Who's Coming to Dinner 2000
","Sidney Poitier would have had his work cut out for him confronting the band of ""enlightened"" upscale Caucasoid suburbanites found in Get Out, a well paced dark comic horror film by Jordan Peele. Expecting a skeptical Tracy and Hepburn the hero goes from Sid to Duane Jones, Ben in Night of the Living Dead instead.",/review/rw3652966/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2017,Brew_Swayne,5," I Don't Get The Hype
","Cookie cutter suspense/thriller/horror flick that isn't very suspenseful or thrilling or scary. The only real change from the norm with this movie is that it features a black man as the lead actor, and early on in the movie it touches on some of the problems of interracial dating from a black man's perspective. I found some humor in the way that the white family (and later their white friends) interacted with the lead character...going out of their way at times to either talk about how they voted for Obama or loved Tiger Woods...basically doing and saying the things that white people say to black people in an attempt to prove they aren't racist.

17 March 2017,christonr-64261,7," Peele-ing Back the Race Curtain
","Jordan Peele's first feature film offers a worryingly bleak reflection of race relations, segregation and stereotyping in what will undoubtedly be one of 2017's most troubling (and terrifying) films. A psychological thriller dressed up as classic horror, the sense of impending doom created right from the off - with an African American man walking through a white suburban neighborhood at night - leaves you with a sense of dread but also numbness; and, to an extent, helpless voyeurism.",/review/rw3652966/?ref_=tt_urv

14 July 2017,Reno-Rangan,7," Now you're in the sunken place!
","Not all the directional debut sees this kind of welcome from the audience. Yeah, Jordan Peele had written and directed it. It is similar to the 90s style mystery-thrillers. Definitely must see for the 90s, 80s guys. It kind of looked like a black comedy, but I guess that's not they had preferred. Especially that teacup scenes and some of the close up shots, that freaks, yet very funny.",/review/rw3652966/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2017,joshbarton15,10," Believe the hype...
","Jordan Peele is a man best known as one half of the comedy duo Key & Peele, so when I first heard the news that he'd written and directed a horror film, I would be lying if I said I wasn't a little surprised. Then came reports that Get Out was getting ridiculously good feedback from test screenings and, after horror having a solid year in 2016, I was hoping it'd live up to expectations. Believe the hype guys because Get Out is as good as you've heard.",/review/rw3652966/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2017,CANpatbuck3664,8," Get Out is a Sleeper Hit for a Reason, it's Creepy, Inventive and Topical
","*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) and Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) are packing to go away for the weekend. They're both a little anxious, she's introducing him to her parents Dean (Bradley Whitford) and Missy (Catherine Keener) and there's some pressure on the event. They've enlisted their friend Rod (LilRel Howery) to watch their dog for the weekend and they head out. Chris is worried how her parents will react to him but Rose sees race as a non-issue and is sure her parents will feel the same way. After a minor incident involving a collision with a deer and a slightly racist encounter with a cop, they finally arrive. To Rose's relief, her parents are courteous but they're interactions with Chris are awkward at best. It doesn't help that the staff are any less friendly, Walter (Marcus Henderson) and Georgina (Betty Gabriel) smile and do their jobs but something is off about them. Chris wakes up in the middle of the night to go have a smoke and he runs into Missy. She's a licensed hypnotist and offers to help cure him of his bad habit. He's reluctant but he more or less consents. What he fails to realize when he's under her care, she has the ability to make him quit more than just his smoking habit.",/review/rw3652966/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2019,EpimetheusA1,9," ""Sink into the floor...""
","This film is definitely a modern classic. Even beneath the films most prominent themes of race and class are some underlying themes of brotherhood and love. It goes without saying that, despite its comedic moments, this film is truly terrifying and there are iconic scenes and characters that will be revered for years to come. Although this film is a lot of fun, especially for a psychological thriller, it's messages are what takes it from a ""good movie"" to an ""all-time classic"".",/review/rw3652966/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2017,drpakmanrains,10," My Kind Of Horror Thriller
","After sitting through two and a third long hours of ""IT"" recently, being bored mostly by the predictable CGI and the usual jolts in today's so called horror films, I just watched ""Get Out"". I wasn't expecting much, as the DVD had 5 mediocre to awful previews. But almost immediately, I became intensely involved by the plot and quality of this film, which mixes social satire and racial issues brilliantly. This is not like most horror films today, but rather more like suspense thrillers as ""The Stepford Wives"", ""the Harvest"", or ""The Tall Man"". The scares are not like jolts, but rather stem from the nervous feeling that kept me glued to the screen, anxious to see what will happen next. I just learned this was the director's first film, though it seemed to have excellent production values and built suspense seamlessly. I love stories where something strange is going on, and the mystery is gradually revealed, like the original ""Invasion Of The Body Snatchers"" or ""Night Of The Living Dead"". For those not looking for gore or shocks, but rather suspense, this should satisfy most of you. But if special effects are your preference, maybe stay away.",/review/rw3652966/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2017,filmtravel101,3," Not worthy of 8 - pretty predictable and boring -
