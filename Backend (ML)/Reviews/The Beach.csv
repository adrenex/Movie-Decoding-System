3 July 2020,JoeytheBrit,," Bad Times at the El Royale review
","While the situation may (or may not) have been lifted from Tarantino, the style of writing belongs to writer-director Drew Goddard, who creates a small world with only a passing relationship to our own. Five strangers and a hotel clerk meet at the deserted El Royale, and each has a secret that will be exposed on the long, stormy - and ultimately violent - night that follows. It's intriguing - if a little slow - to begin with, but runs out of steam with the arrival of Chris Hemsworth as a Manson-like cult leader with the haziest of agendas. There are some decent twists, though - and one truly terrifying jump scare - and Jeff Bridges steals every scene that he's in.",/review/rw4400947/?ref_=tt_urv

","It is a surprising , perfect puzzle. All is familiar. And you feel that more than you know. The build up is incredible, the mix of western, policier, horror and adventure, war and Tarantino, conspiracy theory, few drops of Scorsese and few crumbs of romance are almost incredible. A film admirable crafted. And that - from impecable story to the acting are ingredients defining it as real special.",/review/rw4400947/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2019,classicsoncall,9," ""Sh_t happens. Get the whiskey!""
","Whoa, pleasant surprise here! The movie delivered a lot more than I was expecting with a title like ""Bad Times at the El Royale"". Seems like Jeff Bridges can't miss ever since ""Crazy Heart"", with follow up grizzled, ornery characterizations in ""Rooster Cogburn"" and ""Hell or High Water"". He was great here as the dementia challenged old timer bent on reclaiming an old score from ten years prior during a robbery that went South. But he's not alone among a cast that includes relative newcomer Cynthia Erivo, Jon Hamm, Dakota Johnson and Chris Hemsworth, who provides an additional layer of intensity with an appearance late in the story. Part of my fondness for the film comes from an appreciation for Tarantino-esque story telling with a non-linear chronology, which was very effective here and not too difficult to follow.",/review/rw4400947/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2020,Leofwine_draca,8," Generally likeable
","BAD TIMES AT THE EL ROYALE is a generally likeable crime thriller that keeps you guessing for a while before letting rip with a high-energy climax. It's another single location type movie set in the lobby and various rooms of a slightly sleazy motel, but the good news is that it's a lot more intelligent than Tarantino's similar HATEFUL EIGHT. The first half takes a little while to get going with character stories presented as sub-plots that mingle together in a way similar to the likes of 11:14, although not quite as good. The ending really picks up with actors such as Jeff Bridges and Chris Hemsworth shining in against-type roles, and the unknown-to-me cast members pull off effective performances too. Not quite a classic, but still a fun way to spend an hour or two.",/review/rw4400947/?ref_=tt_urv
29 February 2020,zhammons-21058,8," You will love it or hate it, most likely.
","Just watched this for the first time after stumbling across it on demand. Figured I would give it a chance, since I loved Cabin in the Woods and Jeff Bridges is one of my favorite actors. I'm no film major or snooty critic, just a guy that enjoys movies. It is definitely a film that pays homage to QT, Coen Bros, etc, but I don't think it is trying to be one of their films as others have said. I'm impressed when a director can pull off an interesting story that takes place in a small setting, such as Hateful Eight, Cloverfield Lane, Devil, Insomnia etc. At nearly 2.5 hours, I didn't feel like the movie was too long, and there were several twists to keep it interesting. I believe all good artists are influenced by their predecessors, but they also put their own spin on it. I think if you are a fan of the above directors, you will enjoy the movie. Just don't try and hold it to QT standards.",/review/rw4400947/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2018,neil-476,10," An absolute cracker
","It is the 1960s. The El Royale hotel/motel/casino sits on the California/Nevada border. Staffed only by youngster Miles, a number of guests arrive. Each has a secret, and no-one is quite who they might appear to be at first sight. A very eventful night is under way.",/review/rw4400947/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2018,Fella_shibby,10," It keeps you engaged from beginning to end. Before comparing it to Tarantino style films pls watch Jean-Luc Godard's films.
","The film starts with a man moving all the items of a hotel room in one corner, he then removes the carpet n the floorboards, stashes a bag underneath n puts back all the things in place. After he has finished his mysterious work.....
Fast forward ten years n destiny brings together a group of people who all end up at this same hotel on a dark rainy night due to different circumstances.
Comparison to The Identity is present but please do not compare it to Tarantino style films jus cos it has a nonlinear approach.
Fellas who r comparing the nonlinear film style to Tarantino's films ain't aware of Jean-Luc Godard, the pioneer of nonlinear filmmaking.
Is it a coincidence that the surname of the director of this film too is Goddard.
Drew Goddard is in full Jean-Luc Godard-esque mood.
Attention is required as every person at the El Royale has a story n
the background story of all the characters were properly interwined.
Some of the scenes r way too slow n the editing needed some post production work.
Jus few days back i saw Chronicles of the Ghostly tribe n i wrote in its review that the flashbacks were confusing n not at all gripping but in El Royale the flashbacks were intriguing n not at all confusing.
The film is visually striking and offers a high level of ambience.
It has lots of eerie mood, good suspense, a great sense of dread throughout. The background story of one of the character which is shown towards the end is a bit shocking n well placed.
The owners of the hotel remained mystery but that is another story.....",/review/rw4400947/?ref_=tt_urv

",I didn't expect much from this movie when i started it but it was very interesting and good. The story is pretty interesting and the build up is also perfect. It keeps you waiting shrouding you with mystery. The cast is perfect. Personally i thought Jeff bridge's performance was perfect. The other cast also give a solid performance. All in all the movie is very enjoyable and i definitely recommend it,/review/rw4400947/?ref_=tt_urv

","It baffles me that this movie did not get better reviews than it did. Bad Times at the El Royale, is incredible, as the story is intriguing and all the actors get your attention with Chris Hemsworth standing out at the end.
The action scenes are great, the cinematography and the soundtrack also stand out a lot. This is just a fun movie all the way through and to me personally, it is one of the best films of the year.",/review/rw4400947/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2019,UniqueParticle,10," Astounding!
","Originally saw this in theaters which even then I loved it! Drew Goddard directed this masterpiece and ""Cabin in the woods"", another masterpiece in my opinion. This felt like a stylish new generation of classic films. I love the entire cast especially Jeff Bridges and Chris Hemsworth! Such a grand beautiful piece of art with a great soundtrack. Superb experience -- highly recommend!",/review/rw4400947/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2018,jg_1977,8," Good times had seeing Bad Times
","First off let me say, Bat Times at the El Royale is most certainly not for everyone. The way the story unfolds and how information is withheld/presented is quite complex. Although this may make it a bit too convoluted for some, it makes it an absolute treat for anyone willing to dig beneath the surface and get analytical. Not unlike Cabin in the Woods (Drew Goddard's directorial debut), Bad Times plays with your expectations. Goddard takes painstaking care to build tension throughout a scene, only to have it all upended by a sudden twist. For that reason, I anticipate the reaction to this film will be divided, as many moviegoers simply don't like surprises or being unsure of what will happen. However, if you are a fan of Goddard's previous work, it's a safe bet that you'll like this one. I also need to talk about the cast, as they deliver an absolute treasure of an ensemble performance. Each person plays their part incredibly well, but Cynthia Erivo and Chris Hemsworth are the definite stand outs. Hemsworth especially shines, showing us that he can do more than play a quippy Norse god. This movie has so much to unpack both visually and in terms of foreshadowing that I cannot wait to see it again. If you're looking for a smart, stylish, and generally thrilling way to spend a few hours, look no further than Bad Times at the El Royale.",/review/rw4400947/?ref_=tt_urv

8 November 2020,christopher-underwood,8," a late great showing from Jeff Bridges
","For the most part this is a really good, if not excellent film, with a fantastic central performance from Jeff Bridges, ably supported with an equally compelling performance from Londoner Cynthia Erivo who I recently saw in Stephen King's The Outside TV series. beautifully shot and confidently and surely constructed to have us spellbound but not fully aware of just what is going on. Is it the hotel that is weird or just the people? Jon Hamm is great in the early stages and looked a bit like a young Robert de Niro. Things really only go wrong, for me, in the last half hour. The film is certainly some fifteen minutes too long and there is simply too much time allowed for Chris Hemsworth to unconvincingly develop his character and similarly with Lewis Pullman who had been great as the hapless bellboy cum hotel manager but with whom we spend a little too long in the end. Disappointing end or not this is well worth a watch and always going to be worth it for a late great showing from Jeff Bridges, and those 60s songs where even just a line or two can be surprisingly effective, indeed it is 'strange how potent cheap music is.'",/review/rw4400947/?ref_=tt_urv

1 October 2018,Yee_Reviews,6," Wannabe Tarantino Film
","Good: The time period 1969 provides a great stylistic approach to a hotel that has property on both California and Nevada, which adds to the idea of having a good side and a bad side and the hotel also creates a sense of entrapment. The cinematography is great as it makes slow pans to unveil the secrets of the characters and the El Royale. The hotel, costume design, and soundtrack help create a nostalgic setting. The directing and editing are also well done when incorporating sound/music to scenes especially when Cynthia Ervio sings. Erivo's musical performance is filled with heart and soul and helps develop the character and conveys her emotions. Other standouts are Jeff Bridges and Chris Hemsworth. Hemsworth just has a charming presence and provides the slight dark tone of his character. Bridges plays his character well as he connects with Erivo and tries to execute his actions. However, the rest of the cast have trouble making their appearance known...",/review/rw4400947/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2019,BandSAboutMovies,5," A long way around the hotel for no real payoff
","Remember when Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction made their initial splash for Quentin Tarantino and studios rushed to get their own chopped up narrative films in theaters? Killing Zoe, 8 Heads in a Duffel Bag, 2 Days in the Valley, Smoking Aces and plenty more, it seemed like everyone was trying to make a movie that didn't follow a linear track, had overly erudite killers with a skewed moral code and plenty of strange MacGuffins. As if 1992 was back again, I threw Bad Times at the El Royale into our blu ray player and sat back to watch.",/review/rw4400947/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2018,thomasjay-2201,8," Must Watch
","My most anticipated release for the rest of this month/year and it's fair to say I left satisfied, although taking a little while to get going pace wise with the majority of the opening being dialogue based once it gets going it's got no problem at all. Tense and odd but brilliantly executed the general plot is so interesting, Goddard pays magnificent attention to detail in every scene all of which becomes useful at a later stage and some of the action was strangely beautiful and original playing with lighting, environments and elements which I can honestly say I've never seen before. Shades of Tarantino and a lovely colour pallete this was a brilliant watch, Goddard strikes again I highly recommend you see this",/review/rw4400947/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2018,Darth_Osmosis,9," Dark, fun, cool and entertaining as hell!
","This movie is a wild ride. You will not know what happens next and be constantly on the edge of your seat. The cast is wonderful for this type of movie, everybody plays their character very well, and they all have an interesting backstory. The way they play off each other is also good and creates some very funny, intense and great moments. The setting is also brilliant and truly becomes a character on it's own! It is never boring and is beautifully shot, so it is always nice to look at. The story is told in a manner that makes it so it maintains it's momentum throughout. Very enjoyable and definitely worth a watch!",/review/rw4400947/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2018,aliases-53334,1," Ending couldn't have come sooner
","Where to begin... this film started off well. The first 1.5 hours are compelling, creepy, surprising and will catch your undivided attention.
It is true that the director has seen too many Tarantino films. A lack of originality is painfully obvious here, as the film unfolds into an ugly baby of ""Identity"" (strangers meeting in a stranded hotel) meeting ""Reservoir dogs"" and a bit of ""pulp fiction"" and ""Four rooms"".
Having an inspiration is not a crime, ladies, but creating a copycat out of several movies is a badly crime of fashion.
Still, the film was fairly compelling and enjoyable, until dear Hemsworth apeard, around 40 minutes to the ending. 
Somehow, this last, long, tortuous scene dragged the entire film to an empty dark hole of audience leaving the theatre or checking their phones.
No more fun and games! From now on its bad cinema and terrible pretenious cult-leader Hemsworth, shaking his belly abbs in a bad Reservoir Dogs wannabe to a ""cool"" song, preparing to be very mean and violence. It all turns into an uncomfortable, annoying last scene that dragged forever and became sadly pointless as we learn more about some of the characters (details we did not want or need to know) and got a chance of seeing more of Hemsworth's body (at least some eye candy to make us feel better about all this).
The whole film (literally) began smoking up in flames as it tries to show us it is actually about good and evil (?), the wrongs of men, racism and sexism, bad sisterhood, military and war (seriously?) and who knows what else. 
The point is, at this stage, nobody cares. Best part was the movie finally ended in the end.",/review/rw4400947/?ref_=tt_urv

18 June 2019,truemythmedia,6," Great until it's Not.
","I really wanted to like this movie. For about the first hour, I really did, but by about the two-hour mark I was ready for the film to end, and by the time the credits rolled I found myself walking from the theater slightly disappointed. ""Bad Times at the El Royale"" was written and directed by Drew Goddard (""Cabin in the Woods""), a man whose work I've been largely split on, but whenever he hits the nail on the head, his stuff really works for me. This film started off great; there were lots of great twists and turns, memorable and diverse characters, and a mysterious premise. But as the film rolled on, and the character's secrets were unveiled, I found myself growing disenfranchised with the film. Goddard continuously hints at darker things happening, but he never really delivered what he promises. The movie felt like it was trying to emulate the overlapping storylines of ""Pulp Fiction"", and even some of the dialogue felt like it was Tarantino-esque, but Goddard never quite reaches the level of snappiness Tarantino infuses into his films. Goddard's writing seems uneven; some of the lengthy dialogue scenes are great, while others are dull, borderline boring.",/review/rw4400947/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2018,thechair,5," There's probably a decent film in here somewhere...
","How I wish I was one of the 9s and 10s reviewing on here. Loved Cabin in the Woods and Drew's work in general, but unfortunately this is way, way off what it should have been. With a firm editor and some zip in the dialogue this could have been a nice 90s-Tarantino-esque noir, but as it is it is a collection of tiresomely overlong scenes held together by a storyline that is far from engaging on any level, and with a heavy tone ill-fitting the material. Every scene could (and should) have been slashed by 25% and nothing would have been lost (well, an awful lot of singing). There are no crackling verbal exchanges in any of them, and despite what remain good performances from an excellent cast, by the end (and maybe the 33rd or 34th flashback to another character's backstory) I just wanted the lights to come up and for it all to be over. 5/10 for the acting, a couple of good moments/surprises and the look of it, otherwise it would have been a 2 or a 3. Boring.",/review/rw4400947/?ref_=tt_urv
