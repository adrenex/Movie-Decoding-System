24 April 2021,ryleilove,5," Unsatisfying Ending
","I think was movie was pretty good considering they had to share the terrifying 24 year story of Elizabeth Fritz in such a short amount of time. The acting was ok, and though the two eldest children should have been nearly adults, they looked 14 and 12. Perhaps to showcase the stunt of growth? Idk but my biggest disappointment was the ending. It felt rushed. I would have loved to see her mom and sisters reaction of reuniting with her vs an old flame who we are supposed to believe waited 20 years for her return on the same bike he'd been riding since the beginning of the film. I would have loved to see her reaction to the son she sent to be raised by her mom. Maybe even her mom and sisters disgust toward the father would have been great. Parts of this movie just felt lazy and the ending was the main.",/review/rw7223420/?ref_=tt_urv

","This film is inspired by the life of Elisabeth Fritzl and the abuse she suffered at the hands of her father, Josef.",/review/rw7223420/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2021,jennfinn,6," Based on Monster Josef Fritzl.
","Girl in the Basement is loosely based on Josef Fritzl of Austria who imprisoned his 18 year old daughter Elisabeth in a basement prison for 24 years during which time she gave birth to SEVEN of his children. Three kids were raised in the basement with Elisabeth, three were raised upstairs by Josef & his wife, and one was killed by Josef a few days after his birth. I'm stating all this information because reviewer DEEDRALA said it wasn't based on a true story when in fact it most certainly is. Judd Nelson gave a chilling performance as Don, the psycho father who locks his daughter, Sara in the basement for twenty years. The movie starts with Sara sneaking out to a party with her boyfriend, her dad catches her and she's grounded for one week. Don overhears Sara telling her mom & sister that she's leaving as soon as she turns 18 so she can travel the world. We are told Don is controlling and crazy but how does he go from grounding her for sneaking out to locking her in the basement for 20 years ? The man goes from concerned dad to full on sociopath in minutes and I'm not buying it. Josef the actual monster who did this in real life showed signs long before he locked up his daughter. He served time for rape while he was married, he started raping Elisabeth when she was eleven years old, and he started building her prison three years before he locked her in there. Also in the movie Sara looks exactly the same when she leaves the bunker twenty years later, they could've at least aged her a bit. Once again LMN wanted to cash in on a tragedy but they didn't want to actually research anything.",/review/rw7223420/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2021,ythecreator-61401,4," A potentially impactful story weakened by a mediocre deliver.
","The delivering through a low budget standardized package of generic tv drama prevents the implications of such events to be fully developed for its own flaws of mediocre acting, underdeveloped plot and neglected atmosphere.",/review/rw7223420/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2021,jackgdemoss,4," My first time rating a Lifetime movie
","I knew something was off the moment our main antagonist delivered his first line of dialogue. He was such an atrociously bad actor throughout the entire film that it genuinely felt like a school project at times. It wasn't until the first cut to black during a tense moment that I realized this is a Lifetime made for TV type movie. With that taken into consideration, it held my attention well enough. What trumps even the poor acting and cinematography was the method of story telling. They attempt the classic move where they show a scene from near he end of the movie and then jump back 20 years earlier, slowly building back up to that moment to continue from it. The problem is that this particular scene shows us that any attempt at escape we see throughout the first hour will be unsuccessful, killing any tension and momentum. This was based off the harrowing real story of Elisabeth Fritzl, and more justice could have been done with it in the film realm.",/review/rw7223420/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2021,jdorego,7," Lesson for victims too
",Disagree with reviews of bad acting. All actors did quite well with what was given them. They had to summarize 20 years into a 90 minute movie so at least it moves fast and keeps you engaged.,/review/rw7223420/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2021,krocheav,3," Girl in the Basement - Problems
","This rather nasty made for cable movie is a fabrication that's based on some shocking true events. A daughter held captive in the family's home cellar, and constantly assaulted by her deranged father for 25 years! (fortunately this maniac is now locked away for life) During this hideous time, she gave birth to 7 children! Problem is that while this adapted version is traumatic, there are elements of this production that don't ring true. The director Elizabeth Rohm, seemed more like a trainee or someone who only took a superficial interest in her shocking story! Essential details such as; the unfortunate girl being depicted mostly looking way too youthfully healthy for someone locked away over such a huge time span.",/review/rw7223420/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2021,Top_Dawg_Critic,6," A well told true story, ruined by horrible directing.
","Why would they hire actress Elisabeth Röhm, to direct this film, when she's never been behind a camera before? This was such a troubling and horrific true story event, it needed professionals to tell it. The screenplay was on point, but Röhm's failure to direct her cast and scenes properly, really failed this film. Performances were adequate to decent, but that was strictly from the merits of the actors following a screenplay. Stefanie Scott's performance got better as the movie progressed, but I'm sure that was due to her getting comfortable with her character. Even Judd Nelson's performance was stale and amateurish, that with a better director, he would've shined. Had a seasoned director been involved, this could've been much more gut-wrenching and epic film. Nevertheless, it's a story that needed to be told, and I'm glad it was; It was a bold move for Lifetime to produce this. I just wish it was told in a better way. It's a generous 6/10 from me.",/review/rw7223420/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2021,sarah-baldwin,6," Extremely light version of truth
","Well done and definitely toned down for TV. I personally think people need to start making movies that actually depict the true horror of the reality we live in. Her true events were 1,000 times more horrific. It doesn't do the victims justice by making the father out to be better than he was. He is pure evil. Men like her father should be tortured every second for the rest of their life.",/review/rw7223420/?ref_=tt_urv

28 February 2021,pmtelefon,7," Well made but unpleasant
","I've seen a bunch of Lifetime movies. I tend to have a problem with the ones that based on a true story. I don't mind spending my Saturday night with an obsessed ex-boyfriend or roommate or whatever. But when it has to do with a real person's sufferings, I get uncomfortable. That is what happened as I watched ""Girl in the Basement"". The movie is well made with very good performances across the board. It's just that I have a hard time trying to relax while real victims scream. Honorable mention: an apparently ageless Judd Nelson.",/review/rw7223420/?ref_=tt_urv

20 March 2022,lynansaysingle,8," Hell on Earth
","How to begin to say how I felt after watching this movie and know that someone actually went through all of it and more. I felt pure hatred, sick with anger that this evil man did all of this this and to his own flesh and blood. This movie has been even toned down as it did not show that Sara has been getting raped by his own father since she was 11 and that is why she wanted to leave as soon as she turned 18. Unfortunately her plans failed and her worst nightmare became her reality for 24 long years. I am very sadden with disbelief that a mother did not sense or feel the horror that came upon one of her children under the same roof for years. I am exasperated, as a mother I sense the slightest discomfort my child feels. How did she not feel her child was crying out for help when she was raped as a child years before she went missing. Her passiveness can be unforgivable in my eyes.",/review/rw7223420/?ref_=tt_urv

","Based on a true story, this movie is about a father who imprisons his daughter for 20 years. He keeps her in the basement where he abuses her, getting her pregnant numerous times. She raises her kids in this room, and they escape when the daughter needs to go to the hospital. Most of the performances were fine, but Judd Nelson really makes you hate his character. I don't usually watch Lifetime movies. This one wasn't too graphic, but in many ways more disturbing than most horror movies.",/review/rw7223420/?ref_=tt_urv
