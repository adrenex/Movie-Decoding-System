20 August 2018,jtindahouse,6," A little underwhelming
","Ironically in 'Tomb Raider' they got the hard part right and messed up the easy part. The hard part in my opinion was correctly casting 'Lara Croft'. To follow in the shoes of a peak-of-her-powers Angelina Jolie is no easy feat. They pulled that off though by finding Alicia Vikander who was excellent in this film. The part they messed up though, and why this is such a bland experience, was they just didn't give her anything interesting to do. ",/review/rw4094711/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2018,claudio_carvalho,4," Dumb and Full of Clichés
","Action films are usually made in order that the viewer does not think and enjoy the action only. Clichés are common but ""Tomb Raider"" adds another ingredient to the formula: one of the dumbest storylines ever. This wannabe Indiana Jones introduces Lara Croft, living in financial difficulties in London only because she does not acknowledge that her father, who is missing for seven years, is dead. She does not go to the university and does not have money for anything while his fortune is administrated by executives. She finds a lead where he might be and instead of receiving her inheritance and organizing an adequate expedition to look for him, she prefers to go to the pawnshop to raise money and travel alone. Her father asks her only one thing, to destroy his research about Himiko since it would be dangerous to mankind if in wrong hands. And our heroin does exactly the opposite, taking the documents exactly to his enemies. Last but not the least, her father survives seven years alone in the wilderness to keep Himiko´s tomb closed. In a couple of days, our heroin succeeds in opening the tomb for the enemy and witnesses the death of her father after seven years living in extreme danger. My vote is four.",/review/rw4094711/?ref_=tt_urv

16 March 2018,dave-mcclain,3," a joyless slog
","""Tomb Raider"" (PG-13, 1:58) is a reboot of the erstwhile Angelina Jolie franchise (with 2001 and 2003 ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider"" films). All the movies are based on the British ""Tomb Raider"" action-adventure video game series, which came on the scene in 1996. Like the games, the movies have used various combinations of ""Tomb Raider"" and ""Lara Croft"" (the franchises' central character) in their titles. Naming tweaks aside, the question is if the 2018 changes in casting & approach pay off for Movie Fans. ",/review/rw4094711/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2018,gornasa,7," Better than a lot of other movies out there
","I don't get the 1-star reviews. This is definitely not the worst movie of the century. I can't say it has a great storyline, but at least it has some storyline, unlike most Hollywood action movies these days.
The things I liked:
1. The special effects. They looked real and Lara didn't look like some plastic figure jumping and tumbling around and whatnot. She looked like Alicia Vikander, an actual person that has stuff happen to her. Apparently Alicia did some stunts herself so maybe they didn't have to use so much CGI. And she looks very athletic so that adds to the overal feel of Lara being a spunky little adventuress.
2. Alicia as Lara. There's been a lot of talk about her practically nonexistent breasts, and 'of course' the real Lara is quite busty, but I find this talk ridiculous. Alicia looks stunning and sporty, and she oozes Lara Croft from every pore. Her acting was great too, it was very intense and realistic - the emotions and the sounds she made during the fight made it seem like it was all happening for real. You don't usually see it in movies. ",/review/rw4094711/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2018,TheLittleSongbird,7," A worthwhile raid
","The general reputation for films based on video games is not a good one. From those seen, it is not surprising that they generally have not been well received and that as a films-based-on-video-games group the reputation is dubious.",/review/rw4094711/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2018,bettycjung,8," Vikander was really good as an action heroine
","3/18/18. Saw this on the big screen today and it was worth it. A nicely done action/adventure movie that will remind you a little bit of Indiana Jones. Vikander is great as Lara Croft, who decides to look for her missing father, and ends up fighting for her life. Great action sequences with a decent story line. Supporting cast was very good. Worth catching.",/review/rw4094711/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2018,The-Sarkologist,3," Time for a mindless reboot
","I'm sort of wandering how old a movie has to be when they decide that it is time for a remake. Well, I'm actually thinking that it is getting less and less the further we progress because I'm sure that the Angeline Jolie Tomb Raiders were only out a few years ago. In fact, when I first saw the advertisements for this instalment a part of me thought that it was just Angelina reprising her role, only to be rather baffled when I discovered that Lara Croft was actually being played by a completely different actress. In fact, it became quite clear when I watched the preview a second time (as I wasn't really paying attention the first time I saw it) that I realised it was a reboot.
 Honestly, I'm not all that sure why it is I go and watch these movies because as it turned out this one was pretty bad. Well, not really, but I certainly wasn't able to get into it. I'm sure there are plenty of people out there that really enjoy these films, but all I can say is that it is basically unoriginal. Okay, it is a reboot, and reboots are never original, but then again they never end up being all that successful either, especially when the original was so much better. Actually, I sometimes wonder why Hollywood insists on rebooting and remaking successful films when it is quite clear that it rarely, if ever, works.
 Okay, it has been a while since I've seen the original Lara Croft film, and it also seems that I never got around to writing a review for it either, so it makes it difficult to compare. However, here we start off with Lara as a bicycle courier in London, and she seems to forever be getting herself into trouble. Well, once again it is the story of the abandoned child since her father went off on an adventure seven years ago and is now presumed dead. So, Lara decides that she might as well sign the papers, only to discover a piece to a puzzle that sends her on a round the world adventure.
 As I said, it is difficult to compare the two films since in this one it seems as if she is a bit of a newbie when it comes to adventuring, and it is the hunting down her father plotline (which a part of me believes that was the original film as well). In a way, I thought that maybe she would have been a bit more skilful, though I guess that would make it a little unrealistic as it is also supposed to be a coming of age type of film, and in another sense a passing on the baton.
 There were a few interesting plot points as well, namely because it deals with a legendary Japanese queen known as the Death Queen, and we are all led to believe that she is an evil sorceress who was banished to an island and imprisoned in a tomb because she was, well, so evil. However, the hint is dropped that legends aren't always what they seem to be, though that does not necessarily mean that they are completely false. In fact the truth behind the legend may be much more fantastic.
 Still, this is probably not a film that I would be going out of my way to recommend. It was okay, but in the end nothing that really stands out. I guess it is probably more like one of those mindless films that you watch when you really don't want to think, and have basically watched all of the Indiana Jones films to death, but still want something that is of the same style. Sure, Indiana Jones is just way too hard to beat, sometimes it is good to have something that is a little different (though you generally know what is going to happen at the end). I should mention that they have left the film open to a sequel.",/review/rw4094711/?ref_=tt_urv

18 March 2018,christian-larson,1," Boring, cliche film
","Tomb Raider is the latest video game adaptation by Roar Uthaug, a nameless director. Rarely is a video game movie good, in fact, its never good. Its no surprise here. This is your typical action movie with your typical dialogue and typical everything. It's very cliched and flawed. The direction and script are awful. I was never entertained during the movie. There is no attempt to make an interesting character out of Lara. She never learns anything, she never has any arcs nor any development. There is no style in this movie, it's so factory based, its disgusting. There's nothing special about the camerawork, the editing, nothing is even remarkably good. Its just below average. The editing is ok. The color grading is actually pretty gross looking. Its so frustrating that you have a beautiful jungle and it looks disgusting since the color grading is all gray and ugly. There are some nice shots of the beach and of a camera following Lara running. But that's it. Everything else is either boring, average, or, painfully cringe inducing. The dialogue in this film is atrocious. Most of the dialogue is cliched and conventional, and some of them are so cringe. The ending tries to make an ""intriguing"" twist, but it just falls flat completely. It comes out of nowhere and in retrospect, it does not make sense at all. The acting is also really bad. Alicia VIkander does a terrible job, and her shouts in the movie are so laughable. It's sad that this movie actually takes itself seriously. Don't see it.

27 December 2018,Leofwine_draca,6," Not perfect, but not bad either
","TOMB RAIDER is the latest Hollywood reboot, this time of the video game series about a female archaeologist scouring the globe and penetrating ancient tombs for their secret treasures. Previously two lacklustre movies were made with Angelina Jolie, and the good news is that this is a step up from those. It's not perfect, not by any means, but it's worth a single watch at least and it has some genuinely good elements to see it through. The film is still far too reliant on cheesy CGI action sequences which have no sense of danger whatsoever, which is why the best bit of action in the whole thing is the early bike chase through the streets of London, propelled along as it is by strong cinematography and efficient stuntwork. Alicia Vikander is far better in the role than Jolie ever was, putting across a sense of pride and toughness, and truth be told it's the first time I've actually liked her in something. Dominic West gives the best and most assured performance as the missing father. Okay, so Walton Goggin's villain is a weak spot and the running time is a bit overlong, especially in midsection where things flag a little, but with Daniel Wu in support and some nihilistic moments, this is better than something equivalent, like, say, Tom Cruise's THE MUMMY.",/review/rw4094711/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2018,statuskuo,4," Meh
","The original movie adaption with Angelina Jolie was no great shakes, which surprised me they decided to re-boot this. After watching this one, you find yourself REALLY missing the days when you were allowed to plant tongue firmly in cheek due to the camp value.
Though I have not played the 2013 re-boot of the game itself, it seems odd that they would change storylines to suit...the new generation of gamers. Perhaps this has been done already, but it hasn't improved the outline, and in some flaccid way, almost diluted it from an already weak Indy Jones rip.
Alicia Vikander plays this Millenial Lara Croft. A troubled rich kid posing as a working courier whilst attempting to afford to pay for mixed martial arts training. She doesn't enjoy her wealth, nor the possibility it could bring. Instead, she chooses to live within the dregs of society, desperately turning her back on society and frustrating who I believe to be her step-mum Kristin Scott Thomas. Unfortunately, you already sense the turns and reveals that movies like this can't let go. Flashbacks to conversations that is already figured out by...everyone and their grandmas. This movie is so lackluster it sensed how bad it was when within the same scene the stakes of world destruction is met with the silliest of solutions to push forth into the tomb. Makes ones stomach turn.
There is no grand adventure here. In fact, it's full of one bad decision after another. Silly and dumb without camp. The original was silly and goofy, but at least Angelina Jolie seem to enjoyed her time donning the form fitting brassier. Alicia may not understand, despite her Academy win, that it is okay to tell the money people that their ideas are garbage. Or maybe t's a payday for something else going on in her life. I can't blame her for that. Maybe tomb raiding to her means cashing a fat check at the bank.",/review/rw4094711/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2018,MichaelNontonMulu,8," A nice reboot of the iconic video game character's movie
","At first when I found out about the reboot of this iconic video game character movie, I admit that I had my doubts when they cast Alicia Vikander to play Lara Croft. My doubt was due to the her prior experience of mostly having dramatic roles rather than action role. It would really require a great physical attributes in order to play this heroine who was famous for her agility and ability to run and jump through a whole lot of dangerous places like in the video game. But it turned out my doubt was completely unwarranted. Alicia Vikander truly deserves the praise for being a new action star and she was really great in playing this role. There were soo many action sequences that required her to do all those stuff and what surprised and amazed me was the fact that she did all of her stunts. ",/review/rw4094711/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2018,liamkenny91,3," Not the Tomb Raider you know - or want.
","Going into this movie, I had very high hopes - I loved the previous movies (for all their flaws and silliness), and have played and enjoyed almost all of the games, including the reboot this movie is based on. What this movie feels like, is pandering to the ""Lara Croft"" name, it adds nothing new, in terms of the Tomb Raider Mythology or any action movie in general. The script is generic, boring and predictable. The entire cinema actually scoffed at a line close to the end, during a scene which was supposed to be dramatic, but came off as fake and unusual.
