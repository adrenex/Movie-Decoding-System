15 November 2021,deloudelouvain,7," Intriguing, not bad at all.
","Before writing a review I always ask myself two questions. Was I entertained for the entire movie? Was it well made? I have to answer yes on those two questions for The Night House. The story is slow paced but it has a constant intriguing plot that keeps you wondering what is happening. It's not one of those movies you figure out everything from the beginning. There aren't really scary moments, not even jump scares but there's some good suspense and mystery. The acting wasn't bad at all so nothing bad to write about that either. In this genre The Night House is definitely worth a watch.",/review/rw8060626/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2022,FeastMode,7," Scream 5 would call this elevated horror
","Well-made psychological horror flick with a great performance by Rebecca Hall. It can be considered a slow burn but I was fully invested and never bored. Very atmospheric. Lots of beautiful shots. Some effective scares. Great movie overall and I would definitely watch it again. (1 viewing, 2/7/2022)",/review/rw8060626/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2021,george.schmidt,8," Hall is remarkable in this excellent modern ghost story.
","THE NIGHT HOUSE (2021) *** Rebecca Hall, Sarah Goldberg, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Evan Jonigkeit, Stacy Martin. Compelling supernatural drama about a recently widowed woman (Hall in a remarkable performance) who begins to question her sanity when she begins to make discoveries of her late husband's past as well as their home which seems to house a sinister presence. Well directed by David Bruckner with just the amount of dread and genuine jolts thanks also to a shrewd screenplay by Ben Collins and Luke Piotrowsk. The pin-pricking score by Ben Lovett & handsomely shot cinematography by Elisha Christian makes all the difference in this modern day ghost story.",/review/rw8060626/?ref_=tt_urv

6 October 2021,Neptune165,5," I felt it was too slow to get to the meat of the story
","They took so long getting to the reveal that the ending feels completely rushed and does not provide crucial information that would have given more context to what was going on. (The ""bathroom scene"") did not play with the rest of the movie and was so outlandish that it completely pulled me out of the movie. She is being thrown against a wall with a mirror, so he must have some power, but still doesn't kill her, The same gun that was used by her husband and was returned (presumably loaded?) by the police?!! The audience leaves confused about what happened, why it happened, or even how it happened. ""Nothing"" suspended Beth in the position like the statue she found? But he couldn't kill her?? I couldn't understand why after she found the dead bodies she went back home and took a shower and still wanting to see her husband after she found out he murder a lot of women. This movie make no sense.",/review/rw8060626/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2021,UniqueParticle,9," 1000x better than expected and ending is perfect
","I'm blown by this horror story, I regret reading anything bad because it's way wrong! Rebecca Hall's character deals with the aftermath of her husband's suicide and is haunted with mysteries throughout. David Bruckner directed a crafty well done version of what tremendous loss is like. I absolutely loved the presence of unknown entity whenever it happens especially the epilogue is so good! I don't mean to spoil anything but I chose yes just in case. It's a shame The Night House isn't making more money cause it definitely deserves it.",/review/rw8060626/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2021,CinemaClown,," A Gradually Escalating & Silently Unnerving Chiller
","With a dreadful, disquieting atmosphere pervading its frames and a dark, disturbing mystery simmering beneath the surface, The Night House makes for a gripping, haunting & gradually escalating psychological horror with a plot that only gets more uneasy & uncomfortable as it progresses, and is powerfully anchored by Rebecca Hall's emotionally engrossing showcase.",/review/rw8060626/?ref_=tt_urv

10 September 2021,jtindahouse,8," Hall is great in a complex and layered horror film that can still scare
","After an extremely poorly timed lock-down in my country days before 'The Night House' - one of my most anticipated films of the year - was due to come out, I finally got the chance to see it yesterday. Getting overly excited for an upcoming film is rarely a good omen. I find that films like 'Midsommar', where the reality actually lives up to the hype, are rare. 'The Night House' was still an excellent film, but it wasn't quite the masterpiece I had been hoping for.",/review/rw8060626/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2021,johannes2000-1,7," Effective ghost story, especially the first half.
","For the first hour of the movie I was very much intrigued by this slowly but effectively unfolding story, getting more and more bewildered, just like main character Beth, by the weird and scary goings-on. The photography is great, and beside a nice sinister atmosphere, there are multiple jump-scares to keep you on the edge of your chair. Rebecca Hall carries the whole movie admirably, she's totally convincing, first as the grieved and forlorn widow of a husband that out of the blue committed suicide, subsequently as the exasperated woman who thinks she's losing her mind. She's not trying to win our sympathy with her aggrieved and angry behavior and her heavy drinking, but you do team up with her when her world turns upside down on her.",/review/rw8060626/?ref_=tt_urv

26 October 2021,BandSAboutMovies,6," Decent ghost story
","The Night House may not be perfect, but it takes some chances and has a nice puzzle at its heart that makes sense the further you go into the movie. It fits nearly into that sub-genre of a genre, the giallo where a woman is either gaslighting herself, being gaslit or going slowly insane (for more, see Footprints on the Moon, The Perfume of the Lady in Black, The Psychic and Lizard In a Woman's Skin).",/review/rw8060626/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2021,Pjtaylor-96-138044,6," Rather underwhelming.
","'The Night House (2020)' is, frankly, just a bit uninteresting. It isn't exactly boring, per se, but it certainly isn't all that compelling, either. It's, essentially, saved by a handful of effective and somewhat distinct sequences, alongside a confident central performance and some solid cinematography. The mystery at the movie's core is occasionally intriguing, but its answers - and some of the steps taken to reveal them - are generally disappointing. The ending, in particular, is rather anticlimactic. To be honest, it doesn't really finish anything off, even though it does reveal most of the narrative's secrets. This doesn't feel as though it was done on purpose; it's almost the opposite of something like the thematically resonant cliffhanger that finishes off 'Halloween (1978)', for example. There are some inventive visuals and some intriguing ideas, don't get me wrong. It's intermittently entertaining. Ultimately, though, it's just a bit underwhelming. There isn't really a proper theme and none of it is actually scary. It's a decent effort, but not much more. 6/10.",/review/rw8060626/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2022,baunacholi-86159,6," A fresh version of
","SPOILER: A ghost story. The movies biggest plus is the story. To add something new to the mystery genre is quite seldom. Hence I appreciated the night house' clever, eerie and slowly revealed storyline. The twists and red herrings are nicely embedded into the overall flow and link all pieces together rather being solely used as cheap tricks. It could have ended a bit sharper in my pov. All elements are there but it gets a bit fuzzy towards the end.",/review/rw8060626/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2021,HadiAriyan07,3," The Ending Ruined the Entire Movie
","Rebecca Hall is great as usual, but she's so above the story and the script. Nothing out of the norm in The Night House, the cinematography, the production design, the score and the horror is all there, nothing special. The only thing this movie had the potential in it, is the mystery of what's really happening.",/review/rw8060626/?ref_=tt_urv

","This was a movie that was getting quite the push. I've been going to the theater a lot as of late and both of the ones I go to were showing the trailer. It was even popping up on streaming services with commercials as well. Jaime and I got the chance to see this when the Gateway Film Center had an advanced screening to which we were able to get passes. I've also now given it a second viewing to see where I sit with for my year end list. To get into the movie itself, a widow begins to uncover her recently deceased husband's disturbing secrets.",/review/rw8060626/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2022,jordan2240,3," Typical for what makes 'horror' today
","I thought this started out with some promise, but then it devolved into the typical supernatural b.s. That makes absolutely no sense like most current horror stories. Apparently, dragging people down hallways and making them distort into unnatural shapes is typical of evil spirits and really scary! Additionally, the story itself makes little sense, as the explanation for what happened is, well, stupid. Hall's acting is superb, but it can't save another 'horror' clunker. Waste of time.",/review/rw8060626/?ref_=tt_urv
