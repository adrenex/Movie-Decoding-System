26 October 2013,CinemaClown,," Welcome to the Darkest Side of Cinema
","Controversial, graphic, violent, unsettling, disturbing, devastating & disgusting but an underrated cinema nonetheless that dares to explore the darkest side of adult industry, there's no denying that A Serbian Film is destined to upset majority of viewers with its gross, sickening & utterly discomforting subject matter which is exactly its motive but looking beyond its on- screen depiction of every taboo, it's also a pretty bold piece of filmmaking.",/review/rw2285073/?ref_=tt_urv

","There are some films that should never have been made. This is one of them. It is revolting, twisted and sickening. The film was banned in a number of countries around the globe - with good reason! This is an 'art film' in its worst form. The ending was completely dissatisfying. I don't recommend this at all.",/review/rw2285073/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2011,Meven_Stoffat,1," Crueler than cruel, darker than dark, more vile than vile entertainment
","A Serbian Film is an ugly, cruel, nihilistic and depressing movie- one I regret having seen. I definitely recommend you stay away from it- no matter how much you love ""shock"" movies, or if you can take ""sick, shocking stuff"". Mind you, I can stand shock movies. One of my top films of all time, Cannibal Holocaust, is a film that is considered a ""shock"" film, but it's more than just a film with shock scenes, as the ending challenges the viewer to question our corrupt morals nowadays. A Serbian Film does not do that at all, it exists only to subject its viewer to ugly, vile, and repugnant stuff that would make the Saw movies look like a teddy bear's picnic.",/review/rw2285073/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2019,michaelnobleb-83955,," Just a slight warning, can't rate it because it would be unfair.
","I'm not sure why I'm writing this review to be quite honest. I saw this movie about seven years ago. Since then I've gotten married, had children, had my share of ups and downs, but one thing remains constant. More often than not, I take a few seconds out of my week to think about this movie and the impression that it has left on me. A problem I didn't realize I had until just now in this moment. I came here to check the reviews on a movie to watch with my kids and ended up subconsciously typing this movie into the search bar.",/review/rw2285073/?ref_=tt_urv

",Without a doubt this is one of the most disturbing movies and the responses it has received have been polar opposites. Some have described it as fascinating and mild-blowing and others have called it torture trash. I was warned about it beforehand but I like to challenge myself once in a while. Now I can watch movies like 'Feed' and 'Irreverible' and be shaken and admired by them.,/review/rw2285073/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2018,Leofwine_draca,1," Depraved
","Many films nowadays claim to be the ""most shocking ever"" and A SERBIAN FILM is such a movie; it only exists in order to offend, but sadly it has nothing to go along with the offensive scenes. It's a cheap, ugly-looking independent production about an ageing porn star who gets coerced into shooting a new movie, but he finds his life spiralling out of control. There's absolutely nothing to recommend about this unpleasant film; scenes of hinted child abuse and the like are supposed to be edgy and shocking, but they're staged in such a ridiculous fashion that they'll have no traumatic effect on any viewer.",/review/rw2285073/?ref_=tt_urv

","Im speechless about this movies. if you are a heavyweight twisted , horror extreme movie fan then this one will blow you off. I have seen some heavy ones but nothing compared to this one. I don't recommend it to anybody. This movie is between the limits of art and twisted mind perversion. You should be aware with whom you watch it, and definitely NOT recommended for kids , i would even say now even for young adults. i hope i will never hit the cinemas. I only recommend this movie for really movie addicts who can might see the good side out of it.There is nothing more to write about it. it went beyond of what i can call a movie. ....... extreme sex contend with extreme violence.",/review/rw2285073/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2011,Andy-296,1," A sick film
","I'm not easily offended, and in fact I like edgy movies, but this film is totally sick. What is sad about it is that the director is not untalented, and for the first hour this seems to be a very good if disturbing movie. Unfortunately, the last half hour goes downhill in the most sickening way. In Serbia, Milos, a former porn legend, currently out of work and living a family life with a wife and a small kid, is tempted with huge money to step out of retirement to participate in a new kind of artsy porn film. He is not told the argument of the movie (as if porno films have such things) and the mysterious director, one Vukmir, seems totally off the rocks. But since he needs the money he agrees to do it. Unfortunately, his misgivings turn out to be very true, since he is soon forced to participate in increasingly degrading acts, a nonstop parade of horrors (including, and I suppose I'm giving some spoilers here, killing a woman with a machete while he is having intercourse with her, the rape of a baby and of his own small kid) for which he will eventually take revenge. As I said, I think there is some talent here, but is so sick that is not worth it. What is laughable is some reviews I read which try to justify this film as a metaphor or an allegory for the rape of Serbia during the war or something like that. Believe me, there is nothing here about that.",/review/rw2285073/?ref_=tt_urv

There are already many good reviews here dealing with the cinematographic, technical, cultural etc aspects of this film, so I won't add anything new there. This is not about the film, but about you, the potential viewer.",/review/rw2285073/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2011,Radu_A,6," 'A Serbian Film' from an academical point of view
","I've written a book and some articles about film censorship, so given the controversy looming around this particular film, and its highly interesting release history in the UK (read wikipedia for more), I got my hands on a pre-release uncensored copy. What's very interesting is that apart from some suggestive shots hinting at pedophilia and the extension of the film's most gruesome, unforgettable scene, it's all there, only left to the imagination - leaving me with the question I've come up with whenever confronted with such a case: if censorship leaves certain aspects to the spectator's imagination, isn't the effect even more stimulating?

","Now I LOVE my horror, gore, video nasties, scary stuff etc and have watched pretty much everything there is out there........I heard about 'Serbian Film' and have to admit like most people with my kind of film interest just HAD to see it ASAP purely to see if it lived up to the hype. Well I wish I hadn't now wasted those 2 hours of my life for many reasons. 1) The storyline is basically 'past-it porn star signs up for a snuff film' 2)The film drags and drags on and then there is a disgusting scene blah blah.............. Now if you want to watch a man assisting a woman in the birth of her baby and then straight away drop his pants and start raping it infront of her whilst it screams uncontrollably you seriously need help. That should have put you off even reading any further but if it didn't the main actor finds himself viciously raping his own son who has been drugged........I really am not going to say anymore. If stuff like this attracts you to a film then you have major issues......I don't care about the 'dialogue, the pretty scenery, the atmosphere' blah blah as this film is DISGUSTING and Unnecessary :( I snapped the DVD the minute after ide finished watching it, then put it in a bin bag.....in next doors bin !!!!!",/review/rw2285073/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2011,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,9," A milestone for pulp cinema
","First, I want to say that I disagree with everyone who argues that this movie is simply made for explicit shock value with no other purpose. I can quarrel this with two simple points: 1. I am a male porn performer myself and immediately found there to be a handful of real concepts, thoughts, and fears to relate with Milos on within the first fifteen minutes of the film (desensitization, your position in a family setting as a pornographer, to take the job or not to take the job, etc). Now, I'm sorry if you have no way of grasping that he is a realistic and admirable character in believable shoes, but he is. The level of relation I found with Milos shocked and impressed me and made me wonder if either that screenwriter had had some personal experience as a porn performer in the past, or instead was just a really intelligent person who was able to grasp it without actually experiencing it.",/review/rw2285073/?ref_=tt_urv

5 April 2020,natea_teodor,1," I hope this movie gets erased from History!
","I won't include spoilers here, everyone is free to watch any movie he wants. That's free will and Internet is accessible to anyone!
But if you decide to watch such ""art"", then you will be deeply disappointed!
Because honestly, that's not even a movie! The first 50 minutes of the movie are just a prologue. You are just ""introduced"" into the plot, how the main character got tricked to destroy himself.
A lot of people recommended to me this movie. They even said ""hey Teodor, you should watch this movie, I know you like dark stuff, that's a treat for you.""""
And today I decided to follow this. I was encouraged by a large curiosity honestly. I watched 50 minutes of it painfully because nothing was happening. They just talked, made plans. And then I was hit by gruesome.
I can handle pretty much anything. I am not the kind of guy which sees something gore and I rush to the bathroom to throw up. I really enjoy it actually. Is part of the movie. It is ...... art!
But A Serbian Movie (or Film ... or Srpski Film whatever) takes everything to another level. A level of stupidity and gruesome.
Honestly, as a personal opinion: You NEED TO BE MENTALLY ILL and have serious MENTAL PROBLEMS to watch this movie and give it 10 stars, to enjoy it! You can't enjoy a movie like this one. That's not ART! That's not A MOVIE! That's SICK! That's a serious disaster.
I really really hope they used CGI in this movie. Some scenes are too difficult to watch, even for a ""veteran"" like me. I watched a lot of crazy movies, but this one is different. And is different in a bad way. It's just... not worthy. You will just waste 90 minutes out of your lives and after this you will just ask yourself ""Why???! Why did I even watched this S%(@ and why this movie was invented?? Who is behind this contraption and how does he is not in prison for life yet???""""",/review/rw2285073/?ref_=tt_urv

10 April 2010,grindhouse74,7," Cinema at its most Extreme......I dare you to see this...
","So you think you have seen it all???? Think again, i reckon i have just witnessed the most disturbing extreme movie ever, and you know what, for the first time i have no idea whether to give this film a good review or a bad review, its not a film that you can enjoy, although it was very well made and preformed by the actors, so in a visual and technical term it was impressive.. The premise for this little shocker is simple, a semi-retired porn star is lured back to his profession to do this once in a lifetime shoot so he can make lots of money and secure his family, but he has no idea what the shoot will contain, so we the viewer have a birds eye view in the dark and very murky journey he goes through, as the porn shoot becomes more extreme he begins to realise what he's got himself into and the director has a shocking surprise for his lead actor in what he wants him to do, not to spoil anything (its a taboo busting subject) but lets just say that if you put Cannibal holocaust, Irreversible, Emanuel In America, and Martyrs in a blender, throw a baby in the mix and you have an idea what your letting yourself in for.....I know some people will be very upset watching this film and some people will demand that this film be banned, there are some scenes of extreme sexual violence that will anger some of the mainstream crowd, i just hope that the censors will leave this film the way the director intended.. Be cautious when you see this movie, if it gets a proper release this film will get mixed reviews, it will be sure to divide people apart and thats the beauty of this controversial film, love it or hate it, you will never forget it.

","I first watched A Serbian Film uncut once, online, and then after that, it was removed from the site it was on (which was a good job, considering the site is very popular and has an under 18/21 audience). Was I shocked by it? No. Did I find it interesting or thought-provoking? Not at all. Am I a lover of a horror films? You bet. So now you must be wondering, well why did I watch A Serbian Film knowing what it was about then come on here and give it a bum rap. Well. I heard of it through friends and websites, and being a lover of horror movies, and a fan that likes to ""have seen it all"" I obviously was going to watch A Serbian Film sooner or later. First of, don't get me wrong, it's not the violence in this movie that makes me dislike it, it's how they tried to be so over the top about it, and in doing so, it makes it look like a futile piece of crap.

28 October 2011,Smells_Like_Cheese,7," Gruesome
","On the internet one of the films that has had the biggest buzz that I noticed was a movie called A Serbian Film, getting so many bans and claiming to be too extreme to show to any audience. Naturally being the freak that I am love to see the forbidden, I've seen a lot of extreme films trying to test my limits on what I can take. For some reason I did build this movie up in my head to make it a lot worse than I could imagine, which wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. However, this did push my limits and not even with the particular ""newborn"" scene that is usually the center of attention, keeping in mind that I watched films like The Exorcist and Jaws when I was a child so I know what's a movie and what's reality, it's the ending that killed me. The reason I love extreme films is because I feel that a lot of films are so watered down with the truth and that bad things do happen to good people. It's a hard reality to accept and you don't want to believe it, we close our eyes to a lot of crimes every day. I thought that A Serbian Film was going to be like that, I know the porn industry has been labeled as too extreme for a lot of people to quit or end up dying of disease or drug over dose, but this took it to a much darker level of almost being a snuff film done in a Hollywood way.",/review/rw2285073/?ref_=tt_urv

25 July 2010,meccanici,2," Every exploitation trick in the book . .
","This review contains spoilers - and descriptions of scenes depicted in 
 Srpski Film.
 
 A baby is graphically birthed on screen by a large bald man. The mother 
 lies prone, and pushes the baby out into his hands. He then takes down 
 his underwear, and rapes the screaming newborn baby - on screen.
 
 A man is shown violently anally raping (onscreen) a young child - his 
 own son, after he is injected with massive doses of a powerful sexual 
 stimulant. The boy - presumably also drugged - lies face-down, bleeding 
 profusely from his anus as the man continues a sustained sexual attack.
 
 Evidently, this is art.
 
 The thing that bothered me the most about Srpski Film isn't necessarily 
 its use of deliberate shock, and taboo busting scenes designed to 
 offend. It is the way in which Srdjan Spasojevic tries to cover his 
 dubious tracks by passing it off as some kind of artistic political 
 allegory about life in Serbia.
 
 I was aware of the fact that I was increasingly annoyed as I watched 
 this film - mainly because the filmmakers use every trick in the book, 
 and obviously some new ones to batter the viewer over the head with 
 aggressive imagery, in order to make enough social fuss to draw in 
 viewers. It doesn't necessarily make it a good film, although it is 
 admittedly well shot, and well acted.
 
 It almost reminded me of seeing footage of beheadings on the internet. 
 It's supposed to be profound in some way, but ultimately it is just 
 irredeemable pain and destruction, and contains no social commentary at 
 all.
 
 Realistic torture and extremely graphic rape scenes usually make a 
 negative impact on the viewer, because they are horrific and unpleasant 
 subjects. Using babies and children does not make it artistic, 
 independent of your cultural origins - although some people claim that 
 it is art. I saw another review of this film that evidently recognised 
 genuine ""art"" in every single frame
 
 I, like some of the other reviewers - have happily watched horror and 
 exploitation movies for years - but so what? It doesn't make any 
 difference whatsoever. Sub-genres come and go, and the recent tide of 
 shocking torture films are more akin to a test of the viewer's resolve, 
 than the slices of entertainment they used to be. Fair enough - if you 
 don't like them then don't watch.
 
 I am a film fan. I definitely love film. I just don't love this kind of 
 film, or the thinly veiled attempts to disguise absolute exploitation 
 as something profound.",/review/rw2285073/?ref_=tt_urv
