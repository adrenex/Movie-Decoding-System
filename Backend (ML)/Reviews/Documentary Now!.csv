","Nymph()maniac, if I've to describe in a single sentence, is director Lars von Trier trying to sell his bland & banal softcore as a work of art. Divided into 2 volumes, Nymph()maniac is the final chapter in what is now being labeled as Depression Trilogy (preceded by Antichrist & Melancholia) and tells the story of a self-diagnosed nymphomaniac named Joe recounting her life's sexual experiences to Seligman; the man who found her badly-beaten up in some deserted alley plus who later tries to connect & analyze her stories with whatever he has read about.",/review/rw2952120/?ref_=tt_urv

24 May 2014,KineticSeoul,3," It gets worse
","Lars is one of those directors that is emphasis the freedom of speech and tries to be controversial. However sometimes, there is a limit to that. And I am not one of the viewers that nitpick or makes a big deal out of this in movies. But this one really pushes the limit with it's messages about how pedophiles deserve a medal for not giving into the desires with action. Seriously what the crap man? I feel the second part was just not really necessary and really could have combined it into a 3 or so hour movie. This is the spiraling downward story of Joe and it really drags a lot. I am not sure if the main goal for Lars was to bore and make the audiences depressed a great deal through this volume, but if so it does the trick. The dialogue this time around is also really boring and lost it's somewhat interesting flare that the first volume has. The message seems to be that there is no hope, people are all selfish hypocrites even the ones trying to do the right things, there is not point in caring for others because people are crap. And that is what this movie seems to come down to. I am cool with people being entitled to their own opinions although I may disagree. But this Vol is all about shock factor, but it just got boring and annoying really quickly and just wanted it all to end. Even if it has a crappy ending. Now when it comes to the ending of this movie, some critics seem to feel that it's a betrayal and a middle finger to the audiences. I actually re-watched certain scenes to see if there is any symbol or messages that I might have missed that leads to the ending. And not really, the ending really is a cop out. It's like Lars was inspired by movies like ""Irreversible"" or ""Man Bites Dog"" and was like Lars was thinking ""I can't let this movie have a somewhat happy ending, it needs to end with a tragedy. Even if that tragedy is just smacked on there because I am all about melancholia"". Maybe he just wanted to shock the audiences one last time, like you know it's coming but giving hope to the audiences and then crushing it. Some say Seligman was trying to sacrifice himself others say it's to show the unavoidable power of sexual desire and hypocrisy as the human condition. Knowing a bit about Lars, it would have to be the latter.",/review/rw2952120/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2014,RevRonster,3," It was hard to not laugh at the end...
","Overall, I thought the first one was okay. Even though a majority of the time I was bored with the story, I did think it was somewhat interesting and I felt the acting was very good in it. I also felt the real sex element of the film was nothing more than a gimmick to create buzz but it wasn't so bad that it tossed me out of the film. However, I didn't really feel the same in the second installment.",/review/rw2952120/?ref_=tt_urv

5 March 2015,lubchka6,1," Feces on a wall calling itself art is still just feces.
","Where to start? Watching Nymphomaniac, both volumes, is like going to an art show where feces is displayed, and everyone is standing around discussing the contours, layers, lighting, and you're standing quietly thinking to yourself, "" I must be missing something. This is art! Isn't it?"" Basically, the story of emperor's new clothes at its finest. I will be bold enough to say that no, I'm not missing anything. It really is just sh** I'm looking at. My final thought at the end of both volumes was ""wow, those are hours I'm never going to get back."" And it's not that the movie was all bad. Charlotte is wonderful, as are all the other actors. The topic is interesting. I didn't mind the nudity and I wasn't offended by any of it. There just isn't any point to it at all! None. Just when you think there may be some point in the friendship she develops with an asexual male, the story stuffs that thought into the toilet in the most confusing unnecessary way. Or when you think there is some point to her love story with Jerome, that is trashed in a very stupid way too. And if the director thinks that he is building up, just to let us down, well, he fails to build anything up since the whole movie is so boring and monotone. There just no point. And if the point of the movie is that there is no point, then why the Hell am I stuck staring at the screen for so long? Anyways, I am utterly disappointed. This is poop.",/review/rw2952120/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2014,FrostyChud,10," Portrait of a failed psychoanalysis
","NYMPHOMANIAC is the most exciting, intelligent film I have seen in a long time. The moment I saw Seligmann shuffle out of his apartment to Rammstein, I knew I was in the hands of a filmmaker I could trust. This scene was the first of many at which I found myself exulting inside. GO, LARS, GO! NYMPHOMANIAC is von Trier's F-14 and he takes it on bombing run after bombing run, destroying a different pious hypocrisy each time. The film is full of all sorts of audacious touches that no other filmmakers working today have the guts or brains to include in their boring, sentimental, ideological films.

20 June 2016,Leofwine_draca,5," The lesser of the two films
","Lars von Trier's second film about the life story of a female nymphomaniac goes down increasingly dark alleyways compared to VOL. I, but at the same time I found it the lesser movie. This film just doesn't have the drive or vitality that made the first film so interesting, and there are some odd plot decisions - especially towards the climax - that don't ring true.",/review/rw2952120/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2015,maripere95,2," The movie rails off into an unwanted territory
","The characters all end up committing heinous acts that throughout the runtime of two films would lead you to think is completely unlike them at all. Not only is the final act a giant figurative middle finger to the audience, but it also decides to give all the characters completely new personalities just to be able to create a shocking ending. What is so infuriating about the ending, is that there was no built-up or anything suggesting that the characters were capable of doing these acts. It is not as if only one character were to do something that is ""outside of their character,"" but it is pretty much everyone in the movie decides to do something completely unlike themselves all at the same time, just to be able to have an unsatisfying climactic conclusion. Other than the final act, the other scenes also seem to delve more into fetishism instead of focusing on the central ""problem,"" which is her sex addiction (or nymphomania). The movie rails off into an unwanted territory and brings all 4+ hours of these two volumes to not only a disappointing ending, but also an ending that is insulting to its audience.",/review/rw2952120/?ref_=tt_urv

3 February 2015,estreet-eva,3," Less pointless sleaziness than the 1st but not much better
","Although shot as one film, the second half of Von Trier's pornographic decent into debauchery at least picks up some substance as the titular character Joe starts to suffer for her obsession. The purposeful shock value remains high with scenes pulled directly from interracial porn and from ""50 Shades of Grey"". Von Trier plays some of these as dark comedy but more of the snort rather than laugh out loud variety. At least we do get to see some real outcomes from the real condition of sex addiction (as opposed to the pretend kind that Tiger Woods had so he could go back to endorsing products after ""rehab"") including job loss and having to go to meetings. Joe's choice of abandoned her son to feed her compulsion makes her less of a charactacture. However, the overall sleaze of the enterprise still makes this one to avoid. In short, if you were hoping to redeem the time you spent watching the first one, it doesn't happen.",/review/rw2952120/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2014,ohthatgigi,3," Lars chose the worst ending
","Now we come to the second half, the light and brisk tone turned into darkness and intense.The volume II completed itself to a whole encyclopedia of sex, basically it encompass some most hitted genre of pornography, the heartrending yet anticipatory breakup with Shia and her son, the grotesquely sadistic sexual experience(Jamie Bell is a seductive rising star I think he looks extremely authoritative even in a gray sweatshirt), the lesbian trans-generational sexbut I have to say the second half chose the WORST ending.

",I have written quite exhaustive review of this movie but Socialist State of IMDb kinda prohibits some words - but in a very Kafkaesque manner does not explain which ones. That's somewhat unfortunate as the movie Nymphomaniac can only be described by words that describe some mature content activities. I mean some really depraved mature content activities.,/review/rw2952120/?ref_=tt_urv

Though both movies have the same tone, Kill Bill vol 2 runs at a different pace, and I was feeling that somewhat with vol II of Nymphomaniac, but while Kill Bill vol 2 was still entertaining, I was missing that with the second Volume of Nymphomaniac.",/review/rw2952120/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2017,filipemanuelneto,1," A mediocre end to a movie that had not started very well.
","Contrary, perhaps, to the majority of the public, I decided to see this film because of the name of its director, Lars von Trier. If I liked ""Antichrist"" and I considered this film particularly artistic, I do not know yet very well what to think about this film, which is the second half of a movie that, in fact, has already started quite badly, with a Vol. I weaker than I expected. The script continues the conversation between Joe and his good Samaritan, the innocent and asexual Seligman. The story gradually becomes more dense, with the protagonist descending deeper into her own perversion: sadomasochism, beatings, the destruction of her own family with dramatic consequences for her only child, the way of crime... all seems to reveal the worst consequences of sex addiction. However, as it all grows darker, the film loses verisimilitude and becomes an unbelievable sexual tale.",/review/rw2952120/?ref_=tt_urv

9 January 2016,wmennisny-617-254276,2," Just when I thought it couldn't get worse after Vol 1...
","I'm going to keep it straight to the point. Just when I thought, after vol. 1 that it couldn't get worse, along comes the nadir of blackness and utter hopelessness. I know Von Triers from ""Dancer In The Dark"", a film that I liked but found nearly unbearable to watch and only saw once and never want to see again. I recognize the talent, however, and braced myself for another helping. Little did I know what I was really in for. The bottom line is that these films depict a world inhabited by people that are desperately and hopelessly doomed. I've never seen such nihilistic portrayals in my life. I'm all for ""realism"" in films but I don't want to be thrown into the ""real lives"" of these people....no, no a thousand times no! Their world is so bleak and hopeless and devoid of any affection or warmth or light that it simply looses any sense to it. The lives of these people have not an iota of the elements that make living worthwhile so once that's realized, after about a minute, it becomes pure torture. I pride myself on my level of tolerance for the fetishes and idiosyncrasies that people have but sheer brutality is something that I know exists but care not to be thrown into in brutal graphic detail. These are the most bleak and depressing films ever made to my knowledge.",/review/rw2952120/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2015,troyputland,3," Lars von Trier up to his usual tricks again.
","Lars von Trier. If you know the name then you're aware of the avant-garde, ambiguous style he produces in every feature film he's made. Nymphomaniac, with its two parts and 240 minute running time, has its cast practicing real sex acts. It's the sole reason why this film has garnered so much attention. Overlooked is everything else in between. Joe (Gainsbourg) tells her tale of emotional and physical highs and lows to Seligman (Skarsgard), a dutiful, friendly fellow that helps her after an assault. Her life's story is split up into metaphorical chapters, from the moment she finds her sexuality as a young girl, up to present day. Gainsbourg is a fine example of ideal casting, looking the part before baring any skin. Her story telling is clunky and disjointed. Lars von Trier's scriptwriting is dry, elusive and as ambiguous as a white canvas. The C word's blurted out more times by Gainsbourg than seen, grating like nails on a chalkboard. The acting's authentic, by all accounts (most notable is Stacy Martin playing young Joe), but only when dialogue is absent (Shia LaBeouf's accent is diabolical). The scenes that contain nudity represent nymphomania. Porn's toes are not being trod on. Nymphomaniac's easier to digest than other LvT films. Some viewers may feel short changed and a little underwhelmed, both physically and emotionally, by the end.",/review/rw2952120/?ref_=tt_urv
