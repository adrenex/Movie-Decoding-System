","While the world was still recovering from the over-hyped Todd Phillips movie a smaller, quieter, but funnier movie slipped into cinemas and made a little splash. Both feature groups of troubled men looking for a good time, but Hot Tub Time Machine is just madder and more inventive.",/review/rw2296146/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2015,kosmasp,8," Back in time
","Not an instant classic, but a lot of fun to watch. I think you can summarize it like that. The main actors are doing a great job selling the very silly idea of time traveling with or rather inside a hot tub! If you get sucked into that, everything else will work too. But if you don't like that general idea ... Maybe you shouldn't watch the movie after all and save yourself the time (and grief).",/review/rw2296146/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2014,SnoopyStyle,7," hilarious 80s references
","Adam (John Cusack) and Nick (Craig Robinson) try to cheer up their suicidal friend Lou (Rob Corddry) by taking him on a ski trip reliving their school days. They take along nephew Jacob (Clark Duke). The resort town is not what they remembered. When they have a drunken night in the hot tub, they travel back in time to 1986.",/review/rw2296146/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2012,g-bodyl,9," Funnier Than Anticipated!
","Hot Tub Time Machine is a much funnier movie than what the film title calls for. I didn't really know what to expect of this film but I got way more than my lowered expectations. This is a funny, sweet film that pays homage to the 1980's. This is a film that made me wish I was a teenager back in the 80's.",/review/rw2296146/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2013,lesleyharris30,8," Hilarious With Some Surprising Heart,
","Hot Tub Time Machine is a great movie with a ridiculous but very funny storyline and a very comedic cast.I mostly enjoyed Craig Robinson in this movie,he isn't a very well known actor,but I really like him in everything i've seen him in,he's a good actor and also very funny,I also really enjoyed John Cusack,i've only seen him in serious roles in the past and I was surprised that he was so good at delivering a funny performance in this.Chevy Chase did a great job in this,but he needed to be in it a lot more,when you manage to get a comedy actor as big as this in your movie,you need to give them more screen time.I was also surprised with the heart in this movie,I thought it would be an American Pie type of comedy,but it was actually very heartwarming at times and I got really attached to these characters.Fans of very goofy comedies will definitely enjoy this movie and will be laughing out loud.",/review/rw2296146/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2019,UniqueParticle,10," Uproariously hilarious
","Originally saw this in the theatre almost 10 years ago and still funny! I laughed so hard my face hurt, this is seriously one of the best comedies ever! Such a great cast John Cusack, Clark Duke, Craig Robinson, and Rob Corddry, so much fun and I absolutely love the Sci-Fi aspect so much, don't think if it's been done before especially with a Hot Tub but it's very refreshing. Also every part with Crispin Clover is exceedingly funny every time I watch this and I have seen it at least 10 times or more. Steve Pink directed a goldmine of legendary comedy with awesome lines and badass scenes.",/review/rw2296146/?ref_=tt_urv

29 December 2011,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,7," Hot Tub Time Machine (2010)
","Hell, it certainly kept me damn entertained. In this day and age it takes real comedy chops to pull off poo and vomit gags with such expert timing. The film embraces the absurdity of time travel and doesn't focus too much on the whys. All four of the male leads are brilliant, especially Corddry, who pulls off one of the great movie arseholes, without completely detaching himself from the audience. There are some classic lines, mostly coming from insults, and the film doesn't rely too much on date humour (just a few references to e-mail etc.) It cleverly spits in the face of the butterfly effect and relishes its characters manipulation of time, whilst showing that some things can't be avoided. A very entertaining comedy.",/review/rw2296146/?ref_=tt_urv

6 September 2019,TheAll-SeeingI,10," It's a Gen X Thing, You Wouldn't Understand
","If you're Generation X, the uproarious ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" will titillate you with the raunchy, yesteryear brand of comedy you crave. Unapologetically heavy on ludicrous sexual and '80s throwback references, this period piece is a huge triumph in buddy movie humor, and serves as a bridge from proudly vulgar predecessors like """,/review/rw2296146/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2010,Qanqor,7," Vastly better than I expected

15 August 2016,cherold,8," Silly, funny 80s redux
","There have been many movies, like Back to the Future or Peggy Sue Got Married, that let the protagonists travel back in time and played with the concept of how their actions could reshape the future. None of them care less about any of that than Hot Tub Time Machine, which really just wants to be a 1980s John Cusack comedy and pretty much manages it.",/review/rw2296146/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2012,tomgillespie2002,6," A film well aware of its own ridiculousness
","The 1980's, it would seem, is back with a bang. Modern music is filled with synthesised melodies and dodgy outfits, fashion brought back leg- warmers (albeit briefly), big sunglasses, and tight jeans, and films have recently been taking a sentimental look back at a time when teen comedies, gory horrors and oiled-up muscle men action films ruled the roost. Yet it is a decade looked back at with as much disdain as it is warmth, pointed out by John Cusack's character Adam in Hot Tub Time Machine, as although he recognises it as the best time of his life, he states that ""we had Reagan and AIDS,"" and exclaims ""I f****n' hated this decade!"".",/review/rw2296146/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2016,Vartiainen,5," Goofy fun
","So, apparently in Mother Russia they lace their energy drinks with nuclear waste. Which in turn, when mixed with a hot tub, allows you to travel back in time. Sounds plausible to me!",/review/rw2296146/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2018,nogodnomasters,8," EXACTLY AS EXPECTED
","With a name like ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" I didn't expect a sophisticated movie. I expected a 1980's style sex comedy with gratuitous nudity, potty humor, and a couple of good jokes. That is exactly what you get.",/review/rw2296146/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2012,judegraysmith,8," Hot Tub rubbish but fun
","I love kitsch and this movie is just that. I like the idea of a hot tub time machine and can only applaud any writer who came up with such a rubbishy idea for a movie. Liked the back to the 80's bits as I too was one of those people dressed liked that. I loved Poison and Skid Row and make no apologies for being a teen in the 80's. Fun movie, just don't expect high art. Think Weekend at Bernie's and you won't be far wrong as far as comedy goes. Well chosen cast. They are playing a bunch life's losers and we can all equate with that. Like I have said in other reviews, I'm a sucker for movies so bad they are good but this one is just a little better than that.",/review/rw2296146/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2010,GirishGowda,7," Ridiculous, Raunchy and Fun
","What a stupid title for a John Cusack movie! John Cusack doesn't steal the limelight, instead everybody is given an equal chance to shine. When the opening scene had Nick putting his hands inside a dog, you know that what kind of a movie this will be. The characters quickly establish themselves as 'assholes' and if you can get over the initial nauseating feeling, you are in for a fun ride. I am a big fan of John Cusack and he has not let me down most of the times and he is a good bet to take. If you liked 'The Hangover', then you are going to love 'Hot Tub Time Machine'. The movie is very raunchy, over the top and gross, but in a good way. The chemistry between the main characters is spectacular. The music score is superb, so is the acting. Authenticity and common sense is thrown out the window, but just enjoy in this Hot Tub folks.",/review/rw2296146/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2010,whosyourdrummer1,8," Forget reality and enjoy this movie
","Although as a warning this movie had some pretty intense language, and very crude humor I enjoyed it so much. The actual plot of this movie as depicted on the trailer is in no way realistic at all which adds to it's humor. Isn't that what we go to the movies for? A little escape of reality for a while? This movie from first moment to last is hilarious in every way and the jokes keep rolling. This movie is like all of the greater 80's movies piled into one with a mix of Back to the Future. Every character in this movie had a significant number of hilarious jokes, and the entire audience was laughing hysterically. In my opinion this was better than The Hangover because every 2 minutes I found myself laughing harder and harder at every joke. Great movie.",/review/rw2296146/?ref_=tt_urv

13 January 2021,vithiet,7," Dumb but entertaining with many funny moments.
","I never wanted to watch this movie because I thought it would be stupid and not funny. My friend made me, and in the end we had a good time watching it. It is dumb, but maybe going in with very low expectations made it better. In the current state of the world, it's actually pretty nice to turn your brain's off switch and just enjoy something simple.",/review/rw2296146/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2010,claudio_carvalho,6," Entertaining Comedy
","Nick Weber (Craig Robinson) has been cheated by his wife and has a boring job. Adam (John Cusack) has been dumped by his girlfriend and his twenty year-old nerd nephew Jacob (Clark Duke) spends his time playing video-game in the basement of his house. When their alcoholic friend Lou Dorchen (Rob Corddry) tries to commit suicide, Nick and Adam invite the suicidal to travel with them and Jacob to a winter resort where they had been together twenty and something years ago. The losers drink in a hot tub and mysteriously they are taken back to the 1986 Winter Festival in the resort. They agree to live that day the same way they did in the past expecting to return to the present. But there are many temptations to change that night that has affected their lives forever.",/review/rw2296146/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2017,Tweekums,7," Funny if somewhat crude time travel comedy
","It is 2010 and three friends' lives haven't turned out how they hoped; Adam has just been dumped, Nick gave up on his dream of being a singer and Lou is suicidal. After Lou tries to kill himself the others decide that the three of them, along with Adam's nephew Jacob, should revisit the ski resort that they had a great time at in '86. It is no longer a rockin' town; businesses are closed and their hotel is rundown at least the hot tub works. As the quartet get drunk in the tub they accidentally spill an illegal Russian energy drink onto the controls; in the morning everything is different they are back in 1986! A look in the mirror shows that the three older men are actually in the bodies of their younger selves and Jacob flickers slightly. With some knowledge of time travel movies they decide that they should try to do exactly what they did before in the hope they may be able to get back and Jacob will be born. It won't be easy though as there are plenty of things they don't want to do again and temptations to have some fun.",/review/rw2296146/?ref_=tt_urv
