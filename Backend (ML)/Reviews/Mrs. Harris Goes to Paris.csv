23 March 2021,siderite,9," A huge improvement over the 2017 cut
","I don't want to discuss the Machiavellian machinations that led to the butchery cut from 2017 and then to this one seeing the light of day - suffice to say that I am not hopeful for the future - yet I am grateful for them leading to me getting to see Zack Snyder's cut. Other than being way too long, it was a pretty perfect film. It would have been a much better business decision to split it into two films and getting twice the money from cinemas than to cut and reshoot it into stupidity.",/review/rw6752839/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2021,Prismark10,8," Zack Snyder's Justice League
","There was a time I would go to the cinema, watch a movie like Superman II or Raiders of the Lost Ark. I would think I really liked that movie, could had done with another 30 minutes added on to it, what a ride.",/review/rw6752839/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2021,rajon07,9," This is the Justice League movie we deserve
","As a life long comic fan, DC characters are more close to my heart than Marvel characters. The first making of this film was just disappointing. It seems like there are bunch of idiots sitting on the WB executive positions who have no vision at all. The first film was literally incomplete. This one tells the full story and I must say nicely. This is the movie we, all the fans wanted and deserve.",/review/rw6752839/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2021,mrsgatorbranch1217,8," Wow... so much better than the one that went to theaters
",Zach Snyder's original version is 1000 x's better than the one Joss Whedon put in theaters. DC made a huge mistake not trusting Synder.,/review/rw6752839/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2021,Pyro_Pizza,8," Long, but worth it.
","Zack Snyder's Justice league is an excellent movie. It is however 4 hours long. And I never got bored watching any of it. It's a masterpiece and testament to Synder's vision for his movie that we should have gotten to see back in 2017. He fixed the problems with Justice League (2017) and improved upon them, must watch for any comic book fan.",/review/rw6752839/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2021,deeformecreep,10," It leaves you asking for more!
","Zack Snyder delivers by far his best film with Justice League. The film has an engaging story with a lot of heart and a great cast of characters who all have good chemistry together standouts being Ezra Millers Flash and Ray Fishers Cyborg. The film also has many easter eggs and cameos fans of the comics will recognize.
Honestly as a big fan of DC this is my favorite DCEU film.",/review/rw6752839/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2021,aminussh,9," Incredible, far better than previous cut
","Zack snyder's justice league is far better than theatrical cut, in every way you can think of, steppenwolf is an actual threat now, his cgi is great, he has a clear goal, but cyborg is the heart of the movie and one of the best characters, Snyder did each hero justice, and flash powers are incredible and mind-blowing, Wonder woman is nothing like what we've seen in ww84, she is a valiant warrior and badass character, I really liked how they portrayed darkseid and paved the way for a potential JL2, he is an absolute great villain, and junkie xl music is really epic and great, overall 9/10 for this movie, I just had one problem with it: too much slow-motions
NOW, it's time to RESTORE THE SNYDERVERSE",/review/rw6752839/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2021,cricketbat,8," I'm glad that they found a way to resurrect this superhero film
","While it's not a perfect movie, Zack Snyder's Justice League is definitely better than Joss Whedon's version. Although it almost seems like cheating because Snyder got four hours to tell this superhero story, where the 2017 movie only had two. Still, this gives more room for character development, the storyline makes more sense, and there are some really cool moments. It didn't feel too long to me, actually, but I hope this doesn't usher in the era of 4+ hour films.",/review/rw6752839/?ref_=tt_urv

29 March 2021,rtbradford,8," Much Better Movie
","This version is so much better than the originally released movie. At first, I didn't understand what all the excitement and hype were about when it was announced that the Snyder version was being released, but now I understand. The originally released movie was pretty awful. The storyline was disjointed and the character development was almost nonexistent. The Snyder version provided us with full storylines and character development for Cyborg and The Flash as well as eliminating some extraneous material that didn't add to the movie. If you like DC comics and were disappointed with the 2017 version of Justice League, go and see this version. You will be pleasantly surprised at how much better it is than the original.",/review/rw6752839/?ref_=tt_urv

","The story of ""Man of Steel"" and ""Batman vs. Superman"" is continued in this movie in such an epic way. This is totally different than the theatrical version.

","It was the longest movie that I've seen in my entire life. Despite being 4 hours length it didn't feel like that, all that time just flew away. That's main point which shows that this film was interesting to watch. I've seen first Justice League and now seeing this I can see some similarities but there are more differences in a good way. I've enjoyed plot, it was easy to follow, interesting to watch, it kept your attention whole time. Can't say a lot about acting it was on point, really good, main actors did great job (yeah, there are some awkward scenes but just few). The main concern I have is effects. As a viewer I saw that there was a lot of slow-mo or speed- up scenes to make CGI smooth (that's my guess) but that just made some scenes less realistic. I really admire some special effects, colors and details but some scenes have major problems. I would say this movie deserves about 7.3-7.4/10 but, as this is the best film, that I've seen, so far in this year, I raised my mark to 8. I would encourage to watch this movie for comics, DC or even Marvel fans because it's really good.",/review/rw6752839/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2021,kevin_robbins,10," This was so good from beginning to end and had a nice pace between storyline and action scenes.
","Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021) is a movie the Mrs. And I watched the night it was released to HBOMax...the entire 4 hours. Man we loved it. The storyline focuses on a premonition given to Batman that tells him a world conqueror is on its way to Earth and he needs to assemble some rumored and identify companions to face the invader. Follow his crusade while meanwhile, the world conquerors minions have already arrived to Earth and set the stage for an epic showdown. This movie is directed by Zack Snyder (300) and stars Henry Cavill (Man of Steel), Ben Affleck (Gone Girl), Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman), Amy Adams (Doubt), Jason Mamoa (Aquaman), Jeremy Irons (Dead Ringers) and Diane Lane (The Outsiders). My description does not do the storyline justice. The execution of the villain and how impactful he was as a foe was excellent. We loved Steppenwolf. The vastness of the Amazonian island in the opening sequence was a great kickoff to the movie. I liked how Aquaman was portrayed in this version as well as the ripple-effect of losing Superman, for his family as well as to the overall planet. This was so good from beginning to end and had a nice pace between storyline and action scenes. We are fortunate Snyder came back and gave us this version and this is one of my favorite super hero moves I have seen in some time. This is almost a perfect film that I'd score a 9.5/10.",/review/rw6752839/?ref_=tt_urv

","I loved the movie from the beggining to the end.Just like Ray fisher said,I was hoping that the movie doesn't end. The begging scene was mind blowing, liked that scene very much. Unlike 'the Justice League' the movie show every hero is best at their own thing, make us love every charecters.
Thanks Zack and the whole team.",/review/rw6752839/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2021,jack_pearson,10," What in the hell was that
","I cannot believe WB ever thought any of what i just watched was bad material. zacks version is better in literally every way possible, it's a 4 hour movie but it doesn't feel like it, never drags and i actually was disappointed when it ended because i wanted more. the pacing is incredible, the story is coherent unlike the 2017 cut. the music was insane, junkie XL outdid himself especially with wonder woman's theme; i don't understand how zack can make WW this fierce badass but she was a joke in her own movie. You can tell the difference of when a director respects the characters given to him; every single one of these heroes was a joke in whedon's cut especially batman and cyborg but zack gave batman and everyone else the respect they deserve. the only flaw is that it ended, thank you snyder for this universe and thank you to all the fans who made it possible",/review/rw6752839/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2021,amirfalcon,9," So Snyder's Cut
","Most Critics said that there is no difference between this version and that whedon crap version , but yet we know where's that opinions come from.
Snyder's Cut was complete and more believable than the whedon version and more importantly the last three sequences first the last fight with flash back in time , second one luther breakout from arkham and the unique one ""The Nightmare"" and when i saw LETO as joker that's far from what i saw in suicide squad crap , brilliant job done from snyder because he pull that acting from leto and that's where a real director can show the QUALITY",/review/rw6752839/?ref_=tt_urv

","Gonna keep this short. It was worth the wait, despite the DCU's cinematic history and it's inferior ""Josstice League"". It's 4 hour runtime wisps by with its perfect pacing and attention to detail. This is definitely the definitive verison and Zack Snyders vision as intended. 10/10.",/review/rw6752839/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2021,classicsoncall,8," ""There is no us without him.""
","If you know the history of this film, you'll know it's not a sequel to 2017's ""Justice League"", but more a replacement of it. At four hours, double the run time of the earlier picture, it delves more deeply into the back stories of The Flash/Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) and Cyborg/Victor Stone (Ray Fisher), which is commendable, since they didn't get their own full treatments like Wonder Woman and Aquaman. The story here revolves around the the three mother boxes that the main villain Steppenwolf seeks to bring together to usher in the Unity, which would bring about the destruction of the planet. If you grew up a DC comic book fan in the Sixties, you would take the formation of the Justice League to have occurred among super-hero friends who all knew each other, so it was a bit of a disconnect for me to see how tough a job it was for Batman (Ben Affleck) to get some of the others to join him in his mission. Also, with Steppenwolf reporting to two masters, both DeSaad and Darkseid, you had to wonder at times why Darkseid himself wouldn't just step in to do all of his own dirty work instead of relying on intermediaries. The comic book stories take the time to drag out all these relationships over time, but in a compressed format, even if four hours, it just makes me wonder. I had to wonder too, why Steppenwolf made such a big deal about locating the third mother box on Earth. After all, the second mother box was also located on Earth, just under the ocean in Aquaman's realm. It would have been preferable I think for Superman (Henry Cavill) to have a larger role in the story, though his reuniting with Lois Lane (Amy Adams) and his mother (Diane Lane) allowed for some poignant moments that offered some of the best dialog in the picture. Ultimately, the Zack Snyder cut offers an epic story line that fans can enjoy in chapter segments if the four hour run time proves a bit antsy, giving fans what they missed out on in the earlier version.",/review/rw6752839/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2021,JoelAlexanderr,4," Overlong and unnecessary
","If I had to describe ZACK SNYDER'S JUSTICE LEAGUE in one word, it'd be ""tiring."" By the end of this four-hour-long saga (yes, you read that correctly), I just wanted to take a nice long nap and give myself a break from the constant CGI battles, overuse of slow motion, and all-over-the-place storyline.",/review/rw6752839/?ref_=tt_urv
