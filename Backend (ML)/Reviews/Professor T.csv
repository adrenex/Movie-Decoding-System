28 April 2016,Benski2046,10," A sublimely dark fairytale
","Remember when Channel 4 was home to edgy, intelligent comedy, subversive music, cult films and late-night, stoner-vision staples such as Vidz? Me too. Albeit through a hazy vignette next to memories of carving flints and ducking pterodactyls.",/review/rw4977119/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2016,drbaulk,10," Jaw-drop amazing and insanely brilliant
",I'm not sure if this was written specifically with Olivia Colman and Julian Barratt in mind - but they are utterly brilliant and perfect for their roles. ,/review/rw4977119/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2019,Bluechinaspecial,9," Gorgeous. Different. Worthwhile!
","Please give this beautiful show a try. It's funny, dark, quirky and brilliant. It's primarily a portrayal of mental illness and it's forms, but is character driven. It's part high art, part horror imagery.. part comedy, part awkward Brit cringe-drama. Don't pass it up if you enjoy deep themes and excellent acting. Cinematography is top notch, also!",/review/rw4977119/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2016,corrie-29221,10," Brilliant, absolutely brilliant.
","If you are looking for something different, that is at the same time funny, bizarre and sad - then this is for you. I found myself shaking my head, crying and laughing out loud, sometimes in one single scene. While dealing with multiple issues including severe depression, the writer draws you into the lives of the characters. Where in the first episode you feel some annoyance with them, as the story develops, you develop a sense of sympathy and understanding towards each of the characters. I was so impressed by Will Sharpe that I looked him up and will make and effort to see more of his work. Truly a brilliant mind in my opinion and I have to add that it was as if the parts were written for these particular actors. However as per some of the other reviews, it is not for everybody.",/review/rw4977119/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2016,craigrichardlowis,10," Refreshing and brilliant
","Dark, seemingly depressing too at first. However, the masterful use of the surreal and the perverse is a delight. This is Olivia Coleman at her very best, playing a wife suppressing so much turmoil that she's plainly the more troubled of the couple - in spite of Julian Barrett's superb portrayal of a suicidal husband. The addition of two deeply troubled but intriguingly bizarre ""children"" (living at home at 25) makes for even better viewing. Each twist of the story and development of the plot leaves me all the more enraptured - rare indeed in any TV comedy.",/review/rw4977119/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2016,dougieharley,10," Brilliant
",This is a great dark comedy about an extremely dysfunctional and odd family. It has an honest look on depression and how it effects yourself and the people around you with a humorous twist.,/review/rw4977119/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2017,andylec,10," A thoroughly uplifting fairy tale
","From the first scene I was gripped and slowly drawn into the deepest recesses of the characters lives. This is drama at its best, red in tooth and claw, with humorous passages weaved throughout, temporarily lifting the tension only for a brief moment.",/review/rw4977119/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2016,salpensom,10," Superb dark comedy drama
","It appears, from the reviews posted so far, that ""Flowers"" is a bit like Marmite. You are going to have to try it to see for yourself. ",/review/rw4977119/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2016,johnbell-24673,9," One of the Best Shows on TV
","Yep. If not the best. It's been so long since a TV show has had all of the right components and combines them perfectly to create this masterpiece; The show revolves around an over-arching theme of mental illness which makes for uncomfortable yet gripping viewing. From attempted suicide to death, Flowers guarantees laughter even when you know you shouldn't.",/review/rw4977119/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2016,dwillbowie,10," Stunning depiction of the howling darkness.
",It's hard to describe what is truly sublime about this comedy drama without appearing gushy and incoherent. ,/review/rw4977119/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2016,SondheimTheGuineaPig,9," A gripping television series
","""Flowers"" is dark, funny, poignant, and smart. A terrible beauty. I couldn't look away, and couldn't stop watching until I'd finished the entire series in a single sitting.",/review/rw4977119/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2016,Pyf,9," Highly overlooked gem!
","Once in a while a rare show comes around and surprises you completely out of the blue. It's impossible to pick one genre to describe this show, it's a wonderful mix of different genres that compliment each other/",/review/rw4977119/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2019,djeestout-12638,8," Heartbreaking
","This is sort of a beautifully-told story that almost cancels itself out by turning into a most heartbreakingly sad story that is hard to watch in the second season. I watched it to the end, because of its excellent story-telling, while hoping it would pull itself out of the bleakness into which it had ground itself, but ended up watching it with one eye painfully squinting when Shun began to fall apart. He tried so hard, but the characters of the Flowers family were so self-absorbed, he never had a chance with his adopted family. The story ended up being about Shun, and thus was a tragedy. Not sure how I feel.",/review/rw4977119/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2021,joiningjt,6," Would have been a solid 10 but season 2 became ALL drama and NO comedy!! 2 bad!!
",This had such promise the cast is simply phenomenal absolutely no weak actors and the writing and directing in season 1 was flawless. The magic went away in season 2 the balance of great comedy and great drama went away and it became completely all drama. Some of the episodes were hard to watch it's a shame because this show was headed for legendary status but instead will be forgotten. I have to say that it's not because of the cast they were simply brilliant it was the writing and a little of the directing they lost focus of where the show was going.,/review/rw4977119/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2016,akcomusic,10," Superbly dark and bizarre.
","This is peepshow meet Tamara Drew with a splash of Cohen brother and  Time Burton to boot. A grand cast of bizarre characters all spiraling  out of control in a grim situation comedy. Julian Barrett is on top  form and the interactions are subtle and don't pander to archetypes  instead allowing itself to be a little obscure. Between the suicidal  children's book writer, the neurotic trombone instructor, the art hour  psychopathic sister and the inventor wannabe brother; there is enough  in the just the flowers family alone for a great shower never mind the  auxiliary characters that also seem to have had the same level of care  put into them.  This screams cult classic even if the general British public don't adopt it right away, it will find a very  loving home with film/TV/comedy fans everywhere much like ""Nighty  night"" or ""Monkeydust"".",/review/rw4977119/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2019,The_late_Buddy_Ryan,6," Promising UK cringe comedy jumps the kipper in the second season
","Elevator pitch: Depressed Edward Gorey character, his needy, neglected wife (Olivia Colman!) and their two failed-to-launch adult children live in a remote woodsy area, amidst no-less-peculiar neighbors. You'll recall that Will Sharpe's Sherlock certainly seemed to be bipolar, with touches of OCD and Tourette's. Here we have all that and more, including maybe schizophrenia and being congenitally ""so rude that you're doomed to die a virgin,"" as one of the younger Flowerses says to her brother. The one attractive, normal-seeming character, who's being pursued by both of them, is really just the best at keeping her issues hidden; she gets written out of the show pretty quickly.",/review/rw4977119/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2019,tpindustries,10," Best show I've ever found on Netflix
","First season is terrific, Second season is a waste of time, apart from one or two episodes, just watch the first season as it has comedy and originality.",/review/rw4977119/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2019,chopperDavo,10," Unexpectedly Good
",I had no idea what this show would be about when I started watching. But I'm glad I watched the first 2-3 episodes because after that I was hooked.,/review/rw4977119/?ref_=tt_urv

22 September 2020,Ruskington,5," Starts off blooming but quickly wilts
","I found the early episodes of Flowers to be some of the most interesting and innovative drama and comedy I had seen in years. Olivia Colman and Julian Barratt are exceptional as you'd expect and the writing is sharp and original. Unfortunately, the story just became a complete mess as the show progressed, turning into a confused jumble of bizarre scenes and incoherent plot developments. I'm not sure what went wrong but I found it genuinely difficult to endure the second season.",/review/rw4977119/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2019,nikkiworrell,10," Brilliant and uncomfortable
","Flowers is like a warm hug from someone who loves you, whose love you feel you don't deserve.",/review/rw4977119/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2019,caribouster,9," Moving, funny and original.
","Loved everything about this little gem. Wish I'd discovered it sooner and that there were more episodes. Great acting, sharp, funny with somehow surreal but also heartbreakingly real writing. Just binged both seasons and feel like putting episode one on again. I don't want to leave the Flowers's world ðŸ˜‚",/review/rw4977119/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2021,Headturner1,5," And a half
","I guess I'm in the minority here. I was looking for something light and funny and the fact this looked dark made it even better... It wasn't! What is it even about??? I get depression and suicide but where was it funny?!? Is the show crap? No, but it's a messy hodgepodge of events that, really, make little sense. I watched all of season 1 and maybe i'll go back to 2 later. None of the characters are likable imo and it wasn't funny. I thought maybe in the end we were going to find out they were all dead which would explain the hodgepodge of random nothingness that this is. Good actors and wanted to like it but it fell flat for me.",/review/rw4977119/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2019,garywrght756,10," One of the greatest funniest shows ever
","I love this from the writing, to the casting down to every individual performance it is perfect. It has everything. One minute you are revelling in nonsense and side splitting humour to crying at the real darkness that life has brought to these loveable crazy people x",/review/rw4977119/?ref_=tt_urv
