29 December 2019,deanbean317,10," A study in tension
","Just one night after my wife and I discussed what a group of stinkers Jennifer Aniston has gotten herself into, we stumbled upon this absolute GEM of a show. From the first episode to the last the tension from episode to episode is literally so thick you can cut it with a knife. The silent moments in this show scream like no other that I've seen. There is no fat in this show...every piece is essential for the show to work, from the marquee stars to the secondary leads to what some may consider bit parts. No one is expendable. Not to overuse the standard cliches, but Jennifer Aniston, Steve Carell, Reese Witherspoon, Billy Crudup and the rest of the cast are a tour de force and never hit a false note. What I found most refreshing was, even with a subject as politically charged as the #metoo movement, the writers treated the subject in a purely subjective manner, giving us the whos and whys and letting us make up our own minds and form or own conclusions...something the actual news seems unable or unwilling to do today. I have no idea how these characters will carry their stories over to a second season, but I'll be there when they do! Bravo Apple+!",/review/rw5348497/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2019,dpestana,9," Billy Crudup owns this show!
","The show is amazing, but wow, what a remarkable performance by Billy Crudup. He totally kills it! I love his character, so funny. We need more of him! Great work! Of course, the rest of the cast is also amazing! Great job everyone!",/review/rw5348497/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Such an amazing cast!
","The Morning Show is an pretty good drama led by such an amazing cast. It takes you behind the scenes of a morning show and gives you a candid look at what makes the show go and the lives of the people involved in it. It may start a little slow for some but stick with it because it gets better as the show goes on. It seems like the entire cast was nominated for their jobs in this show (Steve Carrel, Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, Billy Crudup, Mark Duplass) and for good reason...they were all terrific! It's obviously a star studded cast but it's not only the stars that make this show so good, the writing is well done too. Now for some reason season 2 isn't nearly as good as the first seasons. It's still worth watching just not as entertaining. I hope future seasons get back to the quality of of the first season.",/review/rw5348497/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2021,Supermanfan-13,8," Worth Watching!
","First of all The Morning Show has one of the best overall casts of any show on tv. Just to name some of the actors in this are Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, Steve Carell, Billy Crudup, Mark Duplass, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, etc. With a cast like that you just know the show is worth watching. The first season is the best but the second is still pretty good. It's one of the rare shows where each episode gets better and leaves you wanting more. It's a fast paced show that you'll want to binge watch as quickly as you can. Season three is coming out later this year and I'm looking forward to watching it.",/review/rw5348497/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2021,jk-692-236394,2," Season One- So much potential- Season Two- wow what a bomb.
","Season One was current and interesting. It ended on a high note of rebellion and standing up for what was right. Season two totally backtracked and ruined it all. Now it is just a high priced, famous people playing over the top characters in a freaking network soap opera. You have all seen this before. I am out.",/review/rw5348497/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2022,Nevergivea10,," Wish I could rate seasons separately
",I would rate season 1 an 8. It tackles a lot of social issues while still remaining entertaining and still doesn't get too preachy.,/review/rw5348497/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2019,umer_salman,9," Thats how you do a show on feminism.
",Complex emotions on all sides. Appealing to human nature. Not overly preachy. Makes you think about cause and effect.,/review/rw5348497/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2022,stafheyndrickx-490-681654,5," Season 2 totally destroys what season 1 has built
","Season 1 was, as so many reviews say, kind of interesting, and actually had a decent story and some interesting characters in it. All that was left out in season 2, because apparently all the viewers are expected to donis watch Jennifer Aniston's locked into one position's mouth trying to act out some emotion through here face.... It's ridiculous what actresses and actors do to themselves just to keep looking younger, and the unnatural look it creates is just terrible and ruins the shows and movies their in....",/review/rw5348497/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2019,francis007,5," Great show
","One of the weirdest critic I saw was that the show is left wing propaganda. Well this is on the opposite a very balanced show, that gives a voice to the men perspective on MeToo and criticises it very harshly while the main hero is a moderate conservative. This is why the show is good - you get different perspective and ideas.",/review/rw5348497/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2021,gonzojesse,7," Downhill for Season 2
","Season 1 felt inspired. Season 2 feels like a bad soap opera. People just overacting and screaming all the time. The writing went downhill so fast. Sad. What happened, Apple?",/review/rw5348497/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2021,tomarm-21596,7," Season 1 is 8 stars, season 2 is 5
","Season 1 had a good, interesting, story line, that grabbed you from the beginning. Kept you watching esp in anticipation on what will happen in the rivalry between the 2 female leads. But they suddenly coming together in end in that show of woman solidarity was more depressing cop out, enough to drop the season from a 9 to an 8.",/review/rw5348497/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2019,danbutler-45322,8," Apple doesn't disappoint with this one.
","I was skeptical and this show wasn't even on my radar, but after watching the first episode, I was hooked. I binged the next 4 in 2 days. Great show! The acting is superb. The story is interesting. It touches on issues of the day with finesse and doesn't preach. Which is hard to find these days. The casting is pretty perfect. Billy Crudup steals the show. Awesome work, Apple!",/review/rw5348497/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2019,nancyldraper,9," Apple+ has set a high bar
","{Initial Impressions} Can you call it an initial impressions when you are 6 episodes deep into a 10 episode series? It's just that good! Once I started watching it, I couldn't stop until I was caught up. The acting is great. The cast is accomplished, both stars and supporting performers. The story is well defined. Do not be mislead, this is a serious drama. I can't say enough good things about it. Apple+ has set a high bar for itself with this inaugural series. I give it a 9 (superb) out of 10. {Drama}",/review/rw5348497/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2021,krombang,2," 9 for first season, 2 for second season
",I don't understand why IMDb still doesn't separate the score for each season (yet a special score for an episode).,/review/rw5348497/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2021,andrew_clure,3," Oh dear! What happened to S2
","No idea what happened here. S1 was decent, not amazing but pretty good. S2 on the other hand, they've completely thrown it all out. Characters have changed personality, plot has gone, the lot. Great characters like Cory, have turned into 1dimensional jelly.",/review/rw5348497/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2021,martytamu27,5," Second season...eh
","The characters seems to have changed personalities.and sometimes seem almost one liner ish in their dialogue. Also, does every single conversation anyone and everyone has on this show have to be so high intensity shouting drama this is so important end of the world screaming cursing back stabbing high strung drama?!?!?!",/review/rw5348497/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2021,avisdolphin,7," Solid First Season
",The first season was very good and I would have given the show a higher ranking but season 2 is weak. It has become very soap-opera-ish. Too many chaotic tangential stories and lots of annoying hysterics.,/review/rw5348497/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2021,efd-10467,7," Series 2 Flopped
","Series 1 builds each episode to a great climax, so there was anticipation for Series 2 to continue, but it just never gets going, too much emotion, too many superfluous character side stories, not enough story or new plot lines.",/review/rw5348497/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2021,harineem-209-525488,6," Season 2 mess - Unbearable Reese
","I really loved the first Season and gave a very high rating but 2 is a mess, waited for the finale to write this. The finale was a mess, Jeniffer Aniston monologue was meandering and pointless surprisingly in a show with some great dialogues. Billy Crudup was the only reason for me to hang in there till the end. If they gave Razzies for web series, I would nominate Reese Witherspoon for the worst over the board acting, just hated every time she came on the screen. The biggest disappointment was their attempt to make us sympathise with the Black guy who wants to host the show as a racial issue, sorry he really seemed like a guy with the wrong attitude. If you don't get promoted, you don't badmouth your boss and embarrass your company in public , a badly written character. I still don't understand why were Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Karen Pittman not nominated for Emmy instead of Aniston and Witherspoon, thats where racism is apparent. Karen Pittman again shines with what little they give her, its a shame she is not being recognised for her performance.",/review/rw5348497/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2021,wingman1111,5," Drab prolonged storylines, lacks direction
",Honestly was looking forward to this series but 2 seasons in now and i've lost interest.,/review/rw5348497/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2021,ianalexanderwalden,6," Season 2 is not it
","Compared to Season 1...a dip in writing, acting and storyline. I also think it's a cop out to end the first season with a bombshell where every main character trashes and/or leaves the network and then immediately follow it with the next season where they are all back at UBA. Not creative.",/review/rw5348497/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2019,MovieQween-33622,10," Two words: Jennifer Aniston
","This show is Jennifer's hands down. She is playing her career best right now and I'm loving every moment of her. She deserves all of the awards that are eventually coming her way! I can't wait to see where the rest of this show goes, I'm completely hooked with Jennifer. The male characters are very well acted, Steve Carrell, Billy Crudup is at his best and Mark Duplass is turning me into a fan. Steve Carrell's character is a little too uncomfortably on the nose to Matt Lauer. I think that part is a little weird for me still, I still slightly cringe when I see Steve Carrell's scenes and story line. I suppose that's the point? I think overall it's a good look behind the curtain of the politics and bs that goes on behind closed doors.",/review/rw5348497/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2021,Snidgy,5," Wait....did they forget to write a screenplay?
","After a pretty decent first season, viewers are now into episode seven of the second season and many must be thinking (like me): ""Wait, did they forget to actually write a screenplay for season 2?"".",/review/rw5348497/?ref_=tt_urv

23 December 2019,rhmacl,10," This one gets it ALL correctly...
","This series is a masterpiece in relevance, production, acting, and writing. Extremely good performances by a broad cast. The writing soars, expertly defining the voice of each character's perspective, and delivering insights that are timely, believable, and poignant. Many perspectives and attitudes about sexual exploitation of workers is cast during first few episodes, and throughout the series justifications and rationales are tested, considered, and dispatched. The finale is best savored, with some of greatest performances; particularly Anniston's-unrivaled in her storied career. Jen draws from decades of learning and self-knowledge to portray a highly visible icon's breakdown and tantrum as she demonstrates what female strength and it's many facets, truly is for all to see; strength to tolerate the ""boy's club"" while finding ways to succeed despite it; strength to stand face-to-face with competition and show no signs of it in the veneer; strength to give-up and back-off when the stakes run too high; and strength to change the unfair rules. Besides Anniston, many other amazing performances are delivered: Witherspoon, Polway, Mbatha, Crudup, Carrell and many more...all are nuanced, expertly delivered, which goes back to the writing: Bravo! Excellent! Well done!",/review/rw5348497/?ref_=tt_urv
