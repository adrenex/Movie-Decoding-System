19 September 2015,paulcreeden,9," Brilliant. Yes, Cool, No. I don't want that.
","Outrageously funny satire. Hugh Bonneville, the patronizing lord of Downton, redeems himself while bathing in the complete absurdity of corporate culture. He has great comic talent, but he has quite a bit of talented company here as well. Jessica Hynes as Siobhan is the perfect farcical PR person of the computer age. She and her foil, Tracey, played by Monica Dolan, turn group scenes into absurdity rivaling ""Monty Python"" genius. ",/review/rw7560241/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2015,Lejink,6," Bright Business Comedy
","I suppose the natural career change for ""2012""'s Olympics supremo Ian Fletcher was to an executive position at another of the great talking-shops, the BBC itself. Thus ""W1A"" continues very much in the footprints of its predecessor, with Fletcher at the centre of the middle of things at the Beeb, quickly becoming the spokesperson and whipping boy for a number of topical-at-the-time scandals at the corporation, involving regional discrimination and pay levels. Now with the Quango-esque title ""Head Of Values"" he's soon involved with a similar group of headless deadbeats talking lots but saying little in another amusing spoof comedy.",/review/rw7560241/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2019,msghall,9," Oh....cool. Yeah cool. Uh...dunno. Crap!
","Such a great series I watched it twice. Wonderfully acted and written, the single word interplay between the characters is a marvel. The discipline and skill to pull off the rapid-fire exchanges is something to behold. While much of the humour is broad, much of it is wonderfully narrow British irreverence and wit. But the glue that holds it together is Hugh Skinner's Will. His beautifully-timed nonsensical statements sum up the entire series, making fun of corporate culture that has lost its ability to communicate, saved at the last moment by the erudite adult in the room, Ian Fletcher.",/review/rw7560241/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2014,brian-west-289-887982,6," W1A (BBC2) – Review
","""You're aware that you're at the centre of something genuinely important, and the exciting thing is to think that part of the job is establishing where that centre is, and what it's in the middle of."" It's hard to parody something that's already a parody of itself, so W1A (BBC2) – the BBC's bizarre and surreal mickey take of its own corridors of power – must be viewed in context.",/review/rw7560241/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2017,hi_and,10," Funniest Show Around
","A hilarious skewering of both the BBC and the mindset of corporate lackeys everywhere. Absolutely crammed with great characters, many of whom, in the British manner, have their distinctive and increasingly wonderful catch-phrases. It seems impossible that this got made by the same organization that is portrayed in the show, but it is very pleasing that it was. It's just a shame that the number of episodes per season is small even by UK standards.",/review/rw7560241/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2014,droopsnout,8," Very funny. Is it just me?
","I suspect that some of the reviews here have been made by people who are perhaps too close to the BBC, or are amongst a significant section of the British population who regard the licence fee as the wrong way to fund the Corporation.",/review/rw7560241/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2017,qui_j,5," It's OK but very, very repetitive!
","The show does capture the uselessness of corporate culture, its incessant meetings, and predictable committee members. The problem is that after a while, it becomes repetitive and tedious to watch. Even though each episode may bring a new business challenge, the repetitiveness of action and thought by the characters becomes boring, causing the viewer to just disengage. After a while, I just watched the episodes on an ""ad hoc"" basis to provide padding for my binge watching of other series that I did not wish to finish too quickly because they were so good. By padding it with this mindless material, the better series lasted me for a longer period of time!",/review/rw7560241/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2014,tlloydesq,7," biting an accurate comedy
",This is a very well observed comedy. The setting for the programme is the BBC but it could be any big company. Ian Fletcher of 2012 fame joins the BBC as its head of values. Being the new boy in town he struggles with the entrenched working practices. Senior management float from meeting to meeting without making any decisions which they leave to their subordinates who were are too busy to attend.,/review/rw7560241/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2015,Prismark10,6," Sympatico
","From the makers of Twenty Twelve which starred Hugh Bonneville as Ian Fletcher the rather out of his depth Head of Deliverance for the 2012 London Olympics. He now returns as the bumbling Head of Values at the BBC since he managed to deliver the Olympics successfully. He also teams up again with Jessica Hynes, now the shallow PR chief at the BBC with daft ideas.",/review/rw7560241/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2019,tuggerwaugh,7," Repetitive dialogue wears thin
","This show is really funny and well-written the first few times you watch it. Then it's just repetitive. You know what the characters are going to say before they say it. Yes, no, yes, a ha, yeah, cool, no worries. As a satire of a tv network it's clever. The characters are good. I just find it wears thin after a while.",/review/rw7560241/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2015,peter-1708,9," Too close to the truth to be funny if you're a tax-payer
","I found this very funny and very true. I worked at BBC Future Media (and other parts of the BBC) and recognise a number of these senior managers. The caricatures are not far removed from reality. On the creative side, you might think the show was cruel. Not really, they used to have weekly ""creative sessions"" in my kitchen area. There's nothing like the sight of desperate 40-somethings trying to come up with something young and hip to make you wish you were far, far away from the commissioning process and the necessary obliges noblesses! The meeting rooms, ""Strictly Come Dancing"" and ""Top Gear"" and so on, and Syncopatispace is beyond parody. This show is almost exactly like working there.",/review/rw7560241/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2021,RandomTard,4," Annoying show with not much content
","I am not from UK, so I have no special interest in BBC what so ever. I do think there was a couple of funny moments in the series over the years but mostly it was just repetition of the very little it had to offer. I guess this could be better if watched while high but then there really would be a lot better shows for that too.",/review/rw7560241/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2017,simon-894,2," The sketch that never ends...
","This works as a short sketch only. It is a single gag that is repeated ad nauseam and after only three episodes I could take no more. It is painful to watch and frankly not worthy of fine actors, Hugh Bonneville and Jessica Hynes. For example, the conference suite scenes have the same structure and outcome every time - only the dialogue (such that it is) varies. The Head of Security character is unbelievable and just isn't funny, the Intern is just annoyingly hopeless. Several scenes are just a waste of time and banal in the extreme. It's altogether unbearable and unfunny.",/review/rw7560241/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2019,joeycola,8," This could have gone on for-ev-er!
","Only 3 seasons? Really?? Ah, I guess it's hard to keep a cast like this together for long. What seemed like pure silliness at first really grew on me. I really ended up caring about these characters. When I went to start the next season and discovered there was none, I was heartbroken.",/review/rw7560241/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2014,ianlouisiana,4," Too true to be good................
","No doubt about it,the BBC wants to be loved,wants to be ""Auntie"" and ""The Beeb"",wants to be known as the home of ""Children in Need"" and ""Sports Relief"" where its favoured entertainers and presenters are given endless opportunities to show their caring side whilst simultaneously promoting themselves and their BBC programmes whilst engaging in emotional blackmail. In reality,the national broadcaster is smug,self - regarding,self - regulating,incestuous,and exerts far too powerful an influence on its audience whom it regards as a malleable amorphous mass who blindly pay out their licence fee in order to be patronised,ignored and have their intelligence insulted at regular intervals. Thus with ""W1A""they may appear to be mocking their own excesses but in fact they are showing them off - demonstrating to us viewers that the organisation will always be an Oxbridge talking shop producing whatever it decides will be good for us and spending our money however it sees fit with no possibility of redress. Too many clever - clever people at the BBC may chortle at the in - jokes and applaud the ""sporting"" way celebrities appear as themselves(don't think Miss C.Vorderman should give up her day job - whatever it may be) but have failed to consider that this programme's predecessor,""2012"", was centred on a specific once - in - a - lifetime event that for the previous two years had occupied the news media almost non - stop.It was very much of its time. The BBC's Olympic Legacy seems to consist of re - cycled scripts and hackneyed ideas,I'm afraid.",/review/rw7560241/?ref_=tt_urv

27 May 2018,nebilcs-168-165298,7," Funny in places but we've been here before
","I watched the first few episodes of the first season and giggled appropriately. Goodness knows the BBC makes a good target for this kind of satire and is a good proxy for many similar corporate settings. But after a while fatigue set in. Compared with Twenty Twelve which was consistently laugh-out-loud funny, too many characters in W1A share similar lines and ""yes/no/cool"" affectations. But what really fails is the mockumentary angle. It was tenuous in Twenty Twelve but just about kept within the lines as an unlikely but feasible documentary. W1A would have been better pitched as a straightforward satirical comedy rather than having a narration constantly remind the viewer that we are supposed to regard this as a reality programme.",/review/rw7560241/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2020,brian-milligan,7," Beware.....
","I'm positive that the writers of this show were out to prove how ridiculous the entertainment business is but more important they wanted to make people who watch anxious and annoyed and they do it perfectly. I could not get through it. It is the most aggravating thing I've ever seen. The only characters who are somewhat normal are Hugh Bonneville and David Tennant as the narrator. Im guessing their lines are there just to bring you back fom the brink. It is very difficult to watch. It creates anxiety and annoyance and hatred for the people who run this fictional version of the BBC. One could use this program as a mental torture device but it would be cruel and unusual punishment and probably illegal. Most of the script is designed to provoke this sense of unease , uncomfortableness and agitation but delivered in the guise of comedy. It is genius in that way but if you suffer from anxiety or depression or anger management i warn you this will ruin your day and you'll run screaming to your therapist for more meds.",/review/rw7560241/?ref_=tt_urv

8 April 2022,vintagegeek,4," Moronic
","Nothing but idiotic conversations with no depth or real content and very repetitive. Also, it's done with hand held single camera which constantly jumps around and most times it's jittery. Obviously the cameraman didn't have the strength to carry it. I think they tried to emulate a documentary approach and it's awful.",/review/rw7560241/?ref_=tt_urv

","Don't know why Netflix didn't recommend this to me, instead of all the junk. It's a bit repetitive but very light. I do enjoy these types of shows. This is very similar to ""the IT crowd"". It's great that BBC makes limited episodes of these shows. Very funny and light. Great characters and very well narrated.",/review/rw7560241/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2014,duncan-holding-770-188063,5," Twenty Twelve was brilliant-the follow up less so
","Twenty twelve (also reviewed) was IMO the best comedy since the first series of I'm Alan Partridge. When i heard this semi follow up (the two main characters return) I was apprehensive as to whether the dynamics would remain in a different setting with different characters. Having seen the first two episodes my apprehension was confirmed, This time the script writers poke fun at the inner workings of the BBC and while it remains funny in parts the characters this time round seem too stupid to be remotely believable. The Hynes character whilst pretty much ott in twenty twelve but still funny to watch this time is a parody. Vincent Franklin is badly missed in this follow up. Will watch the final two episodes in the hope of seeing better things but wont hold my breath at this stage",/review/rw7560241/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2019,sherpro-13339,5," Clever and fast-paced but repetitive
","This approach to bureaucracy has been done and done - this is good fun and the overall production enhanced by actors such as Bonneville and the rest.
One thing that drags it way down for me is the appalling and loud inter-scene music and (often) the over-speedy and gaudy scene change visuals.",/review/rw7560241/?ref_=tt_urv
