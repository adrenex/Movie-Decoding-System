27 January 2021,cfauteux,7," Stop at Season 6
","Many great shows end too early. We cherish them and wonder what could have been. That wonder is what keeps a show in the back of our minds. Even more shows go on too long. This show has gone on too long to the point where the writers don't take the time to progress the characters. They're stuck in the same storylines from 3 years ago and in many ways the characters have regressed from the depth they grew over the first few seasons. The charm and heart is gone. The mother is creepy now. Adam is cringey. His brother is becoming more and more dim witted it hurts. His sister is always mad and the way they represent her relationship with her boyfriend is juvenile. The dad is still good, he's Murray. I just read that Adam F. Goldberg isn't even involved in the show anymore and it all makes sense. Make this suffering stop. My rating for the first 6 seasons is 8. Final two seasons are 1 so it brings down the average.",/review/rw3853058/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2022,warnerdang,6," Know when you're done....
","The original premise of the Goldbergs was great, a standard family sitcom based on some semi-autobiographical family info from the show runner. The 80's nostalgia was great as it was generally non-specific regarding chronological release of products and events which also added to the fun of the show.",/review/rw3853058/?ref_=tt_urv

",A late (2nd season) quick review.,/review/rw3853058/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2022,gaw-88608,1," Enough already
","At the start this was a fast-paced, fun half-hour. Especially with the presence of George Segal. Like many successful sitcoms, they just don't know when to bring the curtain down. I think I just watched my last episode today. It is now just become boring and obnoxious. And they have tried to fill in the gap left by the expulsion of Jeff Garlin. My hope is that they will take a bow and end this thing now. Ale a time slot for the next hit show.",/review/rw3853058/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2020,stevesutton-74951,7," Barry Goldberg sucks
","I caught up on the Goldbergs pretty late. However, due to covid19 isolation, I managed to catch up. I love the scripts, the stories, and the family - but with one notable exception. I loath Barry. There are very few characters that I have found so annoying. Not only is his general behaviour childlike and inexcusable, but he is seldom confronted by or made responsible for his appalling self absorbed actions. This isn't comedy but tragedy. I wish the writers could have made him more likeable and sympathetic. As it stands, Barry being beaten with a baseball bat would have come as comic light relief.",/review/rw3853058/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2014,cyifly-2,9," Which Character Where You In the 80s?
","This was written at almost the end of the first season. I can't speak for more than that. But so far, It's really, really funny.",/review/rw3853058/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2022,katiecarsi,5," Started great..... downhill from there
","So Season 10...Dad died? Really? This show was done after Season 6. But I hung in there. Now 3 episodes into 10, I'm done. Pitiful. At least Jeff Garlin had the sense to leave. But the kids are all college aged and still living at home. Pop died and so they bring in Pop Pop. They really thought this was going to keep the viewers entertained which says how little they think of the network viewer. The story lines are getting beyond tired. And I used to be a fan of Wendy M, but her shtick is so monotonous at this point. What was once endearing is now eyeroll inducing. Such a bad end to a promising start that introduced several new faces that I came to look forward to enjoying every episode. But now, I just want to slam the door in their faces.....",/review/rw3853058/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2013,akua420,10," About time!
","Its about time we get a great show like this! It reminds me so much of The Wonder Years (One of my favourite shows of all times). It is funny, all the actors are fantastic and have great chemistry together. After 3 episodes it quickly became my new favourite show. At the end of each episode there is a clip of the real family it is based on (Adam Goldberg) which I love. I think this is why the show works so great, is because its based on a real family and real stories. So many shows and movies you watch and there isn't anything realistic about it, so they are entertaining but not something you can relate to. That is not the case with this show, and that is why it reminds me so much of The Wonder Years. It mixes comedy with story telling. I can't rave about this show enough, and I will be FURIOUS if it gets cancelled.",/review/rw3853058/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2022,dvdandre,6," used to be 10/10 now it's not worth watching
","Don't get me wrong, I religiously LOVED this show, I loved everything about it as it brought back so many memories of the 80s. Absolutely adored it. The sad passing of George Segal could have been endured but the firing of Jeff Garlin was ridiculous. The producers should have stopped this woke rubbish and gotten on with the show! As they say in Australia, they threw the baby out with the bathwater. He was a major presence on the show. I don't know who 'accused' him, but let it be knows he was never charged and should be treated as innocent until proven guilty... unless of course you're in a banana country where you are guilty first and have to prove your innocence...",/review/rw3853058/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2013,siys,8," Heartwarming & Charming
","I believe it depends on what type family you grew up with whether you enjoy this program or not; and although my family was not exactly like this, nor did we grow up in the 80s, The Goldbergs is quite charming and each episode has struck a nerve with this viewer and tugged at my heartstrings.",/review/rw3853058/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2021,mujali-48677,1," Garbage for the easily pleased
","I took a chance on this show because my best mate wouldn't stop raving about it. Being an 80s kid, I thought I would love the premise, the references etc, just like I have with Cobra Kai even though that is a very different type of show.",/review/rw3853058/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2018,Ed-Shullivan,8," Warm Hearted - Great stories - Reminiscent of the 1980's - and with a great eclectic cast!
","Oy vey this show is just not okay, each episode stands on its own merit, and with the young quirky Adam Goldberg's (Sean Giambrone) nasal voice narrating for the audience what he is going through (besides puberty) inside and outside the Goldberg family home in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, is sheer entertainment each and every week.",/review/rw3853058/?ref_=tt_urv

",Now without the dad the show is all over the place. And making an 80's base show little woke not working for me. Time for this show to come to and end before it unwatchable. This show used to be an 10.,/review/rw3853058/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2013,jakob-rogalski,10," Don't listen to the haters
","It is quite unusual for me to laugh very hard, when I am watching an episode of a show. But with The Goldbergs I was cracking up by the first half of the first episode, I could not resist to write my first review on IMDb.",/review/rw3853058/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2016,Top_Dawg_Critic,10," This eras Brady Bunch
","I applaud every aspect of this show; the actors, the directing, the stories (of which are based on original VHS camcorder recordings), the timeline-dated set decor and clothing, the comedy, and above all, the excellent family values within the episodes complete with trials and tribulations we all experienced as children and parents.

27 September 2022,JodyKibler,2," You ruined the show
",You got rid of a pivotal character because he would say his vajayjay hurts. You ruined this show. We will be deleting from the set recordings. It about 1.5 seasons too much. This show started out strong back in the day. And the show held its own for a long time. Probably should have worked on wrapping it up when the older kids started going off to college. Now that Jeff Garland was fired the show is a freaking disaster. And you keeping pushing it out there. What you are pushing is junk. I can't believe a few of these Actors even signed on to do this crap. Really really disappointing. Maybe the people that need to be beamed is the whining crew.,/review/rw3853058/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2017,fluffchop,1," Garbage
","It has a nice cast in the Mom and Grandpa, the others are there for the ride. The thing about this show is that it's just not an interesting premise. The kid is so unlikable that who could really care less about him. The style of show where the adult looks back on his childhood was done to death with The Wonder Years. We were all just naive enough in the 80s to view that show with some wonder and curious delight at the late 60s. This show has none of that wonder whatsoever.",/review/rw3853058/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2019,orcinussr,2," HORRIBLE TRITE POOP!
","It used to be so fun to watch, and mistaken for good, however it was merely nostalgia for my childhood - but it quickly jumped the shark becoming inane juvenile storylines that spend 20mins in sheer stupidity then abruptly pivoting to 2 Mins of attempted poignant morales - Frankly I now find it extremely annoying and borderline offensive",/review/rw3853058/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2021,m-47826,8," Finally...
","Another good and genuinely funny sitcom. It's been a while since I haven't seen one like this. The timeline is completely messed up, but it adds to the goofy/over the top tone of the show. Even when scripts steal ideas from other shows, it's done in an appealing way that fits the tone. Not getting the point of that spin off series, though... I'm only at season 4, so I guess I have two more seasons before the big quality loss everyone's been talking about here...",/review/rw3853058/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2020,ProjectAnomaly,8," The Goldbergs
","Great, if stereotypical characters and great comedic timing.",/review/rw3853058/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2016,beresfordjd,9," Creeps up on you.
","I watched The Goldbergs when it first appeared on British TV and didn't like it much ( I thought at first it was trying to be MITM) but having seen more and more episodes it has really gelled with me. I love American humour generally and Jewish humour particularly so it is great for me. George Segal still has the chops, he is a great comedic actor. The script is sharp and the timing of the actors really makes the script zing. I always liked Jeff Garlin in Curb Your Enthusiasm and he works well in this as Mr Goldberg. Wendi does a great job with Mrs Goldberg and the premise of the whole programme works well. Patton Oswalt is one of my favourite comic actors - love him in King of Queens and his narration is excellent in this.",/review/rw3853058/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2013,disciple43,9," Children of the 80's UNITE!!
","I have to admit, that when I watched the first episode of this show, it reminded me so much of The Wonder Years that it was distracting. That being said, after episode 2 and 3, I hardly notice the narration. I think the first episode had a ton more narration because of character introductions and such, but 2 and 3 have gotten progressively funnier, and all of the 80's nostalgia is very endearing to me.

8 November 2017,halbarr-71820,3," not funny
",I've given this show a chance watching several reruns. No character catches my attention enough to keep me watching. All they do is yell and the outfits are exaggerated. The wig on the mom is too much. Kid's voice is annoying. Older brother is super annoying. Only good thing is when they showcase products or popular culture from the era. Doesn't warrant the reviews being so high. People are easily entertained I guess.,/review/rw3853058/?ref_=tt_urv
