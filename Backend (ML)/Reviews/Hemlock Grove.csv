",This film is about several couples who are expecting babies. They run into various troubles and emotional rollercoasters while preparing themselves for parenthood.,/review/rw2670695/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2012,neil-476,7," Some good moments, but you have to sit through some bad stuff to get to them
","This film follows the story of 5 pregnant women and their partners: Cameron Diaz is a reality TV weight loss show guru who disagrees with her partner over circumcision, Elizabeth Banks is a baby shop proprietor whose husband finds himself drawn unwillingly into competition with father Dennis Quaid over everything (Quaid's trophy wife Brooklyn Decker is having twins: beat that son!), Jennifer Lopez is looking to adopt an Ethiopean baby but hubby is far from sure about parenthood, and takeaway truck worker Anna Kendrick finds herself unexpectedly pregnant after an impetuous one night stand with the guy who was nearly her prom date. These threads intertwine mildly, but the intertwining is incredibly contrived.",/review/rw2670695/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2014,katieking90,7," A sweet movie, unfairly judged
",This movie is my favorite feel-good flick and 9 out of 10 times it's my go to for an easy late night comedy. That isn't to say it is a gut- busting laugh-fest but it EASILY ranks higher than a chuckle. Even though I can almost quote every line I still smile in expectation for the scenes and moments that continue to crack me up. ,/review/rw2670695/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2012,miarae,8," deserves a higher rating in my opinion
","Honestly, the reason for seeing this movie was nothing more and nothing less than the desire to go to the cinema with a friend. With some other movies not interesting her, it was between The Lucky Ones and this one, both movies that have a low score on IMDb. I was pleasantly surprised, however, with not just the actors in the movie but also with the dialogue and chemistry on screen, which seemed very natural. I definitely enjoyed watching it and will most likely end up buying it on DVD; not even the fact that Chris Rock was in it bothered me, whereas I usually can't stand him. I have to applaud Jennifer Lopez too, I never thought much of her as an actress, but I found myself sympathizing with her and liking her portrayal of the character. Over all, I find that this movie deserves a higher score than it's currently got on IMDb.",/review/rw2670695/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2012,napierslogs,5," Twenty floating heads can't make you laugh but a couple of actors can grab your heart
","I was expecting to come away with a sassy name for this new genre, the Hollywood-ensemble rom-com, but there was nothing clever to provide any inspiration in ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"". The best line that I have heard to describe this comes from a fellow IMDb user, gregeichelberger, ""It's ""New Year's Eve"" in the neo-natal unit; ""Valentine's Day"" with a uterus; ""Knocked Up"" times five."" That sums up the whole thing perfectly.",/review/rw2670695/?ref_=tt_urv

30 September 2012,TxMike,," Inoffensive rom-com, my wife and I enjoyed it for light entertainment.

18 June 2012,JimmyCollins,2," Oh gee, what a waste of money.
","I saw the trailer for What To Expect When You're Expecting and I thought it looked funny, and more than 1 of the cast members happen to be favorites of mine, but pretty much 20 minutes in, I knew I was going to hate this movie. Out of all of the mega cast movies of late, this is indeed the weakest of all of them. This movie is meant to be a comedy, but I didn't laugh once or even come remotely close to laughing, the cast, some if which are rather talented never get a chance to prove themselves as every scene is so ridiculously short, and the script, talk about a cheese overload, and this is written by Shauna Cross, who wrote a terrifically funny script for Whip It, it's a shame none of the heart, wit and humor that was in that could transfer to this film.",/review/rw2670695/?ref_=tt_urv

19 May 2012,JankiSharma,8," What to expect when you're expecting:simple and unexpectedly nice
","Director Kirk Jones (liked his other movie too, Everybody's fine) did a good job again directing a simple and well known concept pertaining to the process of pregnancy and child birth : takes a man and a woman to bring a baby into this world. This movie is mainly about how every woman and man go through the tribulations of this aspect of life's journey differently. Cameron Diaz as Jules , fitness guru ( a la Jillian Michaels of Biggest loser) is in great shape and is happy to be impregnated by Evan (matthew Morrison). Elizabeth banks,Wendy, encourages people to breastfeed babies and goes through a very tough pregnancy and has full support from her husband Gary ( Ben Falcone from Bridesmaids and TV shows: Yes, dear and Curb your enthusiasm). Brooklyn Decker as the young wife of Dennis Quaid( father of Gary) is very naturally young and has a very easy twin pregnancy. Anna Kendrick(Rosie) loses her baby , pregnant after just one night stand with Marco (Chace Crawford). Rosie and Marco are sad after losing baby. Rosie has a very positive attitude and has confidence that because she is young she will definitely have many more chances at pregnancy. On the other hand, Jennifer Lopez as Holly is ready for adopting Ethiopian baby after going through several attempts at making babies in different ways. She feels miserable after losing contract as a photographer and feels like a loser. All the actors did well. I enjoyed watching Elizabeth banks and Brooklyn Decker(Just go with it) the most. I like Kendrick and she does well in any role (Up in the air, 50/50). Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Lopez did well. Among the male actors ,Ben Falcone was convincing as a very supportive husband of Banks. I felt the slap when Banks slapped Falcone demanding pain medications during labor.... Pregnancies are tough. No wonder Mother's day and father's day are special....",/review/rw2670695/?ref_=tt_urv

31 July 2012,kosmasp,3," Shallow, predictable mess
","You can still have a good time watching it, especially if you're more open minded and go in expecting nothing I suppose. But situations happening in the movie are not really depicted that funny. When people talk about ""timing"" or rather bad timing, they could use this as an example of how it doesn't work.",/review/rw2670695/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2015,juneebuggy,5," Total chick flick with a few laughs -about what I expected
","I got out of this exactly what I was expecting going in so in that respect I wasn't disappointed. This is an ensemble rom-com, filled with familiar Hollywood faces (to distract from the lack of substance I guess), like 'Valentines' Day or 'New Years Eve' except everybody has baby on the brain here. Its a total chick flick with a few laughs, some drama and I didn't have to think too hard.",/review/rw2670695/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2012,terrellrobinson71,8," Here's something to expect: A movie that balances the ups and downs of pregnancy in a funny and unexpectedly moving way.
","It's ironic that I am not a dad (or a soon-to-be one) and the funniest thing is that there are moments in which my mom went through the whole pregnancy issue, but I happen to enjoy a movie called ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"", based on the self-help book of the same name for soon-to-be mothers by Heidi Murkoff. Here's the good news: For men and women who are mothers and fathers or about to become those parents, you can relate to these certain issues: Miscarriages, infertility, contractions, hormones, adoption....the whole nine yards (or months) of surviving pregnancy. So, how to start reorganizing the plot? I know, how about I'll connect the story by the dots. Dot 1: Holly (The lovely Jennifer Lopez), a photographer and her husband Alex (Rodrigo Santoro) are about to adopt a baby from Ethiopia. Dot 2: Rosie (Anna Kendrick) and Marco (Chase Crawford, one of those heartthrobs from ""Gossip Girl"") are rival food-truck owners who had a one-night stand that results in a big oops. She does get pregnant until... (I'm not telling.) Dot 3: Wendy (the always lovable Elizabeth Banks) and her husband Gary (Ben Falcone from ""Bridesmaids"") are about to finally have a baby after two years of trying, only to find themselves competing with Gary's father Ramsey (Dennis Quaid), a race-car driver and his trophy wife, the gorgeous Southern Belle Skyler (Brooklyn Decker, yes, that Brooklyn Decker) who's eating for three. (You get the expression, right?) And finally for dot 4, Jules (Cameron Diaz), a trainer for a ""Biggest Loser""-type TV show and Evan (the charming Matthew Morrison from my favorite show ""Glee""), a dancer for a ""Dancing with the Stars""-type show are expecting one, as well. Only to find their careers in chaos due to the baby issue. Oh, I forgot dot 5: The Dudes Group, run by Vic (Chris Rock) and his buddies (with kids) hang out every Saturday and helping poor Alex (from that first dot) on how to be a man and to become a dad. It's a heavy order to make a movie about the ups and downs of pregnancy, but director Kirk Jones and screenwriters Shauna Cross and Heather Hach walks a fine balance of what makes us laugh, what can we expect to happen and how to relate to those issues. The results for that makes it a very, very funny and unexpectedly moving film. When the pregnancy for the four of the five couples comes kicking in, it's realistic, moving, heartbreaking and utterly remarkable. The all-star cast, also including Australian comedienne Rebel Wilson (also from ""Bridesmaids"" and the upcoming ""Pitch Perfect"") as Wendy's assistant, Janice and Joe Manganiello from ""True Blood"" as the Dudes' Group's other (and hunky) Lone Wolf, Davis, are amazing. The stories that sometimes interconnect with one another are surprisingly good. And by the end, there's always that one movie that's made for adults and how the audience can relate to moments like that, which could happen in real life. I guess this is a movie that's, at least, worth expecting.",/review/rw2670695/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2012,DarkVulcan29,5," Don't Expect Much.
","I like a good all star cast, but in this case,the jokes that are giving here feel very forced, and like they are trying to hard. There are some descent performances by Anna Kendrick, and Dennis Quaid is also memorable in his role, but everybody else are all so overly written, to the point that they are not has memorable.",/review/rw2670695/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2016,Shopaholic35,8," Very funny but not what I was expecting.
","I genuinely enjoyed What to Expect When You're Expecting and found it to be quite hilarious. The jokes were well timed and it seemed to be outrageously truthful in places and bullsh!t in others. They tried to depict multiple experiences with pregnancy from the very difficult to the ""oh it was a breeze"".

7 December 2021,LukeCustomer2,9," I have no idea why this gets bad reviews.
",This to me is an adorable movie. One that I can put on and enjoy over and over again. I find it so enjoyable because there is more than one couple and thus we don't have to sustain one story the entire time. Of course.. some stories are worse than others but none drags on too long. Each story is about people that I like and there are no large woke storylines or things that annoy me.,/review/rw2670695/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2012,cosmo_tiger,8," Yet another chick-flick that I thought was great and liked it almost as much as my wife. I say A.
","""I just wanted the glow. The one that they promise you on the cover of those magazines. Well, I'm calling it - pregnancy sucks. Making a human being is really hard. I have no control over my body or my emotions."" This is a movie based off the famous book and deals with five different couples and how they handle pregnancy ranging from problems trying to adopt to having a sickeningly easy time giving birth. This is yet another movie dealing with many different couples and relationship problems but this is one of the better ones. I have said before that I am not really a fan of this type of genre but I really enjoyed this movie and laughed throughout. It may be because I have a kid and went through the whole pregnancy thing with my wife but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. I am also really shocked at my favorite movies of the last few weeks. I have really enjoyed ""Think Like A Man"" and ""Five-Year Engagement"" and once again I think this ""chick-flick"" is the best movie of the week. I am not sure what that says about me but there are some really funny parts in this and if you are a woman do not be afraid about bringing this home to your man, he may throw a fit at first but the comedy (and Cameron Diaz's opening dance scene) will keep him watching and he will also enjoy it. I know I did...the dance was amazing though. Overall, a surprisingly funny movie that really won me over and I thought that was great. I (again surprisingly) give this an A.",/review/rw2670695/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2012,nickmesafilms,5," What to Expect When You're Expecting (2012) - Not Expecting to Expect Anything Good in This!
","You know what I expect? I expect better movies! ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" is once again another ensemble rom-com that's basically just a bunch of short stories glued together in a full-length motion picture. You know, with a cast like this, this movie would have been better off with a title like ""What to Expect When You're 'Selling Out'"". I wouldn't say that this movie was ""god-awful"", I suppose that maybe a married couple might enjoy something here, but this is still an unoriginal, predictable, and unmemorable piece of ""nothing"". Director Kirk Jones has provided to give us a giant predictable ""sell-out"" that does nothing but go with the usual clichés. In movies like this, we usually get a bunch of individual stories packed in one movie, some that we care about, and some that we don't care about. Each story talks about a group of couples who are about to either have a baby, adopt a baby, or deciding whether to have the baby or not. We've seen these stories plenty of times before, so there's already a clue for the audience to know what will happen next. There are some chuckle-inducing moments, and I cared for a few story lines, but it's just a shame because there are so many likable actors in this movie, so this might be considered as a waste of talent. Cameron Diaz plays a weight loss contestant on a reality show who's expecting a newborn with Matthew Morrison, Jennifer Lopez takes the ""Angelina Jolie"" perspective to adopt an African baby, Elizabeth Banks plays a pregnant woman with tons of anxiety problems on the torture of pregnancy, and what do you know, Chris Rock is actually the leader of a group of ""baby daddies"". These story lines are probably careless, and mostly not funny, if you ask me! The only two story lines I actually enjoyed involves Anna Kendrick as a young woman who is expecting a baby after a certain one-night stand, and Dennis Quaid as a NASCAR legend who's expecting a new baby with his much younger, and ridiculously hot wife, played by Brooklyn Decker. I actually need to score this movie some points for that! But either way, I wasn't surprised! This movie is exactly what everyone thought it was going to be, so I guess I can say I'm not really that upset with this movie. But ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" is not worth watching in any way, but if you're the type of person who enjoys these type of movies, my advice to you...wait for rental! I didn't expect that remark to pop out of my mouth. ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"", in my review, ""predictable and mediocre, but overall unimpressive"".",/review/rw2670695/?ref_=tt_urv

","Well... don't expect much. The plot is thin, predictable and the movie is simply not funny. My girlfriend roped me in -- so I went. The cast was likable... but everything else about the movie I couldn't bear. That said, this is a sure fire girl film that your lady love... especially if she has baby on her mind. The cast is very easy on the eyes.. especially the gorgeous Brooklyn Decker who is certainly bound to a be a big star. Jennifer Lopez was not very good or funny.

4 June 2012,meeza,4," Not so great expectations
","I expected at least a bit more creativity in the rom-com ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"". Sure I knew it is a prototype chick flick, and yes I am aware I am a male humanoid. But please, did you expect me to enjoy the ridiculous and humdrum scenes of this movie. Let me start with the embryonic part of this review. ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" focuses on several stories of women and their pregnancies and adoptions. One story is of a reality-show host celebrity Jules who unexpectedly gets pregnant by another reality-show host celebrity Evan; their biggest quarrel is if the child should be circumcised; I don't know about you but that just does not cut it for me in sheer entertainment. Another one is the neurotic Wendy who has desperately tried to get pregnant with her formerly-obese hubby Gary; and low and behold the unexpected happens one day and Wendy is in pregoland. Yet another yawning story is of Holly, a photographer who is not able to get pregnant so decides to get all Angelina-Jolied by adopting an African orphan. And then there is Gary's father Ramsey who impregnates his young stunning wife Skyler, who goes through the pregnancy experience as if nothing; which is pretty close to what this movie was. And I am not even touching the part of a quartet of sugar park daddies who are part of a creepy paternal cult that walk their babies on strollers in the park; but what do you expect from Director Kirk Jones' dismal film. The only story that I found semi-appealing was of young Rosie and Marco; Rosie unexpectedly gets pregnant from a one-night stand experience from the Don de Marco, and it authentically incorporates within their relationship. But this movie in the end, beginning, and middle did not even have one ounce of creativity, no thanks to Shauna Cross and Heather Hach's mechanical screenplay. The cast of this movie decided not to labor it too much with tons of silly performances from the likes of Cameron Diaz, Jennifer Lopez, Chris Rock, Elizabeth Banks, and Dennis Quaid; many of these established actors have been known to deliver worthy performances; but not in this delivery. I did think that the up- and-coming Anna Kendrick was genuine with her performance as Rosie. And Rebel Wilson was a rebel with a cause with her comedic performance as Wendy's assistant Janice. Nevertheless, I rather go through a cesarean section then revisit the awful sections of ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"". It is my birth right to proclaim this movie as one of the worst movies of 2012. ** Needs Improvement",/review/rw2670695/?ref_=tt_urv
