22 January 2023,VetteRanger,7," Nice but a couple of issues
","Here Allison Sweeny and her husband have hit a questionable patch in their marriage because they're both working too much and spend little time together. So they decided to take the time, take their ""not done yet"" honeymoon, and after spinning a globe wind up in Greece.",/review/rw8848993/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2023,catrine-48845,6," Not my favorite of the series
","I always enjoyed Alison Sweeney especially in ""murder she baked"". I wish they would do some more of those. I enjoy watching these except, I found this one a little bit dumb. They never had a honeymoon and never get to spend time together , so her friends end up crashing their honeymoon. I don't know about you but I would be a little upset. I also didn't think they had chemistry together . I did enjoy the other stories more and I always liked Lacey Chabert.",/review/rw8848993/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2023,Jackbv123,7," Another good one
",This franchise keeps giving us decent movies. It is probably because the 3 couples are played by reliable actors. I've always loved Allison Sweeny. There was one interesting and daring wardrobe choice for her.,/review/rw8848993/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2023,mwa-18792,1," You Ruined the Wedding Veil Trilogy with a Horrible Script
","I am a big fan of the original Wedding Veil Trilogy and was excited there would be more. Unfortunately, the next 3 were a big letdown, totally losing the charm and magic of the first 3. The stories didn't connect to one another. The last movie ""Journey"" was the weakest of the 2nd trilogy having many plot holes and a weak script. Even the interesting idea of having a honeymoon did not go anywhere that made sense. The girls showing up on her honeymoon was beyond the pale. It was laughable that Tracey got mad at Nick for trying to help the chef, yet she can't refrain from calling her 2 girlfriends on their honeymoon! By this last movie, it feels like the three friends are too codependent. The stories just did not make sense. Lady Dalton's back story could have been interesting, but it too felt forced and contrived when she offers up her trove of rare letters to fund an orphan she hardly knows. But, here again there are many unanswered questions, e.g., -- "" Why is this wealthy woman staying at this rather tacky hotel?"" ""Why do Nick and Tracey stay there, considering the inedible food?"" Worst of all was the tag at the end - with the antique dealer giving the girls the same line as Hilda in the first movie. This makes it feel like Hilda was just a con, and this was just a line used by antique dealers around the world when meeting gullible tourists. It was a poor choice for an ending, and not a good cliffhanger which is what I think the writer was going for. The three original Wedding Veil Trilogy scripts were smart and connected to one another. Shame on Hallmark for ruining the Trilogy with movies lacking spark and creativity.",/review/rw8848993/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2023,grammajanie-28811,10," Best of the bunch.
","All of the wedding veil movies are good. Great casts and fun premise. This. This is the best of them all, in my opinion. The 2 leads are hands down two of my all- time favorite actors - Victor Webster and Allison Sweeney elevate any movie. The plot in this installment has such depth. Not only does it have our next veil pairing , but also the story of Leo and his future. What a lovely addition to the overall story. What a great little actor Che Grant is! Very engaging and believable. All of the cast is strong. The pace is good and the scenery is gorgeous. And......it looks as if there may be more sequels? Yes, please.",/review/rw8848993/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2023,cgvsluis,7," I love the Wedding Veil series and hope it continues.
","This is the sixth film in the Wedding Veil series and it may not be my favorite, but set in Greece and starting Alison Sweeney and Victor Webster, it is still a must see.",/review/rw8848993/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2023,kirkendog,5," Throw out the veil
","The best thing about this movie was the location, a rare movie not filmed in Canada makes these better, even if they have their own weak moments. It also allows for a reduction in forced diversity, which this network has gone completely overboard with the last few years.",/review/rw8848993/?ref_=tt_urv
