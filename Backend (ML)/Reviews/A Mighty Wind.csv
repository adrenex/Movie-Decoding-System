1 July 2008,seawalker,6," Not a bad film. Just one that could have been better
","With the shadow of La Knightely looming large, I really wanted ""The Edge Of Love"" to be another ""Atonement"" - a big, beautiful looking, poetic wartime romance - but it wasn't. Do not get me wrong, there are many good things in ""The Edge Of Love"". It just did not touch my heart the way that ""Atonement"" did.",/review/rw3070112/?ref_=tt_urv

","Naturally, before watching this film, ones expectations are high. The tale of Dylan Thomas and his lovers promises to be exhilarating. The stars used in the production hold high promise. However the result is different. There is just something not quite right about this film.",/review/rw3070112/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2008,rogerdarlington,," A humanistic tale
","Set during the Second World War in both London and Wales, this film portrays the complex relationships between four real-life characters: the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas (played by Welsh actor Matthew Rhys abandoning his American accent from the US television series ""Brothers And Sisters""), his Irish wife Caitlin MacNamara (British actress Sienna Miller), his first love Vera Phillips (another British actress Keira Knightley) and Vera's husband the British soldier Captain William Killick (Irish actor Cillian Murphy). Many of the incidents represented are a matter of record but other occurrences are simply speculation on the part of screenwriter Sharman Macdonald (Knightley's mother).",/review/rw3070112/?ref_=tt_urv

","Where would Hollywood have been without Fredric March as Robert Browning or Dennis Price as Lord Byron, famous lovers in their day?

","This will be rough and tumbly, as I've just watched the film under less-than-ideal (ahem) circumstances. Let me say first off that I feel sorry for fans of Dylan Thomas: Matthew Rhys is charming beneath his mop of dark curls, his eyes twinkle with mischief, and his expressive voice lends itself well to what few lines of Thomas's poetry he recites, but Dylan Thomas as a character in this film is such an abominable wastrel and a cad that at best he's Satan with a pot-belly and a Welsh accent.",/review/rw3070112/?ref_=tt_urv

","THE EDGE OF LOVE – TRASH IT ( C ) Keira Knightley's most Boring movie till dateShe & Sienna Miller looked gorgeous...But the movie didn't live up to the expectations the locations were stunning but the movie was very slow Cillian Murphy acted really well as always and I think Matthew Ryes was totally miscast (He only looked like Dylan Thomas), he couldn't stand up among them, he wasn't charming as Dylan Thomas was suppose to be, Anyways there was Bad Direction & Poor Writing as well Both Keira Knightley & Sienna Miller Couldn't Save this One though their Performances Were Really good. I really wished that if they worked on story a little bit more so it would have been more interesting and intriguing for us.",/review/rw3070112/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2013,Rodrigo_Amaro,5," Life, ""Love"" and Loss during Wartime. Dreadful and in no way could have been better
","Love triangle? Forget it, this is a love square involving famous poet Dylan Thomas (Matthew Rhys), his wife Caitlin (Sienna Miller), his lover and later her friend Vera (Keira Knightley) and an admirer of her, the soldier William (Cillian Murphy). But not necessarily involving all of them together, even though there's the knowledge of all parts that there's something on in between them. And the background of this turbulent relationship is England during World War 2 with the bombs falling over their heads while they ""love"" and hate each other, and write poems about it. ""The Edge of Love"" isn't a romantic story of meetings, falling in love and break-ups, it's the upside of those, it's everything else but love. Pitiful",/review/rw3070112/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2008,jmelvin1-1,8," Portrait Of An Artist as a Bad Man
","From the start of ""The Edge Of Love"", the viewer is transported to the striking world of WW2 London. We follow the lives of four people who might have been created just for this movie, an exploration of female friendship and the strains caused on it by marriage and infidelity. Except one of the characters is named Dylan Thomas, perhaps the greatest English poet of the 20th century. And his reactions to the world around him were not only selfish, but at times truly despicable. ",/review/rw3070112/?ref_=tt_urv

","Despite the title and unlike some other stories about love and war, this film isn't too sticky and pink, because love is as a rose: With thorns, that is.

","Keira Knightley and Sienna Miller stars in the story of two of the women in the life of Dylan Thomas. Knightley is Thomas's boyhood sweetheart he re-encounters during the Blitz. Meeting at a bar they reconnect, however things become complicated when Thomas' brings his wife (Miller) along the next time he meets her. The women hit it off and things proceed at pace until the trio are joined by the man who will become Knightly's husband. This further complicates things as jealousy begins to show its face.",/review/rw3070112/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2008,kjewitt,5," Is there really a story in there?
","I'd like to think that there is a space in the market for ""intelligent"" and ""adult"" films which aren't just about exploding robots, hidden magic worlds etc. This film ticks many of the required boxes, but I think it plays into the hands of fans of non-intelligent and adult films who are always ready to say ""where's the story? What am I supposed to get excited about?"" There is a definite problem that there is no clear protagonist. It's very easy to be sniffy about McKie and Hollywood story structure: but, on the other hand, it's very hard to make a film unless you have a protagonist who is in jeopardy and who changes as a result. Vera (KK) probably gets the most screen time: but she doesn't really change much. William (Cillian Murphy) is the character who faces the greatest danger: but we don't see the film through his eyes. Overall, I think the performances and the film-making generally are good enough: there is also plenty of adequate dialogue and texture in the writing: but the story isn't really strong enough. It's really a Sunday evening, one hour, made for TV drama which fits very well with the remit of BBC television: but I can't see why it should be on the big screen. Re Sienna Miller as Caitlin, I heard Mark Kermode deliver a spectacular condemnation before I saw the film. I sort of agree that the accent is all over the place but that for me wasn't the real problem: I just don't think she is mad and bad enough. The gooey ending with KK and SM struggling to part, and sort of promising always to be friends, is absurd. At no point in the film has their friendship ever been an important issue for the audience, and it is ridiculous to expect the audience to start caring about it here.",/review/rw3070112/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2010,PeachHamBeach,9," Their own little universe...
","THE EDGE OF LOVE. I even found the title intriguing. Can the edge of love grow in many strange directions? Does madness live beyond this edge? At times, it feels like the film seems to be missing something. It's hard to describe. It's either that or it's just that sometimes you feel strangely disconnected from the characters, which somehow makes it even more difficult to stop watching and just turn off. You just can't seem to turn away from this private little world in which one man and two women live. John Maybury definitely has his own unique ""grammar"" in film, which he himself makes fun of along with actor Matthew Rhys in a commentary track which is as much fun as the movie itself.",/review/rw3070112/?ref_=tt_urv

29 September 2011,phd_travel,," Worth watching for the 2 actresses but the story is unpleasant
","With a WW2 setting, a famous poet's story and good leads this movie should have been a really good one. I am a fan of both actresses Keira and Sienna and they do look quite lovely here. Keira looks most beautiful when she isn't smiling. She is a surprisingly good singer and it's quite fascinating to watch her sing. The Blitz parts are quite sudden and effective. The down side is the story itself isn't very pleasant. This love triangle is a bit painful to watch. I understand it is based on true events but the characters are realistically flawed. The mental breakdown of Cillian Murphy's character is quite frightening. And Keira's acting is quite good here. Sienna is alright too although her role is simpler. It shows Dylan Thomas in quite a realistic self centered way. Matthew Rhys is good as the selfish poet. I can see why the movie wasn't more successful. The story is unpleasant. The screenplay relied too much on rushed dialog to lay out key plot elements and it was hard to grasp what was happening sometimes. Maybe the direction could have been clearer when establishing the story lines and major events.",/review/rw3070112/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'm increasingly aware of two kinds of ordinary narrative. One is simple storytelling. However well done it is, the point is to display a life changed without changing that of the viewer. Another is a powerfully constructed machine designed to fundamentally touch the viewer.

3 July 2008,stowbury,8," An art-house movie of the highest calibre
","This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more. A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it). But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold. It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work. A very rare type of film these days - it holds the attention and stirs the emotions without abandoning artistic integrity and succumbing to manipulative, superficial shortcuts.",/review/rw3070112/?ref_=tt_urv
