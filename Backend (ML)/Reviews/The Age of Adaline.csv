","I ""get"" that it is a time-honored tradition on IMDb that the first reviewers of any new series are usually fans in the making who have fallen in love with the show and want to sound the trumpet for others to follow.",/review/rw3614983/?ref_=tt_urv

7 February 2018,saltpieter,," Entertaining But Unbelievable
",So you can discharge very high calibre weapons at will in public places and no-one calls the police? People can be killed and no-one ever witnesses the incident. Did the American people all go overseas at once as there is a complete absence of normal movement of people during incidents in the show.,/review/rw3614983/?ref_=tt_urv

18 November 2016,mike_brunton,9," I enjoyed the pilot
","There are quite a few bad reviews for this pilot episode of Shooter, and I don't quite realize why. I am a big man of a well made series and also quite picky and critical. Very few series can maintain my interest for a long time, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Dexter, Boardwalk Empire, Hannibal are just a few I have stuck to right to the end. However, as movies are so badly made these days, Star Trek Beyond anyone? I have to admit I enjoyed the pilot. I think Ryan Philippe was fine, he didn't appear too young to be a seasoned vet. I thought the family angle was endearing and added to the torment of what is about to happen to him. I watched the 2007 movie Shooter with Mark Wahlberg and I also think it was a very good movie that deserved a higher rating. Many people have talked about the series of books that movie and this series are based upon. If the series follows the book (I presume), and the movie then we kind of know what to expect from the following episodes, but even then I don't care. It will be interesting to see if they can maintain the suspense and action for 10 or so episodes. Sure, perhaps nine out of ten is too high a rating, but clearly there were haters out there slating this pilot and giving it two or three stars which is just unfair. I am also pleased that clearly right from the start the producers are saying this is just one season and not going to be drawn out and become ridiculous like Prison Break, and personally I have felt the same with Gotham, The Flash and the 100 (although season two was excellent, season three made me leave). So sure we know what to expect from the coming episodes, a lot of running, a lot of conspiracy theories, a lot of Swagger digging for the truth, and I am fine with that, if they keep up the production values and dialogue, and the directing was fine.",/review/rw3614983/?ref_=tt_urv

30 November 2016,clacura,7," Loved the Movie, Ep 3 finally got it right!
","A series pilot today is everything. it is like the weekend box office results for a movie. It has to hit. That is the new reality in TV. There are just too many options. That said, hang in there. The pilot was not Mr Robot. That was one of the best pilots ever. ",/review/rw3614983/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2018,YabbaDabbaDabba,1," Season 1 Good. Then It Just Went Off A Cliff!
","I hate conspiracies that drone on and on. I hate stupid plots. Phoenix, Atlas, give me a break. Conspiracies always foretell cheap writing, cheaper script writers and just plain dumbness. This has been going on for seasons 2 and 3 and I'm tired of it. I have been tired of it. This went off the cliff in season 2. Not interesting, not believable and just plain boring. Don't waste your time when it starts reruns in a couple of years because it hit the cliff entirely too soon.",/review/rw3614983/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2017,redx1708,1," Lord have mercy
","This is not really a review since i turned it off in disgust after watching 30 minutes of the 1st episode. I have read all the books and they are class material just begging to be made into movies. The Mark Wahlberg movie was decent but not remarkable, probably because of the limited time they had to unfold the plot, so I was looking forward to the series adaption which could really get all the plot right. What a disappointment though. It's the classic ""the book ain't good enough, we can certainly do better"", syndrome. So why not write an original story instead of just borrowing character names ? Living in a cabin Deep in the Woods with his dog ? We can't have that. Lets give him a nice house and a Hallmark Family. Oh, and let's turn Nick Memphis into a sexy female FBI agent. Indeed let's forget all about the stupid book and do our own thing. Well Lord have mercy !! Can't believe Steven Hunter approved this.",/review/rw3614983/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2021,kosmasp,7," The whole package
","I really am curious if there ever will be the day, when people stop rating a whole show based on just either a couple of episodes or the very first season. The only show I rated before it ended (and I will update before you cry foul once it continues) is Cobra Kai. But as I've already stated, I will update my rating if necessary, but certainly edit and extend my review to it.",/review/rw3614983/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2020,cereyese,7," Alternative ending in my mind
","I watched the 3 seasons in under a week and got really hung on the series. I really liked it. The first 2 seasons are way better though, in the third one it seems they forgot bob lee's a sniper. No sniping from him. The ending however.... after everything, really?? Please un-shoot julie, it left me depressed. I created an alternative ending in my mind and will pretend this never happened.",/review/rw3614983/?ref_=tt_urv

19 June 2018,witster18,7," beware of the technicality dockers!
","Listen, I didn't serve, and I'm not a weapons expert, so I wouldn't know if there are technical issues with the series. That said, for a USA series this is surprisingly entertaining. Also, it's pretty hard to find any soldier-based actioner or science/dr piece without finding something to gripe about.",/review/rw3614983/?ref_=tt_urv

19 November 2016,Starmix715,9," Loved it. Kept me gripped all the way through.
","There are so many reviews detailing every minor things they thought wad wrong but why can't people just enjoy something without picking faults in things that don't affect the overall show? The acting was very good indeed. the story was good, it flowed nicely, it ended in a way where I cannot wait to watch the episode 2. Ryan Phillipe's depiction of Bob was superb! He was truly believable. It wasn't overbearing with political nonsense, it showed his home life and explained why he had walked away from the army. It has the potential for greatness if the rest of the series keep up the pace, it wasn't one dimensional, it looks like we are really going to get to know the characters, and at the end of the day it was entertaining, what else do you want from a TV show??",/review/rw3614983/?ref_=tt_urv

23 April 2021,gnaqgxy,8," Season 1 = 10. Season 2 = 6.5. Season 3 = 8
","Veterans, Patriots, Texans will love this series. Just because there's not sex/drug scenes or adultery or constant profanity in every episode doesn't make this a ""kid's show"" or ""written by a 12-year-old."" The series is very action-packed, and all of the actors did a great job (except Harris; I found his character quite annoying). Season 2 was not my favorite. Too many flashbacks and weird storyline. But you have to watch it to understand Season 3, which was pretty great. I agree with the other reviews... they could have added more seasons.",/review/rw3614983/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2018,elliotjeory,8," Great show
","This show is a cut above the rest. If you were a fan of the film you will like this. Plenty of action, great acting and character development. It's also smart and is interesting to learn things from a military perspective. Episodes aren't too long and keep you interested in following the story and plot developments. A season 4 would be great.",/review/rw3614983/?ref_=tt_urv

16 July 2017,Cameow,5," So Unbelievable! üôÑüëéüèº
","I am a 50 year old woman with no military experience or gun knowledge. I started watching the first season on Netflix this weekend so I could be ready for the opening of the second season July 18. I really liked the first three episodes, even though they were nothing like the 2008 movie, but by the 4th episode, it started getting really ridiculous. In real life, his wife and everyone associated with him would be watched by all the government agencies for years. His wife and Memphis are no longer watched after the 3rd episode, he goes to the library, to gun shows, to convenience stores (he even meets his wife in the bathroom at one) he sneaks to see his wife and has sex one night, he meets his wife and daughter for a family picnic and spends the afternoon together, nobody is ever following him, his wife or Memphis. By episode 10, there is no hiding, he is out in public with nobody paying any attention to him. Really??? This guy was supposed to have tried to assassinate the President of the United States! Everyone would recognize him. It's really sad that this turns into such a joke. But, I suppose my expectations were a little high. After all, how can you take a 2 hour movie and make 10 episodes each an hour long and never solve the show? Good thing I didn't have anything better to do on a hot, rainy, miserable weekend. And no, I won't be tuning in for 10 more hours of the second season.",/review/rw3614983/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2016,office-934-681839,8," Promising, has potential, but still early to say to be good.
","This seems to be promising. A little of ""the contractor, with Wesley Snipes"", a bit of ""murder at 1600"", and other similar movies have been set on the stage, but nevertheless this is now a series, a TV show and it can go into a interesting direction. Although it is hard to say after the first plot, how it really will end up. Anyhow, I will wait for the next show and see if it is worthy my higher scores. One at last, there are a view top shows out there, meaning top writing, acting, scenery, music, etc. (some like Banshee, although it might be not everybody's genre), anyway, this first show is a little poor on these parts, but as I said it has the potential to become much better. We will see.",/review/rw3614983/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2017,Gracie96,10," Great show, great acting
","First let me say that I know this is a take-off on the movie ""Shooter"" starring Mark Wahlberg with some character changes. That being said, I like both versions but think I may like this TV series more than the movie. Another reason I like this show is actor Tom Sizemore--my all-time favorite tough guy actor--is in it playing Hugh Meachum, an evil CIA agent who is partially behind the plot to set up Bob Lee for an attempt to kill the president. Sizemore has playing the perfect bad guy down to an art and in this role his character will stop at nothing to rid himself of Bob Lee and anyone else who interferes with his plans. I hope this series is renewed at the end of the season. Anyone not watching it is missing out on a great series.",/review/rw3614983/?ref_=tt_urv
