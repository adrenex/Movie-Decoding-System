21 May 2019,dholliday-imdb,8," Seasons 1-6: outstanding. 7: daft but good. 8: disappointing
","Let's say you're reading these reviews and haven't watched GoT yet, but now that it's finished are considering the marathon. What's the consensus? In this case, the consensus is accurate, and that is:",/review/rw2415538/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2023,Supermanfan-13,10," One of the best shows ever created!
","What can you say about this incredible show that hasn't already been said? I know that people say this about a ton of different shows but Game of Thrones is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the best TV shows ever created...it's damn near perfect (except for maybe the last few episodes) and easily one of my all-time favorite shows! Yeah, the last few episodes of Season 8 weren't that good and the ending was just awful but the first 7 1/2 seasons were so amazing that it still gets a 10 from me! I'm pretty sure there's never been a show more talked about or more loved in the history of television than GOT. All you have to do is read through the reviews to see how loved this show really is! Again, this show is absolutely amazing!",/review/rw2415538/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2020,SaifOVGU,10," Can you just make the remake the season finale?
","I'm feeling so heartbroken to see everyone criticising my favourite show of all time. And yes of course that's because of the bad making of the season finale, I can totally understand that. After all these years hardwork, creating and developing each and every character from bottom to top, memories, emotions throughout the process all went to vain for one bad making. It's so painful to accept it for the audience who invested lots of time watching the show from the starting and then finishing it like this! It's a long long journey. I don't even remember the day I started watching it and since then I waited the next year to come for the new season. I can't say anything more. Only one last request, could you please delete the whole season 8 and make a new version of it? Please?",/review/rw2415538/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2017,TheLittleSongbird,10," This is a television show?
","Was over-time on a gradual binge of watching 'Game of Thrones' from the first episode (gradual because of being so busy), having heard nothing but amazing things about it from friends, family and IMDb reviewers. Plus with such a great cast of talent and a brilliant book series, how could it possibly go wrong? ",/review/rw2415538/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2023,afura-78800,10," One of the best series ever made
","I finally finished watching game of thrones and all I can say is that this is one of the best shows ever created. This show has just everything you want to have in a show like nice special effects, awesome story, very talented actors, good surpise moments and effects, incredible landscapes and so on.",/review/rw2415538/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2019,samxxx-671-826221,8," A perfect example of: Falling in Love with the Wrong Guy
","It was a master piece. It was written to the perfection. It was mesmerizing. It was gripping. It was so shocking that if someone is binge watching this show he/she will need a time-off in between to get their head around things and accept some messed up, yet mind blowing development.",/review/rw2415538/?ref_=tt_urv

","So imagine you go into an ice cream shop and you order a sundae. They've got all kinds of nice stuff going on, beautiful delicious soft serve vanilla bean ice cream, some hot fudge, freshly cracked up peanuts, woah what is that?? A brownie? Some delicious house made whipped cream... Man this sundae is gonna be spectacular. Wow what more could you ask for? Cherry on top? Bring it on!!",/review/rw2415538/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2020,alshamari-marwa,9," Extraordinary untill season 8
","This is the first series i would recommend to anybody , it is an amazing piece of work , the most stunning TV series you will ever watch.
Why i gave it 9/10 because of the last season, it's still good but very disappointing compared to all the seasons. YOU will enjoy every episode",/review/rw2415538/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2022,msorik,10," A real (pre/se)quel...
","Pure rubbish what they are calling a prequel...but I hear a sequel is coming-with Snow! Characters we actually care about bc the storylines were so good. Simply the best series ever on TV! I cannot contain it nor lie about it I would love to see Sansa back...it's all good between cousins even in the Bible! I don't think I can handle a man in the wilderness story, it will have again missed what people enjoyed about it. Bring back the sisters, etc. And give us good stories and DO NOT resuscitate the dragon lady! It will be almost next to impossible to write a good story again but I wish them the best.",/review/rw2415538/?ref_=tt_urv

30 December 2022,Amthermandes,10," Completely and utterly genius, despite the anticlimactic ending
","This show is one in a million. It's one of the few shows that either meet or transcend the public hype. Yes, it's that good. No, it's not for everyone. It's chock full of extreme violence, gore, and the nudity is rampant and unnecessary, but aside from the extreme adult content, it's absolutely worth the hype.",/review/rw2415538/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2022,christopherbirk-ny,10," Epic and amazing!
",That's really all there is to say: Epic and amazing! Touches on all the right elements and does it with perfect execution. Stellar cast that seems born to play those roles.,/review/rw2415538/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2020,danielkpkp,9," It could have been the best TV series ever made...
","Till season 7 very likely the best TV show ever made in terms of suspense, character development, plot, effects, acting.... 10/10 with no doubt! But S6E10 is probably the point where you should stop and imagine your own ending. It is guaranteed better and has more character development. Otherwise you may end up rating it down by more than just one and are overcome by disappointment...",/review/rw2415538/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2022,daycu-,," An Epic Fantasy Series!
","Game of Thrones has its flaws but it can't be denied that it's one of the most watched, popular and cherished shows by HBO. The production design alone still holds up and will most likely always. The cinematography is so gorgeous, the VFX is superb, unforgettable battles, brutal moments, heartwarming moments, Game of Thrones has it all! With a vast cast of characters, Game of Thrones juggles it's characters so impressively well. Not to mention Game of Thrones is full of complex grey characters, which I personally love. The only flaw I've seen in the series was bad choppy action sequences in one episode. Ive always felt that the music and character dynamics was the heart of Game of Thrones and believe it or not, we got that throughout all 8 seasons. Game of Thrones not only left one hell of a imprint in the television world, but set up success for other series to come from the world of Westeros, and is definitely a must watch. Don't let the bad reviews fool you!!",/review/rw2415538/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2021,kevin_robbins,10," Ultimately, this remains one of the greatest television series of all time, even with it's complete failure of a conclusion.
","Game of Thrones is a series we caught onto just after Season 2 and watched real-time straight through after catching up off HBO until the very final episode. The storyline focuses on several kingdoms, many of which feel they have their own claim to the throne that rules them all. When a powerful and incestuous family takes the throne away from a recently killed king, some noble families emerge only to be ruthless struck down and family scattered. Watch as the family members strive for success on their own and hope to get their lands back on the right foot and direction.",/review/rw2415538/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2022,drana-86716,10," Underrated Actors and Worse Ending
",First of all reading a book and watching a show are two different things. People who likes to read doesn't mean they will like the show based on that book and vice versa. Movies and shows are mainly for commercial purposes as it target much larger audiences than ardent book readers.,/review/rw2415538/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2014,gogoschka-1,8," Fantasy has never seemed so real
","I don't believe there has ever been anything like 'Game of Thrones' on TV. The sheer amount of quality and talent in this series is staggering. The actors (and I mean really ALL the actors), the costumes, the visual effects, the make-up: everybody working on this show seems to have wanted to make Television-history. And the writing is just phenomenal.",/review/rw2415538/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2020,Jockette,10," Just awesome
","I came late to GOT on TV - finally starting to watch around the time S8 was launched. So I pretty much knew of the characters and storylines as I watched the whole series. This meant no (major) surprises, and limited emotional impact re how good/bad the series became over the years. In my view, the whole series rates as a 10/10. Some episodes better/worse than others, of course. But as an engaging and gripping series it blew me away.",/review/rw2415538/?ref_=tt_urv

16 September 2022,martin_merelesc,9," When you play the game of thrones, you either win or you die
","This series has undoubtedly become one of my favorites, it is very striking, since in addition to mixing topics such as politics, strategy, betrayal, fantasy, secrets and wars, it is also an unpredictable series and what do I mean, well, basically when you think you know what is going to happen, either with a story or a character, it takes a totally unexpected turn, so if someone has not seen it yet, my advice is: ""never get completely attached to the characters""
Speaking of the characters, we have a wide variety of them to choose from and a large part with a very good evolution, at least until they die; Here none of them are completely good or bad (correction: if there are some who are really bad), and that is why there may come a time when you hate them, but then you love them and then you hate them again...",/review/rw2415538/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2023,DiCaprioFan13,10," Absolutely Amazing!!
","What can be said about Game of Thrones that hasn't already been said? It's universally thought of as one of the best series in the history of television. Look up any ""best shows ever"" list and I promise you'll find Game of Thrones near the top of every list you'll find. Obviously everyone knows the last episode was absolutely awful, even most of the actors have come out and said they didn't like it. Having said that, it doesn't take away from the show being amazing. One bad show doesn't take away from the other 72 episodes that were almost perfect! I've watched the entire series all the way through twice now and if anything I just appreciate this show even more.",/review/rw2415538/?ref_=tt_urv
