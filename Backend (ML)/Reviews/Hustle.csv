9 June 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,9," If you're not a fan of basketball, you'll still enjoy this well put-together film.
","But if you are, then you'll love this Adam Sandler and LeBron James production. It's a great and touching story, told perfectly, with outstanding performances and chemistry by Sandler and actual NBA star Juancho Hernangomez. You'll also see a bunch of other NBA players and celebrities. The directing is excellent, as is the cinematography. The almost 2 hour runtime flew by with the great pacing. This film is certainly one of the better sport-dramas I've seen, if not the best. I promise you you'll laugh and you will cry. This is a re-watch at least one more time for sure. A well deserved 9/10 from me.",/review/rw8220187/?ref_=tt_urv

","The first thing i can noticed is how Adam Sandlers really have the chemistry on this role, i can feel how he personally love this game.",/review/rw8220187/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2022,tresm87,7," ""Serious"" Sandler with his signature touches of comic relief seems to be the winning formula of late.
",Once again it's no surprise that Adam shines in another more serious role. When people constantly seem to be shocked at his range I tell them to go back and watch reign over me. He's always had this versatility. That's not to say his signature brand of comedy isn't implemented in this solid film. The story is rather straightforward an interesting as it also shows his passion for the game of basketball that he's always had in reality as well. Overall another solid entry into his recent renaissance. Wasn't too fond of certain moments or the casting of Latifah as his wife but I can look that over.,/review/rw8220187/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2022,Calicodreamin,8," Love letter to basketball
",Adam Sandlers love letter to basketball and honestly it was kind of beautiful. The story had a good mix of truth and fiction and the cast a good mix of actors and bball legends. The characters had chemistry and brought authenticity to the sentiment of this story.,/review/rw8220187/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2022,ferguson-6,7," for love of the game
","Greetings again from the darkness. As a sports fan and movie fan, I approach every sports movie with trepidation and low expectations. Let's face it, most actors aren't great (or even good) athletes, and most athletes aren't great (or even good) actors. We would have no interest in a western where the cowboys can't ride horses, just as we have no interest in watching John Goodman portray a baseball legend in THE BABE (1992). I tell you this to convey my state of mind while preparing to watch this basketball movie from director Jeremiah Zagar and co-writers Will Fetters (A STAR IS BORN, 2018) and Taylor Materne. It gives me pleasure to say that even though the premise is kind of similar to Kevin Bacon's 1992 film, THE AIR UP THERE, this one should satisfy most sports and basketball fans.",/review/rw8220187/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2022,wackoreviews,8," Great sports movie FILLED with cameos from the NBA
","Turns out Adam Sandler can actually do movies that aren't comedies. Shocking, I know. After a down-on-his-luck basketball scout discovers an extraordinary player abroad, he brings the phenom back without his team's approval.",/review/rw8220187/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2022,haines403,9," Why Sandler why?
","Why can he make excellent films like this yet still makes garbage films where he pulls stupid faces and talks stupid? This film had Rocky vibes not just Philly wise,it was engrossing and despite preferring football as we say in the UK to basketball it was entertaining all the way through...please stop with the terrible comedies and stick to this sort of stuff...",/review/rw8220187/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2022,carsonpayne-66437,9," Unexpectedly captivating
","I don't know what I expected when I start watching this movie without being much better than I would've hoped for. Sandler did a great job in his performance and kept a humorous also showing the interesting part that goes to the NBA. The start of the cast also kept me glued to the screen as I was waiting to see who would show up next. The story was interesting and kept me intrigued throughout the film which is not what I would've expected. There were some good jokes, some moving scenes, and an overall well written story.",/review/rw8220187/?ref_=tt_urv

9 June 2022,impendingdd,10," A really good movie.
","Sandler is in his element here. He's natural the entire film. There's not one awkward moment from him. Juancho Hernangomez, a real life pro ball player who plays Bo Cruz, the other star of the film, is a very good actor. The film may not do anything daring, but it doesn't need to. It's a really well made movie that's entertaining and well casted. The soundtrack is good. It's a feel good movie about redemption and never giving up. Sometimes being cliche isn't a bad thing when it's done well. I for one loved to see Sandler doing a movie like this. And the energy is just there. One last thing I'd like to add is there are cameos in this movie but they don't feel forced. There's not really any cringey dialogue, they kind of just get their few seconds of screen time in. And no, Lebron does not have a role in this movie for those wondering.",/review/rw8220187/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2022,reedychris,8," Heart felt feel good sports movie. Best one in years
","If you're like me and enjoy feel good sports movies you will enjoy this. Seems like years since anyone got one right. The way it ends is a little bit flat, but still enjoyable.",/review/rw8220187/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2022,mwen001-2,8," The Cruz Missile
",When you play or played the game you will really appreciate that film. Yes it is the traditional story line like against all odds but it is very well executed and tells the story in modern way. Finally a movie about the foreign players in the NBA and there stories how they got into the NBA. Really enjoyed it!,/review/rw8220187/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2022,offthewall101,8," Sandler should stick to serious roles
","From Billy Madison and Jack & Jill to Uncut Gems and Hustle, Adam's come a long way. Great movie with a near perfect arc, the only major flaw was that the payoff was so short, wish they showed Cruz a little more in his triumphant state.",/review/rw8220187/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2022,arungeorge13,7," A predictable-yet-fun sports drama with a good Sandler performance! [+66%]
","While this could very easily have been another goofy, over-the-top sports drama from the Happy Madison team, the writers Taylor Materne & Will Fetters along with director Jeremiah Zagar ensure they add the essential ingredient - heart. Yes, it helps if you have context of the game of basketball and the running of the NBA, but Hustle treats its lead characters with sufficient emotional touches that make their journey worth seeing. Once again, Sandler is great in a serious role with some occasional comical flourishes. The film doesn't try to generate comedy for the sake of it. All that's there is situational and comes naturally within the interactions.",/review/rw8220187/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2022,Sunsphxsuns,10," HOW COULD ANYONE NOT LOVE THIS FILM?
","No matter what people say about him, Adam Sandler consistently directs, produces, writes, and, mainly, acts in entertaining films. The fact that he is probably one of the kindest, nicest, and genuine people in the film industry is simply ""sauce for the goose."" He's a nice fellow! That in itself is absolutely phenomenal, considering the Hollywood movie industry has a dark reputation for being ruthless, duplicitous, obsequious, and sometimes, rather lecherous (as in, Harvey Weinstein).",/review/rw8220187/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2022,deloudelouvain,7," Sandler should stick to these kind of roles.
","I've never been a fan of Adam Sandler, well not the comedy Adam Sandler, you know the one where he acts and talks stupidly. I couldn't stand him in those roles, but since Uncut Gems and now Hustle I discovered another Adam Sandler, a much better one. I won't ever say he's my favorite actor, that will never happen, but he should stick to roles like this one. I don't understand why this movie is also categorized in the comedy genre, because this isn't a comedy at all, it's a dramatic basketball movie. You don't really have to be a basketball fan to appreciate this movie (where tons of real players and other celebrities appear) but it helps. A bit long but entertaining nonetheless.",/review/rw8220187/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2022,masonsaul,9," Incredible sports drama

it remains an incredible sports drama because it tells it's story with plenty of warmth and a clear love and passion for the sport with satisfying nuance and restraint.",/review/rw8220187/?ref_=tt_urv

13 June 2022,FeastMode,6," NBA version of Rocky
","This is an enjoyable sports movie with a good performance by Adam Sandler. It does a good job investing you in the characters and their outcomes. There is a ton of NBA fan service, especially with the cameos. I'm more of an NFL guy so that stuff didn't do much for me. I still had a pretty good time.
