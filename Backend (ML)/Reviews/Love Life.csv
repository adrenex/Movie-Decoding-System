21 January 2002,joseph t,," This one will touch you...
","This is a masterful and faithful portrayal of Steinbeck's classic novel. The screenplay brings to life the tragic yet uplifting story of loyalty and the kind of bond that can grow between men that we are often reluctant to acknowledge, much less show.",/review/rw3487230/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2000,Junker-2,9," Tell me about the rabbits, George...
","I put off watching this movie for many years. I figured, what was the point? I had read the book ""Of Mice and Men"", watched earlier movie versions and seen it performed on stage. Why sit through yet another version? Finally one day at the video rental store I decided to take a chance and rent it. I am very, very glad I did.",/review/rw3487230/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 1999,tesscat,10," Beautifully done!
","How often are we forced to endure the uninsightful changes that are made to American classics in the process of turning them into feature films?  The 1939 version of this movie is a prime example.  It, very simply, was not the story that Steinbeck wrote.  The changes that were made were too sweeping to be seen as anything other than some ego thinking that Steinbeck could be improved upon.",/review/rw3487230/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2004,dbdumonteil,8," ...and a hutch full of rabbits
","""Of mice and men"" is one of these movies we definitely need in our times.Gary Sinise 's directing is classic in the noblest sense of the term.The cinematography recalls some of those Ford (who adapted ""Grapes of wrath"",another Steinbeck's novel for the screen) gems of the forties or fifties.It is heart-rending to see Malkovich and his portrayal of the half-wit is one of the finest you can see in a nineties movies and leaves,for instance Dustin Hoffman's ""rain man"" character far behind.It takes a lot of guts to play such demeaning parts !Gary Sinise should not be forgotten either,in a performance which offers all the subtleties of the heart.",/review/rw3487230/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2000,pettyfog,9," Should be shown in EVERY h.s. lit class
","If ever a movie lived up to a standard of literature for the contemporary American art form, this is it. When you watch this you'll be stunned at how easy it should be to adapt a novel .. but it's seldom done right. You'll NEVER find a truer adaptation than this.. in fact you'll swear it's not ""adapted"" at all.",/review/rw3487230/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2007,oshram-3,10," A brilliant vision
","Most of you are probably familiar with the plot from when this book was forced upon you in high school; George and Lenny are wandering laborers in the 20s/30s. George is a pretty sharp guy, but Lenny is mentally handicapped; a giant of a man, he is a phenomenal worker, but his mental and emotional shortcomings continually land the two men in hot water. When they end up at a particular ranch in Salinas, the men encounter trouble that no amount of running away will solve.",/review/rw3487230/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2018,bradencn,10," The only movie I know that follows the book to a ""T""
","If you are looking for a movie that has every scene, every character, and every part of the plot that is exactly accurate to the book, you have found it in this film. It was absolutely incredible to watch one of my favorite books come to life.",/review/rw3487230/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2000,jamie_71,10," Wonderful
",It took me forever to get ahold of this movie. I had waited 2 weeks for it to be returned to the movie store. I waited four hours until the man brought it back to make sure I got it. Wow was it worth waiting for! I have not seen any movies lately that were so full of heart and love. Sinise and Malkovich BOTH play amazing roles in this film. I've seen it 5 times and everytime I cried at the dramatic ending. It shows how cruel and yet how loving people can be. This movie has a great mix of everything I think anyone could enjoy. I cannot believe I had never heard of this film before looking up info on Gary Sinise. This film should be a classic. The acting is superb and it holds your attention throughout the whole movie. I LOVE this movie incredibly!! Definitely a 10 out of 10!,/review/rw3487230/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2001,mikemahony,9," Better than I expected
","I simply rented this movie to get a head start in my english class. I heard we are reading this book, so I rented the movie to have the edge over my classmates who know nothing of it yet. ""HA HA HA"" I thought now I will be smarter.",/review/rw3487230/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2005,JuguAbraham,8," Amazing movie adaptation of a great book
","Often a movie is associated with its actors or its director. I would associate this film more with Horton Foote the brilliant scriptwriter, who sculpted the script from a great book by a formidable author, John Steinbeck.",/review/rw3487230/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2001,ellusion,9," A gentle hand makes a powerful punch.
","A gentle hand makes a powerful punch.  And I'm not talking about Lenny, but Gary Sinise.  I'm not quite sure why this one of the most powerful adaptations from a book.  Perhaps the steps from book to play to screenplay gave it enough time to find it's pace and voice. ",/review/rw3487230/?ref_=tt_urv

10 August 2017,DoctorStrabismus,10," Great dramatisation of a very great classic
","Let's start out by saying that I am a huge Steinbeck fan. I have read just about all of his work, and many books several times over. I have visited his family home and the museum to him in Salinas, and also Monterey and Cannery Row on three occasions, and that's a long way from Australia.",/review/rw3487230/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2011,eyesour,6," Worth watching. Once
","It must be at least 50 years since I read Steinbeck's novella, and it stays with one. But there is still something off-putting about it, and I don't think I ever re-read it. I don't think I'll be re-watching this movie, either. Yes, both story and movie are moving and touching. They are also highly depressing, and have a sort of ugly fascination about them, rather than being enjoyable or impressive.",/review/rw3487230/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2003,panicwatcher,7," Great except for Malkovich
","This movie has a good script, fine acting, and is beautifully photographed. Even though I had read the book and knew the plot, I was drawn into story and moved by the ending.  Gary Sinise does a very good job of showing what a complicated and conflicted character George is.   George seems to be a smart man, but he has not gotten far in life.  He feels the need to watch out for his closest friend, Lenny.  But, you sense that George sometimes thinks Lenny is a burden and George feels guilty about those thoughts.  This might be Gary Sinise's best acting performance. ",/review/rw3487230/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2005,bwianiscool13,8," Great from a cinematic standpoint, Not too shabby from a Literary
","First off, the acting in this movie is incredible. It's funny how someone as intellectual and bright as Malkovich can pull his role off so well. Gary Sinese was great too, effectively portraying George.",/review/rw3487230/?ref_=tt_urv

3 December 2003,Smells_Like_Cheese,10," Very good
","""Of Mice and Men"" is one of my all time favorite books. I read it in high school and it was the first book I had a major interest in and read again and again after we finished it. The friendship of Lennie and George is so strong and inspiring. I think that's a reason I loved it, because my best friend and I could relate. We'd do anything for each other just like George would do for Lennie.",/review/rw3487230/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2008,disdressed12,8," good movie,but i thought the original was a bit better
","this almost exactly the same as the original 1939 version,yet i found it a bit slow and not quite as compelling.Gary Sinise directed and stars in the movie,along with John Malkovich.Sinise is very good as Gary,one half of a drifter duo,who travel the countryside looking for work and trying too stay out of trouble.Malkovich is mesmerizing in the role of Lenny the large man with the intellect of a child.Lenny is the reason they must keep moving.Gary tires to keep him out of trouble,but when that fails,they must movie on.i found this version lighter in tone than the original,but again,it is also tragic,just like the original.it's a good movie,but i just didn't like it as much as the original.for me,Of Mice and Men is an 8/10",/review/rw3487230/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2011,StevePulaski,9," A parable of friendship with dark undertones
","John Steinbeck's novel Of Mice and Men is a misunderstood literary work of art. Because of its simple nature, many people don't look at it with a very broad focus. But who could blame them? It's a pamphlet at a little more than a hundred pages and doesn't boast its explicit and controversial nature. The novel is basically reiterating Steinbeck's biased opinions of communism and how the common-man will never succeed because of roadside distractions.",/review/rw3487230/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2017,a_chinn,10," The last film directed by Gary Sinise is one of the best films of the 1990s
","Gorgeously filmed bit of Americana, although it's a rather dark vision American about of loneliness and the struggle to achieve the ""American Dream."" Director and star Gary Sinise, with screenwriter Horton Foote (who memorably adapted the 1962 film version of ""To Kill a Mockingbird""), craft a faithful adaptation of the John Steinbeck novel about two depression era drifters, George and Lennie. I won't bother summarizing the plot, as I'll assume anyone reading this has already read the book in middle school (or maybe you're a middle schooler watching the film instead of reading the book?), but Sinise is perfect as George, but the seemingly miscast John Malkovich as Lennie is surprisingly good in his role as well. Malkovich has never been a physically imposing presences on screen, which is one way he seems wrong for playing the hulking Lennie, and Malkovich is typically cast in sharp-tongues verbose roles such as ""Dangerous Liaisons"" or the villain in ""In the Line of Fire,"" but he does a wonderful job as the childlike Lennie. If I had to compare this performance to another of his, he did play a simple minded character in ""Making Mr. Right"" (along with a dual role as a more Malkovich-like of scientist). Ray Walston is the other standout in the cast as the old ranch hand Candy, who should have put down his own dog. Walston's role is a smaller one, but it's a particularly moving one from a veteran actor who's best remembered for his more comic of performances (""The Apartment,"" ""The Sting,"" or ""My Favorite Martian""), which really speaks to his talent. There really isn't a false note among any of the cast members, who include Casey Siemaszko, Sherilyn Fenn, John Terry, Alexis Arquette, Joe Morton, and Noble Willingham. These brilliant performances, elegant direction, and beautiful writing are complimented by one of composer Mark Isham's best scores (and that's saying something) and golden hued picturesque photography by Kenneth MacMillan. Overall, I'd rank Gary Sinise's ""Of Mice and Men"" among the best films of the 1990s and it's a crime the he hasn't directed a feature film since. FUN FACT! Walton's Candy is missing a hand and Walston is best known for playing Mr. Hand in ""Fast Times at Ridgemount High.""",/review/rw3487230/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2007,ackstasis,7," ""There ain't many guys travel around together. I don't know why. Maybe everybody in the whole damn world's scared of each other.""
","John Steinbeck's novel 'Of Mice and Men' is, along with his fellow masterpiece 'The Grapes of Wrath,' a classic of twentieth century literature. Brilliantly evoking time and place, Steinbeck masterfully recounted the tragic tale of George and Lennie, two friends who travel together and look out for each other during the Great Depression.",/review/rw3487230/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2016,Wuchakk,8," Steinbeck's classic book comes to life with Gary Sinise and John Malkovich
","Based on the classic John Steinbeck novel and released in 1992, the story focuses on two traveling companions desperate for work in rural California during the Depression: George (Gary Sinise) is of average stature and smart whereas Lennie (John Malkovich) is big and mentally challenged. They get a gig at a big ranch while dreaming of owning their own one day when the opportunity suddenly presents itself. Unfortunately, the arrogant son of the owner, Curley (Casey Siemaszko), and his flirtatious wife (Sherilyn Fenn) complicate matters. John Terry is on hand as Slim, Ray Walston plays Candy and Joe Morton plays Crooks.",/review/rw3487230/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10," Such a beautiful film...
","The book is one of my favourites, and I just loved this film. As an adaptation, it succeeds, apart from Curley's wife it is fairly faithful. But the real revelation of this Of Mice and Men is how well it succeeds on its own terms. The film looks absolutely gorgeous, with the scenery and photography very striking, while the score is moving and perhaps even nostalgic. The story still maintains the emotional impact especially at the end, and Of Mice and Men is beautifully scripted and directed. The performances are uniformly excellent. John Malkovich and Gary Sinise give very powerful performances, particularly Sinise, and Sherilyn Fenn has never been more appealing, however it was Ray Walston as Candy that I identified most with. All in all, a beautiful movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw3487230/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2016,eddie_baggins,8," A touching and well acted adaptation
","It's never an easy task tackling an adaptation of a famed novel and revered writer John Steinbeck's oft talked about and well-loved title from 1937 Of Mice and Men is a risky proposition for the big screen with its deep themes, hard hitting examination of human nature and multilayered characters but all the way back in 1992 actor/director Gary Sinise (a face still perhaps best known from Forrest Gump and now sadly the TV series CSI: NY) alongside John Malkovich, helped turn Steinbeck's source material into a drama filled with heart, soul and against all odds, humour.",/review/rw3487230/?ref_=tt_urv
