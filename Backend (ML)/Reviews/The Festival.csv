22 February 1999,SKG-2,8," Maybe Demi Moore does have what it takes
","I fully admit I am not the biggest Demi Moore fan in the world.  As a matter of fact, she's been in some of my least favorite movies of the decade (A FEW GOOD MEN, INDECENT PROPOSAL, THE SCARLET LETTER, THE JUROR, STRIPTEASE), and she really hasn't been good in any of those.  But she did win me over in this movie, because she lives up to her character's line, ""Look, I'm not trying to make any sort of statement here.""  And she isn't.  Instead of letting vanity get in the way, or injecting pathos, she lets her actions speak for her, just like her character does in trying to win acceptance as a SEAL.  The haircut scene is a good example; though it's directed with cinematic flourish, she does it matter-of-fact.",/review/rw0416962/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2002,Ghenghy,9," Worth a second look
","I ignored this on it's release and caught flashes of it during it's run on HBO, there were some exciting action sequences and amazing glimpses into the hell that SEAL training requires, but somehow I just couldnt put all the pieces together. It didnt make sense.....until now. I finally watched this movie in it's entirety last night and I am hooked. Whether the film misses the target on it's ""statement"" is not the point. It's just a good flick. Demi Moore pulls off the roll in convincing style and Viggo Mortenson has his best part as the Master Chief of the SEAL training unit. They have this crazy dynamic between themselves that finally unfolds at the ending, leaving you wishing for just a little more. Solid action film with a great support cast and a perfectly despicable villain played to the hilt by Anne Bancroft as a Senator who compromises GI Jane for her own political gain. Well, at least she tries. I think Demi Moore is one of the most underappreciated talents in recent memory. She has this unique combination of hardass determination and sensitivity that is rare. 9/10",/review/rw0416962/?ref_=tt_urv

10 September 2015,anaconda-40658,5," G.I.Joke.
","G.I. Jane (1997): Dir: Ridley Scott / Cast: Demi Moore, Viggo Mortensen, Anne Bancroft, Scott Wilson, Morris Chestnut: A film about a woman in a man's world with violence being the key factor. Demi Moore gives a convincing portrayal of a woman in military training and trying to withstand painstaking labour, crude gender jokes, and eating out of a trash bin. She exercises constantly and even shaves her head to blend in but outside forces attempt to sabotage her. What really comes across is her sense of human worth and her demand to be treated equally. During war games her entire troop is captured and she endures torture at the hands of her commander. Director Ridley Scott is skilled at presenting realism but the screenplay is marred with clichés and predictable ending that borders on farce. Scott has made superior films such as Blade Runner and Alien but this is hardly ranking up there with films that demonstrated greater skill. Moore displays a real sense of individuality while her co-stars surrender to stereotypes. Viggo Mortensen plays her heavy handed commander in what is easily a predictable stereotype with all the integrity of a playground bully. Anne Bancroft is also wasted in a role of a woman who is stuck so far back in tradition that it is a wonder that she exists in real time. For Moore this is barely a step up from Striptease. Message of equality is strong. Score: 5 ½ / 10",/review/rw0416962/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2009,zardoz-13,5," Gee, I Don't Like Jane
","Actress Demi Moore shaves her head, dons fatigues, and totes a machine gun in British director Ridley Scott's opportune but exploitative ""G.I. Jane,"" a sexual equality polemic about the first female to graduate as a Navy SEAL. This lackluster basic training epic serves up a volatile but exemplary message about equal rights and the armed forces that cost the filmmakers the aid of the Department of Defense. When ""G.I. Jane"" isn't preaching gender parity, this cynical but slickly done ""Top Gun"" clone is gung ho on showing Moore kicking butt in the kind of role her husband Bruce Willis excels. Sadly, ""G.I. Jane's"" melodramatic storyline combines with its juvenile heroics to undermine what little credibility it musters as a socially conscious exercise in political correctness.",/review/rw0416962/?ref_=tt_urv

7 August 2003,deliaj,5," Where I think this movie fails.
","G.I. Jane has some good points, good scenes, and (some)good acting. However, I saw its main point as trying to promote a ""can-do"" scenario for women in the military (I am a female veteran of 24 years) and I think several things in the movie do just the opposite.  If the idea, problem, or goal is to prove that women can succeed in a traditionally male career, task, or training, then that should be presented while maintaining the woman's gender.  What I mean is, O'Neil doesn't succeed until she shaves her head (shorter than the men's - and unnecessary), bulks up to the point where her body fat falls below normal and she ceases to menstruate, and generally becomes ""one of the boys.""  The point is, she's a woman, not a man.  She shouldn't have to become a man to prove she can succeed with a group of men. This is painfully clear when she screams ""Suck my dick,"" at the Sergeant. The obvious point is that, since she's a woman, she doesn't have one of those.  Nor should she need to metaphorically develop one in order to succeed.  Another point I'd like to make is that her dialogue as a prisoner of war was ridiculous.  The object is to survive.  If you don't, your mission has failed.  Taunting, bragging, and arguing with captors is a big NO-NO.  Her, ""I'm sorry, am I supposed to be afraid?"" line would have gotten her stripped naked and suspended under a water hose for hours.  There are no cadets that are tougher than the captors(instructors).  Bringing unhappy attention to oneself in that situation is inescapably stupid.  It is not tough.  Her worst line, though, is ""I'm going in."" CLICHE!!",/review/rw0416962/?ref_=tt_urv

","I was really looking forward to G.I. Jane, because I always tried to think of it when I was renting movies, but it always slipped my mind, then I just saw I love the 90's on VH1 and was reminded one more time, so I just stuck it in my head and finally watched it tonite. I have to say that actually I enjoyed G.I. Jane, I think that the rating on IMDb is a little unfair, but I can let it go. My problem with the film was the way it ended, it just turned into those big twist stories that wasn't really needed, because you are just rooting for Demi to make it throughout training and there is always some kind of block to make the audience ""interested"".",/review/rw0416962/?ref_=tt_urv

","Demi Moore gave a good performance to a role that suited her really well. I can understand where her character was coming from when she said that she did not want to become a poster figure for women's advancement in the military and society at large.  However, being that she was the only woman in the NAVY Seal training camp, it was sort of inevitable for that to happen.

24 February 2013,Uriah43,2," Feminist Propaganda
","This movie is proof that in Hollywood all things are possible. I say this because it was quite obvious that whoever wrote this film obviously had one goal in mind and that was to present a political opinion that pandered to a certain audience without regard to actual reality. But bending reality completely out of shape has been a trend for a long time in Hollywood and since it sells tickets I imagine it will continue for some time to come. That said, I suppose I shouldn't argue with success regardless of how silly the story gets. At any rate, Demi Moore plays ""Navy Lieutenant Jordan O'Neill"" who has applied for SEAL training but has been turned down. She laments that because some of her male counterparts have succeeded that they are being promoted ahead of her. Apparently there are no other tough courses in the entire Navy for her to excel. Fortunately, as luck would have it ""Senator Lillian DeHaven"" (Anne Bancroft) also laments the fact that women aren't given equal opportunities in the Navy and so Lt. Jordan O'Neill suddenly has her big chance. Quite naturally, she not only survives the course (which has many men falling by the wayside due to the physical and mental strain) but she also becomes the leader of her squad due solely to her will to succeed. Not only that, but she is so extraordinary that we see her helping men through the obstacle course along with rejecting all ""gender norms"" as well. Naturally, towards the end of the film she even manages to save her instructor ""Master Chief John James Urgayle"" (Viggo Mortensen) while on assignment in Libya. Again, only in Hollywood. Now, normally I would rate a film as ridiculous as this the worst possible score. But it does have some good action scenes and I like Demi Moore. But even so, unless you really need some laughs, totally enjoy feminist propaganda or are completely naive, I wouldn't bother with this one.",/review/rw0416962/?ref_=tt_urv

4 June 2018,ironhorse_iv,6," While, this movie was somewhat uplifting. 'G.I Jane' just didn't quite get my seal of approval. It was very mediocre.
","When Demi Moore, appeared on the red carpet with a bald head and a muscular built, for the premiere of 1996 'Striptease'. There was a lot of good buzz for her next big film, 1997's 'G.I Jane'. However, once the public got a hold of the film directed by Ridley Scott. The buzz turn into negative press. Without spoiling the well-shot movie, too much, one of the reasons, why this film didn't do so well at the box office, was, because viewers and critics, alike were under the impression that was going to be, a very realistic depiction of what life is like, for a woman to go through Navy SEALS training. However, the film wasn't like that. Actually, the movie was heavily fictional story of a Navy servicewoman, Lt. Jordan O'Neil (Demi Moore) being the first woman to enrolled in the Armed Force's 'the Combined Reconnaissance Team' (CRT) training program; a fictitious special operations until, that brings together operators from across all branches of the military into one group. Because of that, all the marketing for this film, including the trailers were misleading. It's hardly about Navy Seals at all! No wonder, why, this movie was called 'G.I Jane', despite the fact that the acronym is mostly used to describe the soldiers not sailors. 'The CRT' sounds like a team that a toy company like Hasbro would create, rather than the Department of Defense. Despite that outrageous figment artistic license, the movie training story is still not very well told. One such example is the out of the blue force action scene, toward the end of the movie. The idea that a national emergency situation, would require trainee's support, over years upon years, of well-trained, ready to go, Armed Force's special operation personnel is highly illogical. Not only that, but wouldn't it, make more sense, that the team that should support the U.S Army Rangers, in their mission, shouldn't be the trainees, but the Army's own, Delta Force or Green Berets. After all they're all in the same reconnaissance branch. Also, in real-life, any special operation trainee in any branch would probably take up to 2 years of training before, they ever saw combat. Such is the case with the real Navy Seals recruits. For them, they first have to go to Naval Special Warfare Preparatory School for 8 weeks; before advancing into BUD/S (Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL), training for another six months; follow up with another 3 weeks in parachute jump school/ plus 26 week course in SEAL Qualification Training (SQT), before finally, finishing off with SEAL Tactical Training (STT) that, normal workup or pre-deployment workup, including SERE (Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape) is a 12- to 18-month cycle divided into three phases with them going to many different locations. The idea that this film is presenting, with a trainee skipping school programs and leapfrog toward any training site, within a few months, with the same instructors, plus go to war, with them, is not bound in any reality. No wonder, Moore went so far as to call then-President Bill Clinton to try to get advice from the Pentagon for the movie script. It's clear that screenwriters, David Twohy and Danielle Alexandra, had no clue, in what, they were doing. Despite the unrealistic inaccurate depiction of how the United States military operates their training courses, I still have to give Moore, some praise. While, her acting in this movie was alright; Demi really did look the part. Because of that, I highly disagree with critics, with her deserving a Razzie Award for Worst Actress for this film. If anything, Anne Bancroft's performance as Senator Lillian DeHaven was the worst. It was hammy and way too over-the-top for the character she's playing. As for Viggo Mortensen. He does a pretty damn good job of portraying Command Master Chief John James Urgayle. However, the idea that his character would trumped up charges of O'Neil being a lesbian (violating the ""Don't ask, don't tell"" policy), seem a bit, out of character, but once again, that's the writer's fault, not the actor. It's lazy writing. As for the infamous POW scene, where the Master Chief beats her up and threatens her with rape. Surprisingly, those acts are justified. That's is what would happen if she was indeed captured by the enemy. While, there are those, who particular annoyed by this, because instructors are not supposed to physically abuse recruits. Under SERE-C, it's possible that it could happen, however, very unlikely under regular SERE training. Especially if the trainee outrank the Master Chief; such as O'Neil being a Lieutenant. So that was a bit odd. As for her having mistreatment from other recruits. It also could happens, as shown in real-life scandals like 'Tailhook', but it's likewise very rare, due to trust and teamwork being so vital in the military. Still, no one can deny, there is some sexism in the Armed Forces; after all, women weren't allowed to serve in any special operation roles, until January 2016; which is kinda depressing, because, when it comes to utilizing women in those fields; the United States is in the dark ages, compare to countries; which already had a number of female soldiers holding their own, reaching and surpassing the standards of their duties. As of this date of this writing, there has yet to be a natural born female to join the Navy Seals; which is sad, because everybody should had the fighting chance to serve their nation, if they want to. The idea of women having not enough brawn power to be in special operation is really outdate excuse. The majority of missions don't fail, because of the lack of man power. They flop, because the lack of smart strategies and misused of resources. Much like this movie. Regardless, of that, I hope, this movie's positive message would encouraged women to fight. Maybe, one day, there will be a good real-life 'G.I Jane' story to tell than this fictional half-ass version. One can hope.",/review/rw0416962/?ref_=tt_urv
