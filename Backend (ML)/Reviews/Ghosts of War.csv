22 September 2015,abisio,9," Slow but involving murder mystery
",I did not read Dark Places nor Gone Girl (the other Flynn's book) but I can really said that movie is slow but captivating. Theron is as always excellent and modest. Her character does not shine like the female character in Gone Girl; in fact her character is really an accessory to the story that basically happens in flash backs.,/review/rw3291767/?ref_=tt_urv

29 December 2015,dfa120374,6," Decent And Enjoyable Enough
","Dark Places (like a lot of movies, I guess) won't be everyone's cup of tea as it's a pretty slow-paced Thriller that concentrates on a decent cast delivering a good story. If you're more into faster-paced films then you more than likely won't enjoy this.",/review/rw3291767/?ref_=tt_urv

31 May 2015,Coventry,6," Watch the film or read the book, but I don't recommend both
","This is the first time – ever – that I'm able to write in a review that I read the book before I watched the film! I'm an avid movie fanatic and not much of a book reader, but for some reason I read both Gillian Flynn novels (this one as well as ""Gone Girl"") before they were turned into Hollywood movies with an all-star cast. ""Dark Places"" is clearly not as successful as ""Gone Girl"", because the release got pushed back a couple of times and this one isn't likely to ever end up in the IMDb top 250. Now, I always disliked that typical and clichéd statement: ""the book is much better than the film"", but I must admit that there's truth in it Director Gilles Paquet-Brenner's screenplay adaptation is very loyal to Flynn's novel, and thus the basic subject matter is tense and unsettling, but for some inexplicable reason the book is compelling whereas the film is rather tedious ""Dark Places"" tells the story of Libby Day. At the tender age of 7, Libby witnessed how her mother and two sisters were brutally slain in their Kansas farm at night, and she confirmed to the authorities that her 15-year-old brother Ben was the culprit. 28 years later, Libby understandably grew up to become an angry, secluded and insecure woman. Driven by financial issues, Libby accepts the peculiar Lyle's offer to attend a meeting of the Kill Club. This bizarre collective exists of people who're investigating infamous (and unsolved) murder cases, and they are convinced that Ben Day is innocent. Reluctant at first, Libby begins to unravel the mystery of what exactly happened on the awful night that ruined her life. The search confronts her with her imprisoned brother and her estranged father, but also brings new secrets to the surface about her mother Patty and her brother's long lost high- school girlfriend Diondra.

1 August 2015,skitzavolly15,7," Always skeptical about a movie based on a good book - was not disappointed...
","A lot of people compare Dark Places to Gone Girl and say, book-wise, Gone Girl was the better book. I actually liked Dark Places better, so when I found out they were making it into a movie, I was of course skeptical about whether or not it'd be good. I just finished watching it and was happy that my skepticism was for naught - this movie stayed true to the book. Casting was done well and the flow proved that the screenplay writers & director paid attention to the original book.",/review/rw3291767/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2015,eddie_baggins,4," This is no Gone Girl
","Last year David Fincher delivered a pinpoint accurate adaptation of Gillian Flynn's bestselling book Gone Girl, a thriller that was both well designed, well-acted and perfectly constructed in its adapting of Flynn's source writing and was a break out hit the world over. Gone Girl as a film then is everything that Dark Places isn't.",/review/rw3291767/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2015,gridoon2023,7," Good solid whodunit
","It's been a while since I've seen such a good old-fashioned whodunit on the big screen; the genre seems to be somewhat of a forgotten art in modern cinema. Compared to ""Gone Girl"", ""Dark Places"" is less flashy, less psychologically twisted, more down-to-earth, more plot-driven. It kept me wondering who-done-it until the end, and the solution is clever and unpredictable (let's just say there is a thin line between innocence and guilt in this movie). The narrative moves very smoothly and methodically between the present and the past, helped by a solid cast, well-selected in terms of the younger and the older actors who are called upon to play the same character (especially in the case of Chloë Grace Moretz and Andrea Roth). Recommended for fans of the genre. *** out of 4.",/review/rw3291767/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2018,clintstevens,5," Dark Places Is Hard To Swallow
","Dark Places is a quirky movie that pushes the boundaries of believability to the breaking point. The one plus is at least it's not one of Hollywood's usual rehashed remakes or a comic book hero saga, but that's about the extent of it's good points.",/review/rw3291767/?ref_=tt_urv

10 April 2015,Garcwrites,7," Another gripping mystery filled crime drama?
","Dark Places was interesting but not as riveting as I had hoped. I never had a chance to read the book - because the movie came out very early in France - so I watched the film with fresh eyes not knowing what I was in for. Problem solver that I am, I watched the film looking for clues but I fairly quickly had all the right suspects lined up before I even got through a quarter of the movie. I don't know if it's a testament to my ""mad"" deductive skills or a lack of mystery in the story telling. The exact same thing happened to me with Gone Girl - the book - which is why I didn't finish reading it. I guess I was hopping for more of a challenge with Dark Places, something that would have surprised me at the end.",/review/rw3291767/?ref_=tt_urv

31 March 2015,evondorster,8," Dark Places indeed
",What do you expect from a story with a title like that? You do indeed find them in this earnest and thoughtful movie. A fifteen-year-old boy accused of pedophilia and Satan worship who gets his girlfriend pregnant and is then accused of murdering his mother and two sisters by his third sister - how much darker can you get without it seeming too contrived? ,/review/rw3291767/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2015,brchthethird,5," A deeply flawed adaptation with little humor to be found -- 'dark' for darkness' sake
","Airport novels have their place, to be sure, and good movies have been made out of them too. In particular, I can think of THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO and Gillian Flynn's own GONE GIRL. Absent a visual stylist like Fincher, and a script by the novel's author, DARK PLACES flounders with its self-serious tone, which is at complete odds with the inherent ridiculousness of the material. Matters aren't really helped by a narrative structure that sucks most of the mystery and tension out of the proceedings. For all of the luridness that the filmmakers pass off as ingenuity and ""edginess,"" the film is actually kind of dull. The trailer hints at a plot which takes a trip into a world filled with serial murder aficionados and devil worship, but it merely flirts with those ideas, using them as window-dressing for something a little more ordinary. Charlize Theron gives a decent enough performance, perhaps the best out of the cast of wasted character actors, but even she wasn't enough to elevate the material. Its biggest sin is perhaps playing things so straight, to the point where each reveal feels obligatory and unsurprising. Still, the film is put together nicely on a technical level. The visuals are appropriately grimy and ""dark,"" and there are some fleeting moments of documentary-style camera-work which fit the true crime element of the story. I also thought the score was pretty good. When it comes down to it, there was a severe lack of artistry in the storytelling and no sense of humor, making this a rental at best. But to be honest, you're better off sticking with GONE GIRL.",/review/rw3291767/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2018,Leofwine_draca,6," American crime noir
","DARK PLACES is a slow-paced and realistic slice of American crime with a slightly muddled storyline. The narrative is split between two time frames, the present day and the historical past, but the present day plotting is rather weak and limited despite the presence of established stars including Charlize Theron and Nicholas Hoult in the cast. The historical story is much more interesting and involves the build-up to a family massacre which has an eventual reveal that you certainly won't see coming. The film utilises the real-life Satanism scare of the 1990s to good effect and keeps you watching in order to find out the answers, although it's not a movie that you'll come back to once you've found out what really did happen.",/review/rw3291767/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2015,albertojleal1,8," A great indie mystery.
","A great little movie. Slow and intense, it tells a very good story. Compelling as well as intriguing, the movie real characters. Normal human beings that for better or for worse are people dealing with their life in a desperate way of making things better. It is heart braking as well as full of hope even is the latter is harder to find at times. I had a great time watching this movie but I also didn't expect it to be Gone Girl - which is directed by David Fincher. Gilles Paquet-Brenner gives us a good mystery with a secret that doesn't reveal itself until the very end. Great cast, good script but this movie is more challenging than Fincher's. Gave it your absolute attention, and you will be rewarded.",/review/rw3291767/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2015,closerlookfilms,9," VERY underrated suspense thriller!
","I'm going to do this short and sweet: This film starts out like an episode of ""True Detective"" or ""Touching Evil"", and then as it comes down to the final inning, shifts into a beautifully paced and developed revelation, that is truly unexpected and chilling. ",/review/rw3291767/?ref_=tt_urv

26 October 2015,lee_eisenberg,6," repressed memories
","I interpreted ""Dark Places"" as a look at repressed memories. So often people experience traumatic things that they try as hard as possible to forget.

3 October 2019,Calicodreamin,7," Captivating thriller
","I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this thriller. It has a good flow with the parallel storytelling and the slow unravel of past and present events. The final reveal was unexpected, which I always enjoy. I thought the acting was good, especially with Theron. It's not a typical thriller and shows the darker side of being the lone survivor.",/review/rw3291767/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2017,zkonedog,7," Production/Reception Problems Don't Nearly Sink This One (Despite Their Best Efforts)
","A few years ago, Gillian Flynn's novel ""Gone Girl"" was turned into a film that received Academy Award consideration. While I won't go so far as to say that ""Dark Places"" is quite as good as that one, there must have been something going on behind the scenes in the production that really hampered its marketing. It doesn't nearly deserve the terrible reputation it is receiving right now.",/review/rw3291767/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2015,locatordave,7," shine your light on Dark Places
","I didn't care much for Gone Girl -- maybe it was Ben Affleck -- but I was drawn to this movie despite that. Maybe it was Charlize Theron, maybe it was Nicholas Hoult, whom I have enjoyed watching grow into a first rate actor since his days in Skins. In any case, whatever reservations I had at first rapidly dissolved into a distant memory as the first ten minutes passed.",/review/rw3291767/?ref_=tt_urv
