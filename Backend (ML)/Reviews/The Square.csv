23 August 2018,eberkerbatur,8," Comedy mean ADAM SANDLER for me this is old comedy :) :) :) :) :)
","Whenever I want to watch comedy movies, when I feel so sad and need to be laughing is the only name that comes to mind ADAM SANDLER and his team.
I have watched all the movies and there is nothing else that makes me so happy and laughing in this life.",/review/rw3025683/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2017,www_dot_tmcc,8," Screw you guys, I like it!
","What's wrong with the occasional feel- good movie? I think Adam Sandler shines when he's working with kids, and in these troubling times, I appreciate that he seems to be dedicated to making movies that have the general theme of ""just have fun being a decent person."" I respect him so much more now than I ever did during the SNL/Billy Madison/Happy Gilmore days.",/review/rw3025683/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2014,blufrog49,7," Touching Comedy
","I think Adam Sandler is a smart, talented entertainer and I also enjoy Drew Barrymore and the two together is a special treat. I also admire these actors because, for the most part, they never seem to make it into the scandal sheets. Sandler has been in some real ""dogs,"" and I tell myself it was just for the money.",/review/rw3025683/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2022,HelloBlockbuster,10," Feel good meets some comedy
",Okay the comedic relief was 100 percent Terry Crews with Drew Berrymore a close second.,/review/rw3025683/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2014,insanemoviecollector,8," I loved it
","I truly loved this film. It was heart warming, fun and had me laughing several times. Yes, it's totally predictable but that can sometimes be OK. You know what you are going to get, the freaky children and the inevitable romance. I like these two when there together and I like Sandler despite what the critics say. He is someone you can relate to. A great movie to chill out, relax or just something to make you happy. ",/review/rw3025683/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2015,malky-6,7," Brightened up a Miserable Sunday for me.
","When you see Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore in a film, you know what to expect. Both have done many good, heart warming films over the years, so if you know what you are getting, don't go to see it if it's not your stuff, then complain about it! ",/review/rw3025683/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2014,tonyblass,9," Lucky there's a family guy who isn't ashamed of being a GUY
","If you can believe it, we loved it. Don't care what the critics say, obviously. But you know why they hate it. Stubbornly suburban, vaguely sexist, more like sketch comedy lacking a finely crafted story arc, and definitely an unashamedly traditionalist pro-family view of ""boys need dads and girls need moms."" So that's Sandler's POV. You can go to the art house to see witty, urbane and progressive films (and we do) or to the multiplex to see the endless parade of horror, action, YA and/or comic book dumb dumb fare. (and we don't) But I'm still glad there's room in this world for Adam Sandler movies. Because they're funny and human.",/review/rw3025683/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2014,bobbo204,8," Been a while since I've laughed so hard
","Went to this movie a little leery because of the reviews and because I haven't loved all of Adam Sandler's movies. I was very surprised to find that I laughed nearly the whole movie. I thought Adam and Drew Barrymore did a great job together. All of the supporting cast was hilarious, especially Kevin Nealon and his ""wife,"" and Terry Crews, who cracked me up every single scene he was in. Some of the scenes were a bit emotional, and even these scenes teared me up a little bit, thought all the acting was well done. The Africa setting was beautiful and the scenes in the hotel were gorgeous.",/review/rw3025683/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2015,nintendogs03,9," Adam & Drew did it again!
","The Wedding Singer, 50 First Dates, how could you not love them? What makes a movie enjoyable is the chemistry costars have. Adam and Drew got that right! It starts out as a blind date gone wrong (i think many of us have gone through something similar) and somehow, they meet again. Again. This time, their characters brought kids! There were many moments where my family and I laughed for minutes straight and many that make us feel sympathetic for these characters. The point of this movie is to make viewers feel good and it has succeeded. Adam, Drew, and the rest of the cast seemed excited and dedicated to be a part of this movie and their performances show that they could do a kick-butt film.",/review/rw3025683/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2014,Vega7473,9," A touching comedy
","The lower ratings on this film are too harsh. This is actually a sweet comedy where two individuals who initially repel each other grow to like each other. The added touches are the children in this film, who are not only hilarious but also bring out the parental qualities in Drew and Sandler's characters. ",/review/rw3025683/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2014,zhanna1963,10," Great film
","I don't know why this film has had so many poor reviews. Myself and my husband loved it. We've loved all of Adam Sandlers films and this one delivered just as well as the rest. The chemistry between him and Drew Barrymore is as good as 50 First Dates, it was funny, we laughed all the way through, the storyline was fun and held gentle messages to any families in this situation therefore approaching potential sensitive subjects with tact and diplomatic wit.",/review/rw3025683/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2015,Movie-ManDan,6," Sandler's Best Movie In Years.
","It is clear that Adam Sandler has lost his touch. He went from doing hilarious and heartfelt comedies that only he can do, to stupid and meaningless comedies and second grader can do better. Deep within Adam Sandler is a gifted actor that can light up the screen, if given a good script and a good director. Watch his 2007 drama, Reign Over Me. It is his only movie where he does not deliver any ounce of comedy. By the looks of Blended, he is moving back in that serious direction.",/review/rw3025683/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2014,melihcarter,9," Perfect chemistry Berrymore and Sandler is back
","After a couple of very bad recent movies, finally Adam Sandler did what he is doing the best. A family movie with kids, holiday and Drew Berrymore! it is almost impossible for a movie to be disappointing with these two. The jokes were funny, the kids were acting really good, musics were great. I saw the movie with my family and we all enjoyed (as Sandler fans) movie. His a few last attempts were really bad movies but this time he got it right again. And that's why I feel sad about all the bad reviews this movie has. Because some people are hating it just because they didn't like Adam Sandler's last movies, and they are ready to be automatic haters. Well if you like Adam Sandler (at least his 50 first dates, click era) you'll love this movie. I also loved the parts they used from earlier movies",/review/rw3025683/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2014,mrcricken8,7," Surprisingly Good
","Wow,I was expecting to bash this movie,but was I wrong.The movie 'Blended' is actually a good movie.I will not spoil the movie for you,but I will say I am still surprised it was good.When I was sitting watching the movie,and I laughed,I was quite surprised.This is yet another Adam Sandler movie.I have recently hated all of Sandler's new movies.I despised 'Grown Ups',and hated 'Grown Ups 2'.Those movies were terrible.'Jack and Jill',don't get me started on that garbage.Expecting to be angry at this movie,I had very little hopes of this movie being good.I watched it as a final chance for Sandler to redeem himself from his previous disasters.Luckily,I ended up enjoying this movie and kept turning to my friend,looking at him like are we seriously laughing.Overall,a huge comeback for Sandler and meaning this movie is 7.5/10.",/review/rw3025683/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2014,steve-4-401708,7," Better than what the haters would have you believe..
","If you're looking for the Sandler of 15 years ago, or the scoop of septic that the current comedic ""geniuses"" have to offer (Rogen, Attepow, etc.,) then stay home and watch for umpteenth time the ""hilarious"" back and forth between Franco and Seth in This Is Then End.",/review/rw3025683/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2022,tracynurzynski-483-915726,10," Unpopular Opinion: I loved it!
","I know it's not a popular opinion but I love this movie. It's easy, it's funny, it's warm, there is a sweet message in there too. Not sure what all the negativity is about. I even own this one on DVD. Lol! It's one of those movies that's easy to watch again & again. Wedding Singer is still one of my favorite Barrymore/Sandler movies! I think they are great in this too.",/review/rw3025683/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2014,mm-39,5," Blended is blanded.
","A bland movie! My wife and I drove out of town to one of the last drive- ins in our area. The Drive-In gets the B movies. Sandler makes many B movies. Sandler's funny days of Happy Gilmore are far behind him. The last good movie Sandler made was Anger Management. Blended is an example of Sandler's stalled career. The material is dated, and stale. Whatonce was shocking or over the top for Sandler is now redundant material! Embarrassed, overly stupid, and weird situations is all of Sandler's comic delivery. Blended is a cutesy love story with a few laughs. Watchable movie, but noting special. Blended would be the second feature in the Drive Inn after the main feature is shown. If the out of town drive-in had a double feature. Five stars out of ten.",/review/rw3025683/?ref_=tt_urv

",Adam and Drew pop. The Adam Sandler formula is fun and makes us happy. If you like life and being silly. Watch it.,/review/rw3025683/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2014,pthinkii,9," Great comedy/I wanna see it again
","Ignore the critics, this movie is great. Really sweet. Hilarious. Adam Sandler has grown a lot over the years and the critics should give him break.",/review/rw3025683/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2014,cadadmail,8," Drew! Barrymore/Sandler pairing magic
","OK, well I love Drew Barrymore - so maybe 8 is high, but the romance and love was so well done mixing families I rate this at 8. The humor and seeing Mr. Sandler's friends was so perfect for the scenes they were in. Hearing those around me laugh seeing them preform brings a smile to your face. So being Adam Sandler is in this you must know the humor will be low brow - and it is, but not as much as when he was single.",/review/rw3025683/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2022,alysha_edmunds,10," A Good, Funny Adam Sandler Movie
","This film was good, funny in all the right places, touching and sweet. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore together again were great and the nods to previous films were noted. I generally enjoyed this film, one of Adam Sandlers better films which made me laugh out loud numerous times. Recommended for any Sandler Rom/Com fans.",/review/rw3025683/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2014,maclock,," Just not all that funny
","As Blended is generally inoffensive and as it offers some good lessons for younger people, it is an acceptable family film. It is just too bad that it fails at being funny, for being funny is necessary if a film is going to succeed as a comedy. With a script that delivers very few gut busters and some horribly contrived scenarios, I am uncertain what the filmmakers had hoped to deliver with Blended. Watch Blended if you need to pick a film you can watch with your kids and if you are not all that bothered if said film is funny, even if it is billed as a comedy. ",/review/rw3025683/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2018,sfmdovey,8," Really Good
",This is my favourite film with Barrymore and Sandler together. I love the storyline and all the jokes. Terry Crews was an unexpected person to be in this film but his role was hilarious and made the film even better. I highly recommend this film if you like Rom-Com's.,/review/rw3025683/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2020,brookenichole-98054,10," Amazing!
","I love this movie and have seen it plenty of times and every time it's worth it. The chemistry between the kids and the leads are undeniable. The romance has a fantastic buildup and the leads make it all the more worth it. The jokes are hilarious and never get old. The story is heartwarming and gives me an overall happy feeling. The whole idea of the dad having all girls and the mom having all boys played out really well. They ended up building and helping each others families out. The acting is great and Terry Crews is honestly really funny. Overall, it's the best.",/review/rw3025683/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2014,AudioFileZ,4," Landing In Africa...With A Big Thud!
","I guess you could say Adam Sandler's Blended has a heart as opposed to Will Farrell's Anchorman 2 which doesn't? That postulated, for this viewer anyway, Anchorman 2 kept me in constant laughter while Blended hardly manages an occasional snicker. It's good to see Drew Barrymore and Sandler back together as they've had, I think, two previous pairings that, perhaps, had a modicum of chemistry. Here that pairing seems strained, perhaps because of Sandler's character needing to be actually funny since that is what Blended is obviously trying for. The laughs are truly spaced out which is to say way too many fall flat.",/review/rw3025683/?ref_=tt_urv
