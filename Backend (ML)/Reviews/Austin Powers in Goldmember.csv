21 January 2004,johnnysugar,7," A sweet and colorful dark comedy that's still a little hard to swallow
","Much like the candy that bears it's name, ""Jawbreaker"" is a sweet, infectious dark comedy that wants you to enjoy it for a good, long time. Unfortunately, also like the candy, the film is a little hard to swallow, and it doesn't last as long or come on as strong as it's name would lead you to believe.  But even though you know that much candy is bad for you, you still want to have it.",/review/rw0553056/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2004,guyfromjerzee,7," A guilty pleasure
","""Jawbreaker"" has all the predictable, clich√©d elements of past teen comedies, but I can't deny the fact that I enjoyed it. I think part of its appeal is that it's a darker comedy, like ""Heathers""--though this movie certainly isn't in the same league. Everybody in the cast gives fine performances. Rose McGowan's is a little over-the-top, but I think it fit the tone of the movie. The running time is about 85 minutes, so it doesn't go on long. There are plenty of funny moments that keep it entertaining. You can argue that the Karen Carpenter joke was too cruel, but that joke alone didn't ruin the film for me. The ending is certainly a cop-out. There could've been a MUCH better pay-off! But despite the fact that ""Jawbreaker"" is undoubtedly a flawed film, it's energetic and fun. There are much worse teen movies out there.",/review/rw0553056/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2003,Darkest_Rose,8," A Delicious Dark Teen Comedy
","Courtney(Rose Mcgowan),Julie(Rebecca Gayheart),Marcie(Julie Benz) and Liz(Charlotte Ayanna) were the most popular girls at school. But on Liz's 17th birthday, her friends want to surprise her and kidnap her. But that plan goes wrong, when accidently, Liz chokes on the jawbreaker, her friends stuffed in her mouth to keep her from screaming. Everyone is totally shocked, except the cold hearted Courtney, who just doesn't give a crap about anybody but herself. Julie wants to go to the police right away and tell them what happened but Courtney calms her down and tries to cover the crime and make it look like somebody raped Liz. Suddenly, a geeky outcast named Fern Mayo(Judy Greer) who has always admired Liz, finds out what happened to her and is totally devasted. Courtney tells her if she keeps her mouth shut, she will make Fern something she always wanted to be. POPULAR. This was a very entertaining and fun dark comedy. I enjoyed it a lot. Rose Mcgowan is gorgeous and does a great job along with the rest of the cast. I would give Jawbreaker 10/10",/review/rw0553056/?ref_=tt_urv

","When you watch ""Jawbreaker,"" you can't help but sense echoes of ""Heathers,"" ""Clueless"" and ""The Craft.""  So it is a bit of a derivative teen bopper flick.  But it's not a total rip-off and does stand on its own two feet.",/review/rw0553056/?ref_=tt_urv

12 January 2011,StevePulaski,8," A sweet kind of teen comedy
","Jawbreaker is a copy of a copy. It takes plot points from Heathers, Carrie, and uses some originals of it's own to create itself. It's not a bad film. Actually one of the better teen films I have seen recently. It reminds me of a much more recent film I saw a few months back called Mean Girls. Of course that came five years later. This one has all very beautiful, and perky actresses that flood the screen at one time, much like Mean Girls. But Mean Girls was a film that was much more tame and lit the screen up. This one falls under a dark comedy.",/review/rw0553056/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2020,rivertam26,8," A deserved cult classic
","The Rotten Tomatoes score for this is Shockingly low at 11%. I definitely think it's time for a critical revisit because the movie has become such a cult classic. It centers around a group of popular teen girls in high school. The Alpha played by a perfectly poisonous Rose McGowan (Scream). Rebecca Gayheart (Urban Legend) the nice one and Julie Benz (TV's Buffy) as the ditzy follower. They play an unfortunate prank on their girlfriend and she chokes on a large Jawbreaker. They try and cover it up while the Alpha takes it to questionable lengths. It's a darkly humorous teen flick that's now better than ever. Filled with quotable dialogue and one hell of a lead performance from McGowan. It's fun, disturbing and hilarious in all the right ways. Judy Greer (Halloween 2018) stars as Fern a witness they give a makeover, Pam Grier (Jackie Brown) as the feisty detective and Carol Kane (Scrooged) as the kooky principal. Even Marilyn Manson shows up for a cameo.",/review/rw0553056/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie totally rocked!! I thought this movie had great punch-lines, great style, great music, and above all an AWESOME cast. Rose McGowan is great in this movie, along with newcomer Judy Greer. Julie Benz and Rebecca Gayheart also are good in this movie. This movie sort of put a twist on the teen sensation, along with an R rating and TONS of sex appeal. Overall, I give this movie ****1/2 of *****",/review/rw0553056/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2008,moonspinner55,4," Kidnap-comedy with a dark streak; from the ""Heathers"" school of screen writing...
","A group of ultra-hip teenage schoolgirls (from Reagan High!) accidentally kill one of their own in a birthday prank gone awry; they struggle to keep their deed a secret even after a nerdy student discovers the truth. Darkly comic tale, brightly-produced yet full of cynicism, has brief moments that go out on a limb, but is ultimately a rather formulaic ""Heathers"" knock-off. Holds interest nearly half the way, however the wrap-up is right off the assembly-line. It certainly benefits from a good cast, with the central performances by Rose McGowan and Rebecca Gayheart spot-on, however prominently-billed P.J. Soles, William Katt and Marilyn Manson hardly appear at all. *1/2 from ****",/review/rw0553056/?ref_=tt_urv

28 January 2003,khatcher-2,1," This film is just perfect
","for frustrated seventeen-year-olds. If a rose by any other name is just a thorn in your side, then this film is definitely it. Accompanied by a noise-track which is ably detailed on IMDb as the original music, but which most of the time is a tasteless debauch into unmusical masochism, a supposedly 16 year-old Rose and her feline companions embark on a laughable foray into something which is no kind of comedy at all. If any US High School has any female adolescents even remotely resembling these young ladies, evidently something is going wrong with the great empire.",/review/rw0553056/?ref_=tt_urv

","A pack of 'mean girls' play a prank on the school's prom queen. They kidnap her and put a jawbreaker gumball in her mouth to keep her quiet, hence the title. One problem: she chokes on the gumball. Now the girls have a dead body on their hands. The movie slides into familiar territory (The Trouble with Harry, Weekend at Bernie's) as the girls try to figure out how to get rid of the body while avoiding suspicion. Cops and other complicating factors begin showing up at the worst possible moment, etc. etc. The comedic complications are mostly well executed, and the usual pangs of conscience and arguments among the conspirators keep things lively.

28 May 2002,chrisbrown6453,3," When I left the theater after seeing Jawbreaker the first word that came to my mind was ohmygodicantbelieveijustwatchedthat.
","Now, the second word to come to mind was insipid.  I wasn't sure exactly that word meant, but for some reason I thought it fit. So, I came home and looked it up. And now, here is the Webster's New World College Dictionary definition of insipid: ""Insipid - adj. - 1. Without flavor, tasteless. 2. Not exciting or interesting; dull; lifeless. Insipid implies a lack of taste or flavor and is, hence, figuratively applied to anything that is lifeless, dull, etc."" I think I may have found a new favorite word. Insipid describes exactly how I felt about this good for nothing movie. Rose McGowan, Julie Benz, and Rebecca Gayheart play three popular girls in high school. As a birthday prank, they kidnap their other best friend so they can humiliate her in front of the whole school. In doing so, they stuff a very large jawbreaker in her mouth to keep her quiet. She accidently swallows it and dies. When a quiet non-popular girl (Judy Evans Greer) finds out, the popular girls tell her that to buy her silence, they will make her popular. Well one thing leads to another, blah blah blah good triumphs over evil and everyone has a la-di-dah time. Now let me ask you something. I may have gone to a normal high school, but I certainly don't remember hearing about friends kidnapping other friends, gagging them, stuffing them into trunks of cars, and then wanting to humiliate them in front of the school. It just doesn't seem like something friends do to each other for a birthday. Maybe get them drunk. Maybe take them out to dinner. Maybe rent a stripper. But kidnapping isn't something I normally think of. So the premise of the movie was stupid. And then the rest of the movie fell into place. Honestly the only good thing about this movie was seeing what next tight, revealing clothing the girls were going to wear next. The script was horrible, which meant that the actors sounded extremely stupid when having to speak those words. The direction was bad, the music was ok, but only when Rock You Like a Hurricane came on. Oh yeah, and I did like seeing Marilyn Manson dressed up as a regular guy (albeit a strange looking one). So pass on this piece of crap. I'd rather spend an hour and a half sucking on a real jawbreaker and staring at the wall than sit through this again.",/review/rw0553056/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2007,Special-K88,," a stupid idea somehow turned into a full-length movie
","Annoying, unfunny, ill-conceived Heathers wannabe about three autocratic high school vixens who rule their school, that is until an accidental murder threatens to tarnish their reputation. In order to conceal the crime, they're forced to adopt the school's biggest nerd as a member of their crew, but the plan backfires in more ways than one. Considering the film's ridiculous setup you have to wonder if anyone actually read the script before they broke ground on this dreary nonsense. Another case of a pointless, unnecessary, and desperately padded film trying to squeeze as much as it can out of the appeal and antics of a talented cast, but here it ceases to matter. A waste of time and not even worth the effort. *",/review/rw0553056/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 1999,pooch-8,," Brainless, dull teensploitation
","Halfway through Jawbreaker, there is a scene where Julie (Rebecca Gayheart) recounts to her new love interest the horrible chain of events that led to the accidental death of her best friend.  As Julie haltingly and painfully confesses her sins, we see a series of shots virtually identical to the expositional set-up that opened the film.  This made me angry because filmmakers should know better than to repeat information already known by the audience -- but this is the least of my complaints surrounding Jawbreaker.  The one-dimensional characters, the simpleminded connect-the-dots script, the annoying wall-to-wall music, and the unintentionally hilarious comeuppance of evil Courtney (Rose McGowan) at the prom all succeeded in producing a splitting headache.  What little joy I took away from my experience was provided by Marilyn Manson in an effective and all-too-short cameo, and The Donnas, who gamely rocked through a few numbers as the band playing the Reagan High School prom.",/review/rw0553056/?ref_=tt_urv
