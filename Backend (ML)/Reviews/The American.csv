31 October 2022,raj-bhullar,8," Binged it pretty fast
","Couldn't stop watching this show. It's very interesting. At first when I saw the title I thought it will be not be that good. I thought I will not like it. But I ended up loving this show. Storytelling is good and done at a good pace. In many shows you can skip some useless scenes and they are boring to watch but this show doesn't have that. Every scene is meaningful and moves the plot forward. I never got bored of it. And when every episode ended I really wanted to watch the next episode right away. Also the show keeps getting better as it goes. If you like fantasy, magic and witches and stuff then this is a must watch. This is one the best shows on Netflix right now.",/review/rw8646869/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2022,Hellooo1234321,," 8/10 I am a big fan of adventure and fantasy but not everything is good, this however one tops it all.
","This series has a good storyline, good acting, and good special effects and once you start you get dragged into the story. It's binge-watch-worthy, although I recommend not watching it in one sit, because it gets heavy sometimes. It's a 16+ series because it gets violent and very cruel. I give this series an 8,5 out of 10. It is that good, if you like fantasy, action and a good storyline this is your cup of tea. Hope season 2 is made soon. It's also price worthy of special effects for example. Netflix doesn't have good series about witches until The Bastard son and the devil himself. Thank god they finally made a good series about witches and magic because every other series with magic was meh on Netflix. Do watch The Bastard Son and the Devil himself on Netflix I recommend it 100%.",/review/rw8646869/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2022,Couchkik20,7," Better than your average Hogwarts copycat
","This show is very gripping, a fun combination of many things we love but I don't blame it.",/review/rw8646869/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2022,amina-52236,10," DONT UNDERESTIMATE THIS...
","This was so good. Netflix doesn't like spending money on promo for projects they don't think will do well, so I didn't know this show existed until it came up in my recommended randomly. Don't write it off by first appearance. Keep in mind that most of Netflix's best shows and movies are the ones that Netflix don't care about to begin with. Y'all, it's reallyyyy good. Like, it actually blew my expectations out of the freaking water. Best thing about the show? The complex characters, of course. The found family aspect was so heartwarming as well. The story is interesting and nuanced. I don't remember the last time Netflix did something that impressed me quite like this did. Don't let it get cancelled without giving it a chance.",/review/rw8646869/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2022,WordsworthStone,9," Where are the moderators?
","I thought this show was another average Netflix show. I wouldn't be surprised if they cancelled it next week just because of average view counts. That's why Netflix, a tech service company, is losing media subscribers by the thousands--all the real media giants make ""Netflix is a Joke.""",/review/rw8646869/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2022,RedKidBytes,8," Nathan Son of a Witch!
","Created by the writer Joe Barton who also wrote the Lazarus Project, comes an 8-part series of the fantasy drama. Sunsational CGI effects, immersive backgrounds, and artistic cinematics make watching more enjoyable.",/review/rw8646869/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2022,TheAffableFool,8," Awesome and binge worthy!
","I noticed there is quite a lot of Netflix series that get very cringe-wokey so I always approach with caution. This isn't that, this turned out to be an awesome binge watch. I haven't read the books so after I finished the season I did have a little wiki read and I know they changed things around. Doesn't annoy me because I haven't read the trilogy. So from a perspective of someone who never heard of this series I loved it. Very brutal and the British vibe gives it that gritty edge that American productions always lack.. All that aside I did think the characters were well developed for a fantasy series of this type. Once I watched the first episode I couldn't stop. Can't wait for the second series!",/review/rw8646869/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2022,dnacowboys,8," Cutting edge supernatural drama
","There's not a lot I can add to the other positive reviews in regards to this exceptional series, just to reiterate how frustrating and annoying it would be for Netflix to cancel the show. This wonderful adaptation has taken considerable thought, skilfully combining the very well written and developed characterisation along with the actors performances mixes up a magical formula viewers will just love. Also, the plot arcs have real ' legs', in that I can't see peoples attention spans drifting nor the quality petering out any time soon. Take the above elements, add a huge pinch of triple-A special effects and the magicians (including the incredible Andy Serkis) at The Imaginarium (production company) have conjured up something truly special.",/review/rw8646869/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2022,on_the_river_flowing,8," Exceptional characters, good banter, natural-feeling LGBTQ story component - finally a good Netflix show - just beware the gore if you are sensitive to that
","First - this would not normally be my kind of show. I am not into gory stuff. However, the queer component of the overall story was what drew me to watch this series. If you struggle with the gore, but want to watch, I recommend a couple things - first, usually, you can tell it's coming, and I either look away or shield my screen and adjust the sound. Second, take it in steps. Although I did watch the whole set of episodes in one go. Oops. Either way, the violence can get a bit intense and, given one of the characters, downright cruel at times. So just be warned. For comparison, it is not gratuitous gore à la Suicide Squad, it does go with the story.",/review/rw8646869/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2022,star_hazard,9," Dark coming of age LGBT fantasy with a lot of gore and some romance
","I never read the books this was based on so I can't say if it's accurate but anyway the show itself is great overall for me. For a YA it's not in the level of angst as others? Sure they make some questionable decisions which still fits since they're teenagers but at the same time it's also not as ""annoyingly selfish"" as the usual YA shows we get? Maybe frustrating but it's understandable choices. It's also different from usual YA because the main characters aren't those overpowered protagonists that can do no wrong even as they ruin other people's lives with their choices.",/review/rw8646869/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2022,mhtannous,10," Not deserving of low reviews

","I love it and live it great tv show , you will not regret it, my only wish for this show to not be canceled, have to be second season please..
All characters great actors, I loved how they present the witch's powers , I'm looking forward for next season., I can tell that this show cost alot to come like this , high quality filming this show.",/review/rw8646869/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2022,eduargr,7," entertaining
","It is nothing to write home about, there is nothing that differentiates it from any other series of its kind nor does it have anything special, but nevertheless it holds up, maybe it is not original at all but the good thing about it is that even if it is a story already counted thousands of times you get an entertain.",/review/rw8646869/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2022,Tweekums,8," A solid supernatural YA drama
","This series is set in a world where witches are real. There are two main groups; the dominant Fairborn Witches and their bitter rivals the Blood Witches. Our protagonist is Nathan Byrne, the sixteen year old illegitimate son of Marcus Edge, a notorious Blood Witch who killed many of the most senior Fairborn. Normally Nathan would have been killed as soon as he was born but a prophecy suggests he may be the one to kill his father. As he approaches his seventeenth birthday, the time young witches get their power, he is taken from his home for intensive training. Events lead to him going on the run with Annalise O'Brien, the daughter of the leader of the Fairborn, who has recently acquired a shocking power. Their flight will lead to them heading across the channel to France, where they seek the one person who might be able to help. All the time the Fairborn are in pursuit.",/review/rw8646869/?ref_=tt_urv

1 November 2022,lucindacurcio,9," Go get that heart, Nathan!
","Great acting, original storyline, awesome special effects, the sociopath sister needed to die slowly and painfully, but I guess they needed her as a villain for next season, which I am dying for Netflix to greenlight, as soon as possible!",/review/rw8646869/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2022,isaacmizrahii,8," first off...not for the squeamish...
","I saw a few reviews here complaining about...how to say...the gore? So if that's not for you, don't watch. It DOES get explicitly gorey in parts...the GOOD news is that it doesn't seem at ALL gratuitous...fits right into the storylines...
the only criticism i have of the first season is that parts of it were a bit too predictable for me...i'm pretty good at seeing things before they happen but these things of which i speak, though not specifically( ; - ) ), i'm pretty sure LOTS of people guessed would turn out that way...
i binged it, pretty much...two nights...that counts as a binge, right? I found it, overall, pretty enjoyable... good storyline...not a whole lot of repetition like a lot of series i've seen...'they're captured...they're free...they're captured...they're free'. And that most of the suspense in those series...nope. Not this one. The storyline continues to expand throughout...looking forward to a second season.",/review/rw8646869/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2022,misaacs-34122,10," Absolutely love this!!!
","I literally just binged watched all eight episodes starting from 9 AM this morning. It is now 3:30 in the afternoon. And to say that I loved this show is an understatement, I honestly cannot wait for a second season. And a third season. And a fourth season. End of fifth season. If they do not come out with a second season and possibly more after this first season, I will be highly disappointed and upset and lose faith and Netflix all together. As a fan of the sci-fi and paranormal genre, films and shows and books this is by far one of my new favorite shows in 2022, and I for one am anticipating another season to follow.",/review/rw8646869/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2022,goshin34,5," Up and down
","A halfway decent opening, then some lame predictable BS, a better late-middle, but then the end just went full on stupid. Bad decisions, irrational behavior. Stormtrooper School of Marksmanship. Talking when you should be killing. Putting something REALLY important off (stupidly) and then, oh so predictably, the McGuffin is lost. Killing a bunch of NPCs but then suddenly we have qualms about killing one of the big bads. Making up or changing the Rules of Magic as you go. Inserting a gay affair that didn't fit the character or situation and seemed gratuitous. By the last episode I barely cared about any of the characters and mostly wanted to see them all come to a bad end, which isn't a good way to end the show. It could have been a lot better but the ending was so lame.",/review/rw8646869/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2022,AeonsLegend,6," Starts strong, but falls flat to young adult series pitfalls
","The Bastard Son & The Devil Himself is a young adult TV series based on the Bad Half book trilogy by Sally Green. The premise is there's a world of Witches we don't know about and a half blood boy that is stuck between two warring factions. We follow Nathan in the first few episodes as he goes to school, gets bullied and learns about his ""blood"". The story quickens the pace when he and some others become hunted and need to find a secretive Witch to help them.",/review/rw8646869/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2022,catarinakulborg,10," Do NOT make the mistake of stopping too soon.
","I'll admit the first episode had me rolling my eyes a few times, as I got the impression it was just another typical teenage fantasy drama, but honestly guys. Just... please keep watching. It gets so good. I can almost guarantee that there are twists and shifts in this series that you would never see coming if you only watch the first few episodes. (Unless you've read the book, I guess?) Plus, the effects are STUNNING, and the soundtrack gave me chills.",/review/rw8646869/?ref_=tt_urv

31 October 2022,bertrandma,5," Quality YA Action-Fantastic
","As Young Adult go this is actually pretty decent: the inevitable teen romance and coming-of-age-clichés are considerably spiced-up with a heavy dose of brutality, some irredeemable villains, and a healthy serving of gore (on this point, the VFX for Annalise's magic alone are worth a watch).",/review/rw8646869/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2022,karynislay,10," BOUT FREAKING TIME!
","Ahhh, do you smell it? A Breath of Fresh Air in the Supernatural genre. A new wave of different lingo, traditions and a Black Lead!!!! Yes I said it and it feels good. I'm hoping Netflix keeps this show it's not tons of magic appearances but just the right amount to make it feel real. Characters are well developed and not written like what we're used to but similar with a non familiar twist. You know who you're rooting for out the gate but the villain is not as clear as you'd think. Wait till some Big Bucks get thrown at this it'll be two times any other show if it's kind. This show has all the potential to go anywhere.",/review/rw8646869/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2022,strizbiz-99429,4," A couple episodes in and so far it's slow and kinda meh
","Ok, so I'm almost two episodes in and it feels like I'm four episodes in, In other words each one hour episode feels like they're two hours long, and not in a good way. The main character, Nathan, is supposed to be the son of a real bad guy who apparently kills witches with no real powers....except that they do? And they are tasked with hunting him and his kind, the blood witches down and killing them, the only problem is that none of them are like able at all and you really don't end up caring that the blood witches are killing them. They just don't come off as the good guys, and his sister is the worst of them all. She's just a horrible person. Tbh I'm doubting I'll make it thru the whole series, it's just not that interesting , if anything I'll just skip to the last episode. It's just kinda slow and meh.",/review/rw8646869/?ref_=tt_urv
