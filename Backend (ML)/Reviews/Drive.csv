28 February 2017,gradyharp,10," 'The bullet's already been fired'
","Ben Johnson's novel has been exceptionally well adapted for the screen by Jean- Christophe Castelli and directed with the expected sensitivity of Ang Lee. It is a kick in the gut for those who see it – an anti-war statement placed in front of us as the never- ending wars in the Middle East continue to fester and destroy lives on all sides of the war zone and beyond. But it is also a biting statement about the time in which we live, a time when entertainment and gross spending of money is directed toward the insatiable appetite for big shows and stars and shallow moments of pleasure that appear to obsess us. The manner in which returning soldiers face 'instant glory' is overshadowed by the inherent bully-ism by a public that does not understand the cancer of war and how it metastasizes throughout our troubled planet.",/review/rw3687163/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2016,phd_travel,10," Effective and insightful anti war movie
",This is a very effective anti war movie. And it achieves a lot with a pretty low body count. It looks at a young soldier who after performing a heroic action caught on camera is involved in a promotional tour. It's subtle but completely clear in it's message.,/review/rw3687163/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2017,ssunzhong,9," Not Actually A War Movie
","This will be short and to the point. Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk is not a ""war movie"". It is not a propaganda picture about American Imperialism, it is not a recruitment poster, and it is most certainly not an action movie. War, in all its complexity, is incidental to this film. Billy Lynn just happens to be a soldier and the events that kick off the film happened at war. ",/review/rw3687163/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2021,MOscarbradley,8," Surprisingly moving depiction of ordinary people caught up in extraordinary events.
","The subject of Ang Lee's ""Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk"" isn't the war in Iraq but in how America reacts to its heroes and its soldiers and it's a theme that can be traced back through two World Wars. Indeed for almost as long as movies have existed the cinema has concerned itself with the relationship between the military and the world at large, how it performs and how it is perceived. The most famous example of this is probably the raising of the flag at Iwo Jima and the subsequent 'tour' back home immortalised in such films as ""The Outsider"" with Tony Curtis as Ira Hayes and Clint Eastwood's ""Flags of Our Fathers"" and Oliver Stone's Vietnam film ""Born on the Fourth of July"" so it was only a matter of time before someone would do something similiar with one of the current wars.",/review/rw3687163/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2016,wanglivalley,10," This movie is far more than anti-war.
","Many people said it is an anti-war movie,I don't think so. This movie is far more than anti-war.Because it is not a rich story ,but a rich truth and an emotion. It doesn't want to give you an opinion about what war is, but show you an emotion about a young man and a war. A so-called hero came back from Iraq, how is his life?",/review/rw3687163/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2017,Horst_In_Translation,6," Another solid addition to the career of everybody involved here
","""Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk"" is a co-production between America, Britain and China and the latter is probably because the director here is 2-time Academy Award winner Ang Lee. This is the man's newest work. No need to elaborate further on him as most people certainly now ""Brokeback Mountain"", ""Life of Pi"" or some of his other works. With this film here that runs for slightly under 2 hours, he gives us his take on war-themed movies as the Iraq War is a huge topic in here. But still I must say, it was a good watch for me, even if sometimes war films do not have the greatest impact on me. The reason may be that there are other maybe more important plots in here that made it pretty interesting for me, for example the protagonist's background back home. For lead actor Joe Alwyn this was the very first career performance for him and we will see what he can make of it in the long run. Playing the title character in an Ang Lee movie is a really big thing though. And for screenplay writer Jean-Christophe Castelli, who adapted the Ben Fountain novel here, it was also the first effort as a writer. For that it was pretty solid, but of course he worked with Lee on many other occasions too.",/review/rw3687163/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2017,spencergrande6,7," This is a good movie
","This is a good movie. All the discussion about it surrounds the technology used in making it, and that's necessary, but it's not the whole story -- nor is it NOT the story as others would have you believe. The simple fact is that this is a well-acted and at times completely engrossing anti-war picture, one that is more often than not, yes, let down by some of the failings of trying to show off the tech. Some scenes come across as incredibly ""stage-y"" for lack of a better word, and the lighting can be overlit fluorescent too often (like a docudrama).",/review/rw3687163/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2017,Screen_Blitz,5," Ang Lee wrings some thought-provoking ideas and visual compulsion, but they are not enough to compete with its lack of emotional touch
","The politics of war are incredibly complex, and the human cost is disturbingly high. There are no wonder why those who give up their lives to fight oversea are honored with great dignity. But the big question in this war drama directed by Oscar Winner Ang Lee is: Are we honoring these soldiers the right way? That is an idea that this film takes a dive in, but not with enough impact. Lee's approach to the absorbing topic is too shallow of emotional touch. The greatest accolade Lee acquires in this picture is allowing it to shine with a unique visual innovation, and that is shooting the film with an unheard-of frame rate of 120 FPS to capture the immense atmosphere of the war sequences. It is a technological achievement that powerfully shows how far Hollywood has advanced in technological. Seeing this movie at a theater with an unusual frame rate that high is an alarmingly tough get as there are only six theaters around the globe that include this, with only two of these theaters planted in the United States. Set in 2004, this follows 19-year old Billy Lynn (played by Joe Alwyn), an Army specialist returning home from active duty in Iraq with his fellow squad members. On the day of a Thanksgiving home game at the Dallas Cowboys stadium, Billy, honored as a hero for his duty, and his squad members are brought together on a victory tour during the halftime show. During the tour, Billy is hit with flashbacks of the tragedies that occurred during the battle in Iraq including the death of his friend Staff Sergeant Shroom (played by Vin Diesel) as opposed to the American citizens fantasized perceptions of what they think happened over there. Along the way, he finds his heroism manipulated by film producers Norm (played by Steve Martin) and Albert (played by Chris Tucker) who are trying to land a movie deal out of the events that squadron's faced.",/review/rw3687163/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2017,destinylives52,9," Quiet But Powerful
","Director Ang Lee has a knack for packing a serious, emotional punch in even the most quiet moments of a movie; and he does that again with ""Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk,"" a mostly quiet movie that contemplates the craziness of war: started by the rich; fought by the poor and young; the physical and emotional damage it does to the soldiers and their families; the lies that are told to keep the war effort going; the lip service that most civilians give to the soldiers as life goes on as if there is no war happening, etc.",/review/rw3687163/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2020,boblipton,10," Shlepping To The Theater
","Because it was filmed and projected (in Manhattan, at least, at the AMC Loew's on 68th Street) at 120 frames per second, this was an interested movie from a technical standpoint, even before I saw it. One of the last posts to that thread noted that SLATE didn't like the movie. Because I like Ang Lee's movies, don't worship SLATE and wanted to see if the 120 fps makes any noticeable difference, I saw it anyway.",/review/rw3687163/?ref_=tt_urv

","Greetings again from the darkness. ""Thank you for your service."" For those of us who have never served in the military, we say the words because we don't know how else to show our appreciation. Do the words ring hollow to those in uniform? Maybe. Probably. But how else can we honor these brave souls? What if we have them share a stage with a pop singing group during halftime of a football game? It's this line between honor and propaganda that takes up much of the new movie from two-time Oscar winning director Ang Lee (Life of Pi, Brokeback Mountain).",/review/rw3687163/?ref_=tt_urv

19 February 2017,cruise01,4," Tries to be stunning with the visual aspect but very disappointing.
","Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk is a war drama that could have been so much more as a movie. It tries to be an emotional moving picture about a young army specialist Billy (Joe Alwyn) after a battle in Iraq that left him emotionally scarred from losing one of his own and from taking a life. Being home, he is conflicted with the images of war that is preventing him on trying to live a normal life. His sister Kathryn (Kristen Stewart) is trying to convince him to stay or see a doctor that can diagnose him for the trauma. While, his Sgt Dime (Garrett Hedlund) is trying to get them prepped to going back to Iraq after their thanksgiving football tour with a halftime walk during the Destiny Child's concert.

20 November 2016,trublu215,4," Despite Ang Lee's greatest efforts, this film just can't rise above being more than a gimmick.
","Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk gives us the workings of cinema master Ang Lee in this boisterous, ballsy film that wishes it was better than what it is. The film tells the story of a hero solider who returns home to be on display at a Super Bowl Halftime show, as he is about to make his long walk, he is plagued with bouts of PTSD that force him to recount exactly what happened to him. The film's concept is great, there's no denying that. This could have easily been a straight forward drama without all the technicalities that Ang Lee put into it. Yes, 120fps makes it VERY easy to look at but outside of that, the substance to make have some sustainability is just not there.",/review/rw3687163/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2016,bigmystery23,7," Technically ambitious and breathtaking, but lacking in substance
","The moment the audience saw the first shot of Billy Lynn reaching for his phone, the audience gasped. Ang Lee's ambitious choice of filming at a frame rate of 120fps in a 4K and 3D format is beyond words. We become immersed into Billy Lynn's world, seeing the little details that we normally would not see in a film (imagine what Emmanuel Lubezki did in 'The Revenant' and times it by 5). The person I went with to see the film described it best, it was a very sensual experience not just from the cinematography, but also the interesting soundscape and phenomenal editing. There are small moments when what would be a mundane action becomes a trigger for Billy Lynn and his squad. Lee does not hold back in making the audience feel the PTSD of those soldiers which at times is beautiful done as well as a bit too much for those of us who have never experienced it. Now I could go on about how brilliant the film is technically and it's sure to get some Oscar recognition in that aspect, but all films revolve around a story.",/review/rw3687163/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2016,austin0731,5," not quite
","In terms of visuals Billy Lynn's was very impressive, however I would ask, is this the right genre of film to showcase such technical cinematography? Obviously such stunning shots could only be a plus to the film but for a film that is really more about one's internal struggles rather than exterior conflicts I do find it quite an odd decision to make this film in such a way. I did go in expecting an all out war movie since I have heard of all of these things that Ang Lee is doing in this film, in terms of visuals. Which did leave be surprised but also disappointed at how few those scenes are. Essentially this film takes place within a time span of one day and all takes place at this football game?

10 November 2016,patil_umesh,8," stunning portrayal of post-war time
","This is yet another tremendous work by Ang Lee. Movie showcases post- victory celebration of war heroes, opinions and responses of people in the nation, inability of people to perceive their sacrifice of personal life and struggle between life and death. The psychological state of nineteen year old young war hero is sketched very effectively. Innocence, teenage infatuation, parting, and vanity of war are well communicated through dialogues and expressions. Director has nicely showcased high end display technology used in current day's sports and media. Script juggles between war scenes and post war recognition as gone through sensitive minds of young soldier. Movie has acknowledged rule of detachment from Hindu epic philosophy of Bhagavad-Gita. Also I am glad to see Lord Ganesha worshiped by a crew member.",/review/rw3687163/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2016,dave-mcclain,1," This is the most clichéd, unrealistic and offensive war film I have seen in many years.
","War movies are often based on a true story. Not so with ""Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk"" (R, 1:50). Although there have been countless untold acts of heroism by American soldiers on the field of battle throughout history, this film isn't based on any of them. That, of course, would be perfectly fine – IF the scenarios on which its story were built bore any relationship to reality. This movie, based on the 2012 novel of the same name by Ben Fountain, is sometimes described as satire. If that were accurate, it would explain some of the story's many inaccuracies. However, satire is supposed to be funny and/or provide some meaningful social commentary, neither of which are true here. Nope. Instead what two-time Oscar-winning director Ang Lee (!) and his screenwriter, Jean-Christophe Castelli give us is the most clichéd, unrealistic, uninspiring, pointless and offensive war film since the later ""Rambo"" movies.",/review/rw3687163/?ref_=tt_urv
