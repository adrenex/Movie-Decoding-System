2 June 2022,zeki-4,6," Creepy and tense, but frustrating.
","This somehow reminded me of the much praised movie 'Get Out' from 2017. You know that some things are off, and that there will be a big reveal coming, after building up characters, atmosphere and plot.",/review/rw8728603/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2022,brandonlewissmu,8," I really like it..but I wouldn't recommend it.
","This is a tricky one. On the one hand, the red flags create an intense feeling of dread. On the other hand, it never should of gotten to that point. The couple was flat-out idiotic. Plain and simple. Reading the reviews, a lot of people disliked the movie because of this. Understandable. It's maddening to see 2 people behave so passively and seal their own fates. I, however, think this was done for that exact reason. I think the director wanted us to feel the this way.",/review/rw8728603/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2022,rehams,7," A damning indictment of danish middle class culture wrapped in unnverving horror
","Speak No Evil is an unnerving and unpleasant experience, particularly if you're middle class danish person like me.",/review/rw8728603/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2022,Arcadia1701,5," Creepy but too many holes to really enjoy
","The problem is, when you need a movie like this to last 90 mins you keep needing a reason for the people to stay in the situation after it becomes untenable. Loved the pacing at the start; that really fed into the reason they were even there at the other couples house but by about halfway through it had lost that tension - instead replacing it with frustration. The couple 'escapes' but goes back for the stuffed toy. I mean seriously? Even if you didnt think there were murderers at that exact moment you had still snuck out and been super rude - no way youd go back. Its the equivalent of running up a flight of stairs instead of out the door in a slasher movie. The ending had a good twist but the killers just wanted to stone them to death? Seems unlikley that woudl be their end game after all that effort (shrug). And they leave them there to die and dont seem to worry about being caught? The couple told their friends where they were going, they had the postcard back at their house for police to find, they had their exact address in their google maps... not nearly as smart as the movie tried to make out ie that they had done this dozens of times.... Good acting and overall well filmed but probably fell under the weight of the required run time requirement.",/review/rw8728603/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2022,FIoret,8," The Danish version of ""Get Out"", without the satisfying end.
","The real horror is having these two as parents. I'll assume this sort of compliancy and over niceness is the norm in Danish culture? I'm a black woman living in Midwestern U. S., and you speak to my child with any disregard and I'm stomping you periodt.",/review/rw8728603/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2022,kskmah,3," Ok movie until the last part
","Acting is fine, but the ending ruined the movie. They are going to hurt and kidnap your child right in front of you and you don't fight back? What kind of parents are these? I would kill or at least fight anyone who would try this to my child. Not only that, the bad man had no weapons and the bad woman only had scissors, not a real weapon. Real parents would die for their children which this movie doesn't realize. Not only that was stupid, you could of kidnapped the kid and cut off her tongue without the parents right there. And then the bad people take you to a remote place, tell you take off all your clothes off and go in a pit. You know you are going to die but once again, they stupid parents don't run or fight back? The bad people again had no weapons. The bad guys started to throw rocks at the parents and kill them that way? I guess you can't run away or fight pretty much normal looking people? A very bad joke of an ending.",/review/rw8728603/?ref_=tt_urv

20 September 2022,Draysan-Jennings,4," Stupid people making stupid decisions
","Here's an idea! How about not driving your family to the middle of nowhere so you can stay with strangers you hardly know. I can't understand why so many people are praising this film, It's definitely overrated. It's basically just a movie about stupid people making stupid decisions over and over again. Especially the ending. It probably would of been a good idea to let your wife know you just found a dead kid laying face down in a jacuzzi. And what was up with the parents not making a run for it? These people didn't have guns. They were literally armed with rocks. They could of easily gotten away. I didn't get it. 5 stars.",/review/rw8728603/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2022,andrewchristianjr,8," I NEVER, EVER WANT TO SEE IT AGAIN.
","The film is so twisted and horrifying in every moral way possible. Very interesting, but that ending made me wanna puke. The moral standpoint and anger I had toward the ending. How do you not do anything in that situation and are somehow a father? The final 15 minutes are horrifically unforgettable, featuring a moment of extreme violence that dares viewers to look away. It is so unsettling, in fact, that the very idea of rewatching the film is outrageous. Speak No Evil is riveting and upsetting in equal measure. And I never, ever want to see it again.",/review/rw8728603/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2022,jtindahouse,10," Achieves what every horror film should be setting out to do
","This. This is what horror is about. I felt absolutely dreadful, shocked and uncomfortable by the end of this film, and that is why I have to give this the highest rating. It achieved what every horror movie should set out to do.",/review/rw8728603/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2022,TipToeThroughHell,8," Hell Is Other People
",Sometimes the true horror lies in the awkward sneaky uncomfortableness that slowly ratchets into the nearly unbearable. The place where passive-aggressive steadily becomes aggressive. A slow burn becomes pure hell. Funny Games meets Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf.,/review/rw8728603/?ref_=tt_urv

17 September 2022,zack_gideon,3," Nope.
",As any writer knows bad character decisions (except a slasher) ruin a movie. This film is just one bad character decision after another. The build up is just frustrating and lame.,/review/rw8728603/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2022,forthatusage,2," Depressingly silly
","Good storyline, good story pace, but could have been way better if the characters arent so weak, and so foolish making illogical decisions just to keep the story going..",/review/rw8728603/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2022,jaypegee,8," In the face of barbarism, civilisation is no match.
","We take pride and value ourselves by a series of codes of conducts, written and unwritten laws showing how evolved we are. But how do those stand to the barbarians who don't care about the rules? Are principles of respect and civility incompatible after a certain point with self-preservation? How much does being reasonable, educated and ultimately privileged or sheltered drives people to be compliant, fearful and vulnerable in the face of danger?",/review/rw8728603/?ref_=tt_urv

24 June 2022,andmikkelsen,8," An uncomefortable experience!
","I was left shocked when the movie ended! My hands where all sweaty end i felt uneasy! The movie is a slow burn, that does a good job of creating tension that slowly increases before the climax, which is very hard to watch! You know something is wrong and something bad is gonna happen, but you are still not prepared...The movie has a very provocative nature as it mocks the Danish culture and whay of living.",/review/rw8728603/?ref_=tt_urv

16 September 2022,Xstal,8," Made in Emmental ...
","As full of holes as the holiest cheese, but let the curds settle and consider the breeze, would you really behave like the family of yes, so polite and so awkward, to avoid all the stress, accepting those things you're conditioned to take, politely embarrassed through uncomfortable state, influenced by a perpetual rhyme, that dangles your puppet, until the end of your line.",/review/rw8728603/?ref_=tt_urv

11 December 2022,treishsase,6," 1st half loved it; 2nd one hated it
","The film has a great start. The WTF moments start to appear here and there and you get on that ""what the hell is going to happen"" ride and you enjoy it as a viewer and you think you are in for a treat. The first part of the film has plenty of these to drag you in, leave your room and be there with them and feel those subtle signs that something is very wrong and then I hated it, worst victims ever.",/review/rw8728603/?ref_=tt_urv
