30 September 2022,tenealesharman,5," Loved the books
","Just finished episode 6 and I'll keep watching it til the end. I just honestly can't get over rose and her mums accent; why add an Aussie and kiwi accent? It's so distracting. Rose has been miscast, her Turkish roots play a role in the story. And I'm sorry but she's quite a weak actress. I feel like I'm casting they've gone down a run sheet and ticked a whole heap of boxes. The thing is, this story and the nationality of key characters are part of the story
Unfortunately the costumes are worse then the casting....like where do you even start. A complete disaster
Don't compare it to the books and it's ok.",/review/rw8573666/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2022,stehartley,7," this dosn't suck (no pun intended)
",If you use the books as a guide rather than a script you get a pretty decent vampire show. Ignore all the 10/10s and 1/10s and read the inbetween reviews and you will get a more honest feel of how good or bad the show is. I for one quite enjoyed it. It wasnt quite as good as the movie but it came pretty darn close. Script is pretty solid and decent performances from most of the characters. Special effects are on point. Given the state of streaming platforms and how fast they seem to cancel shows whether good or bad. I could see this show running for 3 or 4 seasons if it picks up the pace and with legacies finishing its a good way to get your vampire fix.,/review/rw8573666/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2022,AfricanBro,5," Had low expectations and it met them
","They make the most of it, production is a little underwhelming and budgeted but the premise is pretty decent. The ideology of the series is really the only thing that kept me watching past the first episode otherwise it's really nothing special. It starts off already in the middle of things with no introductions to the character or world the show's based in; howbeit, it isn't complex so you catch on pretty quickly on what's what. The story is close to ""A discovery of witches"" calibre, everything else however, the writing, acting, budget, plot and production, isn't anything to behold. A couple episodes in I let myself get invested in the characters and I'm enjoying it better. I never heard of the books until now and a lot of the reviews go on about how this is nothing like them and not as good; and I get it because in the proper hands or even just a bigger studio this really could be something better. I didn't really go in with high expectations. So from what others have said if you're a fan of the books you might not enjoy it, but as someone who hasn't read them, despite this being subpar compared to others in the genre like 'The Originals' or 'discovery of witches' etcetera, I'm still interested enough to keep on watching.",/review/rw8573666/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2022,torrescindy-01009,7," Different from the Book but giving it a Chance
","As a fan of the books since I was in high school I was highly anticipating this show. But you have to know before going into this tv series that it is not like the books. At first while I was watching the series I admit I was annoyed by how much they changed, but as time went on after episode 4 I learned to appreciate it. Don't get me wrong I am a huge fan of the book series and am little disappointment that they didn't follow the books. BUT this series DOES NOT DESERVE THE ONE STAR people are giving it. Reading the reviews you can tell that they are not fans of the series. Also you have to remember that Julie Plec is having a hand in Producing the show. If you watched Vampire Diaries you have to know Julie Plec's style. She is definitely changing the books to fit this modern 'Bridgerton age.'
Now onto what I appreciate about the series: I love the diversity and representation that was included. Yes, I know Rose is supposed to be Turkish and Dimitri Russian, but I would like to believe they have a plan to incorporate these cultures. Remember people can be mixed race and even we did not know Rose was Turkish until later in the books. Another thing I love is the opening scene, we got a glimpse of the car crash and meet Lissa's family for ourselves. By the way I did not like Andre.",/review/rw8573666/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2022,meltingmel,9," Much Better Than I Hoped
","I was definitely on the bandwagon that this show was going to suck and I had ALL the reasons why. NOPE ! I was so wrong and I'm really happy about that. It's done SO WELL! Do I love some of the changes? I'm not happy about them but they smooth over them very well. I think the reason why I'm so happy is that the acting is really good, and the chemistry between key romantic characters is spot on. So because of that... I'm loving it. I also can very much see the polished work of Julie Plec.",/review/rw8573666/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2022,pooya-932-558893,," Just wrong
","Vampires that can't move fast or disappear like any vampire movie or series, they are too ordinary and teflon to call them vampires. Just fangs? Are you kidding me? Elder vampires and kids are the same in powers? The vampires do parkour only that's hilarious instead of interesting. This series is a bad joke pretending to be serious with creators had no concept or clue on what vampires are...
Then it comes to elemental magic and thats another disappointment, weak vampires, weak story, weak philosophy and the whole series will lease a bad taste, with fights that looks like very bad johnwick copy fights in a vampire series thats hilarious. I should say WTF.",/review/rw8573666/?ref_=tt_urv

16 September 2022,India_Ana,3," Excuse Me While I Grieve . . .
","I can't believe I subscribed to Peacock TV for this. I'm glad I got a discount for the year. It doesn't look like I'll be subscribing for a second year though. I will never understand why someone takes a book and reworks the characters, world, and story to create something different from the original form. The whole point of watching a book come to life as a movie or show is to see it play out on the screen like it did in my head. To see this world with my own eyes, and to see the characters in the flesh. I DO NOT want changes.",/review/rw8573666/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2022,willandtruly,8," They should have said ""loosely based on"" and not adaptation.
","The subject matter is similar and most of the characters have the same names, but that is where the majority of the similarities to the book series disappear. The story in the show bounces all over all of the books picking and twisting the different events. These books were also for young adults and the content of the show is definitely not for young adults. I wish I had not read the books prior to seeing the show, maybe than I wouldn't be as disappointed. I read all of the Vampire Academy series books and then continued on the the Bloodlines series. I genuinely hope they do not attempt to convert those books as well.",/review/rw8573666/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2022,lilred0130,7," It was not bad... as a stand-alone
","I've never read the books (I did see the movie... it wasn't Oscar material, but I thought it was cute), but from what other people say, it seems to vary too much as an adaptation. So my review is from the perspective of not having read them.",/review/rw8573666/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2022,ejcooper-01861,1," What a Mess.
",I am so so disappointed. The TV series is an utter mess. The book have such a strong strong line with characters full of depth. This series has stripped the books down to nothing. The book series is my favourite series to read. I am so disappointed. The series have thrown so many of the story lines all together and immediately and without rationale. I cannot understand how the writers of this show are happy with what they have produced. I truly wonder how Richelle Mead feels seeing her hard work and story line tossed to the side for some bizarre interpretation that truly makes zero sense. The full length movie was better than the series and even then the movie was also not true to the characters and emotions that the books evoke.,/review/rw8573666/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2022,crystle0713,10," Never read the books
","Maybe that's why I like the show. I find it enjoyable and it leaves me looking forward to the next episode. I really like Rose and Lissa. I certainly hope it is renewed for a 2nd season. Does it have some cheesy parts? Of course. Even some of the best shows suffer from cheesiness once in a while. If you haven't watched it, or read the books, don't go by just the reviews alone. Watch and make up your own mind. I mean, there are some shows out there getting 7 or higher in reviews, and I found them extremely boring. I would get one or 2 episodes in, just to go look for another show, ones I've watched before. All during the past couple of months when there has been nothing on.",/review/rw8573666/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2022,cari_carter,7," Didn't like at first but it's growing on me!
","I feel like it's coming full circle and while it started as eating up the entire book series storyline, it now almost seems like a prequel at the same time. I don't like a few things about the relationships and how Rose sometimes acts which is completely out of character for her in the book. While I didn't like the changes, I'm coming to be okay with them. We'll see how this season ends before making any final judgment. I'll watch it regardless because I Love VA! Totally different but similar at the same time. Hated it but now am okay since I kept watching! Give it a shot and don't take any reviews too seriously. I know it's tough for diehard fans but I think we'll get to the stories we love eventually as long as it continues!",/review/rw8573666/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2022,beccaboobear-83619,1," What on earth...
","Did the writers of this show get handed the book only to yeet it out the window... i wish companies would stop taking books that are A plus grade and turning them into steaming hot garbage. Poor choice in cast. I just... i cant believe they did this, if i was Richelle Mead i would be so pissed off. Honestly if you are reading these reviews thinking about watching this show, this is your warnings now... DONT DO IT, ITS A TRAP. Worst adaptation of a book I think I've ever seen... the movie was honestly 100000x better than this show at least the movie followed the book more and the choice in cast was way better.",/review/rw8573666/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2022,Paigeeexo,," Just no...
",Just finished episode 5 and I can't go on. The movie is one thousand times better than this (and I didn't even like the movie that much). Please DO NOT take amazing books and turn them into hot trash. I can't imagine how Richelle Mead must feel watching her work be misrepresented.,/review/rw8573666/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2022,skpn123,6," A worthy watch thus far......
",I love the book series - it is a fun ride with some good messages about friendship and diversity. I also like the movie. So far the series is a worthy watch though there was a small problems.... I was getting quite confused and though WOW this series is a bit of a muddle - then I realised my program had jumped to Episode 4 instead of the Pilot Episode 1.....,/review/rw8573666/?ref_=tt_urv

",As a huge HUGE fan of the books I was a little concerned about this adoptation because of all the changes they announced beforhand. However after watching the first episode I absolutely love it .I just finished episode 4 it was fantastic I love all the changes it makes its own bold statement I can't wait to watch all the characters develop in the series I hope they go far and finish all the books and make a spin off series for Bloodlines .I love what they have done the filming locations are perfect I love the clothes the way the talk its perfect. Everything is amazing I can't wait to see more I highly recommend this show .Sure it's different from the books but that doesn't mean a bad thing give It a chance I did and I absolutely loved it .,/review/rw8573666/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2022,tinkkytone,6," Some good with the bad
","You could spend your time while watching this show nitpicking it to death...or you could just enjoy it for what it is - a vampire show that doesn't take itself too seriously. Yes, there is a stunning lack of world building which at times makes things very confusing, and the writing is...not that good, but overall it's just a fun show to watch. The cast is very easy on the eyes, if not the best actors, and the costumes for the ""royals"" are an interesting show within the show. The first season is ten episodes and each episode is less than 50 minutes, so I got through this fairly quickly once I stopped all the nitpicking, and just started enjoying, which s what you need to do if you are reading this.",/review/rw8573666/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2022,tobin_brittany,1," Disappointing
","This was my all time favorite book, but they just changed so much that it's frustrating. Like some of the things they changed made no sense what so ever. I guess they wanted to make it their own, but it seems pointless. The conflicts made the book work and would have worked well for the show.",/review/rw8573666/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2022,paigeherberg,9," Enjoyed it!
","There have already been bad reviews on this show. However, it seems to be from not understanding the world in which Vampire Academy is in. Yes they are using umbrellas in the sun. If you pay attention in the show, it explains why. Yes they use sunglasses sometimes even at night; once again, this is explained in the episodes already available if they are watched.",/review/rw8573666/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2022,mercedeszerbini,7," Enjoyable despite book differences.
","Into episode 4. Not going to lie, the differences pulled me out of it a bit, but it is still enjoyable. I'm annoyed when interrupted and can't wait for the next episode - means it's great for me. The characters are likeable and dialogue flows. The drive for what they're doing doesn't leave me perplexed. The chemistry between the couples is there and I'm drawn in. It's good so far and I'll keep watching. I'm already worried it'll be canceled because of the negative reviews that want/need the books to be replicated. If I want what I've already read/seen in my head, I'll re-read the books - but I guess that's just me.",/review/rw8573666/?ref_=tt_urv

16 September 2022,apurvac-50202,7," Not bad
","They are not exactly following the plot and changed a lot of things but the gist remains the same. Since Julie Plec is one of the developers of the show, I knew there would be changes. One only has to compare the differences between TVD books and tv adaptation. Why on the earthy did they make Robert and Victor lovers? They were brothers in the book. Then there's the part about Mia and Sonya being sisters, why? I have watched four episodes so far, i keep expecting Adrian to shop up any day now. Since everything is happening all out of order, who knows? (This reminds me of the Percy Jackson movies) Despite all these changes, I did enjoy the new perspective.",/review/rw8573666/?ref_=tt_urv
