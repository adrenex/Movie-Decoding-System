10 March 2013,JustCuriosity,9," Beautifully filmed Coming-of-Age tale on the Mississippi River
","Mud was very well-received by a packed house at the Paramount Theatre for its Regional Premiere at Austin's SXSW Film Festival. The crowd particularly loved local favorites director Jeff Nichols and the always shape-shifting Matthew McConaughey. (How is it possible that McConaughey hasn't even been nominated for an Oscar yet?) Mud is a charming, entrancing film that has almost lyrical quality as it unfolds along the rural backwoods of Arkansas's Mississippi River. The story revolves around the adventures of two young teenage boys who meet a mysterious drifter appropriately named Mud. Mud is hiding out an island in the Mississippi River awaiting the arrival of his beloved Juniper. The story has elements of drama, thriller, and romance. While the film is slightly too long and the story has a few unnecessary and distracting subplots, its overall eloquence and is absorbing. So like the Mississippi, the story meanders a little too much. The River setting becomes a character in the film that shapes the drama playing out along it. The two teenage actors are excellent, but the film is tour-de-force for McConaughey who is its heart and soul. Highly recommended for those who like serious drama and appreciate natural beauty.",/review/rw2802981/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2013,TruthSpeaks,8," Wow
","This is a movie that stays with you. It's a real movie about people, and a place--not car chases and explosions. I don't agree with the mixed reviews and complaints about the length of the movie. Matthew McConnahey is well-cast. All of the actors do a good work; Reese Witherspoon, Sam Sheppard. Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland do a great job playing the child characters. The Mississippi river is like a character in the movie, which evokes Huckleberry Finn, as others have noted. The settings are magnificent. In a sea of manufactured movies, it's nice to see something that was crafted by human beings. I would recommend this movie to those who are interested.",/review/rw2802981/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2014,Hitchcoc,8," Portrayal of a Time
","I was pretty engaged in this film, particularly in the day-to-day existence of the boys who are at the center of it. It has an element of the ""Stand by Me"" mentality. The boys are bright and real and find themselves having to make decisions on a moral code that they have made for themselves. They are, for the most part, realistic about things, but the culture they are in is so boring and so lacking in stimulation that when the intriguing figure of Mud comes along, they are ready for adventure. Unfortunately, there are simply so many things that just aren't believable. Their access to everything they need when they need it. The ease of transport. The lack of suspicion from others (I know there is some). They also have an incredible amount of mobility. Then there is the contrived ""High Noon"" conclusion that is bound to happen. It is, itself, pretty demanding of our suspension of disbelief. Still, it keeps us entertained, the acting is quite admirable, particularly the supporting characters, but I expected a little more.",/review/rw2802981/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2015,CalRhys,," Exquisite Piece Of Filmmaking
","An exquisite piece of filmmaking from writer-director Jeff Nichols, bolstered by powerful performances from Matthew McConaughey, Reece Witherspoon, Sam Shephard, Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland. 'Mud' is a beautifully shot film that blends crime, drama and romance into a heartfelt plot that follows two young boys who encounter a fugitive in need of their help. Set against some of the most unique and stunning locations ever used in a film, 'Mud' is reminiscent of flicks including 'Stand by Me' and 'Night of the Hunter'. Starting off relatively slow, the film steadily urges the viewer into a riveting tale of love, hate and redemption, with McConaughey giving one of his finest performances ever. A realistic and gripping coming-of-age tale that not only stands as being one of the best films of 2012, but one of the best dramas of the past decade.",/review/rw2802981/?ref_=tt_urv

","In Arkansas, the fourteen year-old Ellis (Tye Sheridan) lives in a floating house with his mother Mary Lee (Sarah Paulson) and his father Senior (Ray McKinnon). Ellis helps his father selling fish with his best friend Neckbone (Jacob Lofland). Ellis and Neckbone find a motorboat stranded on the top of a tree in an island on the Mississippi River since a flood and they plan to fix the boat for them. One day, they climb the tree and they find fresh meal inside the boat meaning that someone is living in ""their"" boat. They leave the place and meet a man named Mud (Matthew McConaughey) near their boat. Soon they learn that the passionate Mud killed a man that had beaten up his girlfriend Juniper (Reese Witherspoon) and now the father and the brother of the deceased man are hunting him down. Mud makes a deal with the romantic Ellis and Neckbone to help him to reunite with Juniper. But when Ellis meets Mud's stepfather Tom (Sam Shepard), he has a different opinion about the love of Juniper with Mud. ",/review/rw2802981/?ref_=tt_urv

27 April 2013,WriterDave,9," A Ripping Good Yarn
","Jeff Nichols' new film ""Mud"" is essentially a coming-of-age tale, but it borrows liberally elements of neo-noir, Southern Gothic and melodrama while being filmed as if it was based on some great novel that was never written. It makes for a ripping good yarn that should please a wide audience thirsty for drama with a bit of heart and some sentimentality (without ever being sappy).",/review/rw2802981/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2013,StevePulaski,10," Multiple different angles immensely elevate a tired story
","Instantaneously, Mud brought me back to days past when my friend and I would explore the woods near my house. The woods were by no means deep, located closely to a golf-course and an apartment complex, but they were all that we had and we loved them. We'd be on the hunt for golf balls, and would often stumble upon such ""treasures"" as rubber tires, potpourri, cigarette butts, beer bottles, and broken glass. Upon finding them, we'd make up stories on how they got there, and often, if we had a sleepover, listen for teenagers, bums, or whoever may be out there in the middle of the night leaving such objects.",/review/rw2802981/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2019,rooprect,8," So good I hate to call it a ""coming of age"" story.
","If you're like me, you greet the phrase ""coming of age story"" with something between a polite nod and an gaping, open mouthed yawn. While ""Mud"" falls into that category, it's easily one of the best, if not the best, in its class. This is because nothing about it is predictable; there's no sappy clich√© message, and although it's mostly tame regarding violence, some parts are extremely tense, menacing and disturbing. Ultimately, yes, it's a coming of age story, but it's a slightly dark version which is aimed more at adults than kids.",/review/rw2802981/?ref_=tt_urv

","I went into ""Mud"" with no idea of what it was about. I immediately had flashbacks to ""Stand By Me"". That said, I think ""Mud"" is a better movie. I thought the acting was exceptional, the photography both real and lush, the lighting well done, and the story was fresh, real, and terrific. The direction MUST have been terrific also, as the result is a near-perfect film that everyone can and should enjoy. ",/review/rw2802981/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2013,generationfilm,9," Director Jeff Nichols' Third Film is an Embodiment of the Classic Americana Spirit Delivered Through Heartfelt Storytelling and Pristine Cinematic Technicality
","Engaging an audience in a truly captivating sense of wonder is a lost art form in the realm of cinema, or at least it has become so rare that we begin to forget how magical the silver screen experience can be. One of those rare filmmakers is writer and director Jeff Nichols who made great strides in inventive filmmaking with his second feature Take Shelter, a deeply unsettling and atmospheric thriller that reminded us that the potential for original storytelling can have equally creative follow through. Writer/director Jeff Nichols' latest atmospheric drama Mud continues his notable prestige for dramatic filmmaking by creating a pure slice of Americana; an evocative and poignant coming of age tale that borrows the lyricism of Tennessee Williams works and mixes them with the harmonious sensitivity of a Sam Shepard play, who is ironically enough in a supporting role in the film, creating a witty and insightful modern day Mark Twain influenced adventure. Keeping his respectful gaze on rural America, Nichols creates an intimate reflection on friendship, unrequited love, and youthful discovery with a rhythmic, sensitive approach towards life's realizations during childhood. Mud is one of those films where all of the creative outlets from the ethereal cinematography to the haunting cinematic score come together in perfect unison to highlight the depth within the story being told. The film unveils its inner soul with a purposefully meditative pace that might deter some from experiencing a thoughtful approach but that would be a drastic mistake because it's one of the more authentically creative and emotionally opulent movies to grace the theaters in a long while. In Mud we're not only witnessing the artistic stamp of a director who has found his distinct voice but also the final stages of resurrection in the acting career of Matthew McConaughey who has never been more focused or impassioned on the screen. While Mud might not be as finely woven as his sophomore effort Take Shelter there is no denying his latest drama's penchant for compelling drama enhanced by the heartfelt nature of the writing, the clarity in the visuals, and the honesty in all of the acting performances.",/review/rw2802981/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2013,ramair350,10," Absolutely gripping, moving, and beautiful - a must see!
","It isn't fair compare this title directly to other films, but I will anyway. So here goes: Huck Finn with a dash of Deliverance, Winters Bone, and Tree of Life. By the way, I hated Tree of Life, which WAS beautiful but entirely too experimental for my liking (I would have been fine with it as an exhibit at a modern art museum). But Mud is a film that is a pleasure to look at, and also has a fantastic story that weaves in poverty, youth, the loss of innocence, love, and violence.",/review/rw2802981/?ref_=tt_urv

Just at a time when they are beginning to recognize their own pre-adult urgings awakening inside them, they discover who is living in their tree house of sort and make friends with him. He becomes a mentor to them just when the murky waters have become too muddy to see clearly, and he tells them how his own life has been shipwrecked because of a love affair that began when he was about their age.",/review/rw2802981/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2021,masonsaul,9," Incredible drama
","Despite an action movie worthy premise, Mud is actually an incredible drama about love that's mature, sombre and emotional. Tye Sheridan, Jacob Lofland and Matthew McConaughey are all incredible with superb chemistry. Reese Witherspoon, Sarah Paulson, Ray McKinnon and Sam Shepard are all great. Jeff Nichol's direction is excellent, it's beautifully filmed and effectively slow paced. The music by David Wingo is fantastic.",/review/rw2802981/?ref_=tt_urv

26 May 2013,classicsoncall,9," ""You gotta know what's worth keepin' and what's worth lettin' go.""
","This is one of the few movies I've ever been enticed to see based on a trailer other than a favorite genre film I would have been predisposed to see anyway, say a Western or a good sci-fi flick. Fortunately the advertising worked, ""Mud"" is an effective movie with emphasis on story and character development that seems lacking in a majority of pictures today. Matthew McConaughey is superb as the title character in a role that belies his once daunted status as People Magazine's hottest hunk of the year. His performance alone is worth a trip to the movies, but he's supported by an equally able cast led by Tye Sheridan in what may arguably be the principal role of a young boy named Ellis, who along with best friend Neckbone (Jacob Lofland), embark on an adventure in the making on a Mississippi River island that's fraught with unknown danger.",/review/rw2802981/?ref_=tt_urv
