15 March 2007,MartianOctocretr5,8," Touching story
","A very well mastered family movie with a positive message that addresses topical themes for children in a poignant, focused manner. The children depicted are very real and likable (well, except for the ones you're supposed to dislike, that is), and easy to identify with. The movie is a faithful and touching adaptation of the beloved children's classic book.",/review/rw2916642/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2019,ismamuzzaman,," One of those few movies that made me cry.
","This movie is like a happy memory from my childhood. I had seen it once when I was very young and today, as a 20 year old. And honestly, I cried both the times. As a child, I learned what imagination was from this movie. And now, I acknowledge how much freedom I had as a child. This may not have been the best movie ever made, or the best movie I have ever seen, but whenever I will see this movie, I know it will remind me of some of the best memories from my childhood, and remind me how much I should cherish those memories.",/review/rw2916642/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2007,Nez-Alpha,7," Story over effects.
","When I sat down to watch Bridge to Terabithia, I did not know quite what to expect. From what I had seen in the trailers, I thought the movie would be about two kids that end up in some magical world, similar to the Chronicles of Narnia (clearly, I did not read the book). Needless to say that I was surprised when actually seeing the movie. I shall not spoil the story for those who have yet to see the movie, but I will say that, in my opinion, this movie is for a more mature audience than one would think. Rather than being a fairytale for youngsters, the movie actually gives the viewer an inside look in a young boy's life and all the troubles he faces, concerning school, family and friends. The setting overall was a lot darker than expected as well. I can be short about the acting. The child-stars that play the lead roles did a great job and really brought the characters to life. On this subject I must give some credit to the director as well, as it is very difficult to work with children and to get them to play the part exactly the way you want them too. One final aspect of the movie that deserves mentioning is the fact that it does not lean on special effects. Although there is a fair amount of nice CGI present in the film, the story dominates. Which in my opinion, is a lot better than the other way around. Overall, I found the movie very enjoyable, but I would advise parents of young children to find out more about the movie, before deciding on whether or not you'll let your kids watch it.",/review/rw2916642/?ref_=tt_urv

16 February 2007,katie-joy,10," Couldn't Have Done Better
","When I heard back in August 2006 that they were making the award winning book ""Bridge to Terabithia"" into a movie, I immediately reread the book. But, it took my only a few hours, and I had months to wait. Today, February 16th, I saw it, and I have a few things all of you might want to know. This movie is very kid friendly, if you are very concerned about what your kids see, then, this might be good. There are a few imaginary ""scary"" figures, but it's not like a horror movie. The actors did so wonderfully well, it scares me. Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia were always favorites of mine, but they surprised me anyway. They played the roles well. It teaches you a lesson, also, and it shows some how to use an imagination. I thought this movie was marvelous, and it deserves to be watched by millions. It couldn't have done better.",/review/rw2916642/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2014,SnoopyStyle,8," Good performances from the kids
","Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson) is picked on at school, and is forced to wear his sister's hand-me-down sneakers. His father (Robert Patrick) is a poor farmer. Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb) is new in school. Jesse strives to be the fastest runner but then he gets beat by the new girl. It turns out that she's their neighbor. She is an imaginative writer and he's constantly drawing in his book. He's infatuated with the music teacher Ms. Edmunds (Zooey Deschanel). At first, he doesn't like the new girl but he finds her to be a fellow traveler bullied by the other kids. Together, they find a worn out rope swing.

","About 10 years ago, when I was 8-years-old, a schoolteacher friend of my mother's gave me a book to read, and that book was Bridge to Terabithia. I was absolutely enthralled by the novel, and found myself crying at the end, the first time a work of fiction had made me cry. The magic and wonder of the book stuck with me the past decade, so you can imagine my excitement when I found out it was being turned into a movie!",/review/rw2916642/?ref_=tt_urv

","Great movie for all ages I took my five year old and fiancé they loved it.....Josh Hutcherson was great in this and so was Anna Sophia Robb .....People actually cried and clapped after the show it touches your inner child...It will take you through a life experience that not all kids go through in life but you will be absorbed in the film as I was...If you are looking for a great film instead of all the kids movies that rely on jokes that are used over and over ...go to this film and you will be satisfied with drama, light comedy and maybe slight depression of the reality it faces, but your spirit will be lifted as will your child's.",/review/rw2916642/?ref_=tt_urv

6 February 2007,pierce44,10," Major Hit Brewing
","Saw the premiere and the movie has all the earmarks of a major hit. You never know for sure with American audiences but this is a very beautiful and engaging film. It REALLY outclasses any number of recent movies marketed at kids and it is one of the few I've seen that shows honest portrayals of both children and adults. No one, not even the bullies, is a stereotype or caricature. The novel is a masterpiece, but this film holds its own. With so many films, you walk out, whether amused or annoyed, and soon forget most of what you saw. Not so with Bridge--it stays with you, as it should. Go and enjoy...and then pass the word.",/review/rw2916642/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2017,Hitchcoc,9," Does Justice to a Really Fine Book
","There are lots of books about kids who don't fit in. There are lots of books about bullying. The movie industry has created scripts, utilizing these personalities and showing their struggles. This movie rises above the ordinary. It's a fantasy film that is also a love story. What is real? What is in the mind? It doesn't matter because love and friendship supersede a setting that some would say is impossible. The boy and girl create a world where they can get away from unfulfilled lives and revel in a kind of medieval ethos. They face monsters and trolls and other forces, but that is what gives them life. As they make their respective ways through Terabithia, outside factors begin to resolve themselves and an embracing of the the real world happens. Watch this with your kid.",/review/rw2916642/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2010,TheLittleSongbird,9," Beautiful, charming and touching fantasy film
","Based on Katherine Patterson's beautiful book, Bridge to Terabithia is a beautiful, charming and touching fantasy film, that serves as an emotionally rich testament to the life-changing power of friendship. The film does start off a little slow, as the two protagonists at first interact quite awkwardly, but fifteen minutes in the pacing picked up. I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly the film went. The story is quite simple, as Jess and Leslie encounter mundane daily experiences and become inseparable as a result by their alienation and creativity, but it is an effective one and respects reasonably the story of the book. Also the script ensures that the characters are believable; Jess and Leslie certainly are believable as characters, and Gabor Csupo, who also directed the surprisingly good and underrated Secret of Moonacre, tackles the issues explored in the film with wit and sensitivity.",/review/rw2916642/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2007,landonfreeman,8," Not a children's story????
","I have read about 30 reviews on here about this movie, many of them saying this film is not for kids. While I do understand where some parents may be coming from, I have to disagree. I personally read this book when I was in 5th grade. That was 11 years ago, yet somehow that book still sticks in my mind. I honestly had completely forgotten what the book was about, but I remember it being about two kids. Therefore, seeing the movie was like experiencing the story all over again. I DO think this is a good movie for children 10+. Like I already mentioned I was 11 when I read the book for the first time and I remember it having quite a positive impact on me. I didn't remember the novel or what it was about, however I did remember that it touched me in a way that very few books ever did. Kids 10+ need to see this movie.",/review/rw2916642/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2007,pandapandapie,10," A friendless boy, who is having trouble everywhere in life, is inspired and changed by the new girl at school, who teaches him the importance of fun and imagination.
","I went into this movie not knowing what it was about. From the trailers I had assumed that it was kind of like The Never Ending Story, but I found that the trailers were terribly misleading. Since I have never read the book, I had no idea what it would really be like, but I was very pleasantly surprised. I won't get into the plot because I'm terrible at explaining plot lines well, but I hope that it will suffice when I say that I left the theater with my mind blown. I turned to my friend and was like, ""Wow, I actually want to turn around and see that again, right now."" but I couldn't because I had to go to work. It's unusual to be saying this because I normally don't like to re-watch movies so soon, but I've found that ever since I left the theater, I just want to go back. I've been trying to drag my friends there with me because I think that everyone should see this, but unfortunately, the add campaign may have ruined all chances of that happening. I find that every time I ask one of my friends to go with me, they say that there is no way they are going to watch that movie, which means I'll probably have to see it alone when I watch it again (I will definitely be watching this again). It was so good that I cried during the movie. I only remember crying in one other movie ever.",/review/rw2916642/?ref_=tt_urv

","I had read the book before i saw the movie and I didn't think that they would do a good job with the movie and stay true to the novel. I was quite surprised though. The movie stayed true to the book and I think that it is a very good movie for 7-13 year olds especially. The parts that I really enjoyed were when the characters imaginations came to life in Terabithia. It made everything seem so real. The ending was very magical and moving..I am not usually an emotional person but i found myself on the verge of tears. The Acting was really good as well. The young girl that played Leslie did a great job as well as Zooey Deschanel playing the kids teacher. Overall, I was very impressed and I was surprised at how good of a job was done to make the movie out of the book. The acting, characters, sets, storyline were very well done. This is a movie that I would definitely recommend to see to everyone, but especially if you are going to see it with children/ teenagers.",/review/rw2916642/?ref_=tt_urv

","Bridge To Terabithia was my favorite book as a kid - I first read it over 25 years ago. It was an amazing, haunting, sad, and powerful story of friendship and loss. It's still one of my favorite books as both an adult and a writer. It has since become a modern classic of children's literature, a book beloved by children and adults alike. It's also one of the most controversial children's books of all time - one of the most banned and challenged.",/review/rw2916642/?ref_=tt_urv

","A little imagination can sometimes go a long way. The story of young, and artistically talented, Jesse (Josh Hutcherson) who is sharing concerns and money problems with his family. He's having trouble at school with the bullies and there is a bully like troll who charges the kids a dollar to go and pee. He is fighting for the attention of his father, against his baby sister. Life for young Jesse isn't looking up, that is until the adventurous, imaginative and non-conformist Leslie (AnnaSophia Robb) arrives in town. Together they form a bond and Jesse's life shall never, again, be the same. Adventures and amazement in other worlds centre around these two kindred spirits, and for once, for Jesse, life isn't so bad after all.

Then she dies, wow will that surprise you. The movie then goes in a totally new direction where the boy must come to grips with his best friends death.

4 December 2013,BeneCumb,7," Decent children movie, with some questionable patterns
","In the world of both wealth and generation gaps as well as changes in values, it is not easy for a child to grow up and find his/her own way - there are so many obstacles and challenges, and kids with strong character and/or home support are able to overcome them more or less smoothly. The rest would wade into hobbies or imaginary world - as we see in Bridge to Terabithia where two loners/ soul-mates find their time and place to exit real problems and difficulties. Well, it is logical, but it appears as a recommendation for others suffering from bullying, abusive family etc. - which is definitely not the best way of encouragement. The plot is also not too smooth, the most interesting part is Leslie and Jesse together until the certain twist, the ending is a bit insipid, the introductory part has too many clichés; digital effects, however, are splendidly made. But the cast is nicely strong, both children and adults, particularly Josh Hutcherson, AnnaSophia Robb, Robert Patrick, Zooey Deschanel.",/review/rw2916642/?ref_=tt_urv
