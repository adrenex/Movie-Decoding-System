","The title ""Bosch & Rockit"" may be misleading.",/review/rw8660455/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2022,Chris_Mac_25,10," Fantastic Aussie cinema
","Just a great Aussie movie. Imperfect characters interacting with the best Australia has to offer as a scenic backdrop. I couldn't find a weak point or character, and the ending left me wanting more but also glad that the future of the characters was up to my own speculation.",/review/rw8660455/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2022,Phil_M_A_Kerr,10," Wow. Better than expected.
","Read the What Walt's Watching review then add my bit:
I thought the ending was great. It was the right choice for a movie about a kid. His life is just opening up to him.",/review/rw8660455/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2022,eleisha_is_fullysik,9," Amazing Aussie film!
","Went into this not expecting much and left feeling so many emotions! Took me on an emotional roller coaster. Laughs, tears, sadness, love! I highly recommend this film. Luke Hemsworth was unreal and the child was great, can't wait to see future projects with him in them.",/review/rw8660455/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2023,edwin-wks,6," Childhood neglect in paradise
","This is a story of a boy who, neglected by his parents and lacking an anchor, turns to the ocean for solace and into himself for protection. He grows up into a man who is supposedly rooted in hippie mysticism and Sikhism, yet juxtaposed with high profile girlfriends and Hollywood projects. This autobiographical account of his early life has the same duality of being cathartic and being self-indulgent. Remove the neglect and there is little else of substance to the movie. Even the neglect fails to be compelling due to the idyllic setting.",/review/rw8660455/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'll start with the bad, not many people say tucker instead of food in Australia. Some of the slams was a put off, though it was made for the international market I assume.",/review/rw8660455/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2023,shagee7977,10," Surfs up...down under
",Director/co-writer Tyler Atkins brings us Ocean Boy. In his directional debut he scores big. Casting has a lot do with this. And Rasmus King also debuts with this film. This young actor is amazing and a joy to watch. He is a natural and he really becomes the character of Rockit.,/review/rw8660455/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2022,MK_Ultra_,5," Okay film weighed down by unlikable characters
",Good story base but drawn out screenplay just weighs it down. The Dad's character is well acted and as much of an antihero as also a guy you want to have a beer with.,/review/rw8660455/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2023,lucienm-60321,7," Fantastic locations !
",Likeable storyline of father trying to be a good father to his surf mad teenager son.,/review/rw8660455/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2023,cinmartel,," Great watch!
","The title ""Bosch & Rockit"" combine two Frank Zappa' song titles, which per se is pretty cool.",/review/rw8660455/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2022,cthirlby,4," Enjoyable but lacking
",Been waiting for this for a while as it was Australian exclusive! Got the chance to watch it and whilst I was enjoying the visuals of the movie with the beaches and surfing scenes which looked great the story didn't work for me. The characters felt bland and I didn't connect with them and the overall story with the ending it had was underwhelming and could've been more. There was a message they were trying to put across but it just wasn't working due to poor writing. I did enjoy watching it tho to some extent and again great surf cinematography!,/review/rw8660455/?ref_=tt_urv
