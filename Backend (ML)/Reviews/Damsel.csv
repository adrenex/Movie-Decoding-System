30 April 2008,Smells_Like_Cheese,7," Better than expected
","When I first saw the trailer for Baby Mama, I just thought this movie was going to be a total disaster, it didn't look funny and like another typical chick flick. But my friends wanted to see it, so we saw it opening weekend, and actually I was surprised, I did like a lot better than what I was expecting. Baby Mama is something that looks like from the Lifetime Network, but it's all good, it has some really funny moments and was just cute. Amy Poehler and Tina Fey are two very funny women from Saturday Night Live, they also did Mean Girls together and made their characters an absolute joy to watch, so seeing them as the leads in this film was going to be an interesting turn. Tina Fey definitely has a lot of talent not only as a writer, but as an actress, she made her character believable and as neuritic as she was, she was still likable. Amy Poehler made her character a little too SNL at times, but these girls made the movie enjoyable and a fun flick to watch for the afternoon.",/review/rw3395823/?ref_=tt_urv

26 April 2019,TheMovieDiorama,5," Baby Mama feels lighter and slightly more colourful than a used pregnancy test.
","Fey and Poehler were the 'Saturday Night Live' dream team. Consistently witty and constantly hilarious. But these results are usually produced when they are performing their own writing. McCullers, mostly of 'Austin Powers' fame, unfortunately places too many restraints on these two leads that consequently hold the overall comedy back, despite its sweet lighthearted tone. A single businesswoman, who mostly puts her career before her personal life, desires to conceive a baby but is unable to due to certain complications. She then proceeds to go down the surrogacy route and forces her lifestyle choices upon the surrogate mother.",/review/rw3395823/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2008,jaredmobarak,6," My avatar is dressed like a whoreBaby Mama
","Say what you will about the marketing machine, but I truly think the people behind promoting Baby Mama did a bang up jobeven if I believe they did so without trying. They make expectations so low in the trailer that you almost have to enjoy the film. Was it a great comedy? No. However, it was much better than I ever could have hoped as Michael McCullers takes us places you never would expect going in. I thought that it would be a water-downed, overlong SNL skit with one woman asking another to carry her baby, leading to a generic odd couple pairing with hijinks and gags piling on top of each other, collapsing under its own weight. Instead we are treated to a pretty sentimental and touching portrait of two women learning to grow and evolve with help from the other, a person, in both regards, that they never would have thought could teach them anything. Even the pregnancy aspect takes a ton of twists and turns never becoming the straight shot gimmick just bringing everyone together. The surrogate mother here must make some tough decisions as she continues along on her journey, lending a side to the tale that actually brings it to a level of intrigue that no Lorne Michaels film has done in recent memory.",/review/rw3395823/?ref_=tt_urv

","Some funny moments, but overwhelming mediocre. The storyline is fairly predictable and lacks real interest, same with the dialogue, a bit bland. Characters lack depth, and there's no real chemistry. It all feels very ""Meh""",/review/rw3395823/?ref_=tt_urv

","The entertaining comedy duo of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler don't quite live up to expectations in this movie. Those two are usually very fun together and while there are some amusing moments in Baby Mama, I ultimately found it to be a bit underwhelming. A good supporting cast can't lift it out of mediocrity either.",/review/rw3395823/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2008,EUyeshima,6," Predictable Farce Driven by a Deafening Biological Clock and a Familiar ""Odd Couple"" Set-Up
","There is a smattering of smart laughs in this 2008 comedy, but first-time director Michael McCullers really plods his own coincidence-driven script along with little sense of style or dramatic resonance. At times, it feels no better than a formulaic romantic comedy from the 1960's usually starring small-screen celebrities trying to break into the big time. Sure enough, this time, we are offered Tina Fey (currently of NBC's ""30 Rock"") and Amy Poehler, former ""Saturday Night Live"" Weekend Update co-anchors and definitely the cream of the current funny lady crop. The problem is that McCullers, a one-time SNL staff writer who also co-wrote the Austin Powers movies with Mike Myers, doesn't elevate the screenplay much beyond the limited dimensions of an extended comedy sketch. That puts most of the pressure on the two women to make this farce work as a distaff version of ""The Odd Couple"" with a pregnancy angle, and they often - you should pardon the expression - deliver.",/review/rw3395823/?ref_=tt_urv

Kate(Fey)is a single, successful businesswoman, who finally hears that biological clock ticking...loudly. She's going to balance her career with hopes of having a baby. She finds that she is infertile, but that doesn't stop her from finding a South Philly working-class gal Angie(Poehler)to be her surrogate. Opposite as night and day, Kate and Angie almost succumb to their different lifestyles and thoughts on rearing a child.

2 January 2009,Movie_Muse_Reviews,7," Tina Fey continues to climb the comedy hierarchy in ""Baby Mama""
","There weren't too many people hotter than Tina Fey in 2008. Between the smash comedy 30 Rock, her impression of GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, and taking the lead for the first time in a movie with ""Baby Mama,"" Fey and her iconic black-rimmed glasses have soared above and beyond Saturday Night Live. While the film ""Baby Mama"" might not be her most notable exploit, it's brand of subtle humor works in her favor and makes for an enjoyable film.",/review/rw3395823/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2008,polarimetric,8," Not Quite Groundbreaking, But Exceeds Expectations
","Saturday Night Live, whether or not you consider it still funny, is going through a great period. Ratings are fairly high coming off of the writers' strike. The show is riding the Democratic nomination race wave pretty well, featuring either Clinton, Obama, or both in at least one sketch per episode. Due to their recent successes, it makes sense that SNL's comedians want to branch out into movies like they successfully did in the 90s with Wayne's World. Baby Mama serves as one of these movies, featuring Tina Fey and Amy Poehler at the helm and at least two more members from the SNL team in the background, namely Will Forte and Fred Armisen. Steve Martin, a frequent SNL host, can also be found in this movie. After reading the character list, it's clear where the SNL comparisons and references come from.",/review/rw3395823/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2008,C-Younkin,7," Tina Fey is hot!
","""Baby Mama"" is Tina Fey's first lead film role. It's well-deserved after her work on ""Mean Girls"" and ""30 Rock"", and she, along with co-star and former SNL cast mate Amy Poehler, do a really nice job of anchoring this one. Fey plays Kate Holbrook, a successful businesswoman who also happens to be a struggling single one. At 37, Kate decides it's time to try and have a child on her own, but her plans are smashed when she finds out there is only a small chance that she can actually become pregnant. With no other option, Kate finds an unlikely surrogate in Angie (Amy Poehler), a trashy and low-rent girl who could really use the money. After learning that Angie is pregnant, Kate begins baby-prepping. Only what she doesn't expect is the arrival of a pregnant Angie at her door with no place to go.",/review/rw3395823/?ref_=tt_urv

","To be gifted with the ability to make people laugh is an honor, and with films, script writers can't know for sure what will evoke an uproar from the audience. A lot of times things are a hit in miss with humor. I'm not saying this movie isn't funny, because i did laugh. However, i didn't laugh as hard as i thought i would. The lack of giggles this movie inspired in me is enough to provoke me to label this movie as a letdown. It's not that this movie is bad, or an awful way to spend an evening. It's that movies are an art-form and there is no art to be found. I think a movie is great if two days later you're still actively trying to find someone to talk about it with. i was ready for the movie to end twenty minutes before the credits rolled.",/review/rw3395823/?ref_=tt_urv

Through this Kate meets the rather less classy Angie and an agreement is struck however, as Kate's doorman Oscar knowingly observes, you cannot have a baby mama without baby mama drama.",/review/rw3395823/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2021,jboothmillard,5," Baby Mama
","I recognised the title of this film because of one of the leading actresses in it, and I'd had it recorded on VHS for a few years, so I was glad when I finally got the time to watch it. Basically, successful single businesswoman Kate Holbrook (Tina Fey) is a vice president for Philadelphia food retailer Round Earth. She has always put her career before her personal life, but now in her late thirties, she finally decides she wants to have a child. But she is disheartened when she discovers her chances of conceiving are low due to her uterus being T-shaped. She is also denied the chance to adopt, so the only option available is to find a surrogate. Chaffee Bicknell (Sigourney Weaver) is a surrogacy agent, who herself has defied the odds and had children during her elder years. The woman Chaffee matches her up with is working class Angie Ostrowiski (Amy Poehler) from South Philadelphia. The implantation is successful, and Angie does become pregnant, doorman Oscar (Romany Malco) refers to her as the ""Baby Mama"". Kate has a well-organised strategy and starts reading childcare books, baby-proofing the apartment, and researching top pre-schools. Kate also tries to control Angie, including eating healthily, but Angie is immature and obnoxious. They are a clash of personalities as they struggle their way through preparation for the baby's arrival. There is also the arrival of Angie's no-good husband Carl (Dax Shepard), which adds to some tensions. It is also revealed that the in-vitro fertilisation procedure was unsuccessful, Angie is faking her pregnancy, including fake bouts of vomiting, and using an inflatable stomach pump for a baby bump. But she is surprised when they go to an ultrasound, and Angie is pregnant for real. Angie and Carl talk in private; it is revealed that they are separated and that they are only in this surrogacy for the money, and they will run off following payment. It turns out that the baby is from Carl's sperm, not from one of Kate's eggs. Meanwhile, Kate is developing a romantic relationship with juice bar owner and former corporate lawyer Rob Ackerman (Greg Kinnear), only the second romance in her life. Angie feels guilty for lying to Kate about her surrogacy intentions and getting pregnant and confesses at Kate's baby shower. Kate explains to Angie that the pregnancy test was supposed to be taken two weeks after the procedure, so the baby could still belong to her, but a wedge is driven between the two women. A court hearing determines that the baby is Angie's, and Angie apologises to Kate. They meet face to face following the hearing, and Angie's water breaks. Kate rushes her to the hospital and passes out during the birth. When Kate wakes, the doctor supervising Angie's pregnancy tells Kate that she's two months pregnant, the result of her relationship with Rob. After this news, Kate visits Angie, holding her new-born baby girl, Stef, named after Gwen Stefani. Kate forgives Angie and the two become best friends, ultimately changing each other for the better. A year later, Angie and Kate have a sisterly-like friendship and have gathered with friends to celebrate Stef's first birthday. Kate and Rob have a baby daughter and are engaged, and Carl has not reunited with Angie, but is taking parenting classes and staying close to her daughter. Also starring Steve Martin as Barry Waterman, Maura Tierney as Caroline, Kate sister, Holland Taylor as Rose Holbrook, Kate's mother, James Rebhorn as Judge, Denis O'Hare as Dr. Manheim, Will Forte as Scott, and Men in Black's Siobhan Fallon Hogan as Birthing Teacher. Fey as the career savvy singleton with her biological clock ticking and wanting motherhood is good, Poehler does well as the slightly annoying trailer trash woman who just scoffs and snacks whilst carrying a potential child, Weaver is alright, and Martin has a weird ponytail hairdo. This is an interesting take on the expectant mother story, it is easy to follow and there are some moments that will cause a snigger, it is predictable in parts, but a fun enough romantic comedy.

","This was a surprisingly funny comedy given the premise. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler worked well together in the leads, as Fey is a career-driven woman who finally decides she wants a baby;unfortunately, her doctor informs her that her uterus isn't the right shape for it. After exploring other options (including adoption), she decides to go with the surrogate route, and Amy Poehler agrees. Unfortunately, she is a white-trash loser (with equally bad common law husband Dax Sheppard aboard), and they are more interested in scamming her. Surprises abound. Greg Kinnear and Steve Martin offer surprisingly good supporting roles in this good comedy that I recommend. Even the cover box is funny! Stay with it to the ending credits.

","Amy Poehler is very funny and deserves far better than this weak, generic ""comedy."" Tina Fey is pretty much hot and cold, sometimes funny, but usually very annoying with her smug, self- satisfied delivery of every line. The movie's story is pretty well conveyed in the trailer and there aren't many surprises left beyond the predictable odd-couple set-up. Hell, even the poster tells you all you need to know about the plot. A lot of decent actors turn up in supporting roles, including many familiar faces from SNL, but NONE of them get big laughs or even make for a memorable scene. The last half-hour or so is completely laugh-free as it makes attempt to bring the two main characters closer together, and puts us to sleep in the process.",/review/rw3395823/?ref_=tt_urv
