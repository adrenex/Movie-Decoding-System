18 February 2009,TheLittleSongbird,10," Deliciously dark; much better than the book!
","I absolutely love this movie. It is dark, funny, charming and brooding, and captures the essence of the book perfectly. By the way, I love the book as well, and consider Roald Dahl one of the finest authors of children's books, look at the BFG for evidence. The whole film is beautifully photographed, looking lush and crisp. Mara Wilson gives a very spirited performance as Matilda. Sure she's not the same as Quentin Blake's illustrations, but I preferred the changes. Danny Devito and Rhea Perlman were great as the parents. As for Miss Honey, I have never seen Embeth Davidtz look so lovely, and that's the truth. Indisputetably, the acting honours go to Pam Ferris as the tyrannical Miss Trunchball. I have never seen that side of Pam Ferris, and in real life, she is not as ugly as they made her. The Bruce Bogtrotter scene was enough to make you feel sick for a week, and you don't feel that in the book. The added scenes like in Magnus's house was a nice touch, and I also loved how dark Devito made it, mixing a bit of humour too. And the music score is superb. Check it out! 10/10.

4 June 2004,ArizWldcat,9," One of our favorite family movies
",My daughters (ranging from age 9-16) have loved this movie for several years. I am normally a very sensitive person and wasn't disturbed by the macabre tone of the movie. Somehow the movie remains upbeat as Matilda is able to find someone who will love her even though her parents don't appreciate her. Young Mara Wilson shines as Matilda. Each time I watch this I am amazed at her talents at such a young age. I haven't heard of her making any films lately...I hope this is by her own choice. ,/review/rw3634690/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 1999,Indy-52,," the best ""family movie"" i've ever seen!
","personally, i hate nauseatingly cute family movies, but this movie is great! I went to see it in the theatre because i had read the book, but i thought that it wouldn't even come close to it. But you know what? I enjoyed this movie more than the novel! I thought it wouldn't be faithful to the book and that it would have turned out to be one of those typical kids' movies, but there's nothing ""cute"" about mrs. Trunchbull! This has got to be one of my favorite films ever and it IS the best childrens' movie ever made. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who has his heart in the right place!",/review/rw3634690/?ref_=tt_urv

28 May 2021,mrashtastic89,10," One of the best family films
","It captures the essence of heartwarming fun with heartwarming humor, but I guess anything with Danny DeVito in it is going to be good, (besides Jumanji: The Next Level). He's a legend and we were lucky to have him.",/review/rw3634690/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2002,Inliten,9," Americanized, but still good
","One of my most highly-anticipated films, 'Matilda' is both a treat and a disappointment. The casting of Mara Wilson as the title character is ingenious - the little girl exudes the qualities set forth in Roald Dahl's classic. Unfortunately, the filmmakers apparently could not resist the urge to alter the book, in which Matilda is British and lives in a small village. The movie version, of course, depicts Matilda as American, but what's worse, that she lives in a larger area. This detracts somewhat from the bucolic setting of the book, although not enough to create a starkly different environment.",/review/rw3634690/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2004,simon-trek,," ""A wonderful and partly scary adaption of Roald Dahl's classic novel""

31 May 2005,J_Leatherwood,9," Best Roald Dahl adaptation
","I believe this film best represents the themes behind Roald Dahl's rather subversive children's literature. It follows the continuity of both ""The Witches"" and ""James and the Giant Peach,"" casting repulsive Trunchbull into the roles of Grand High Witch and repulsive evil aunt, with a bit of the ogre (especially during the chase in Magnus House).",/review/rw3634690/?ref_=tt_urv

16 October 2017,chimera3,10," Cruelty Has No Age Limit
","As a kid, I was always the misunderstood outcast who was far different than everyone else. I was teased and bullied because I was slightly overweight and I had intelligence that had others feel intimidated. Ever since then, I have been drawn to movies where the victim gets revenge on his/her attackers in ingenious ways. For as long as I can remember, I have always been a big fan of ""Matilda"" and it is something that I would recommend to anyone who has troubles with bullies in school.",/review/rw3634690/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2016,Hitchcoc,9," Remarkable Off the Wall Dahl
","I love this movie and look forward to seeing the Broadway production next year. Mara Wilson is such a precocious little star. I generally dislike kid actors but could watch her forever. Roald Dahl brings us a host of quirky characters who are often symbols of a society that isn't much fun for kids. Danny Devito and Rhea Perlman are Matilda's dysfunctional parents who treat her like dirt. She has two gifts: and indomitable spirit and telekinesis. She finally is allowed to go to school, but the school she attends is a nightmare where Miss Trunchbull, an ex-hammer throwing Olympian is in charge. She abuses the children physically and mentally. Eventually, it's going to come down to Matilda and this woman. Matilda enlists her teacher, Miss Honey, who finally gives her the things she needs, love and respect. Of course, Miss Honey is going to pay a price for her aid to the little girl.",/review/rw3634690/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2004,seanbone23,10," What a wonderful film - Not Dull for DAHL
","""I'm smart your dumb, I'm big your little, I'm right your wrong and there's nothing you can do about it!"" What a catchphrase Â– I could use that on my brother sometime but anyhow this was an influence on Matilda that made her strong and prepared her for her turbulent time ahead at school, especially with a nasty head teacher 'Miss Trunchbull'. Roald Dahl had written this book to show that a small girl like Matilda can show courage and get herself out of a bad situation, once the film had been made, everything I can remember from the book was alive with a sweet girl to a lazy Mum and Dad (played by Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman). I give this film 10/10.",/review/rw3634690/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2022,filipemanuelneto,9," An excellent family comedy with some social criticism in the mix.
","The film is one of the most famous family comedies of the 1990s, adapting for the screen the story of the same name by Roald Dahl, where a girl, who was born into an idiotic family unable to understand her, decides to win the right to go to school and to learn, which their parents do not value. However, at school, she comes across a cruel and sadistic headmistress who will become her biggest adversary, while her teacher becomes her best friend.",/review/rw3634690/?ref_=tt_urv

4 May 2020,blott2319-1,8," Funny and wholesome for the whole family
","Matilda is a brilliant example of how to adapt a kids' book while still keeping it entertaining for adults. That's always a little easier with Roald Dahl books, since he uses some adult elements in his stories, but Nicholas Kazan and Robin Swicord did a great job of adapting that book to make a solid movie for young and old. The movie has the exaggerated style you expect from a story for young children. The villains are so villainous that in the real world they would be imprisoned within minutes, and the heroes are so virtuous they become the ideal of what we all would like to be ourselves. In the real world, there's no way someone as kind as Miss Honey would ever work in a school that allowed the students to be abused so much, but in the imagination of a child this makes sense. Because of the way the story is told, it provides a lot of humor that I think holds up even for adults. The over-the-top vileness of Matilda's parents is also fodder for many laughs. Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman are so great at playing neglectful and uncaring, but in a ridiculous way that I can't imagine any real human would behave. The lectures they give to get their daughter to stop reading and watch more TV are hilarious.",/review/rw3634690/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2009,bkoganbing,7," Amazing Little Girl

16 October 2006,ccthemovieman-1,7," Exaggerated Characters
","This is essentially a story geared for children, with a familiar theme that the kid is smarter than any adult, which has gotten tiresome in the last decade or two. Here, though, you can't take any of this seriously because everything is exaggerated so much it's like a pure fantasy-comedy story. Author Roald Dahl, as he did with Willy Wonka, liked to create exaggerated characters.",/review/rw3634690/?ref_=tt_urv

","Watching this with all my family friends together on Netflix was a great time we were all in our teens but I had a great time watching this when I was six years old and as a twelve year old. This movie has a nice plot and feels like a great adaptation of Ronald's book, the cast is believable, the comedy and the mother daughter relationship between Matilda and her teacher is even better. The principal antagonist is an iconic fat villain that I really liked with how great her acting was. The theme of adoption and the treatment of kids that aren't yours really was heartfelt and an important lesson.",/review/rw3634690/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2017,lisafordeay,6," One of my childhood favorites growing up
",Former child star and Mrs Doubtfire star Mara Wilson stars in this family fantasy where she plays the main characther Matilda who isn't like much kids. She loves reading books and has telepathic powers. Her parents loathe her and she goes to school ran by a rough looking woman played by Pam Ferris (who is so unrecognizable BTW)who happens to be the principal in her school. Matilda of course loves her teacher Miss Honey played by Bicentennial Man's Embeth Davidtz who is hiding a secret from Matilda? Turns out she is the step daughter of Miss Trunchenbull and like Matilda her stepmom(which was Ferris's character BTW) didn't love Miss Honey and she felt the same way like Matilda with her family.,/review/rw3634690/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2005,TxMike,," A slightly exaggerated tale of a little girl not appreciated by her family.
","Matilda (Mara Wilson) was just born into the wrong family. Her dad is a crook in the used auto business, and her mother lives in her own little world where nothing is more important than herself. Matilda goes to the most depressing school run by the most Nazi-like Principal anywhere, but has the nicest teacher anyone could want. This movie is the tale of this little girl and her teacher, and how they helped each other to achieve happiness. Not to be taken too seriously, mostly a fun comedy where we can cheer when the bad guys get what is coming to them. The filming technique uses lots of wide angle close up shots, which distorts features, especially of the bad guys.",/review/rw3634690/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 1999,Rumples,7," Fun for young and old
","Unlike so many ""kid's"" movies, this is a film that can be watched and enjoyed by adults too. An amusing fantasy drawn from the work of a master author, this tale provides young girls with a true hero. Definitely worth a watch with your kids - they understand what 'fantasy' means in film-making, even if the adults can't seperate it from reality. 7/10",/review/rw3634690/?ref_=tt_urv
