6 May 2015,anaconda-40658,1," Lightning Didn't Strike Here.
","Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief (2010): Dir: Chris Columbus / Cast: Logan Lerman, Brandon T. Jackson, Alexandra Daddario, Jake Abel, Sean Bean: Pathetic juvenile showcase about teenage Percy who learns that he is the son of the Ocean god Poseidon. When Zeus's lightning bolt is stolen, it is up to Percy to retrieve it before Hades captures it. Perhaps he should check the lost and found first. Director Chris Colubus had success with the first two Harry Potter films but this is a terrible joke and perhaps the worst contraption he ever stuck his name on. Logan Lerman as Percy does his best but falters with the rest of the cast due to stupid situations. Brandon T. Jackson plays Grover, his half goat protector. Yes, I too was half expecting the furry blue monster from Sesame Street since that is the mentality of the material but we are left with this half wit instead. Alexandra Daddario plays the feisty female warrior who ends up in a lame romantic tease in the conclusion. She will dislike Percy at first but before the conclusion of the third act it will be hinted that she will likely bang him in time. Jake Abel plays Hades son whose motives are obvious. It is pretty bad when the children of these powerful beings cannot get along, as if this was some sort of hand-me-down family business proposition. There are numerous celebrity cameos by actors who will not likely wish to maintain association with this junk. Sean Bean plays Zeus but he is never as fitting as Laurence Olivier was in Clash of the Titans. Despite its inventive special effects, this film should be struck by lightning. Score: 1 / 10",/review/rw6722244/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2020,logeesp,5," Entertaining, but doesn't stick to the source material
","The Percy Jackson books were some of my favorite books growing up, and when a movie came out, I couldn't wait to see it. However, the film stays as far away from the source material as possible, which makes me wonder why the heck this movie was made.",/review/rw6722244/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2010,TheLittleSongbird,8," Am I the only person that actually liked this film?
","I have to admit it, I haven't read the book, but regardless of whether it was faithful or not, this rarely ruins a movie or TV adaptation for me. That said, I can understand the disappointment of those who loved the book. However, I really enjoyed this film, it is hardly the best movie I have ever seen, but I personally consider it one of the better movies of 2010 that I've seen so far, and that is saying a lot considering how disappointing some of the movies have been.",/review/rw6722244/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2010,ssallazzar,1," Most ridiculous script ever...
",It rarely happens that i go at the cinema and see a movie that i hoped to be good and entertaining and leave not only with disappointment but actually furious that i was tricked by this movie's trailer to waste my money on the ticket and 2 hours of my time.,/review/rw6722244/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2010,griffolyon12,4," It Numbed My Mind Raw
","I've never been a big fan of Greek mythology, so based upon that criteria I've never been a big fan of movies about the subject. Though I have grown to be pretty fond of the book series, Percy Jackson and the Olympians. I was astounded at how well Greek mythology was interwoven into the modern day culture as author Rick Riordan told a rip-roaring adventure tale, filled with humor, mystery, and tons of action. Like all things successful, Hollywood likes to get in the game, so it's no surprise that a film has been made of the first of the Percy Jackson books, The Lightning Thief. The film, Percy Jackson and the Olympians - The Lightning Thief, seems to have lost something in the translation, winding up as a film that really only shares the name of the book and nothing else.",/review/rw6722244/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2010,buckeysooz,1," Chris Columbus should be ashamed!!!!
","When this movie first arrived in trailers, I like so many adults, who have become fans through our children was excited. We could overlook Pierce Brosnan playing Chiron which gets both the age and nature of the character wrong. We could overlook the character of Percy obviously being older than the books stated age of twelve, however almost everything else was so far removed from the books that have become so popular including storyline, that this movie should not even be allowed to carry the ""based on the books"" tag. The characters were completely miscast, the storyline was a weak abominational blend of books one and two..... kind of..!",/review/rw6722244/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2010,emiele4,1," Did they even read the book? Worst Movie of the YEAR! If not Ever!
","The first question I must ask myself is if Chris Columbus can even read... Because obviously he never read the books. Well maybe he read the back cover summary, its the only reference to the book in the movie. ",/review/rw6722244/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2010,laurieclooney,2," Nothing like the book!!
","Last night I took my 2 daughters and a friends to see the movie. All of the girls had read all the books in the series (including me) and had been anticipating the release of the movie for over a year. The book is fabulous!! I taught 4th grade for 4 years and read it to all my Language Arts classes every year. I never had a student not like the book. It contains humor, action, friendship themes, and characters that contain quite a bit of depth and growth throughout the 5 books in the series.",/review/rw6722244/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2022,Laura_Ratings,6," Good movie but not true to the books
","If you don't think too much about how it's not true to the books, the movie is actually quite entertaining. Logan Lerman is a great actor and a great Percy, but he was definitely too old for the character.",/review/rw6722244/?ref_=tt_urv

8 February 2010,DICK STEEL,7," A Nutshell Review: Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief
","I guess you know the drill already. With the Lord of the Rings making Hollywood studios go into a frenzy in adapting the many fantasy books out there, not everything Tinseltown touched turned to box office gold, and more often than not, save for that famous boy wizard, what could have been pilots of franchises, became no more than false starts. I suppose it goes to show that a solid story is still fundamental, other than making yet another special effects extravaganza to try and wow a growingly jaded audience.",/review/rw6722244/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2010,ProScrybed,4," Good Idea, Rashly Executed
","The premise of this movie - that Greek gods were real and have offspring in the modern world - is interesting. But the execution of this idea felt very rushed in this movie. I haven't read the book, so can't judge where the blame lies for this.",/review/rw6722244/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2010,claudio_carvalho,7," For Fans of Naive Fantasy Genre
","When his lightning bolt is stolen, Zeus (Sean Bean) accuses Poseidon's son Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman) and gives ten days to Poseidon (Kevin McKidd) to return his lightning bolt; otherwise he would initiate a war against his brother. Meanwhile the dyslexic and with ADHD teenager Percy is visiting The Museum of Metropolitan of Art and is attacked by a Fury disguised in his teacher. His crippled best friend Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) reveals that Percy is a demigod and he is his protector and his teacher Mr. Brunner (Pierce Brosnan) gives a pen to him telling that it is a powerful weapon. They go to Percy's house and together with his mother Sally (Catherine Keener), they drive to the Camp Half-Blood. However Sally is attacked by a Minotaur and vanishes before Percy can help her. In the camp, Percy befriends the gorgeous Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario); when they are attacked by Hades (Steve Coogan) that wants the lighting bolt for him, Percy discovers that his mother is in hell with Hades. Percy decides to travel in a dangerous quest to retrieve the lightning bolt and save his mother. However, Grover and Annabeth join him and Luke (Jake Abel) gives a powerful shield of his own to protect Percy. ",/review/rw6722244/?ref_=tt_urv

19 March 2010,ula_teava,1," Bad movie, in every way!!!
","When i first saw the trailer for this movie i automatically knew it would not be a masterpiece but more of a funner, more action packed harry potter, and yet i had a feeling that a nice afternoon spent on going to see this movie would be a relaxing experience.Well I could not have been more wrong.",/review/rw6722244/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2010,napierslogs,7," A fast, wild ride through Greek mythology where I got to be a demi-god for 2 hours
","The trailers attracted me to ""Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief"" because like Percy Jackson, I too am drawn to water and feel it's the only place where I can think. Although the difference is, he's a demi-god, I am not. But this is the type of movie that allows you to dream.",/review/rw6722244/?ref_=tt_urv

22 February 2010,orankimanki,1," Greek mythology goes Hollywood.
","I'm speechless. Truly speechless. If there is a bottom in modern day movies, it lies within the abominable pile of feces that is Percy Jackson the lightning thief. Enter America through the coughed up hair ball that is Percy Jackson (aka. Zac Efron #2), as his immoral adventures lead us through every known America-promoting scene, cliché and famous American destination (need I remind that we are dealing with Greek mythology). I didn't know Olympus resided on the top of the empire state building, or that the underworld was accessible through under the widely known landmark that is the Hollywood sign... This movie has as many flaws as acting careers it will namely destroy. This is what happens when you throw too much money at a dog with rabies and expect it to direct a movie. The leftover money that was thrown at this movie could surely feed the entire world for a century. I'm not sure if I should blame the book, or the movie, for it's inconsistent and illogical storyline. The acting is bad. The characters are shallow and predictable. The editing is horrible, just an example of a scene where Percy's mother is about to tell the truth to Percy about his father, outside being dusk, and then the scene cutting to night time, where she begins the actual explaining. The editors have clearly not watched the movie a second time to bother with flaws, who can blame them, I wouldn't. If you want to have a good laugh with your friends about the movies anus of a presentation, I recommend it. If you want to watch an interesting fantasy adventure about Greek mythology combined with present day, go read a history book and make movie about it with your cellphone cam and toilet paper as a script, and I guarantee you will gain more satisfaction than you would receive from this diarrhea of a movie.",/review/rw6722244/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2010,Angelafterglow,5," I Suposse It's Chris Columbus Fault!!!
","OK, so where to start? I had like the biggest expectations for Percy Jackson's first movie,I for one loved the book, and thought that it would be a great movie based on the trailers but WOW was I gonna get a surprise.",/review/rw6722244/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2010,nic-b-2108,7," Meh....
","I recently read the book series (out of boredom), so I saw this film today with my friend. Firstly, it is quite different from the book. A major part of the storyline was completely left out (or even discarded), some parts were removed, and random parts added that did nothing for the storyline whatsoever. The beginning of the movie felt rather rushed, and hearing the 'whhaat?' from my friend confirmed the fact that they don't really explain things much in the first place. Anyone who might've recently studied Greek mythology or like to read about it as a general interest..it might make more sense to. Otherwise, it would seem a little random.",/review/rw6722244/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2021,maxmages,," It's absolutely sickening
","It took me three tries to watch this movie and I've only just finished halfway through it. Actually, I want to give every film a fair chance and it's actually not my way of not watching a film to the end and still evaluating it, but I think if I have voluntarily decided to watch a film and then I revise this decision again in the meantime so much so that I break off the film then that speaks volumes then that is also a form of criticism normally I always fight my way through but when I eat a burger that is half eaten and because it tastes so gross despite my hunger I myself to decide not to continue eating it is also a form of criticism that the fish ordered and the meat given has a reason to complain.",/review/rw6722244/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2012,Rectangular_businessman,2," Lame Harry Potter wannabe
","After the commercial success of those ""Harry Potter"" films, there have been many adaptations of other literary works, most of them being aimed to kids and teenagers. Some were good, others were just merely watchable, and others were quite boring and dull, like for example, ""Eragon"", all the ""Twilight films"" and this one.",/review/rw6722244/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2013,fast-giga,1," Logic errors to the max
","I haven't read the book and watch this movie only on TV. I can't agree with all critics. There are many things about this movie which are not terrible. Its obviously a movie for children. The child actors are not extremely terrible and the effects are also not terrible, the famous actors play even acceptable...thats about it. The story and the behaviour of all characters is just ridiculous. If you really pay attention and don't shut of your brain completely you will experience logic flaws all over the movie. If you haven't heard anything about Greek mythology you may be able to overlook some of them.",/review/rw6722244/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2010,nearmiss,6," A bit of a disappointment
","My family went to see the movie ""Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief"" today. All of us have read the books and are big fans. I do think it's interesting the comments made about how this movie is a ripoff from Harry Potter. If you actually read the book, the movie was nothing like it. I'd say it wasn't a bad way to spend a few hours. My family liked it, at no time was I wondering how long we'd been in the theatre.

20 March 2021,motorio,2," Percy Jackson and the not-at-all Olympians
","This is an insult to the greek mythology. For a movie claiming that not showering tricks the gods,maybe 5,9 is a bit of a stretch... Unless the ancient greek gods are bunnies, the number of demi-gods in this movie is unacceptable. Why the hell Afrodite's daughters wear only bikinis, why Athena's daughter's name is Annabeth, who let the minotaur out of the labyrinth? Hades is not the Devil, he does not have horns and wings. This may shock you but all stars were not a thing in ancient Greece. There was NO hell in greek mythology. Satyres are not goats they do not eat soda cans. Percy Jackson as a greek demi-god has the power to take greek words and turn them into English words. Lotus is not weed. No hell , so no hellhounds...",/review/rw6722244/?ref_=tt_urv
