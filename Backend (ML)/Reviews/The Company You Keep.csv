","At last a detective show that feels realistic. A flawed detective, but very tough with great instinct. You can keep Frankie Drake and Miss Fisher, this rocks.",/review/rw6871102/?ref_=tt_urv

",I really liked Stumptown and am disappointed it won't be returning.,/review/rw6871102/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2020,triggergotstuffed,8," What to do during coronavirus time...
","Finally had a chance to watch Stumptown season I and now understand what all the fuss was about.
I already knew the cast and I think the actor I enjoyed seeing the most was Camryn Manheim of my old fave, The Practice. The rest of the cast was wonderful, including the guests throughout the first season. This series offers a wide variety of genres in a single series. Great action, comedy, drama, episodic and very good writing.",/review/rw6871102/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2020,tlawrenceintel,10," I love Dex!
","This show rocks! Dex is very human and accessible. The story arcs are realistic. She is fallable and completely flawed. All are reasons that I love her. She loves her afflicted brother, she follows her heart- white, black, gay straight-out it doesn't matter. One of the best shows this year. Hands down!",/review/rw6871102/?ref_=tt_urv

25 March 2021,stianhjelle,10," Bring it back!
",Bring it back! All the good show are being cancel way to soon because of low ratings on mainstream tv. People are streaming when they want to and have time! Get a new system!,/review/rw6871102/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2020,SnoopyStyle,7," damage and sass
","Dex Parios (Cobie Smulders) is a hard talking, hard drinking, hard gambling, troubled war vet, private investigator in Portland, Oregon. She drives a crappy car and cares for her mentally challenged brother. She owes money to casino owner Sue Lynn Blackbird (Tantoo Cardinal). Sue also happens to be the disapproving mother of her late love of her life. Her friend Grey McConnell (Jake Johnson) owns a bar. Detective Miles Hoffman (Michael Ealy) and Lieutenant Cosgrove (Camryn Manheim) are Portland police. Artie Banks (Donal Logue) is an amoral PI.",/review/rw6871102/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2020,sarahbeth-19788,9," WHY IS THIS CANCELLED?!
","Why do all the normal/funny shows get cancelled but we can watch The Simpsons for yet another decade along with other stupid cartoons. There's Naked & Afraid (more boring than anything), TONS of depressing Cop/Military/Investigator shows...I swear every time we like a new, creative, action/drama show it gets cancelled! Then our country wonders why our people are either depressed, violent, or lack common sense. Well here you go! (And yes I am aware not everything I list may be on this channel. It's a general comment. )",/review/rw6871102/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2020,RBENDERB,10," what gives ABC? STUMPTOWN show should live on...
","THIS IS A TRAVESTY,ONE OF BEST SHOWS CANCELLED, hopefully NETFLIX will pick it up,CAST is excellent,characters are engaging and episodes are great,I was shocked when I heard about the cancellation..please return this show to TV.",/review/rw6871102/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2020,andimc,8," WHY THE HARSH REVIEWS?
","Listen, if you are looking for a complex and edge of the seat drama then maybe this isn't for you. If you like a bit of light hearted and entertaining detective drama, with likeable characters then definitely go for it. I enjoyed it and will carry on watching it.",/review/rw6871102/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2019,nancyldraper,8," Good start
","(Initial impression) This was the new show I was most interested in. Fortunately, the pilot was so much better than the promos. Codie Smulders is the draw and she fills out the role. The writing is full of wit and thrills. The supporting cast was a pleasant surprise. I'm going to enjoy this. I give this a 7.5 (good start) out of 10. {PI Drama}",/review/rw6871102/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2019,fatelovesthefearless,7," Worth it for the soundtrack alone
",I must say I didn't expect to like this show as much as I do. It's refreshing to see a show about someone who is damaged and self destructive yet cares a lot about other people.,/review/rw6871102/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2020,lynnkuznia,10," Finally CHARACTERS Worth Watching
","This is beyond normal American TV in that the characters are flawed, yet likeable. I am a fan of British TV characters as they are rarely put together, but get the job done. This moves beyond the normal gender bias ""save the girl"" nonsense we normally see. Dex is strong and flawed. A welcome reprieve and good writing.",/review/rw6871102/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2020,niini-70196,," Why!??
",I have only one question Why they cancelled the show ??,/review/rw6871102/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2020,casiann,10," It has a great cast, writing, directing and soundtrack
","I can't believe this only has 7.5 stars. More people need to watch this show! It's fun, edgy, funny and heartbreaking. Well rounded show. You won't regret watching it!",/review/rw6871102/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2020,daria-61824,10," Riveting

25 November 2019,MissCzarChasm,10," Not for Under Rock Dwellers
","I love seeing reviews by tiny misogynistic men who get their panties in wads over the color of leads in TV shows, or by fact that women in real life actually fill roles far from making them their baby bottles. I mean really, grow up already. Progress will never stop. In the history of the world, progress wins, 100% of the time. Period. The mewling you hear from those relegated to crying about ""PC BS"" and how Disney and all of Hollywood hurts their feelings, is just the death throes of regressives withering away.",/review/rw6871102/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2020,pacod1976nl,9," Entertaining show
","Watched the first 14 episodes in 1 weekend en must say I found the series to be very entertaining. Dex is a very likeable character, but als the other actors I found likeable. The action is fun and the gritty humor is fun.",/review/rw6871102/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2019,atlasmb,10," A Private Eye Series That Keeps it Light and Likable
","Something about the television ads made me not want to see this new series. But I watched anyway, probably because of the casting. Cobie Smulders (""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"") plays Dex Parios, a flawed and world-weary protagonist like others we have seen. We learn very quickly that she is observant, ex-military, tormented by PTSD, broke, promiscuous, and plagued by addictions, like gambling and drinking. She lives with her brother, who has Down syndrome and adores her.",/review/rw6871102/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2019,jtags-84059,8," Great series so far
",Up to the 5th episode and I have to say I am enjoying this series immensely. Smulders is doing a great job as the lead and is well supported by a cast of characters that hold this show together nicely. Well written stories with flawed but very likable characters in this unconventional PI series. Very entertaining and I would definitely recommend this.,/review/rw6871102/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2019,T2TLED,8," Loved it!
",Solid pilot. Interesting character angles and Cobie shines!,/review/rw6871102/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2019,Elewis1195,9," Nice fun first episode. Entertaining.
","I'm not sure where the show will go from here and it is a one woman show, make no mistake. There's no 2nd character that stands out even a little, though the intimidating casino boss isn't bad.",/review/rw6871102/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2019,bairjohn,8," Nice start...
","What I really like was that the women got her butt kicked, after a decent fight. There is a lot to absorb, but this could go either way. If they keep some sense of realism it might stay interesting, but if it goes all superwoman outside of the abilities they have already set for her then it will get old quick.",/review/rw6871102/?ref_=tt_urv
