",I remember when this came out and how much it freaked people out. Could we really be living in such a surveillance state? Could the government really be monitoring us whenever they want?,/review/rw3179351/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2020,Muhammad_Rafeeq,10," Still today one of the best movies I have ever seen ( A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10
","People who don't care about government surveillance will find the movie boring. For everyone else it's a paranoid thriller with an important message. Is there any greater power then the ability to spy on anyone at anytime? ""Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.""Exhilarating and entertaining, Enemy of the State is a topical chase thriller that provides the audience with solid escapism and a thought-provoking narrative inspired by Francis Ford Coppola's timeless classic The Conversation.",/review/rw3179351/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2007,baumer,9," Vastly underrated
","Conspiracy theorists who enjoy films like JFK and Conspiracy Theory will have a lot to enjoy with Enemy of the State. For a film that came out almost 10 years ago, it seems just slightly ahead its time. I don't remember everything about 1998, but I do know that things like DVD was in it's nascent stages and although the internet has been part of our vernacular for almost 20 years now, the technology prevalent back in 98 as opposed to now is light years apart. And in the post 911 days, having the idea of our privacy abolished is pretty much upon us. Maybe not to the extent perpetuated in this film, but we are pretty much under Big Brother's watchful eye all the time. When you walk into a bank, a restaurant, a convenience store or any public place, you are photographed and recorded and your image can be recalled with a simple enough click of a button. Even today when you call places like phone company's or pizza parlours you hear a recorded message that says this call may be recorded for quality purposes. We are being watched and kept tabs on everywhere we go and in everything we do. In this vein, Enemy of the State is a marvel. It is a film way ahead of it's time. No one could foresee the tragedy of 911, but now that it is part of our history books, films like The Siege and this one are that much more clairvoyant.",/review/rw3179351/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2001,bob the moo,," Good thriller - Hackman makes it
","Sucessful lawyer Robert Dean is passed information by an old friend without noticing. Seconds later that friend is killed and Dean is targeted by a group within the Government who wish to cover up a conspiracy involving the murder of a congressman. With the Government's full weight of surveillance equipment brought to bear Dean turns to ex-NSA agent Brill to help protect him, find the information and get it out into the open.",/review/rw3179351/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2020,UniqueParticle,10," Excellent action/thriller!
","Love this Tony Scott conspiracy theory film! Glad I own Enemy of the state, it's exhilarating and has a great cast! Thought provoking types are my jam lots of ins and outs involved. FBI tracking people is always intriguing in movies especially in the vein of Tony Scott; he's done a lot of wildly entertaining projects. Extortion scheme thats a unique way to describe part of the story. I absolutely love in this Gene Hackman he's legendary - all around awesome would recommend to anyone!",/review/rw3179351/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2006,pswanson00,9," Whew!
","I don't know how I missed this in theaters, but I watched it for the first time tonight. I almost gave it a 10, because this is as good as the suspense/action drama gets. Somebody on the DVD special features called it ""...a combination of Crimson Tide, The French Connection, and 3 Days of the Condor."" From my list of favorites I'd also say it has aspects of Marathon Man, The Fugitive, and The Firm. Will Smith, whose work does not thrill me 100% of the time, is terrific, and Gene Hackman could not have been better. They also receive support from some great character actors, many of them UNCREDITED (a fact which blew me away). ",/review/rw3179351/?ref_=tt_urv

7 September 1999,TxMike,," Interesting plot, will make you wonder who's watching you!
","Jon Voight, Will Smith, and Gene Hackman are the three stars who make this movie interesting.  Voight is a rogue NSA operative and Smith quite accidentally gets on his trail without even realizing it.  Hackman provides the key to exposing the crooks and facilitating a reasonable ending. Watching this movie makes you wonder how much of the surveillance depicted can really be done today by our governments. Although the movie has its share of violence, and an ending out of Reservoir Dogs, it also is sprinkled with some good humor.  If you like action and espionage, then you'll like this movie.  The DVD picture and soundtrack are both excellent. I give the movie overall 8 of 10.",/review/rw3179351/?ref_=tt_urv

6 December 2003,neilmac,8," Crackerjack Thriller with a message...
","Why?  Well for starters there is the best chase sequence since The French Connection.  Then there is Will Smith as an actor - not just a star, though later in the movie he is admittedly overshadowed by veteran Gene Hackman.",/review/rw3179351/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2020,hitchcockthelegend,9," The government's been in bed with the entire telecommunications industry since the forties. They've infected everything.

5 September 2020,peter_j_l,10," One of the best thrillers ever made and very much ahead of its time.
",This movie was released 1998 and then got critique that is was not that realistic. Now 22 years later we know that this is no science fiction at all. Unfortunately. The movie has stood the the test of time really well - especially since being made 22-23 years ago! Very underrated! Should be way over 8.5 - at least!,/review/rw3179351/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2002,rolfhub,8," I like this one, also beeing somewhat realistic (not in every detail of course).
","Well, I like this one. I like the cast, the visuals are well done, but what is more important is the plot that I like really much. It's not the most sophisticated plot of all times, but I think it's quite good, and to some degree, realistic. Of course it's not possible to move sattelites that quickly, or zoom in on a videotape that much and still have crystal-clear visual, but quite some technology seen is realistic today, or in the near future. This is an hollywood flick, all right, so they have quite much action and everything looks very easy, steering a sattelite seems to be no harder than playing a video game, what makes it all seem a bit unrealistic/sci-fi-like, but today's technical posibilities are quite large, and continue to grow, so informing oneself about the issue (I mean the real world issue) is not a bad idea.",/review/rw3179351/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2020,blott2319-1,8," Solid action-thriller
","Remember the good old days when we used to fear the government and corporations monitoring every aspect of our lives? You know, back before we all started buying devices specifically designed to watch us, track us, and listen in on all our conversations? Enemy of the State almost feels quaint when I watch it now and see those archaic cameras and tracking devices that have been completely replaced by the cell phone almost all of us carry around everywhere we go. That being said, I'm a fan of most man-on-the-run stories, and Tony Scott is a director who knows exactly how to film one. The pace of this film is relentless, as it seems that there are only brief moments when the protagonists are safe, and then the government is on their trail again. Tony Scott films the chase scenes brilliantly so you can't even pause to catch a breath, because there is constant movement. And yet there's a fluidity to the movement as well, so it doesn't completely lose you in a bunch of awkward shaky-cam.",/review/rw3179351/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2017,Leofwine_draca,9," A pulse-pounding suspense thriller
","I watched ENEMY OF THE STATE when it first came out at the cinema a couple of decades ago and remember really enjoying it. Seeing it today, the film has hardly dated at all and in fact feels more relevant than ever in a world dominated by surveillance technology. I think it's a criminally underrated movie that never gets talked about enough, possibly the highlight of Tony Scott's exciting career, and up there with THE BOURNE IDENTITY (which it feels like it inspired a lot) in terms of screen excitement.",/review/rw3179351/?ref_=tt_urv

7 February 2019,heisenberg12,10," A Masterpiece Thriller Ahead of Its Time
","Wow! Talk about a ""thrill ride"". I Highly recommend this movie- it has to be one of the most underrated movies on IMDB and was way ahead of its time. If you saw this in 1998 or 1999, you probably weren't as familiar with the technology and issues at hand, but if you watch it again, you will be able to keep up with the exposition and what it all means. Watch it again is all I can say.",/review/rw3179351/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2007,Panterken,8," One of my favorite action-films ever.
","Enemy Of The State is one of the few movies I went out of my way to see in the theater ( I'm a video-rental guy) and it's indeed a grand action-movie. The big surplus is of course the great messages behind the film. It entails a fear that we all have in some degree, the loss of our privacy. Of course all the Hollywood-elements are present: the returning catchphrases and jokes, the over-dramatic scenes, etc. but Scott never goes too far. The pacing is great and the film's over before you know it even though it has a relatively long run-time( for an action-movie) of 120 min. Will Smith is solid but Gene Hackman is the one who steals the show. It's the first movie I saw that starred him (I was only 10 when the movie came out and I've been a big fan ever since.",/review/rw3179351/?ref_=tt_urv

","In 1998, I was only about seven years old and therefore I couldn't see it in the theaters because of the rating, but my guess is, the entire world got a wake-up call to the horrifying truth about their government. And the thing is, everything that happened in ""Enemy of the State"" is very, very possible of happening. But that's just me thinking, 'cause it was over 11 years ago and and I couldn't remember if I tried. Did this movie do the same thing to the government as ""Jaws"" did to the beaches? Perhaps.",/review/rw3179351/?ref_=tt_urv
