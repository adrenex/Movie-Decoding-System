21 July 2019,ecatalan98,7," Starts off great, but...
","Most of the terrible reviews here are basically for season three, which ultimately ruined the show for good, but few mention that season one was actually good, very good! If it had been just a one-season series it would've been up there with the best of them. It was witty, suspenseful, weird, dramatic, etc. Unfortunately, season 2 takes an unsolicited left
turn. While still featuring some good episodes, the damage was done. When season 3 came out, it was too late, with some of the worst writing ever, featuring some painful plot twists that made no sense at all. It's as if the creators wanted to destroy their show on purpose.",/review/rw3045360/?ref_=tt_urv

14 November 2018,cherold,8," I don't understand why this series attracts so much hate
","I liked Under the Dome right away. It created an interesting mystery, had fairly complex protagonists, and developed an unusual mythology.",/review/rw3045360/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2013,sebpopcorn,," The (ratings) stars are falling...
","I've watched half of this miniseries and so far everything that has happened could easily have been shown in an hour long episode. The dome, which is the reason people are watching this in the first place, barely features. Instead we get a lot of inconsequential stories from characters that are totally unconvincing. There's no sense that this is a story that is going to go anywhere at all. For example the last episode I watched featured 20 minutes of a woman I'd never seen before giving birth.

",Could have given more stars but many a times it was predictable. However director managed to temporarily doubt the prediction through some diversions.,/review/rw3045360/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2015,theromanempire-1,8," Weird with flaws but worth it
","OK this was a weird fantasy series which had nothing to do with king's books but it was an attractive series in which we had plenty of action, fantasy elements and even great love stories and the outcome was very strong as i personally watched the whole series leaving me wanting more.",/review/rw3045360/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2013,politicon2003,7," The Dome Falls
","First of all I rate the pilot episode of 'Under the Dome' as a clear 8.0. I am an admitted avid Stephen King fan and bought a copy of the book in Picton Ontario in January 2011 during the festive season vacation. It is not one of King's best novels but it is far from being his worst. For the horror genre his works are pretty mild and I have never found them spine tingling. In general I like King's works mostly because of his style and the small town characters in them. From such an amazingly prolific writer there are bound to be some duds. I think that the all-time best Stephen King book and mini TV series was the apocalyptic 'The Stand'. Until now the most recent of King's made-for-TV movies I watched and enjoyed (having read the book) was 'Bag of Bones'. I enjoyed 'Under the Dome' as a novel but cannot recall many details, just the general situation and plot. The book version of Under the Dome contains a map of the fictional Maine town of Chester's Mill (most of the Maine locations in Stephen King novels, such as Castle Rock, are fictional. In 'Stand by Me' - aka 'The Body' -Castle Rock is moved to Oregon!) The map of Chester's Mill was helpful in reading the novel to follow where the diverse action was happening outside and inside the dome. Chester's Mill is a small country town. The two North Carolina towns where the series is shot are not unlike Picton itself so I was able to enjoy the book by a blazing fireplace in my son's rambling house and sprawling acres overlooking Maine-like woods and a lake. During the 42 minute of the pilot I watched enthralled. I do not remember enough of the book I read two years ago to tell from the pilot to what extent King may have diverted from his novel but surely the poet himself is the one who is allowed poetic license in such cases. A TV family den audience is different from a one man-reader seated by a fireplace. The action was continuous from the start and the special effects were brilliant (I would not recommend reading the sour puss and nit picking comments on this site). Unlike in many other Stephen King screen works there are no big name film stars but several familiar faces from other TV series and a few young newcomers. Nevertheless, the standard of performance is pretty good. I wonder if King himself will make a cameo appearance in the series as he has often done in others... CBS promises 13 episodes and I am looking forward to all of them purely as light entertainment.",/review/rw3045360/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2015,the_real_smile,5," Time of death: season 3
","I watched all seasons, season 1 was nice. The pace was very slow, but on the edge of tolerable. You could compare it with Lost. The progression of the episodes was logical, how about air, food, water etc? Then season 2 came, some key players disappeared and the book of tricks was necessary to fill in the gaps. This decision did the story not much good. Than season 3 appeared, broke with the first seasons by introducing some sf nonsense and the burden of a artificial created memory. The biggest fail in season 3 however is the introduction of new characters that impossible could have been there all the time. This mixed with the by now stupid story makes you want to skip this series as soon as possible. My advise, watch season 1, try 2 and stop then.",/review/rw3045360/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2019,Lori_ruelo,8," Bustle under the dome!
","The series, Under the Dome, was short-lived but very entertaining. The idea of how to include a handful of people in a dome and then underlie psychological and physical stress, and what they then make of it is very fascinating.
Every individual needs it under this dome. Each has its meaning. Whether it's for good or for bad. It's exciting how people interact with each other.
Actually, it is also clear why it ended in the third season: In the first season comes unexpectedly a dome over a small town and no one knows where it came from. To answer the question you have to go outside, in front of the dome. This will be addressed in the second season. Unfortunately, it gets too fantastic in the last and third seasons.
Extraterrestrials invented this dome and they want to subjugate humanity.
The approach of this idea is fundamentally good, but unfortunately it is implemented too quickly and too confused that it loses its appeal.
Under the Dome is a good series and also excitingly implemented. Unfortunately, the conclusion comes too quickly and is written too easily.",/review/rw3045360/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2013,fathersonholygore,6," The master of anxiety & fear back on TV!
","Stephen King may be one of the absolute best writers at creating a large parade of characters within a town who all have their own little lives, their own little fears, their own secrets and skeletons hiding in the closet. Dean Norris plays Big Jim Rennie, and I'm looking forward to watching him through the series; he is a great actor who is underused, so hopefully we get to see him shine here. I'm interested to see how the acting holds up.",/review/rw3045360/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2013,jimlacy2003,3," As the Stomach Turns, the soap opera version
","If they made the show a mini-series I might be here writing a review giving it at least a 7 or an 8. Instead as I feared they decided to make the ""Under the Dome"" adaption into some contorted series. It is clearly the wrong treatment for such a good story.",/review/rw3045360/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2013,chapy004,10," The beginning of something great! It's got a seal of approval from King himself!
","I've heard the first gripping episode of the Stephen King adaption deviates quite far from the book, yet that shouldn't lower you're hopes for this new TV series because being a part of the project himself as executive producer beside Steven Spielberg, and the mastermind that penned the novel, Stephen King has APPROVED THE SLIGHT CHANGES made to the story through the tough adaption from book to 13 episode TV series. AND BOY, DOES THE FIRST ONE DELIVER.",/review/rw3045360/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2016,paperandbooks,6," Great at first but ridiculous at the end.
","Soo... The first season was pretty good: entertaining, with and interesting topic and relatable characters. I taught that the problems of being under a dome could have been better exploded, but still, the first season was good. Then the second season came, and it was soooo good. I really truly love that season, it was so intense, action-packed and I had all the feels! So after the second season, my hopes were pretty up. When I started the third season, I was so sad the show was canceled... until I actually watched the third season. In it's last season, the show turns ridiculous, and so damn confusing; but not confusing in the good way, I mean confusing like: ""I don't understand a sh¡t, let's go watch something else."" And I just don't know why to build a good plot in two solid seasons, to throw it all to the trash in the third one. I think the writers were in drugs or something when they wrote the last season; otherwise, I don't see how they could screw it up so badly.",/review/rw3045360/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2013,pfogertyca,3," I'm Rooting for the Dome

26 June 2015,Dr_Sagan,," After jumping the shark, the 3rd season jumped the whale too.
","There is no words to describe this crap. It's like the writers are a bunch of kids who invent thing as they go. This has nothing to do with Stephen King's story, despite the fact he guested in a previous episode.",/review/rw3045360/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2015,SnoopyStyle,6," great premise, interesting start deteriorates
","An invisible impenetrable dome descends upon the small town of Chester's Mill, Maine. The residents inside struggle to survive and discover the cause. Big Jim (Dean Norris) is the bully businessman trying to take charge. His son Junior is completely unstable. Julia Shumway (Rachelle Lefevre) is a local reporter who falls for mysterious Barbie (Mike Vogel).

26 June 2013,jediknight190501,8," The premier episode is engrossing and promises to be a summer time hit.
","Once I got past feeling like the new CBS mini-series ""Under the Dome"" was somehow ripping off ""The Simpsons Movie,"" I found myself engrossed by, and involved with this television show. It is set in a by now familiar landscape, the small town of Chester's Mill located in Stephen King's garden of settings, Maine. I have not read his novel upon which the series is based, and I presume that is a good thing, since I am free to question everything that happened, and will happen, without knowing the answers in advance.",/review/rw3045360/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2015,Tweekums,6," Starts well but goes downhill somewhat
","Chester's Mill is a typical New England town until one day a strange invisible and impenetrable dome descends over it. There is no obvious explanation as to what happened or why; at least not initially. Cut off from the outside world the people must figure out how to survive. The only member of the town's council; used car salesman 'Big Jim' Rennie assumes control through bullying and intimidation. Other key characters include his son, Junior, who locks his 'girlfriend' in a bomb shelter before the dome even appears, Dale 'Barbie' Barbara an Iraq veteran who is in town to kill somebody, newspaper woman Julia Shumway and police deputy Linda Esquivel to name just a few. As the series progresses so of the town's teenagers discover a 'mini-dome' that responds to their touch; contact with the outside is established and it becomes apparent that a sinister corporation appears to know more about the dome than they should and ultimately we learn of alien involvement.",/review/rw3045360/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2018,Sleepin_Dragon,5," Promising start, should have finished sooner.
","I'm not surprised by all the negative reviews. It's one of the most frustrating series I've ever watched, the premise is fantastic, a wonderfully clever plot, but after the first few episodes it seems to lose the plot completely. Series one was pretty decent I thought, watchable, Series two was more of the same, but felt a bit lethargic, Series three was an abomination, and shouldn't have been made, it totally lost the plot.",/review/rw3045360/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2013,drchristianaz,9," Read the book, love the show.

27 May 2019,God_is_with_us,6," Not he greatest film series, but a decent time passer
","I really enjoyed parts of this film series, but I felt is was poorly scripted. The acting was great, but the storyline was very all over the place. There wasn't any fluidity of the film's storyline. Very abstract and creative, but I wouldn't suggest someone to watch it, unless they are very interested in dictatorship and anarchy, in survival setting.",/review/rw3045360/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2013,amexspam,5," People shouldn't be allowed to rate a series based on one episode
","As with every other Stephen King adapted miniseries this one started well, faded in the second round, and became formulaic by episode three. The characters are all two dimensional and been done too many times before. The dialog is trite and banal ""it pays to be team player in this town"" says the former high school quarterback. There is little suspense, little action, little romance and it's hard to get involved when there's 3 minute of commercials every 6 minutes. And yet the rating is hovering around 8 because of people voting after the first episode - If this was an ocean cruise I bet they'd have written on the voyage comment cards after the first night ""Best time ever! I love the Titanic!""",/review/rw3045360/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2013,carmstrong2183,8," Great show, but this is definitely not the book
","OK for all of the people giving this show low scores because it does not follow the book and is missing characters I have to completely disagree, OK yes it would be more dark and perhaps even a little better, but then we would be watching another Game Of thrones, where we already know who will die and already know whats going to happen, so the changes they made actually made me happy knowing that even tho I have read the book many spoilers remain unknown or at least open to debate. Also lets get real this is a network TV show, we are not going to have Jr. raping a corpse on network television. I believe that its a great show I have enjoyed it more and more as it has progressed and cannot wait to see how it all pans out.",/review/rw3045360/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2014,andrew-huggett,7," Interesting ideas but ultimately just another soap opera
","The premise of this series is that of a town cut-off by a huge dome-shaped impenetrable force field – very similar concepts were used in John Wyndham's 'The Midwich Cuckoos' and the Doctor Who story: 'The Dæmons' (1971). After an intriguing pilot episode this settles down into the usual typical modern American sci-fi padded-out soap opera. There are just enough surprises to keep one watching – (although some of it is quite predictable – the military firing a missile, the fact that the dome extends underground (presumably forming a perfect sphere). Scariest moment was when the kid who was having a seizure sat up and put his finger to his lip  I detect the usual Stephen King quasi-religious and supernatural elements bubbling under the sci-fi surface of this serial. Pretty good – I may keep watching – not sure yet.",/review/rw3045360/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2014,jon-1749,5," Really, really bad writing for an otherwise interesting premise
","This is an interesting show with an interesting sci-fi / fantasy premise. Unfortunately, the episodes' writers and production team themselves suffered from a ""we don't know what the heck we're writing here, we're just gonna keep you entertained in each individual episode"". There is a story that moves forward from episode to episode, but several nuances and even aspects that were very huge just a few episodes prior become completely abandoned and betrayed.",/review/rw3045360/?ref_=tt_urv
