6 September 2019,katechunz,10," I'm still not over it
","I watched the 5 seasons in two weeks - I was completely hooked! I'm definitely going to rewatch soon as well! The secrets, suspense, magic and romance kept me hooked and on the edge of my seat! Merlin is the best character; he's adorable, beautiful, relatable and hilarious. The COMEDY literally gave me life. I LIVED and BREATHED for when Merlin did something weird or stupid! Arthur and Merlin were the best and I seriously wish there was a season six (would for real donate $2000 or my life for it).",/review/rw3496204/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2017,cecilyeb,8," BBC Merlin, I just can't get over you.
","Oh Merlin. Four years since I finished my last re-watch and you're still breaking my heart. You are quite terrible in many ways, with some of the cheesiest special effects I've ever seen on television, and some of the cheesiest writing as well, but your story captured my imagination like no Game of Thrones has done. The friendship/romance between Merlin and Arthur is almost unbearably lovely and the characters of Guinevere and the knights still haven't left my heart. There were moments of absolute brilliance in this little family show elevated by beautiful acting that still resonate and stay with me after all these years. I would go through it all again.",/review/rw3496204/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2008,Kevin-42,," Instant fantasy, just add dragon! ....and more
","First of all, if you are a really big fan of the Arthurian legend, stay away from this one. Even I, with my superficial knowledge regarding those ancient stories, could tell that this show takes quite a few 'creative liberties'. This said, it is really a rather good show. The sets and costumes are nice (though way out of time for the historic era), the storyline is interesting with a good mixture of humor and suspense salted with some adequate special effects. After just three shows in the series it is hard to judge how much depth the main characters will be able to develop, but they are all so.....likable (My favorite being the young Arthur). There are probably better ways to spend your Saturday evenings, but if you're in front of the tube anyway, you can certainly pick worse.",/review/rw3496204/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2017,Kirpianuscus,," seductive
","a seductive series. this is its basic virtue and the motif for who it is not a bad idea to see it. because it preserves the Medieval atmosphere, the traits of the well known characters but it has the courage and the science to be provocative, nice, dark and amusing, this kind of impeccable adaptation of a familiar universe giving to it new splendid nuances and details. it is a series about friendship and about different forms of magic, about trust and challenges, about beauty and about courage, about a form of delicate and precise definition of the meanings of life in the best manner. so, a charming series. good acting. and great story. enough for create dependence.",/review/rw3496204/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2018,bhester0806,10," Push through the beginning, it'll be worth it !
","The show had a rough start, cheesy at time and the week to week bad guy was silly at times BUT then season two improved and by season 3 it was in full swing and never looked back. ",/review/rw3496204/?ref_=tt_urv
29 February 2020,fairplay-81600,9," Season6

Its really a wonderful serie i love all of it maybe there are some others who think the same as I do",/review/rw3496204/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2019,silvermistvio,10," One of the best TV series of BBC.
","Merlin is one of my favourite TV shows of all time like Doctor Who. The lead actor Colin Morgan is really amazing. I didn't think that he would be that good. I just thought this TV series would be a normal one. But when I watched it, I was amazed.",/review/rw3496204/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2021,coltras35,10," Classic adventure par excellence
","I don't watch much modern TV series, finding them dull, overly serious, pretentious and lacking any entertaining qualities, but Merlin is a grand exception. A thoroughly exciting BBC series centred around Camelot and its key players -King Arthur, Merlin, Guinevere, and Morgana, but executed in a cinematic way, full of action (sword fighting, jousting and plenty of derring-do), tongue-in-cheek humour and pure drama. There's a strong dungeons and dragons feel as the character take on all kinds of creatures, travel to mystic lands and deadly threats.",/review/rw3496204/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2008,steve-862,9," It's Magic (sorry that was corny)
","There are many similarities between Dr Who and Merlin in terms of the way they are written. Like Dr Who Merlin features likable characters, moments of comedy and a little bit of tension that kids and grown ups can both enjoy.",/review/rw3496204/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2008,armstrongd_uk,10," The best new family TV drama for many years
","Everyone associated with this magnificent production deserve awards - the series is simply superb entertainment on every level. The cast is excellent - although when it started one wanted to see the traditional story of Arthur and Excalibur and Lancelot unfold, the sheer chemistry of the current cast are so enjoyable, that I now dread the demise of King Uther, as Anthony Head is absolutely compelling in this role - by far the best thing I've ever seen him do. Merlin, Arthur, even Richard Wilson as Gaius against all the odds, are all brilliantly cast and played.",/review/rw3496204/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2022,meriamrhallab-63404,10," Still re-watching it
","I've watched this series about 4 times, I just don't know what it is about it. It feels like home. The relationship between Merlin and Arthur is the most beautiful and funny I've seen on TV. I am very aware that the dialogues can feel a bit corny sometimes, especially in the first season, but it's just...endearing. The adventures are really fun, more so in the last seasons when the tone gets darker. Obviously the CGI isn't the best, and the show has its overdramatic moments, but it doesn't impact the quality significantly. Oh and the ending is not great and feels a bit rushed, which was a bit heartbreaking. It's not perfect but when you're this emotionally attached to a show it means it's pretty good.",/review/rw3496204/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2016,a_sad_cow,9," Surprisingly well done
","First four seasons were a solid 10/10. Not only the leads, but all the supporting cast and extras show a clear love of the material and theater in general. I'll be selecting one of my next series to follow based on other projects these actors are involved in. The characters are rich and the dragon was particularly well tied in. Quite often the dragon said what I was muttering off screen, which was quite refreshing. ",/review/rw3496204/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2008,hobbitfan-2,8," For what it is, actually fairly good
","Okay, I feel like you have to judge this show with a grain of salt. I've actually found it very enjoyable and oddly addictive, though that doesn't mean I think it's good. Yes, there are plot holes, character inconsistencies, cheesy dialogue, etc., but I think because it doesn't take itself too seriously (like, for example, Robin Hood was prone to do) it can get away with most of these things. There are moments of genuine comedy that I really appreciate, and the rest of the time I spend giggling at the aforementioned flaws. I think the cast is quite good as well: Colin Morgan is charmingly dorky as the title character; Anthony Head milks a surprising amount of emotion from a ridiculously poorly written character; and the rest (except perhaps for Katie McGrath, who can be a little too emotional) imbue their roles with genuine humanity. I especially like the growing relationship between Merlin and Arthur-- the way the show is written, Merlin's only reason for helping Arthur is that 'it's his destiny,' and Arthur has no real reason at all to help Merlin, and yet you definitely feel that they are starting to care for each other.",/review/rw3496204/?ref_=tt_urv

29 May 2011,ja_kitty_71,10," Awesome Fantasy show
","This is a live-action fantasy show I love. It's based around the old legends of the warlock Merlin and his relationship with Arthur, who will become ""King"" Arthur.",/review/rw3496204/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2008,Scaramouche2004,8," New excitement for Saturday tea times
","Merlin follows Doctor Who and Robin Hood in to this crucial prime-time Saturday evening slot, and any programme occupying such a sought after position in the listings, has to be worth it's salt.",/review/rw3496204/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2013,psychoameise,6," Cheesy and repetitive, yet incredibly engaging
","I have watched every single episode of this show, but was driven to distraction and ready to give up on it sometimes. It's really not well made, badly written, but the characters are engaging and the actors seem to have such fun with it that I had to keep watching.",/review/rw3496204/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2020,trufflechef89,7," Wonderful in many ways
","Years after this show has ended, I am still watching and re-watching! As others have noted, Merlin has many strengths. In terms of structure, each episode of the series contains its own mini-adventure. Sometimes, these adventures spur the season arc onwards or create consequences that characters must grapple with in later episodes. All of the seasons, except Season 1, end with a double feature that closes out the season's main danger. The reimagining of the Arthurian legend is very well done in many ways, showing that the creators have perhaps drawn on a variety of tellings of the story to create something new.",/review/rw3496204/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2020,grunsel,," The legend says Arthur would return when needed.He certainly was needed in 2020.
","What a wonderful tonic to revisit Merlin in 2020 on Pick TV. If you have not seen it yet, don't expect a history lesson, just imagine it as a fairy tale your Dad might tell you as a child, so like your Dad, there maybe plot inconsistency and dialogue you're not expecting but it does not matter, this is pure wonderful fantasy and escape from whatever the real world is throwing at you at the moment. I have to say for me that this is about the only TV series ever where I have loved all the characters, everyone darn one of them whether they are in the entire series or just a couple of episodes have added something and made us laugh,cry,scare whatever.",/review/rw3496204/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2016,ElessarAndurilS,9," Far from accurate, but entertaining (bad end)
","I was pleasantly surprised at the show Merlin and how much I enjoyed it. It was a bit adolescent and corny at times, but the dragon effects were good and the stories entertaining so I give it a good overall rating because I enjoyed watching it. There were long running story lines to follow as well as episode based ones, and some goof ups to laugh at (like why the most powerful kingdom always seemed to have virtually no army). But entertaining is entertaining. I expected and mostly got a story about the young King Aurthur and Merlin at his side but was a bit disappointed as Aurthur became king but the changes that were ""prophesied"" through the show never came to pass and finally the ending being half baked. I liked the notion of Merlin living on and Aurthur being available for future perils to the kingdom, but to have him Die a young man and the united kingdom never come about was a bad ending. That should have been addressed as a future event that the show didn't cover having them ""ride off into the sunset"" to face the future challenges once Morgana was killed, not killed off the king and left all the promises unfulfilled. But I'm not going to slam the whole show for a really bad decision on how to end it. I thought it was supposed to be about the young Aurthur and Merlin so what would have been so bad about having the stories from the legend still lying ahead as they entered full adulthood is beyond me. I guess they felt the need to close the story with the show, just a bad choice for the final show when leading up to the last 10 minutes were all heading the right direction.",/review/rw3496204/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2013,doriiiii,," In a land of myth and a time of magic the destiny of a great kingdom rests on the shoulders of a young boy. His name is Merlin.
","Wow! What an amazing, stunning show, absolutely incomparable to any other one in the fantasy genre. Being spared of all the brutality, which is common on TV nowadays, it begins as a light family fantasy show, filled with humor, and turns into a powerful drama nearing its end. Similarly, I started watching it just for entertainment, and couldn't help crying during the last heartbreaking episodes. The central figure of the show is Merlin. I was lucky to binge watch all 5 seasons and thus followed the transformation of Merlin from a clumsy lad with magical abilities into a mighty yet humble sorcerer with pure and noble heart, who never abuses his power or uses it for evil. I admire the idea of Merlin as a young man, approximately of the same age as prince (and later king) Arthur, who shows great courage, loyalty, devotion, compassion and wisdom beyond his years, always staying in the shadow but selflessly following his destiny and protecting and helping his friend Arthur in every possible way:",/review/rw3496204/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2021,Calicodreamin,6," Decent show
","A decent show, charismatic characters with some fun episodes and climactic battle scenes. Though the same five plots are constantly recycled and the characters lack real growth.",/review/rw3496204/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2014,A_Different_Drummer,9," Think of it as GAME OF THRONES Lite...
","Much ado is made about the fact that this programming was family-oriented, but I wonder if that is distracting the reviewers from the core observation that this was a fairly unique and well-executed series by any standard..? First, like the best of British TV, an attempt was made to set the story against the backdrop of history, in this case Arthurian legend, or at least as much as we might know about it. Bravo. Second, the decision was taken to base the dramatic conflict on the smoldering hatred that Anthony Head's character (the King)has for all things mystical, a hatred that is not fully explained to the audience for some considerable time. Again, bravo, a brave choice and Head rises to the occasion, becoming essentially the ongoing 'villain' in his very own castle from week to week. Colin Morgan wears the role of Merlin like a well-worn overcoat, and was an excellent choice. And Katie McGrath's striking features suit themselves well to a series which (in comparison to other series of the era) gives special attention to close-ups and reaction shots. Finally, John Hurt as the brilliantly CGI'd dragon is never less than perfect when his screen time arrives. Overall, a treat for old and young alike. Age be damned.",/review/rw3496204/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2020,harrisontipp,9," It's supposed to be goofy
",The brotherly connection between actors Colin Morgan (Merlin) and Bradley James (Arthur) is unbelievable i get that the storyline and the characters are a bit goofy but what a lot of people don't understand is that IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE GOOFY sure the storyline is nowhere near as good as game of thrones but it's Merlin isn't a glorified highly sexual series it is the story of a young man meeting someone and the friendship between them and seriously the acting is unbelievable not in terms of the emotion and purity but the fact that you walk away from that series and if someone actually told you they were brothers you'd believe it. Please don't into this series expecting a game of thrones series because you will be extremely disappointed go into it knowing nothing but understanding the fact that it is supposed to be a goofy and comedic series,/review/rw3496204/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2016,AlsExGal,8," Imagine if Merlin and Arthur came of age together...
","... and furthermore what if you threw out much of the Arthurian legend, kept the characters, and just shaped it such that it fit the mold of something that would make an interesting TV series? Well, that's what this show is. What got me interested was knowing that Anthony Head, the beloved Giles of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, was playing Uther Pendragon. From the first episode I was hooked. Unlike in the Arthurian legend, Uther, Morgana, and Arthur sit down to breakfast every morning like some normal modern day family, but that doesn't mean there aren't troubling undercurrents and issues between them. Arthur is a teen learning how to be a king - it is his destiny. Merlin is a teen learning magic from Gaius, but on the sly, because Gaius' position is that of court physician. Uther has had the practice of magic banned from the land, but I'll let you watch and find out why.",/review/rw3496204/?ref_=tt_urv
