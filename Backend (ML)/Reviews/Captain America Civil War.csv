1 October 2022,Maxax777,9," I Really Enjoyed This!
","I Really Enjoyed This - first it's just one heck of a great true story - but then, it's got a lot of heart - and it even kind of offers a different view of the War in Vietnam! It's got a good feel to it - it's got some great people in it - it's just a great movie! And again - an amazing true story! I'd honestly say the overall review numbers on this should be even higher - I'd say it's a solid 8 - but I gave it a 9 just to boost the average.",/review/rw8579809/?ref_=tt_urv

27 September 2022,christianemden,8," Ignore the title.
","I saw this movie tonight, without having any idea what I was going to see as a part of a mystery movie screening. The movie even has a cold opening, no title no a tors nothing, so I was sitting through the whole thing until I found out what it's called. I had never heard that this movie existed, what it was about or seen a glimpse of a trailer. This is not a movie that can be marketed, and is likely going to bomb at the box office.",/review/rw8579809/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2022,subxerogravity,7," Indeed, The Greatest Beer Run Ever!
","The title alone was enough to get me to come out and see this one. Although not what I was expecting with a title like that, but it was pretty amazing.",/review/rw8579809/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2022,drohmark,8," It's like an onion.
","It's like an onion. Many layers working correctly together. The title may sound like a bad late night teen movie but quickly showed its many layers it to be much more a social commentary than a war movie. Excellent cast overall and the leads were particularly stellar. Based on real events and people, within a short real life time-frame of 1967 America and the Tet offensive, lies this very good film. Partially a heavy dose of beers and bros from Philly juxtaposed with 1960's America's unflinching coursework on a culture of war escalation like we did in 1945, says Bill Murray as The Colonel. Those sentiments juxtaposed with the Prophetic words from Viet Nam War Correspondent, Russell Crowe, ""It isn't the truth that hurts us. It's the lying that hurts..."". Well worth your time!",/review/rw8579809/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2022,dlmiley,7," Definitely worth watching - ignore the critics
","While not the ""greatest"" movie ever, I enjoyed watching it. Efron, despite the critics' opinions does a decent if not outstanding job as ""Chickee"". The supporting cast including Russell Crowe as a cynical war photographer are all very good. I was also impressed by Ruby Serkis as Chickee's anti-war sister. When Chickee reaches Vietnam, there is plenty of commentary on the bravery of the soldiers fighting there along with the foolish decisions of politicians who sent them there. Also stars Bill Murray as the ""Colonel"" who runs Chickee's neighborhood bar. Recommended - 7/10. Also, be sure to watch the follow-up conversation with Zac Efron, the real ""Chickee"" Donohue, and the director Peter Farrelly.",/review/rw8579809/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2022,jouleZ,8," A fun but eye-opening look at the Vietnam war
","The Greatest Beer Run Ever is one of the best war films I have ever watched! Not just because this happened in a real life story, but how Chickie, (Zach Efron) got the wildest, craziest idea to go to Vietnam, just to bring some beers from America to his friends, who were in the middle of the war!",/review/rw8579809/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2022,That_Movie_Watcher,8," Hauntingly beautiful
","This movie really takes you for a wild ride of emotions. One moment you are laughing, and the next you are stunned and horrified. The imagery of war and what it's true colors were is what I loved most about the film. It sucks you in with such a wholesome plot that quickly turns dark and somber. It's a film that everyone should see! Its brutally honest representation of the horrors of war and the beauty of friendship and human connection was done spectacularly. It's stunning cinematography and musical score just add to this movies enjoyment.",/review/rw8579809/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2022,UniqueParticle,10," I was pleasantly surprised this was the mystery Monday movie and so damn worth it!
",Easily the best Zac Efron's movie and one of the best Farrely brother films! The first half was very funny and the last hour is a lot more serious; probably the most serious role for Zac Efron he should do them more. The dialogue in every scene was well written and flows smooth. I was surprised around 5 people left after they knew what the movie was that was weird but glad one guy that almost left stayed named Jack he was great especially when he laughed loudly.,/review/rw8579809/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2022,ferguson-6,6," beer man with a twist
","Greetings again from the darkness. ""Can I buy you a drink?"" A simple phrase that can have a variety of meanings. In 1967, John ""Chickie"" Donohue did more than buy his buddies a drink. He hand-delivered beer after tracking them down at their military posts during the Vietnam War. Writer-director Peter Farrelly (an Oscar winner for GREEN BOOK, 2018) and co-writers Brian Hayes Currie (also an Oscar winner GREEN BOOK) and Pete Jones (HALL PASS, 2011) tell the story of Chickie's dubious trip to the front lines. His mission was to show the neighborhood boys that folks back home care, and the results proved eye-opening.",/review/rw8579809/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2022,ztigr,6," Good story, so-so movie
","Its a really good story. The movie is just so-so and I think really misfired on some poignant moments. I am talking about the journey this guy took and those incidents that left a mark. Not horrors of war type moments, but those moments of realization that his assumptions were wrong. I just dont think Farrelly has the feel for telling that type of story.",/review/rw8579809/?ref_=tt_urv

2 October 2022,cbarneey,8," What a pleasant surprise

2 October 2022,s_sahar99,8," A fine line between reality and fiction!
","What a well-made movie. Big fan of Efron for his part in this movie. It's a story that will move you to tears. It is not as the title leads you to believe. It's really a story that touches you on different levels. It's emotional, educational, and heart-warming. The direction, the scenes, the story - all put together really well. At times, it's so funny you burst out laughing at the simplicity of the main lead and how he lacks understanding of his surrounding. In other instances, it shows you the reality of war and how little we know of it. It's devastating for both sides. The aftermath of such a travesty. I recommend anyone to watch this. You'll learn a lot but also it will resonate with you too. I don't write reviews until I am moved by something. Out of so much filth and garbage that are movies and shows, this is a gem worth the money you pay to watch.",/review/rw8579809/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2022,hal1002,10," Made me cry, impressive accuracy
","I saw this film with a panel discussion with the real hero of the story, Chickie Donogue, and the director/writer Peter Farrelly. I thought the movie was beautiful and funny and moving, and I cried quite a bit. A fresh take on the war with an almost Alice in Wonderland feel, as this civilian finds himself in the middle of battle, in a world he could never have conceived, and his convictions are smashed by the truth of what was going on. The characters, all based on real people, seem ultra-authentic. Great acting, great directing. A great small-but-impactful performance by Bill Murray as the bar owner.",/review/rw8579809/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2022,djmdjm-03055,10," One of the Best Movies of the Year
","I saw this at my local theatre as a $5 mystery movie. I was blown away. The movie is based on a true story about a man who wanted to show thanks for his soldier buddies in Vietnam. He wanted to show thanks by delivering beer to his friends over 10,000 miles away in a war zone. There were many funny scenes in the movie and many serious ones. The balance of political view points were well balanced and represented the time very well. After the movie I ran into a Vietnam veteran who saw the movie and was in tears because some of the scenes sent his mind back in time to when he was an ammo troop. My only criticism is there should be maybe a warning to combat veterans regarding the graphic and emotional nature of some of the scenes. There were triggering moments in the film for combat vets. Overall a great adventure film about a guy who was sick of the media hating on our country and a guy who was sick of all the loser anti-American protests of the time. He just wanted to show thanks by delivering beer to his buddies in war and risked his own life.",/review/rw8579809/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2022,dbqwbrgb,8," Better than expected
","An interesting cautionary tale of war by late-mid boomers for, and with, millennials. Told through the eyes of people at home, it touches lightly on a few themes surrounding the role of media, propaganda and military deception and ineptitude. While my family were either too old or too young to participate in this war, it reminded me that I grew up catching glimpses of this war, much like Chickies neighbourhood, and never properly understood what was going on- and in that respect it seemed very on point. Zac Efron is great in this, and makes the story seem modern in an effortless way. Much better than I thought it would be.",/review/rw8579809/?ref_=tt_urv
