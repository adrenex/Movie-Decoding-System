8 November 2022,searchanddestroy-1,7," I expected far worse
","Since two decades now, medieval movies from Europe, Eastern Europe are galore, more gruesome one than the other, huge budgets for huge craps most of the time, available mainly un streaming platforms. Most of those lousy productions bet only on gruesome battles, bloody, brutal, battle scenes, where cruelty is the main word. Besides this, nothing at all, bad directing and I don't even speak of the acting. This one is from Czech Republic but seems to be co produced with UK film industry; it is spoken in English and stars Ben Foster and Michael Caine. So, it won't be a surprise if I say it is not for the sissies, it is bloody, with man details concerning meat chopper fight sequences. But the story is not that bad for such a film, not that bad. However, it will never make me forget THE WARLORD, starring Chuck Heston; FLESH AND BLOOD from director Paul Verhoeven, or any Ridley Scott's movie for this scheme.",/review/rw8681390/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2022,housearrestedever,8," It's actually pretty good
","Unlike most of the negative low ratings against this movie that almost made me decide to not viewing it and, even when I finally decided to give it a try, my expectation was still not quite high enough to give it a full shot. But this movie turned out to be pretty good actually. Yes, this movie got a serious audio and soundtrack problems. The dialog between or among the characters sometimes was too low or too vague to be heard clearly, and most of the time was blocked by the annoying loud soundtrack which supposedly should be in the background and subtle enough to support the ongoing of the story, but sadly, the music often played too loud and over-the-top dominant over the scenes, and lot of times too religiously annoying. It also made me wonder if the production team hired a qualified enough audio professional group to handle the recording or microphone. It seems that there were lot of times, the microphone was placed either too far away or too high to record the characters dialog so that always ended up either too vague or too low to be heard clearly. The crew who took care of the audio part of this movie should never be hired by any other movie makers in case to cause the similar problems.",/review/rw8681390/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2022,RJBrez,8," Had some issues, but I loved it
","I know it's 2022 and everyone is a critic and negativity is all anyone brings to the table. I'm the opposite. I'd rather tell you what I liked about something, so here we go.",/review/rw8681390/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2022,benjaminskylerhill,4," Convoluted and mostly bland
","Medieval is helped by a restrained yet captivating performance from Ben Foster. Even better is the production design and costumes; it's a very good-looking, immersive, realistic production.",/review/rw8681390/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2022,Xstal,3," You'll Be None the Budweiser...
","... and care even less (a lot less), but confused and confounded, at an almighty mess, the dialogue is shabby, if you can hear it at all (almost unintelligible at times), as the background of music drowns out jumbled squall, as to who's fighting who, you won't have a Scooby Doo, as allegiances change and alliances fall, the editing's poor, all in all a huge chore, but if slashing and stabbing leave you wanting more, if dismembering and spearing all get a high score, crack open a can of your favourite Czech lager and ask yourself if Jan Zizka would have blown more than the doors off if he was around to see this nonsense.",/review/rw8681390/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,AfricanBro,7," Jan ""One-eyed"" Zizka
","I didn't have much expectation heading into this, I just generally love watching medieval films and series purely for the gore; I think watching people wage war with spears, battle axes, maces and swords is much more thrilling than gun fights, still love them though.",/review/rw8681390/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2022,Ghost33,4," Completely ruined by audio issues
",I love Ben Foster. I think he chooses excellent movies.,/review/rw8681390/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2022,christiankennedy-70109,7," Research the Man before you see the Movie
","There's little effective pretense even though the movie attempts to give some backstory in the first few minutes. This movie will be much more substantial and meaningful to the informed viewers. I initially agreed that the graphic violence was excessive but after researching the man and his exploits on the battlefield, the gore could've gone even farther...",/review/rw8681390/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2022,idonotexist,5," Could have been the new braveheart or gladiator
","Instead, it felt generic, rushed with over emphasis on fighting. This is a true story, based on real events and real people. We have the historical data on all of them yet in the movie, they are vaguely mentioned in intro and outro credits.",/review/rw8681390/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2022,sholto-79379,9," See it for yourself - not to everyone's taste but I loved it!
","I was dubious after seeing the trailer for this film - it looked grim, murky and confused. I did some historical research before watching it and I would recommend - it is trying to depict a very complex and ever shifting political situation and demands a lot of attention and engagement from the viewer.",/review/rw8681390/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2022,ferguson-6,7," tremendous battle scenes
","Greetings again from the darkness. There are some actors I follow simply because I admire their work. Ben Foster earned that loyalty with his performances in such films as LEAVE NO TRACE (2018), HELL OR HIGH WATER (2016), and 3:10 TO YUMA (2007). Here he is cast as Jan Zizka, the legendary 15th century Czech icon whom historians have pegged as having never lost a battle. At the helm is Czech writer-director Petr Jakl whose previous films did not come close to this scale. The list of credited screenwriters includes director Jakl, his father Petr Jakl Sr, Marek Dobes, Michal Petrus, Kevin Bernhardt, and Petr Bok. I don't pretend to know which of these writers had the greatest impact, but what I can report is that the film looks great and includes some of the best battle scenes you'll find in any film set in the Middle Ages.",/review/rw8681390/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,stephenmsaunders,8," Lives up to its name
","The most Impressive thing about Medieval is the way the producers and director have committed to trying to re-create the world where the story is set in the most realistic way that they can. Everyone is filthy, the violence is disturbing, and all of the little details that you look for in a film set during this period are there.",/review/rw8681390/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2022,jon-22643,8," Ben Foster and all the cast make an amazing job
","Despite of the low budget, it's clear that this is a movie of actors. It's great to see that ALL actors make the outmost.",/review/rw8681390/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2022,JeffT1414,7," Worth the watch!
","If you like films about the Middle Ages, then this one is worth the watch. Yes, it is much like other films in this genre (blood and guts and a little bit of a love story), but the director did a great job with angles and sequence and speed. Being based on true events, the storyline in Medieval is unique, as well. Ben Foster leads the film well, and the supporting cast, especially Sophie Lowe and Michael Caine do a nice job. It's not a movie that I will watch over and over again, but it was well worth the watch in the theater, and I'm sure I will watch it at least one more time when it hits the digital market.",/review/rw8681390/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2022,deloudelouvain,6," Confusing but well filmed.
","Well I never heard of this Czech warlord. Ben Foster did a good job portraying him. The production of this movie is good, with some well directed battle scenes, good acting from the entire cast, and a normally interesting story. The problem I had with the movie is how confusing it gets sometimes. I really tried to concentrate but it's just not an easy told story. If you're into medieval movies though it's certainly worth a watch. The costumes and the sceneries are very good, the battles gruesome but excellently filmed so you can't really go wrong with Medieval. Too bad the story was a bit confusing.",/review/rw8681390/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2022,Mike_Noga,5," Muddled visuals and muddled story telling. Decent action
","The visuals in this movie are too dark and muddy and the accents are sometimes not understandable. Characterizations are paper thin even for a historical movie. It's poorly edited and the movie switches between scenes without letting you know how much time has passed between scenes. And while the action was decent, there was too much time in between the action scenes. The pacing was erratic.",/review/rw8681390/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2022,silicontourist,8," A Superb Film Ruined By Unintelligible Dialogue Due To Terrible Audio/Sound Quality!
","You always know that when the starting credits say, ""This film is based upon a true story"" that it will be very far removed from actual real life events etc. Having said that however, this film was exceptional in every department; from the great acting, the choreography of the fighting action scenes, camera work etc. Except for one thing...the horrific audio quality! I would have scored this a full 10/10 otherwise.",/review/rw8681390/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2022,danieljfarthing,5," Disappointingly confusing & bogged down medieval true-tale actioner, with a fine cast (and Michael Caine)
","In writer / director Petr Jäkl's 1400s-based true-tale actioner ""Medieval"" Ben Foster (always solid) is warrior knight Jan Zizka who under political king-maker Michael Caine (poor) becomes central to a grand European power struggle playing out in brutal fashion around in & Prague between the noble likes of Matthew Goode, Til Schweiger (both excellent under-rated actors), Sophie Lowe (terrific) & Karel Roden. Bloody violent battles flow (particularly between Foster & barbarian nemesis Robert Møller) but Jäkl's screenplay becomes so confusing & bogged down that there's no way this was going to be a new ""Gladiator"". Disappointing, considering it's fine cast.",/review/rw8681390/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2022,Tweetienator,4," The Noble Art of Catching a Strike
","Medieval is in no way a historical drama or such but a simple action movie with some brutal quality but nonetheless very unbelievable and not too well choreographed fighting scenes - if you look close you see that the ""bad"" guys even don't try to repel or dodge a strike but seem to have rather some suicidal tendencies. Many times, it just looks like some farmer is mowing hay. Another big issue are those almost constant drones and sounds in the background which a) make the voices sometimes almost inaudible and b) do not fit well into the given scenario or timeline. There are many scenes there is no need for music or background noise, but, well, somehow they still squeezed some in - maybe those responsible for the score are paid for every note played, who knows... What else? The production is okay, the acting too, so Medieval is not too bad and if you are in need for some sword action and battle scenes, this one may do. For anyone who wants some plot and substance, this may be the wrong choice.",/review/rw8681390/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2022,radhrh,1," A confused mess
","I gave Medieval a try because I like Ben Foster and it also features Michael Caine and Mathew Goode so at least it has some recognisable actors. However my spirit sank before the movie started with a parade of half a dozen never heard of before production companies. When you see this you know it's a low budget afair. However sometimes low budget movies can be good so I persevered. Unfortunately despite having a semi respectable cast the writers are all over the place. The plot is a confused mess, from priests and noble ladies talking communism to warlords quoting The Art of War the dialogue is anachronistic. The action scenes are poorly filmed and choreographed. I tapped out after an hour realizing I was only half way through hence it gets a single star.",/review/rw8681390/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2022,jan-hranac,9," Czech history Hollywood style
","OK, that's not fair. Jákl is Czech and if it wasn't for him, this movie would be way worse (or wouldn't exist in the first place). Still, he made it with American audience in mind and it's an American movie, with all the advantages and drawbacks that brings. Remember Mel Gibson's Braveheart? Then you've got an idea. However, unlike Braveheart, Jan Zizka (Medieval) feels a little bit more respectful - after all, this is his own history (while Gibson has no relationship to Scottish history).",/review/rw8681390/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2022,pietclausen,3," A dud and insignificant movie
","Knowing nothing about Czech history, I was eagerly awaiting to view this saga about Jan Zizka, a hero of the 15th century, fighting for freedom. Expecting a brilliant show is not what I got. Starring some well-known actors, but most others completely unknown to me, did not help. The spoken English by non English speaking actors was difficult to understand what they were saying and the story was most confusing. It concerns a numbers of bands of badies and goodies running around in the forest bashing each other whenever they met, but the viewer has no idea who is who. The impression I got was the film being a symbolic presentation of what had been endured in this century with gospel type of music throughout the show. Apparently the movie makes sense if you know this history.",/review/rw8681390/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2022,cdcrb,5," blood and guts
","Did you see ""the northman"" back in the spring? This is pretty much the same sort of thing. It involves the king of bohemia, two popes, the king of france's niece and an emperor. The hre? And last but not least jan zizka. A czech warlord from the middle ages and apparently a national hero. The aforementioned niece is a pawn in a power struggle. Don't worry about ben, here. Although it seems he's on the verge of death many, many times, he manages to keep going. So much bloodshed it gets boring . I must say the fellows with cross bows are very accurate. Supposedly Its based on fact. All news to me.",/review/rw8681390/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2022,darkreignn,2," Medieval? More like mediocre.
","""Medieval"" is a feature film, perhaps playing on a silver screen near you. That said, if you decide to see this movie in theatres, you may find yourself perplexed when you begin to realize that ""Medieval"" moreso belongs at the bottom of the nearest bargain bin at your local Walmart. And at the time of this writing, there are four somewhat positive reviews of this movie posted, and it stuns me to see that all of them have rated this movie a 7 or above because, in all of the infinite multiverse, there is no reality where ""Medieval"" should garner a score of that caliber.",/review/rw8681390/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2022,Mohican15,5," ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED???
","Jan Zizka was one of the great military commanders that history has ever known. He defeated the armoured knights of the Holy Roman Empire with a handful of peasants armed with flails and pitchforks. His armoured wagons (or ""wagonburgs"") laid the foundations for what we now call ""the tank"". He was a legend, freeing the Czech people from the tyrannical popery of Rome. However, he was also a deeply complex individual- the original ""amazing grace"" story. Hacking out a living as a highwayman/mercenary, Zizka's eyes were opened by the gospel of Jan Hus, who taught him how to ""fight the good fight of faith"" before he was tragically martyred. Today, he is perceived as an enduring symbol of Czech nationalism (I nation of which I am fortunate enough to be a member) and his passionate devotion God is overlooked. MEDIEVAL does nothing to mend this one-sided view, with its gratuitous violence, poor dialogue and derivative plot. Zizka become just another gruff-voiced tough guy, unwisely blending his Russel Crowe antics with half-hearted attempts at religious motivation. Director Petr Jakl chose to make a film about Zizka's youth and that's perfectly fine, but Zizka only came to the Lord when he was an old man and had already made most of his mistakes. Forcing the Christian message into this picture feels... awkward. Showing a young man who did terrible things to survive until he was shown a better way (""amazing grace that saved a wretch like me"") would've surely made a far more powerful and profound story. Instead, Foster (who, though a fine actor, is woefully miscast and woefully misused, trying to deliver a Braveheart performance when kitted out with a Ninja Turtles script) ends up stumbling his way through a GOT version of the Robin Hood myth. This was supposed to be the most expensive film that Czech has ever made but the battle scenes felt surprisingly cheap and disappointingly small-scale, especially considering the fact that during his youth, Zizka allegedly took part (and lost his eye in) the Battle of Grunwald- one of the biggest and bloodiest battles in medieval history. Seeing his mighty wagonburgs and hearing choruses of ""Ye Who are Warriors of God"" (the Hussite battle hymn that struck terror into the hearts of Emperor Sigismund's mercenary crusaders) were pleasant diversions from this hackneyed, melodramatic mess.",/review/rw8681390/?ref_=tt_urv
