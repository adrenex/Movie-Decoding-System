23 April 2011,gradyharp,10," Bonds and Commitment and Temptation
","LAST NIGHT is a tightly woven tale that explores the psyches of four people in one fascinating evening. This is the initial directing outing for Iranian-American writer Massy Tadjedin ('The Jacket', 'Leo') who also created the story and the script: the film is so fine that we doubtless will be hearing more about her.

1 April 2011,supadude2004,9," Extremely Underrated Movie. Brilliant Performances From Knightley, et al
","OK, what is going on please? Here is an excellent, skilfully crafted, intelligently paced and well structured movie with a most complimentary screenplay, and it should of course be rated at 8.x out of 10. Yet, as I write it is barely rated above average. Sorry, but I have to knock myself on the head a couple of times just to check that I am now indeed only seeing 6.7 out of ten for a most excellent relationship themed movie.",/review/rw7273654/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2011,Superunknovvn,8," An honest, if terrible look at relationships, love and faith
","I am very surprised ""Last Night"" got a rather lukewarm user rating on IMDb. From my point of view it is a movie that is very honest, if terrible in its depiction of relationships, love and faith. There were many moments, where I expected the movie to lose its momentum, where the filmmakers could have chickened out, but that never happened. Maybe too much is talked about, when some things could have been told through pictures. Then again, I found all dialog very believable. My only criticism concerns Sam Worthington's rather wooden performance. Apart from that ""Last Night"" really knocked me off my feet, from the beginning right until the brilliant final scene.",/review/rw7273654/?ref_=tt_urv

","I haven't used the above summary ""line"" for a while but must have for quite a few times in the 870 odd postings to-date. What it conjures up in my mind is a piece of intimate, self-contained, exquisite cinema that is, it wouldn't be far wrong to say, the opposite to an epic, although they can be equally pleasurable to experiences.",/review/rw7273654/?ref_=tt_urv

26 April 2011,isabel_towns,10," A movie to fall in love with
","Every time I see a movie that I like I feel like when I'm starting to fall in love, few movies have done that, but this movie made me feel like a teenager. It so good, I have been feeling the need to talk about, just like when I meet someone I like. What makes this movie so good? Everything. The story is quite simple. But the question behind it isn't: what is worst a sexual betrayal or a romantic betrayal? The movie let us decide that. It also plays with stereotypes. Guys will always wonder if they could have sex with a sexy women they meet and women always have a private prince charming. The one who they think off when life is not going well or when is going too well. The characters and performances are good. The thing is, Sam's performance is good until Guillame comes along and steals the show; he is so good. I had admired him since I saw Ensemble c'est tout, but here he is beyond good. So at the end Sam's seems made out of plastic, really. Keira is good, one can feel her uncertainty, anger and excitement. And Eva surprised me, she will not get the Oscar, but she proves she can work something serious and be right for such a roll. The script is also very good, one can tell that the characters have well developed backgrounds. The photography is also quite nice, it helps to create a intimate atmosphere. No need to say that if you like these kind of movies that deals with relationships and just the hard work of being humans this movie is for you.",/review/rw7273654/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2010,deepster24,7," Worth watching
","Rather enjoyed this film at the Rome Film Festival last night. The atmosphere of New York by night and the soundtrack itself made it worth the half an hour delay getting in! The main performances are strong, Keira puts in a surprisingly convincing interpretation as the wife who meets her previous love the day her husband is out of town with a female colleague he likes. It discusses the nature of love, betrayal, marriage and sentiment in a thoughtful way, without the usual labelling of people as cheaters and victims. It should encourage us to realise that life and relationships are more complex and that ultimately, nobody really belongs to anyone (however much we might like to think we do). It's a shame these days that we only get to see the lives of the beautiful, very well-to-do folk (in their wonderful apartments, sipping on fine wine) on the big screen as if temptation within marriage was a luxury that only the wealthy and obscenely photogenic can afford. Anyway, universal themes are dealt with well and it's good fodder for a long conversation afterwards.",/review/rw7273654/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2011,Kimmmmi,10," Intelligent Movie - Superbly Done
",Saw this movie at the Tribeca Film Festival and can say that I was truly taken aback by the brilliance of such a simple concept. The movie about a married couple amid marital temptation is very well acted and directed. The film captures the vibe of the Tribeca lifestyle and the trials of a young marriage. Sam Worthington does an amazing job as the reserved husband in love with his wife. The film is well-paced and builds to a crescendo of will they or wont they infidelities. Visually the movie is simple but the effects of overlapping pictures and conversations highlights the similarities of temptation and the differences between men and women. The story was truly amazing and the best movie I have seen in 2011.,/review/rw7273654/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2011,cosmo_tiger,," A grown-up, less in your face version of ""Closer"". Emotionally powerful movie that will leave you wanting more. Great. I say B+
","""What I wouldn't give to have tired of you."" After a party makes her feel uneasy Joanna (Knightley) thinks that her husband Michael (Worthington) is cheating on her. The next day he leaves on a business trip, with the women (Eva Mendes). The same day Joanna runs into her past love and spends time with him. Both are tempted to do what they shouldn't. This is a movie that you have to let form. The first half hour or so is a little slow, but then it really starts to take shape and the ending will leave you wanting more. Being a man, this is not usually the type of movie that I enjoy, but I really did like this one. I would call this a more subdued version of ""Closer"", much less overt sex and much more subtle love. Much like ""Closer"" you are pulled back and forth between who you like and who you don't. Who is right and who is wrong. Who you want to root for, and who you shouldn't. Either way this is a very emotionally powerful movie that will leave you wishing there was more. Overall, I surprisingly liked this movie a lot. This is a very emotional movie that will leave you thinking. That's a good thing. I give it a B+.",/review/rw7273654/?ref_=tt_urv

19 February 2011,georgioskarpouzas,8," Brief Encounter in a modern setting
","This movie is about the dilemmas that follow the temptation of infidelity in a modern middle-class setting. The actresses are fine and very much attuned to their roles, the wife played by Keira Knightley, charming, easy-going but essentially scrupulous and the temptress Eva Mendes, attractive, tiger-like but essentially cold-blooded and manipulative. To those two women, two men correspond, who in a sense complement them. Sam Worthington, the husband plain, common and finally prone to temptation and Guillaume Cannet, flamboyant,charming and lecherous. Knightley and Worthington are decent middle-class people driven to temptation by the sinners Mendes and Cannet.",/review/rw7273654/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2011,wilburowen-3-42221,8," Ah, sweet mystery of life (and the tortures of monogamy).
","8 only because it isn't ""Citizen Kane.."" smaller in size, smaller in intent, but large in the scope of its attention to detail within the maze of twisted morals and confused emotions we live in: we know something is wrong, even when we are not unhappy; we just don't don't know what it is. And we certainly don't know what to do about it without tearing down the castle.... The realism of this elegant, small film with its stunning ambiance centers around the pull of the pleasures of monogamy (home, safety companionship, having someone who knows how you like your eggs to scramble some up for you in the middle of the night) versus variety, danger, and of course the one that got away.",/review/rw7273654/?ref_=tt_urv

As they return home, a full confrontation ensues. Joanna feels Michel must have had a fling with Laura the last time both traveled to the West Coast for a business presentation, something he vehemently denies.

","I enjoyed this movie because it shows real life.There are many difficulties and temptations in a relationship, especially a marriage and that could be a start for someone to watch it.Sometimes it's good to get an idea of what really is going on in reality.We are so used to see a happy end and foolish problems and many may not appreciate the plot .I believe though that the end is a little poor, but maybe on the other hand it lets the viewer decide what would he do in the circumstance that was presented, because the characters can relate to every common man or woman.I also liked very much the chemistry of Knightley and Canet, but in my opinion Worthington and Mendes were not really the best choices, not that their act wasn't good, it just did not hit the eye. I also loved the location!",/review/rw7273654/?ref_=tt_urv

6 November 2010,yris2002,6," ""To cheat or not to cheat?"": rather superficial, too harmless
","""Last night"" made me naturally think of """"Closer"", where we find four people, two men and two women, among whom the law of attraction made them fall apart, more than once, to the point of being no longer able to distinguish between love and attraction. Here we still find four people, one married couple (a significant point, indeed) who flirt with the idea of cheating, one night they are separated and this single night proves highly significant for both. The attractive female cast undoubtedly makes a difference in this movie, which seems to be made in the service of Keira Knightely's and Eva Mendes's power of attraction.",/review/rw7273654/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2012,andie-katschthaler,10," Fantastic movie about the little things that remain unsaid
","With ""Last Night"" it's all in the details. The quiet undertones, the things unsaid, the contrasts of loud backgrounds and quiet conversations; the ways a hug can be so different from another one while on the surface they're both just a hug. The fact that these details stand out so strongly in this film points to some excellent scriptwriting and directing.

","Last Night is a quiet, thoughtful movie that initially seems to be purporting a simple question: is it worse to cheat on your partner sexually or emotionally? But really, the fact that this question seems to be the heart of the film is its weak point, because it's a false question to begin with. If rephrased this way: ""is it worse to cheat on your partner by sleeping with someone else, or by loving someone else?"", it's easier to see why this isn't even really a question. Of course, loving someone else is worse. ",/review/rw7273654/?ref_=tt_urv

","I guess I am in the minority here, but I didn't like this movie. I love Keira Knightly, and Sam Worthington is a great actor, but they just simply weren't given enough to work with. The film follows them as a married couple, who a night apart are both presented with the temptation to cheat on each other. The film moves along at a snail's pace, but it never really gives us a reason to be motivated in this story or why we should root for this couple to be faithful other than because it is the right thing to do. It was also painfully obvious how the film would turn out. I was hoping to be wrong, but sadly I wasn't. But more than that, I just never really felt emotionally invested in this film or its characters despite a great cast.",/review/rw7273654/?ref_=tt_urv
