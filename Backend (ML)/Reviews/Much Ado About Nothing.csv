9 March 2005,tpendleton,," Outstanding entertainment
","I've been watching this British comedy for about 10 years now; first on PBS and then recently on BBS. I'm sure I've seen all 44 episodes; most of them more than once; some of them three times or more. And I've never gotten bored with a single one. It's true that some of the plots were pretty much repeated over and over. But, still, watching Hyacinth, Richard, Daisy, Onslow, and all the others always gave me a chuckle. I've seen them so many times now that I feel I know each character personally. I wish I could have attended one of Hyancith's candlelight suppers, or spent an afternoon watching TV with Onslow, or gone for an afternoon drive with Hyancith and Richard. It would have been a scream. Situation comedies, British or American, don't get much better than ""Keeping Up Appearances"".",/review/rw1525148/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2005,RoamingTigress,," Love it!
","I have been watching Keeping Up Appearances for a number of years now, starting from when I was in middle school. My parents have always been fans of the show from day one and initially I didn't think the idea of a snobbish housewife driving her husband crazy being all that funny. Back then Mr. Bean was the only BritCom I liked, but when I saw my first episode of this classic comedy, I became hooked. ",/review/rw1525148/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2001,alphaspace,," Hyacinth inisist's that all things be simply the best & her show IS!
","All words fail to adequately describe our Hyacinth.  To say she is a totally consumed, self important, myopic  social climber is to be meek in one's definition.  But our Hyacinth is also sweet in her own odd way.  Hyacinth honestly wants to do good by and for all but she just wants to be seen be all the right people while in the midst of doing it.  Her friends love her despite the fact that Hyacinth requires her friends to be long suffering and, selfless in their love of her.  Hyacinth's son Sheridan who is suspected to be totally gay to everyone but her while off at University calls home constantly to his doting mommy and cash cow dad.  She makes the post man, the power & light dude, tradesmen, heck all visitors to her home go through tons of changes like remove their shoes at the door.  Hyacinth was just like my mother so I love her.  Hyacinths family was awesome ranging from her one sister whose husband is a cross dressing turf accountant to Daisy  whose husband is a Big bone idle man with a great heart and, a car thats s joke.",/review/rw1525148/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2005,MovieAddict2016,," One of my all-time favorite shows
","I used to watch ""Keeping Up Appearances"" in England because the main character, Hyacinth Bucket (Patricia Routledge), actually reminded me of a British version of a relative of mine. (I'm not naming names!) The show isn't as well known in the States, although it does get some broadcast over the weekend on PBS.",/review/rw1525148/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2003,hyperexcel,," excellent British comedy
","The dry humour of the Brits has no problem mixing up the slapstick in Keeping Up Appearances, a delicious series poking fun at the social graces of upper crust English society in the eyes of a lowly middle-class British wife.",/review/rw1525148/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2005,davilbr,," Funnier than America's current sitcoms
","My wife and I discovered ""Keeping up appearances"" several years ago on PBS and we've been hooked ever since. As many times as we watch it, we never tire of Hyacinth's relentless efforts to climb the social latter within the backdrop of her less-than-classy family. KUA is certainly funnier than any sitcom produced in America today. The humor is an excellent mixture of traditional brit, old-fashioned slapstick and numerous sight gags and with facial expressions that are often more telling than dialogue. Patricia Routledge is the greatest comedic actress since Lucille Ball and couldn't possibly be more realistic in this hilarious role. She and her supporting cast lend such an element of realism to the show, one is almost tempted to look outside to see if they may be lurking next door! kudos and cheers to the Brits for this classic.",/review/rw1525148/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2006,IridescentTranquility,9," And all Richard wanted was a quiet life . . .
","Poor Richard Bucket. You know what he thinks of his home life right at the start of the series. Now old enough to retire, the long-suffering husband of the woman who makes such a show of her ""Royal Doulton with the hand-painted periwinkles"" would get on his knees and clean the carpets in his old workplace if it meant he could spend more time away from Hyacinth.",/review/rw1525148/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2002,Chrissie,," ""Oh, nice!""
","Snobbish Hyacynth Bucket (""Bou-quet!"" she insists) is the quintessential self-centered social climber oblivious of her own shortcomings. But what really makes the show shine are the supporting characters -- Slatternly Daisy, perpetually reading bodice-rippers, and her slobbish but good-natured husband Onslow; trashy Rose; pitiful Violet with her cross-dressing husband but ""Mercedes, swimming pool, and room for a pony; Emmett the timorous neighbor who lives in terror that Hyacinth will ""sing at me"" (with a voice that shatters glass); the ""dishy vicar"" who tries to hide when ""that Bucket woman"" nears; and, of course, long-suffering henpecked Richard...",/review/rw1525148/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2006,sawznhamrs-1,," Origin of Pat Routledge's portrayal
","Today I woke early and caught a section of the Bette Davis movie, Watch on the Rhine made in 1943. The segment I watched did not even have Bette Davis but what struck me profoundly and immediately was the character named Fanny Farrelly played by Lucille Watson (born 27 May 1879 Qu√©bec, Canada - died 24 June 1962, New York). I don't recall ever seeing her before in any film, but, in this one, it was apparent that her portrayal of Fanny was the inspiration Patricia Routledge took for the character Hyacinth. The behavior and expressions were so similar, I first thought that it must be Patricia in this role, but I knew that it was made in 1943, so it was impossible for it to be her. I would love to see the entire movie, but, will have to wait to find it on again. Anyone who is a fan of Keep Up Appearances would get a kick out of seeing this film just to see this woman! The only difference was that Fanny had no obsession with how things ""appeared"" to other people. But the facial expressions and even the voice are astonishingly similar to Patricia's portrayal of Hyacinth. I would love to know if anyone else has ever seen this film. Also would love to find out from Pat herself if this film inspired her, but don't know any way of contacting her.",/review/rw1525148/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2005,minimeburton,," The Actors
","Absolutely fabulous TV series. Great Actors are Patricia Routledge (Hyacinth), Clive Swift (Richard), Josephine Tewson (Elizabeth), and many more. I think it is a fabulous, interesting and very hilarious TV series. I saw Patrica at a Show she did at a venue in Sydney, Australia. Her acting skills are fantastic. She has the knowledge of a professional comedian. She is just one of the best actors (to me) in the world. I read and interview on her on the internet, and she has no need to retire. She says ""Retirment, hmmmmmmm..........Rubbish it is. Can't even spell the word"" quite frankly, with her skills, I am with her 100%. Clive Swift is another great actor, but also 7 years younger then her, still has a bit of acting skills to catch up on her. Josephine Tewson, another fabulous actor, plays the timid neighbor, Elizabeth. Every time she 'pops in' for a cup of tea or coffee, she ends up spilling something or breaking on of Hyacinths porcelain cups! All the actors on Keeping Up Appearances are great, and should start to think about making another series. WELL DONE!!!",/review/rw1525148/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2002,wwjd1983ad,," Hilarious!!!!
",I watch this program on PBS all the time!!  It is so funny!!!  Many times it is much funnier than other American sitcoms on the networks.  What makes it so funny is Hyacinth's character; she is both believeable and UNbelievable at the same time!!  I recommend this show to everyone who wants a laugh!,/review/rw1525148/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2000,serendipity,," Fantastic!
","This show is truly hilarious with its superb writing, excellent physical comedy and biting wit! Although Routledge lights up the screen with her portrayal of class-conscious Hyacinth, she is well supported by a varied and talented supporting cast. From Violet (the sister with a Mercedes and room for a pony) to library-book reading Daisy, the cast provides non-stop laughter and storylines that keep you watching to discover the next crazy twist. Hyacinth's flamboyant snobbery and utter self-absorption is an excellent contrast to her straight, resigned husband Richard. The running jokes 'Appearances' provides keep you laughing from the theme song to the closing credits. You will tune in for each episode to witness another round of Rose's declarations of love, Hyacinth's worries about whether the post will realize she is of a social standing that should only receive FIRST class mail, Sheridan's requests of money and avoidance of women (reportedly because Mummy asks - not because of his dubious interests!) and Elizabeth's inevitable break of china or spill of tea. Watch it! You won't regret it!",/review/rw1525148/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2005,mdm-11,," Brit-Com's Self-Appointed First Lady of Taste and Substance
","Never before has there been a middle class English housewife so determined to climb the social ladder (or at least appear to). Constantly on the look-out for opportunities to rub elbows with the ""socially desirable"" upper crust, Hyacinth Bucket (pronounced BOU-QUET) always manages to utterly embarrass herself in the process. This set of 4 DVDs features more of the hilarious adventures of Hyacinth and the family and ""friends"" who put up with her obnoxiously ""uppity"" demeanor. Whether pretending to plan a ""very expensive"" trip or entertaining eccentric millionaires (who could pass for vagabonds judging by their attire), Hyacinth never passes up a chance to show how superior she is to all of those ""wanna-be's"" out there.",/review/rw1525148/?ref_=tt_urv

6 June 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10," Delightful to watch
","Now I like sit-coms, from Britain I love Open All Hours, Last of the Summer Wine, Only Fools and Horses and of course this. Keeping Up is just delightful to watch, it is charming and very funny. Complete with engaging characters and great writing.",/review/rw1525148/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 1999,Sylviastel,10," Absolutely Hysterical!
","This show is Britain's greatest export since Faulty Towers. Patricia Routledge is truly a great physical comedienne to the like of Lucille Ball. Her character, Hyacinth, is one of a kind creation by Harold Snoad. He deserves all the kudos for creating a show with such intelligent humor about the class and family. Clive Swift compliments Routledge as her long suffering husband who takes orders from his wife. Why? She doesn't listen to anyone. Her neighbors, Elizabeth, have understood her. Elizabeth is terrified of spilling coffee in her friend's kitchen or living room. She is so nervous of ruining her friend's table. Not that Hyacinth makes a fuss about it. She'll only say ""we were thinking of getting another table anyway."" Emmett, Elizabeth's brother who runs the local operatic society and plays the piano. Hyacinth believes her voice is great enough to belong but rather break glass and cause him to hide from her. She believes he has a crush on her. Did I mention her sisters, Daisy, Violet, and Rose. Violet is the wealthiest sister with a cross-dressing husband who shapes ice in the form of naked ladies. Rose has been with almost every married man in town. She wears mini skirts to the disapproval of her big sister, Hyacinth. Daisy is the married sister with a strong sexual drive and a bone idle lazy sloppy husband, Onslow, who prefers to drink beer and watch racing on the tele. They live to the embarrassment of Hyacinth. She says ""50 years after the blitz...what do the garbage men know what to take."" Rose, Daisy, Onslow and Daddy all live together with a broken car sitting in front of the yard and a dog living in it. Daddy is senile and a dirty old man. He is picked up by Richard at a department store wearing a spacesuit one day while Hyacinth ditches the Councillor Nugent. Daddy says little but he is always going back to the war. He digs trenches in the yard and the commands the house. He even becomes a naturist or nudist. He goes after women all the time. He likes Mrs. Zbygn, a Polish immigrant who speaks no English. Why? He says there's something mysterious about her. Hyacinth tells a huge dog that he can't sit in front of her house. ""Go. You can't stay here. Go."" Hyacinth experiences with a horse aren't much better. Watch this show!!!",/review/rw1525148/?ref_=tt_urv

9 September 2010,frncsbrennan,10," Very Funny!
","This series is perhaps the funniest I have ever seen. Patricia Routledge (Hyacinth Bucket) is brilliant (to use a British phrase.) She is not only that-but darn hilarious. The supporting cast matches her along way. Geoffry Hughes is great as Onslow, who plays Hyacinth's slob brother-in-law who can care less about every and anything. And then there is Daisy, his desperate wife and Hyacinth's sister, who is desperate to get Onslow to show some interest in her. And then there is the man crazy sister Rose (Mary Millar) who will do anything to get a man and to swear off them of them as well (including donating her undies to Charity.) And, of course, there's Hyacinth's poor suffering husband Richard and her neighbor, Elizabeth, who is so nervous in Hyacinth's presence that she continually breaks Hyacinth's Periwinkle China every time she is asked (forced to)come to tea. This is a hilarious series, every episode is enjoyable.",/review/rw1525148/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2008,vintageTVaddict,10," Fun With The English Class System!
","Hyacinth Bucket was a first class snob and a great eccentric. She came from an eccentric family - lazy Daisy and her passion for philosophising layabout husband Onslow; rampant Rose - always seeking Mr Right, or Mr Anybody; Daddy - well past the height of his mental powers; and Violet - married to a cross-dressing turf accountant.",/review/rw1525148/?ref_=tt_urv

","Keeping Up Appearances has always been a personal favorite of mine. It has everything a good comedy needs: catch phrases, good stories, classic plots, extraordinary characters,... The actors are all first class and especially Patricia Routledge, who plays Hyacinth, is outstanding. I mean, has an actress ever been so good in playing her role? I don't think so.",/review/rw1525148/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2005,General_G,," Best British Sitcom!
","I love this show. Hyacinth is so funny, that is its funny when she gets embarrassed. Then there's poor Richard. Hes going to be torchered for the rest of his life by his crazy wife. Elizebeth and Emmet don't have to though. They just have to move! But we them. Hyacinth receives most of her embarrassment from her crazed family, Onslow, Daisy, Rose and Daddy. Onslow and Daisy live like slobs and there home shows it, inside and out. Rose and Daddy also live with them. Rose is a swinger. She reminds me a lot of Blanche on The Golden Girls. Daddy is mental. Hes always running off on his own and doing crazy things. On the last season, they finally introduced Violet and Bruce who had been talked about through the whole series. Just two more of Hyacinth's crazy family. Watch Keeping Up Appearances on PBS.",/review/rw1525148/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2004,atomius,8," ""it's pronounced ""bouquet""!""
","Hyacinth Bucket, pardon my pronunciation, is a British woman who lives with her husband in a residential area, and loves to be top of the social rankings in her area and constantly strives to better her social status, even if by making a fool of herself and generally not succeeding in this endeavour. However, the other residents in her neighbourhood are not so charmed by her candlelit dinners or her extremely out of tune singing. She continually tries to hide the fact she is even related to her sister Rose and even more hides the fact that she knows her sisters husband Onslow and his messy ways. She tries to let the public know that she is a well dressed, respectable and upper class lady, and encourages knowledge of her sister Violet's owning a mercedes. I rate the series 9/10. Frankly the comedy is quite good. Whether it be a hilarious drive or a phone call to her son Sheridan demanding money of her, the characters and plots are all amusing. The humour combines a hint of slapstick in some memorable scenes with lashings of social satire and a pinch of dry wit.",/review/rw1525148/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2006,crazyanimals,10," Funniest woman on the planet
","I have been watching ""KuA"" faithfully for a few years now. I have to say that Great Britain has produced the two best actors in recorded history: Ricky Gervais,of ""The Office,"" and this wonderful lady. I apologize ahead of time to all of Lucille Ball's fans,but in my opinion,for what it's worth,there is no comparison between the two women. ""Hyacinth"" wins hands down.I never tire of her voice,or her physical comedy.Just tonight I was watching an episode,and actually choked on my drink because I was laughing so hard. Thank you BBCA,for airing this show daily. I understand Ms. Routledge is a national treasure in England,as well she should be. I only wish she was appearing in new episodes...it would have been interesting to see how Hyacinth changed,if at all.I simply adore her,and poor Richard,too. All of the regular actors who appear on the show are marvelous.I intend to buy every DVD set or single special episode of the series.",/review/rw1525148/?ref_=tt_urv
