","Really impressive first episode, packed with lot of action, excellent acting, you are at the edge of your seat waiting for the next scene and of course for the next episode.",/review/rw8341963/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2022,crisadassus,10," Good plot, good chapter!
","D√∂n√ºs York: Chapter 1. At first I thought it was very good, it shows us a reality that many of us only see through the news. The images and sound are combined very well generating a great impact. Very good the performances of all, as well as the costumes, the photographs and the locations. In my opinion, I have observed that interior and night scenes they look too dark, which deprives the viewer of a good vision. Engine Aky√ºrek's performance is excellent! I am pleasantly surprised to see him in this new role.",/review/rw8341963/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2022,irena_markova,10," Very interesting series on an important topic
","I just finished watching the first episode of Kacis. I had big expectations, and I have to say - the first episode was even better than I expected. Great story, topic that is important for the whole humanity, quality work, amazing acting (especially Engin Akyurek).",/review/rw8341963/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2022,jellybon,10," Excellent debut for Kacis
","Is not fair to judge a series after only one episode. First episode was a vey good start. Engin introduced us to a world that unfortunately exists in reality but which some treat with indifference. Kacis is not a Marvel Universe series. It is not a series that will make you dream of fairytale realms, fairies and enchanted princes. Kacis is a series that hits you hard with cruel reality. To see this series, you have to be prepared in advance, because it will explore the reality that some refuse to see, it will explore extremism, violence and the absurdity of war. It will explore the devastating effects on the human condition, it will explore the price paid by the brave to get out of the clutches of terrorism. The series is not for the faint of heart, so if you are not ready, avoid it.",/review/rw8341963/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2022,islamu-80752,10," In memoriam
","I would like to dedicate Ka√ßis to the memory of two Spanish war correspondents, Jos√© Couso and Julio Anguita who were killed in Iraq (2003) while doing their job reporting from the front line. Hypocritically we have become the audience of wars sitting comfortably on the sofa in our homes.",/review/rw8341963/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2022,muhammetozcelik-79695,9," The Frustration Of My Prejudice
","I started the first chapter with prejudice. It was not like the Turkish series I thought. I'm just saying that because I'm tired of the dramas with love. Frankly, I'm very glad that a dark theme is used. Feel the Thriller. The noir plans were very good. I'm looking forward to the next episodes.",/review/rw8341963/?ref_=tt_urv

14 June 2022,glossierbabeeee,10," Another masterpiece of Engin Aky√ºrek
","I just watched the first episode of Kacis and I'm extremely pleased by the quality of it. The music is simply amazing and adequate to the ambiance of the story. The cast as a whole is very good but Engin Aky√ºrek takes the prize. Waiting for the second episode already! A very deep and harsh story that needs to be told! We simply don't talk enough about the difficulties, struggles and dangers that war correspondents go through everyday at their jobs. A very interesting and important topic packed with action and suspense.",/review/rw8341963/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2022,applevol,8," Looking forward for more episodes!
","Such a good show! The best Disney+ original series that I've seen since so far! Amazing actors, photography and music! Really good first episode and looking forward to the next one! Engin Aky√ºrek and Irem Helvacioglu are simply outstanding. The whole story revolves around a very delicate topic and so far they've done a terrific job at explaining and showing every detail!",/review/rw8341963/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2022,alwaysaradhya,10," Amazing work of an amazing actor and an amazing writer : Engin Aky√ºrek
","The Ka√ßis is so amazingly portrayed that I don't know how to explain, but I'm literally shaking. But when I think of the people living in those conditions, I can't explain that feeling , Engin Aky√ºrek did a great job like always , bravo, I'm still under effect , I'm so proud he choose this topic. Actually I realize that we live under our comfort zone and litterally unaware that a different scary world exists. Well done man, it's really nice and impressive , waiting impatiently for the upcoming episodes . Its a must watch.",/review/rw8341963/?ref_=tt_urv

",It is one of the most impressive series that I have ever seen. I couldn't understand bad comments. Is it the indisputable truth that bothers you? It shows the darkness of the Middle East successfully. I cannot say anything bad about it.,/review/rw8341963/?ref_=tt_urv

16 June 2022,irinabazili,10," I am impressed!
","Normally I dislike war films, and avoid them but Escape nailed me before the screen! It is more about the human beings and the human nature in the war than about the war itself. Highly recommend it!",/review/rw8341963/?ref_=tt_urv

15 June 2022,somis-05575,4," The series had GREAT potential, but unfortunately FAILED to achieve it
","The overall storyline feels a bit slow. The scenario is mediocre, but it could have been much stronger and better. In some places, the writer's laziness is felt in the script. The story has small logical flaws, but the number of flaws is large.",/review/rw8341963/?ref_=tt_urv

3 August 2022,ayoubpablo,8," Finally good story
","The story is very expressive, the representation is wonderful, I have not seen a series with this enthusiasm for a long time. There are some negative ideas such as the treatment of women, but this does not make the series bad, I hope it continues for many seasons.",/review/rw8341963/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2022,akutay,3," An intelligently woven plagiarism
","A core asset screenplay motive of tragedy of Yazidi Women is anchored for a nicely regional marketing attempt. Perplexed with anachronic mines. A fertile production for the leading best-paid cast! An irony of an Oil & Gas giants Turkish commercial advertisement face! I am disappointed with the Lesseter Schools short sight for talent sourcing and scooting. Nevertheless cinematography (a.k.a. Photo Directing) along with literature thru lights is marvelous (Sound is also achieved Disney qualifications)! Maybe I over expected but a financial robust should be more creative, innovative and genius for this very fertile onlookers youngsters market! I still hold my wish for rewarding spark of surprise debuts and significant genuine productions! As said among Turks: You already have sugar, butter and.semolina? Well go ahead and make that 'Halwa'!",/review/rw8341963/?ref_=tt_urv
