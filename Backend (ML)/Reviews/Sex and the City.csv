4 April 2019,Tweekums,8," An interesting retelling of a classic fairy tale
","This live action Disney film shows the story of Sleeping Beauty from the other side; focusing on Maleficent, the 'evil' fairy who cursed her. As the story opens we are told how there are two neighbouring kingdoms; one of greedy humans and another of friendly magical folk. Maleficent is a young fairy who lives in the latter. One day she meets a human boy named Stefan. They become friends but ultimately he comes to see her less and less. The years pass and Maleficent grows up. Then the human king attacks the fairy realm but it thwarted by Maleficent. He promises his kingdom to the man who rids him of Maleficent; Stefan uses her trust to get close to her and then betrays her. He becomes king and has a daughter, named Aurora. On the day of her christening Maleficent places a curse on her... a curse that will take effect on her sixteenth birthday. She grows up in the care of three fairies and with Maleficent keeping a watchful eye to ensure nothing happens to her before the curse is due to take effect. Inevitably the day of her sixteenth birthday approaches and Maleficent starts to regret cursing Aurora; will anybody be able to prevent it happening or end it if it does occur?",/review/rw3024137/?ref_=tt_urv

","An interesting take on the classic fairy tale (and Disney movie/theme park sensation), this deliberate rewriting felt bold for Disney. The cinematography was also high quality.",/review/rw3024137/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2014,leonblackwood,7," Surprisingly Enjoyable! 7/10
","Review: I really thought that this was going to be a typical Disney movie about fairies and magic dust, but I really enjoyed it. Although the storyline is based around Sleeping Beauty, I found it quite dark with some adult content. The CGI throughout the movie looked impressive and Angelina Jolie played her part extremely well. After being betrayed by her loved one, she turns quite evil and full of hate, but once Aurora comes into the picture, you get to see an inner sweetness which made her character entertaining and a joy to watch. Pieced together with Sharlto Copley playing the villain, this movie really did have every aspect covered and I'm not surprised that it made so much money at the box office. A Great Watch!",/review/rw3024137/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have to admit, I was expecting this to be darker. The promotion they were making with this was all: this is not your usual bed night story. Well it kind of is. It might be a tad darker than the usual Disney inspired stories, but it's still not something that was made for adult (and that is a good thing) ... they should just stop promoting movies in a false light like that.",/review/rw3024137/?ref_=tt_urv

1 June 2014,StrongRex,1," This is NOT Maleficent
","I was genuinely excited to hear that Disney was going to make a film about Maleficent, my favorite Disney villain of all time. I was interested in knowing the 'why' behind her actions in Sleeping Beauty, since we never really got to see that. I will say that the cinematography is amazing. I will also say that while Angelina Jolie was not my first choice, she had the look, her costume was spot-on, and there are moments where you can see where she is at least trying to play this role correctly (and really, who could replace Eleanor Audley?). But one thing I've noticed over the past 10-15 years is that animation and design seem to be their main focus, rather than story or character development. In the movie, Maleficent's back story was incredibly rushed. So much for going into depth on why Maleficent is the way she is.",/review/rw3024137/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2019,ououzaza,8," fun enjoyable film with lots of weird characters' logic.
","Throughout the movie, there are a lot of weird logics. the beginning seems a bit rushed but it was ok. The Cinematography did a really good job. Stunning CGI. but for those who expected a Sleeping Beauty film, they might be disappointed.",/review/rw3024137/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2014,pradeep_christo,10," An excellent adaptation
","Every true fan of the original Sleeping Beauty (1959) was skeptical about this and how much it had to deviate from the actual movie, and as more of the movie was revealed, it was only proving to be another female empowerment, victimized villain kind of a movie. But I'm glad I was wrong, for I'm sure only by watching the whole movie can we truly appreciate and understand the very convincing back story and development the character was subject to. Of course with very liberal changes to the original plot, the key elements that you'd look for are intact. Need I mention the perfect casting of Angelina Jolie, Maleficent truly comes to life in full form by Angelina's stunning skills and presence. A twist that's not clich√©, sentiments that are deep, humor that's ever so natural and action that always keeps you at the edge of your seat! Maleficent in this movie is not exactly as we know of her from the few minutes we got to see her in the original movie, but let me tell you she's every bit deliciously evil. It was amusing to see Angelina play a role that requires a lot of nuances to pull of this character with a lot of depth as opposed to the one-dimensional character from the movie. Never letting off the grip, she carried the movie on her shoulders. Nothing to take away from the beauty of the rest of the movie which takes breath with excellent direction and visual effects that will truly transport you to another world, and the amazing work by all the 'supporting' actors. Yes, the other characters weren't as fleshed out as Maleficent, but I see that as good thing, given the title and theme. A spectacular balance. I'd also like to bring light on the enchanting score, thanks to James Newton Howard, this maestro is underrated.",/review/rw3024137/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2014,sastorytellerfilms,10," Better than the animated film...a masterpiece....
","Wife took me to see this just now on father's day. This is a cinematic masterpiece of storytelling. A film of visual beauty and fantasy. Takes you to that place The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings does with it's cinematography and music score. Angelina Jolie is magnificent and is still one of the top 10 greatest actresses in film. She delivers a grabbing emotional edge of both good and evil. I can't say anything more or it will be a spoiler but this movie will take you places few dare to take on chance on. This movie does not follow the standard predictable formula and it's nice to see a story that reinvents itself in a classic way. I will say this to all of the critics bashing this film ""retire and do us all a favor"". We need more films like this and Disney is blowing the lid off the honey pot and proving that we want more films like this with both story and visual effects. Steven Spielberg and other filmmaking legends should be so proud they are becoming more involved to set the industry back on track the way it should be. So much ""trash"" coming out to make studio money and leaving audiences simply drained of hollow storytelling. Bravo Disney and you guys keep doing them all like this and I promise you the money will come as a reward for it. This movie is right up there with Oz the Great and Powerful, Lord of the Rings, and other classic fantasy films. I will definitely be adding the director along with Angelina to my list of favorite producers and directors. This is exactly how you do it folks. This is filmmaking at it's absolute best. Malificient is a moving, gutsy, imaginative, visually stunning piece of priceless art. Anything lower than 10 stars feels like madness to me. Thank you for this film. ~ S A Storyteller",/review/rw3024137/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2014,cosmo_tiger,7," This was better then I was expecting but did take something away from the history of her. After watching this she isn't as scary
","""The story is not quite as you were told and I should know. For I was the one they called Sleeping Beauty."" Maleficent (Jolie) is a fairy that is loved be everyone in the Moor. When she stops a human from stealing from her land she thinks she has found a friend and her true-love. Little by little he begins to show up less and less. After an unsuccessful attack by the king on Maleficent's forest the King offers to name whoever can take her down as his successor. When he tricks her in order to take the throne Maleficent is bent on revenge, she aims her hatred at the one thing the new King cherishes most, his new daughter, Aurora (Fanning). I'll start with the one question everyone will have, this is not a straight kids movie like Sleeping Beauty was but it is also not as dark and adult as Snow White and the Huntsman. That said I thought it was better then I was expecting but my 11 year old daughter loved it. The only real problem with this movie is the same problem that caused the Star Wars movies to lose some of the magic. Maleficent is arguably the Darth Vader of the Disney Villains, I think of her as the darkest and most powerful of all of them. When the prequels came out and you saw his origin it took some of the mystique away and he no longer had the aura he had before. This one had the same effect, I don't want to give anything away but you will see what I mean when you watch it. Overall, a movie that is geared toward young teens but isn't terrible for adults. I give this a B.",/review/rw3024137/?ref_=tt_urv

28 May 2014,billygoat1071,5," Sympathy of the Villain
","Maleficent is ought to tell the backstory of one of Disney's most formidable villains. Definitely, there might be a dark truth about an innocent outcast transformed into the monster the villain is now famously known for. There could be a possible inspirations from famous tragedies into the drama. Meanwhile, when you somehow realize the fact that the person behind this project is only known for special effects, indeed you'll get the best looking blockbuster you'll see this year. Unfortunately, that wasn't supposed to be the key merit of this story. Maleficent suffers for the lack of gumption of portraying true darkness and depth that this tale calls for, which results a disappointing origins of the classic villain.",/review/rw3024137/?ref_=tt_urv
