30 April 2020,santoshambekar19,9," Netflix, make more of these
","Never have I ever is a Netflix original series on teenagers! I had been a little prejudiced to expect this as a typical stereotype of an Indian culture, however this seemed to be so good and realistic, if you leave still some stereotype stuff!
Typically American series or movies show a lot of stereotype stuff on Indians which either isn't true or a thing of the past and often turns out to be artificial!
But not Devi and her family in this one!
Watch it, you will love it!",/review/rw6023955/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2020,aishasocial,7," Relevant, light, fun and deep at the same time
","I'm a brown girl in my late 20s yet this show somehow feels relevant to me. I know exactly her feelings, been there,done that all of it, and I think that what's makes it special. Also, it tackles major issues including suffering the lose of a loving parent as a teen.
Great job!",/review/rw6023955/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2022,hadzsocial,9," I thought S3 was going to suck just because a lot of shows do
","I have loved this show since the first minutes of season 1 and always live in fear of its cancellation along with so many other great shows that have been axed lately. I guess I have cancellation trauma. Kidding aside, a lot of shows also tend to lose steam after a few seasons and I'm so glad S3 was fantastic, it's probably my favorite season yet.",/review/rw6023955/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2022,jnlurie,9," Mindy Kaling is a genius
","Never have I ever ... enjoyed a teen comedy as much as I do this show. Seriously. I'm a 48 year old man who started watching with my family thinking, ""I love Mindy Kaling, but there's no way she's winning me over here."" I was wrong. So, so wrong.",/review/rw6023955/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2020,akshayginodia9,8," A Refreshing Series
","Just finished watching ""Never Have I Ever"" on Netflix. Honestly, I started it because I wanted something light and fun (and I hadn't seen the trailers before). But this show turned out so much more than that and I am glad that it did. Not to say that it is not fun, but it's so much more than just a typical teenage comedy or a ""chick-flick"" as people call it, with a heavy emotional core.",/review/rw6023955/?ref_=tt_urv

28 April 2020,poppyemercer,10," Binged it and loved it!
","Unexpectedly, I really loved this show! I didn't start it with high hopes, thinking it would just be another classic American cringey high school show with perfect blondes and hunky guys. But I was very pleasantly surprised!",/review/rw6023955/?ref_=tt_urv

14 June 2020,lee_eisenberg,9," Ya know it!
","A family friend from India recommended ""Never Have I Ever"" to my parents and then they told me, so I've been watching it for the past week. So far I've liked every bit of it. I bet that lots of people go through these things, but the show makes it perfectly enjoyable. You're sure to love it.",/review/rw6023955/?ref_=tt_urv

29 April 2020,oreillypriya,7," Better than expected!
",It wasn't near the oustanding calibre of other shows I've watched but was still was fairly enjoyable. It had it's share of cliches and cringey moments but it managed to portray a touching story of a girl recovering from grief alongside her family. I did infact laugh a few times although some of the jokes were extremely awkward and cheesy. The characters were likeable with the exception of a couple who I found annoying and the plot was very predictable. But overall I binged the whole show and remained interested throughout every episode so I do reccomend.,/review/rw6023955/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2020,Bluechinaspecial,7," Enjoyable and Engaging Series With Some Flaws
","First, I love that the young woman they chose as the lead for this series is so relatable. She's a true girl next door. Not too pretty, she looks like one of your friends.",/review/rw6023955/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2020,anipolet,10," IT WAS EQUAL PART FUNNY AND EMOTIONAL
","The series was amazing, I knew it would be funny but it was so heartfelt. I legit binge watched the whole season and can't wait to see what happens next.",/review/rw6023955/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2020,pablopsaura,10," Surprisingly nuanced and well written teen dramedy.
","Teen drama has never been my genre of choice, I tend quiver at the thought of soapy melodrama. But Mindy Kaling's Never Have I Ever, despite ticking many boxes of an over-exploited genre, it manages breath new life into a tired genre and subvert long-running TV tropes, wisely blending pathos with moments of lightness and witty social commentary.",/review/rw6023955/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2022,badreviewer,8," Really enjoyed s3 ending!
","Until the very last 5 minutes I thought this season was OK at best. To be honest I think there were too many stories that they tried to fit in just 10 episodes, therefore things just happened and ended so quickly, some side stories started suddenly and didn't even end. Yet the last scenes in which Devi speakes to her mother and FINALLY understands that it is Ben who is right for her made the season for me. It was a good decision to cycle back to Devi's issues about her fathers death, I think this show is one of the best in terms of representing losing a parent that you loved so much. In most of the shows the dead parents are like figurants to the show, therefore you may not fully empathize with a character that lost their parent. But this show makes a great job on showing us how much of a good person, good husband and a good father Mohan was, how much he cared for Devi, how Devi loved him so much and therefore his death was too traumatizing for her. Except for the rushing pace because of the abundance of the stories in this season, I can say that it was still good and enjoyable. But I can't ignore the fact that the writers gave me two heart attacks making me believe into Ben totally forgot about Devi and is going to go out with that new girl... Not cool.",/review/rw6023955/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2020,Eggoreluckadman,8," Exactly what I expected...in a good way
","The trailer was a bit cringeworthy but it looked like it had heart. So after finishing the first season I was right on both counts. There's some cringeworthy dialogue, jokes, and acting, but the show does have heart and some layers. Also, as an Indian I felt it accurately represented Indian culture especially the balance of being an Indian-American. It reminded me of sex education but not as good it's definitely still a solid show and I would watch another season.",/review/rw6023955/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2020,vivitu,10," Loved it, come on S2!
","What a funny, sweet and heartwarming series. Loved the entire cast! Really excited to see what happens next.",/review/rw6023955/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2020,jessiebellavia,10," So ridiculously good!
","I shocked that this doesn't have a higher rating here. This is some of the best TV I've seen in a while. Great storylines, casting, humor and heart. By the end, I was weeping. I hope everyone does themselves a favor and goes and watches this asap. Thank you, Mindy Kaling, you wonderful delightful absurdly talented weirdo!",/review/rw6023955/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2020,Boxer_007,4," Baffled by the high score
","My expectations for ""Never Have I Ever"" were quite high given the unusually high IMDB score for the genre and the fact that it was created by Mindy Kaling. However, this was a huge flop for me. Extremely unoriginal plots (coming of age and sexuality stories seemed more early 2000's rather than 2020). Characters were incredibly dull and stereotyped despite the constant over-the-top acting attempts. Main character was irritating and spoiled, similar to Mindy's ""Champions"" show. It just felt like another quick-fix teen show touching upon the already familiar and overdone teen topics.",/review/rw6023955/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2020,Hellooo1234321,," Not bad, but too overrated.
",It's great to see a teen drama with an Indian-American girl as the lead. This breaks the stereotypical cycle of Indian-Americans a bit.,/review/rw6023955/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2020,chelsea-cankar,9," Feel good funny comedy that will make you laugh out loud
","I love a good high school comedy. Has made me LOL every episode can't wait for season 2! The commentator is amazing as well, he really makes it.",/review/rw6023955/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2020,Jacksonsev,8," Didn't expect anything less from writer Mindy Kaling
","Started watching the show at 10 PM and watched it straight until now (2:30 AM). Have to say this show was perfect for me because it had EXACTLY my type of humor. I couldn't stop laughing throughout (thank you Mindy Kaling)! I loved how different this show was compared to other shows and loved how culturally diverse it was! Though the performance was not amazing on the leads part, I still give it a pass because it was her first time acting in any movie/show (so quite good for a first time). I promise you won't regret watching! I cannot wait for the second season.",/review/rw6023955/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2020,robinparker311,5," Eh.
","I've never written a review for anything that I didn't really like but something about this keeps you watching even though it's mediocre at absolute BEST. I found myself eye-rolling at the ridiculousness of it, over and over.
The acting is not very good at all, especially the lead actress (it's as if she's just reading her lines from some teenage high school drama club play) & the storylines are somewhat more interesting but basically your standard 'kind of pretty but not popular/smart nerd girl tries to get in w the popular kids while dissing her true friends & family' story line. How many times have we heard that one before?",/review/rw6023955/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2020,scorpiogemini,1," A show about a girl connecting self value with sex.
","I agree with those who have given this show 1-2 stars. Its terrible with its stereotypes and unlikeable protagonist. What is most off-putting is though how the protagonist, is obsessed with losing her virginity, just to become cool. If the show is trying to send a message about ""you should not let your body and selfesteem be treated as trash and lay with the first person to say yes"", it fails terribly. But maybe this is a show trying to send the message that teenage girls should get layed to feel and be popular?",/review/rw6023955/?ref_=tt_urv
