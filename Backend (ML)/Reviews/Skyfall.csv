27 June 2006,jwhale9382,10," Awesome Superhero Show
","This show is awesome. Not just as a cartoon, but as a TV show in general. Unlike like its predecessor, Superfriends, Justice League is a more accurate description of the DC Universe and the characters in it. One of the show's best qualities is that many of DC's best, brightest and unsung heroes and villains are represented in it, not just the really popular ones. I give credit to this show for introducing me to some of the Flash's toughest villains (Mirror Master, Captain Cold, Captain Boomerang, Trickster and Gorilla Grodd). Another great quality of the show is that it's for everyone. As a cartoon, you might think that this show is only for kids. But these characters are so iconic and the stories are so well written and action-packed, that you don't need to be a kid to appreciate it.",/review/rw0790327/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2006,voicemaster71,10," Best DC Animated Show in History! Never Again Will We Ever See Such Greatness!!
","Of all the animated shows of DC Comics characters, never before has there been one as superb as Justice League/JLU. Now unlike lots of posters here, I loved the SuperFriends and you know what? I STILL love them. They represented the silver and bronze age period of comics and they served their purpose well in their time. BUT I WILL agree with everyone else that this series is what the SuperFriends should have been back then. JL/JLU blows the SuperFriends out of the water and out of the Hall of Justice so to speak. The biggest elements of the SuperFriends that I outgrew were those stupid teen tag along sidekicks and their even more stupid cartoon pets for comic relief. ",/review/rw0790327/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2006,garrard,9," A 'toon for the BOOMER in all of us!
","For those of us raised on George Reeves, Christopher Reeve, or ""Batman: The Animated Series,"" ""Justice League"" (or its latest incarnation, ""Justice League Unlimited"") is a god-send. It is a show that combines superhero daring-do with some witty dialog, intriguing story lines, and superb character interaction that is much more ""adult"" than most of the fare on Cartoon Network's prime time lineup.",/review/rw0790327/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2018,the_donnie,10," This is the true soul of DC heroes!
",I watched it when I was 11-12 years old. Now I'm 28 and it continues to be the best heroes series out there. Two seasons of pure joy! :),/review/rw0790327/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2001,Figaro-8,," JUSTICE LEAGUE Rules. Period.
","I knew this was going to be a good show, given the fact that Bruce Timm and the same team responsible for the WB/DC animated shows were doing it.",/review/rw0790327/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2008,bombo918,," I Can't Believe It
","I just started watching this cartoon and i think it is the best show i have ever seen. And now i find out that its been on for years and there is no more. Some of these episodes should be up for awards. No joke. I'm trying to think where i've been in the last 4 or 5 years. The episode Destroyer had the best writing for a cartoon. They put so much in a 30min show. And Justice League Unlimted puts some serious emotion in the writing, like when Superman goes off on on Darkside. That whole thing he says That man wont quit as long as he can still draw a breath, none of my teammate will.Me I have a different problem. I feel like I live in a world made of cardboard. Always taken constant care not to break something to break someone. Never allowing my self to lose control even for a moment because someone could die. but you can take it can't you big man. What we have here is rare opportunity for me to cut loose and show you just how powerful I really am...... That is the best thing ever in a cartoon.",/review/rw0790327/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2002,hypernode1,," Wow!
","YTV in Canada has been re-running ""Superfriends"", the Wonder Twin era crap, at 1am (PST). I decided to watch it for old times sake and was wondering why no one had taken the time to do it right - the ""Batman:TAS"" approach? Suffering from insomnia, and not wanting to watch ""Thunderbirds"" I surfed for a half hour and went back to YTV to see what they had on next and I was NOT disappointed.",/review/rw0790327/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2001,Op_Prime,," The Justice League is back for a new millennium.
","There hasn't been a show featuring these mighty heroes since 1985, but this show ain't no Super Friends. Like the Superman and Batman shows of the 1990s, Justice League has action, humor, creativity and terrific animation. Justice League acts more like the current comic book incarnation. The show stars the most powerful and well known characters from those comic books. Other familiar characters are bound to pop up from time to time. The characters have separate and distinct personalities, which can lead to some conflict and disagreement. That's good since it would be very boring if all the heroes agreed on everything and got along.",/review/rw0790327/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2003,broadfoot,," Gives The Hanna-Barbera Cartoons a Run For Their Money
","This version of Justice League is much better than the now very dated Hanna Barbera cartoons of the 1970s.  The way the characters are drawn are more faithful to the golden age comic books.  Also, the Wonder Woman on this show is beautiful and rates second on my list to Lynda Carter's portrayal of the heroine.  I'm surprised Lynda didn't add her voice to the show as Queen Hippolyte.  As for the other characters, perhaps Batman is a bit of a know-it-all and The Flash is perhaps a few pumpkins short of a pie, but still this is the best cartoon to show up here on Canadian TV in a long time!",/review/rw0790327/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2018,mhorg2018,9," One of the best cartoons ever.
","DC Animation is one of the best animation companies today. They consistently do the best Superhero toons, leaving all others in the dust. Great voices and stories, this is well worth watching again and again. It got even better when it became Unlimited.",/review/rw0790327/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2006,Karolynnkt,10," A Series with a Marvelous Script
","I have been a Justice League fan since its premier on Cartoon Network. I considered it vastly superior to ""Superfriends"" and the episode plots are well written.",/review/rw0790327/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10," I am running out of words to describe how good this show is!
","I have a real interest in superheroes and in animation, with both together this had all the ingredients to be at least a good show. And it was, no more than that, it is a brilliant show, and one of the best superhero series ever made. Personally I think Batman:The Animated Series just beats it, but Justice League is without a doubt one of the most original, ambitious and deep animated shows out there.",/review/rw0790327/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2008,Angelus2,10," ""What like super-friends?""
","I loved the three part of the pilot. The show united some of the great heroes of DC together. All the characters are lovable and seem to have great chemistry, the story lines are very 'grown-up' especially for a children's show. What amazes me is that even though this is a kids show it can easily attract older fans like me, who when this show was running was in his mid teens.",/review/rw0790327/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2007,Dream_seeker,10," A great treat to the DC universe and a thrill ride animation....
","I have to admit when looking at shows like X-men and X-men: Evolution, or Spiderman they are good but when compared to a show like DC's Justice league and JL: Unlimited which began on cartoon network around 2001-2006 and during these years they don't hold a candle to great story driven characters and superb action sequences that feels like you're right in the middle of watching a movie fitted just for T.V.",/review/rw0790327/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2019,Animany94,10," An unforgettable show.
","I remembered watching Justice League back in the day. I wasn't more than 10 years old when I first saw it on the small screen, but even though so many years passed and I didn't have much to do with it or other superhero shows it still holds up and more to this day.",/review/rw0790327/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2022,crazelord,10," Unpopular opinion: I like it better than JLU
","Mind you, they're both excellent. I have JLU as a 9 and this is a 10. My reasoning is that once this show got it's stride (and stops nerfing Superman), it's just some of the best character writing I've ever seen in a show. Basically every story being a multiparter allows it to take it's time to build out the stakes and character motivations.",/review/rw0790327/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2007,kec_jesusfreak,," Wow!
","I've got to say, Justice League is probably one of the best cartoons out there. I love the way they portrayed all the characters; in fact, many of them were better than the originals. I especially liked Batman, J'onn, and Flash- The Bat's stand-offishness fit so well, J'onn's voice and manner of speech were wonderful, and Flash's mix of cockiness and airheadedness was perfect (not to mention *his* voice, which makes me squeal in fangirly joy, haha). The villains were well-done, and Wonder Woman and Hawk Girl just own'd. XD You wouldn't think a teenager would get much joy out of a cartoon, right? But I did. It had some surprisingly grown-up themes, pretty deep ideas. I only have one bad thing to say about this cartoon: It ended too soon.",/review/rw0790327/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2013,scottyent,7," Yeah it's pretty good if you accept it's a cartoon
","Do I enjoy this show? Yes. It is the first cartoon like it that I have watched (in that it has many super heroes), so I can't compare it to something like Super Friends. However, when I started watching the show, perhaps I had the wrong expectation. After all, it is a kids show and a cartoon. I had grown somewhat used to the blockbuster movies such as Iron Man, Dark Knight, etc, that gave superheroes SOME level of consistency. To me, that is really the only thing that a superhero really needs: consistency.",/review/rw0790327/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2019,Cuttheshit,10," The Best Adaptation of DC Superhero mythology!
","This was in my opinion best tv series in the entire DCAU Which spanned during 1992 -2006 ,It was full of adventure,action,great storytelling and suprisingly romance ,which I guess make this show a masterpiece among other animated tv series.Whtever Animation was impressive,cast was great,stories were wonderful.I mean the Finale of the show kept me in edge of my seat,it was one of the greatest episode I had seen in tv.If you haven't already checked this amazing show Please watch This tv series deserves Your valuble time for sure.",/review/rw0790327/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2019,mitsubishizero,9," One of the greatest cartoons ever made
","This's a great update of the Justice League. The animation's great, the stories are interesting and the characters are well developed and interesting to watch. They have great chemistry and when they interact with each other it's believable. I feel like the fight scenes are cool to watch though they can get a little repetitive (The hero fights a villian(s), gets defeated then has a rematch where they triumph afterwards). They may get injured a few times but still manage to get back up and continue fighting. The animation still holds up today. Sometimes the characters seem a little stiff when they talk or emote but the backgrounds and colors still look good and are cool to watch.",/review/rw0790327/?ref_=tt_urv

7 August 2017,sundevilemily,10," I have always loved each episode of the Justice League since I was a kid
","I remember every Saturday morning when I was a kid,Justice League always played a lot on Cartoon Network or on Boomerang.I was always a fan of the main seven of the Justice League(Superman,Batman,Wonder Woman,Green Lantern/John Stewart,The Flash/Wally West,Martian Manhunter,and Hawkgirl. The seven of them are my favorite version of the founding members of the Justice League.And the Batman and Wonder Woman romance is very cute and I loved how lots of the episodes of the show dived deep into how each of the characters have a tough backstory and when it came back to them,working as a team really helped them out.And the sequel series Justice League Unlimited I also really enjoyed,I felt like the show was just like it's predecessor except the Justice League expanded to become just like a sports league with different teams and players except it's of superheroes in a league where there are different episodes of team ups.And I love the Justice League(2001) series and it's sequel more than Young Justice which I am not that huge of a fan of that show anymore.",/review/rw0790327/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2020,amiranda-39274,9," The Perfect Superhero show: Complete Series Analysis
","For as long as I can remember, this show and these heroes have been apart of my life from childhood to my current 20s, and most likely for the rest of my life. This tv series stems from interconnected shows called the dc animated universe or DCAU for short. Starting from batman the animated series, which was the inception for this entire animated enterprise. It is honestly the gold standard for the dc universe in this media outside of its source material. Its what introduced me to numerous DC characters, and whether they were A list or D list they made me fall in love with this universe. This show displays passion for these characters and stories that elevates it far above just being a cartoon made for kids, it makes it an experience. This show is so good that if I even see a clip from it, I am immediately compelled to binge watch all of it. Which just happened since I watched J reviews on the entire DCAU, I decided to binge watch the show with some friends starting from batman the animated series to justice unlimited, and I will be giving my retrospective on it.",/review/rw0790327/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2003,TheMan3051,," Mixed Reaction!
","This is in my opinion a television show which sometimes features a great episode and at other times a horrible episode. The reason I think this is because DC characters really aren't that good. Marvel Comics has a terrific gallery of great characters like Spider-Man, X-Men, Daredevil, Fantastic Four, Captain America, among others. DC comics however doesn't feature that great of a gallery. While characters like Batman, Superman, Flash, and Martian Manhunter are outstanding characters. The rest I don't consider to be that good! However, the show has managed to surprise me, in the episode featuring Aguaman I was surprised to see the major improvements done with the post crisis Aguaman. Now he's a cool character!",/review/rw0790327/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2003,Sargebri,," Finally, They Got it Right
","This is probably the best television adaptation of the Justice League since their days as a back-up feature on the old Aquaman series.  The only thing that's different about it is that there is no Black Canary, no Zatana, no Elongated Man, no Atom, no Green Arrow and no Hawkman.  Also, they do not use either the Hal Jordan Green Lantern (the one most people in my age range are familiar with).  However, this is a far cry from the godawful Wendy, Marvin, Wonder Dog or even the Wonder Twins.  This is just a show for the people who are love the comic book.",/review/rw0790327/?ref_=tt_urv
