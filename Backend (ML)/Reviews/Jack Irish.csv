30 October 2021,ryanwinning1,9," I am appalled by the 5.8 rating
","I remember watching ""The Wolfman"" in theaters and being blown away by how well done this film was and then years later seeing on IMDB that it only scored a 5.8 rating and just scratching my head wondering if I missed something. Now I'm 2021 I Just rewatched it on Netflix and it's still a phenomenal movie! Absolutely incredible! I can't imagine how this movie could have been any better! I believe this movie should be rated along the same lines as ""Sleepy Hallow!"" I give it a 9/10!",/review/rw5796301/?ref_=tt_urv

17 January 2014,SBenoit5,10," Highly underrated masterpiece
","I really don't understand all the bad reviews of this movie. The only explanation that I can figure out is that those people watched it with a lot of expectations and they did not found what they were looking for, or they just went to see that movie being in the wrong mood I must admit that I had to watch it twice in order to give it a 10 out of 10. The first time I gave a 7. The second time I really watched it with a clear mind and I really was able to appreciate each frame of it The actors are perfect, the camera framing is a delight to watch, the costumes are fabulous and each line of the script is well written. It is rare that I give a higher rating at a second viewing, but this movie is that kind of masterpiece",/review/rw5796301/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2018,classicsoncall,7," ""I am what they say I am. I'm a monster.""
","Viewers at IMDb have not been kind to this film with a 5.8 rating (as I write this). I didn't think it was all that bad, with an intriguing story line and Rick Baker's special effects to bring the wolf men of the story to life. The segue of Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) spending some time in an asylum for a year after witnessing his father (Anthony Hopkins) slitting his mother's throat made for some creepy background to their conflicted relationship. The darkness of the sets add to the sense of foreboding once we know what will happen to Lawrence after he's bitten by his Dad, the half man/half wolf creature who's destined to kill the ones he loves. The one thing I'd criticize would be some of those sequences that show the wolf men on all fours during an attack; those scenes looked a little clunky to me. Something the picture didn't make any hay out of was the eventual fate of Scotland Yard detective Francis Aberline (Hugo Weaving). Seems to me he was a candidate to become a wolf man in waiting once he got slashed during his brief encounter. The look on his face said the worst was yet to come if anyone had an idea about a sequel.",/review/rw5796301/?ref_=tt_urv

17 September 2016,suite92,9," Even better than the superb The Wolf Man (1941).
","The initial tableau: Lawrence's mother dies during his childhood in the village of Blackmoor. This traumatizes him; his wealthy father sends him to an asylum, then exiles him to New York. Years later, Gwen (Lawrence's brother's fiancée), finds him in New York and begs him to return to Blackmoor to aid in locating his missing brother. Back in England, Lawrence learns that his brother is dead from mauling by an animal. In this sad setting, Lawrence tries to renew his relationship with his estranged father, Sir John. This works to some degree, but Lawrence himself is bitten. He survives, which is unfortunate, as it turns out.",/review/rw5796301/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2010,The_Fifth_Echo,8," A Worthy Remake, Very Dark.
","I saw ""The Wolfman"" in special screenings Sunday and to be truly honest, I didn't know what to expect. I saw the original 1941 version and I really liked it and it is a classic. I was afraid that the new remake would of been very tacky and that was my biggest concern. But I have to say after I watched this movie. I was very impressed. Benicio Del Toro (An Oscar Winner) portrays the role very well and believable. The cast is very well known with people such as Emily Blunt and the great Anthony Hopkins. They don't technically give ""Oscar Worthy performances"", but their acting certainly is very believable. The movie oozes mysteriousness and the very Dark mood of it makes it very enjoyable. But the movie has some flaws like the story is not original and has been portrayed at least a million times. Also there are ""some"" tacky parts in the movie, but they aren't very important at all. So my overall consensus about the ""Wolfman"" is that it is a worthy remake the 1941 classic and it will gain many new fans.",/review/rw5796301/?ref_=tt_urv

12 February 2010,freaky_dave,5," Disappointed, but the movie had a few merits
","The Wolfman started out well. I enjoyed the atmosphere of the movie, and it seemed to be building towards something for the first thirty minutes or so, but then all of the sudden it lost its way with a lack of imagination and a predictable ending. That is why I can only give it a 5 out of 10 or in other terms about ** out of ****.",/review/rw5796301/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2010,JimSun444,7," No more and no less than expected
","Every once in a while, a movie comes along with what many people would call perfect casting. I remember when Jack Nicholson was first cast as the Joker for Tim Burton's Batman. Nicholson's portrayal was just what was expected from such a great actor in a signature role. But it was NO MORE than we expected from him. In a way, one could say it fell a little flat. Well, I feel that way about The Wolfman. First, Anthony Hopkins, one of the consistently best actors out there, gave the exact performance I would expect from him, commanding respect both as an actor and as the character he played. But it was nothing we haven't seen already. Reminiscent of Meet Joe Black or Fracture or Instinct. I'm also a fan of Benicio Del Toro, but his brooding and emotional performance was exactly what I went to the theater to see. I didn't see anything more. The same could be said for the script, a very straightforward storyline that was a bit predictable and sort of tired. On one hand, I commend the film makers for not overdoing the story with convoluted twists in an effort to be ""original."" But again, I wasn't surprised by anything in the storyline at all.",/review/rw5796301/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2010,C-Younkin,7," Benicio and production design a winner
","""The Wolfman"" is a perfect choice for updating. So much of the 1941 flick rested on good production and make-up design and now we have this lush remake from director Joe Johnston and screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker. The plot comes up a little short but for the most part they've created an awesome-looking film that also comes in just right in the spooky/gory department.",/review/rw5796301/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's a decent horror/Wolfman movie. Great cast , story moves along at a decent pace. It's not an Oscar winning movie but to have a universal exec say it's one of the 2 worst movies universal ever made, other being babe pig in the city.

","I have to admit, that the whole developing story and the whole negative energy surrounding the movie, almost made me not wanting to see this. It seemed to be so bad, that the question would be: Why bother? A director had gone AWOL to do something else (even if there was no ""bad blood"" as everyone says, excuse the pun), a new one got hired, the production got delayed, re-shoots this, re-shoots that. How could this even be remotely any good then?",/review/rw5796301/?ref_=tt_urv

","THE WOLFMAN is one of these films that you know is going to be a great disaster long before you see it . Directed by Joe Johnston a typical Hollywood journey man type of director the film's initial release was supposed to at the tail end of 2007 but was pushed back several times and released in Febuary 2010 where it was met by lukewarm reviews . Its cause wasn't helped that the main criticism was a disjointed , underdeveloped screenplay but now that the DVD has been released with an additional 17 minutes could THE WOLFMAN be rehabilitated ?

","I give it four for its excellent Gothic atmosphere, but this is a film that is markedly inferior to the 1941 original. You would think Universal would be more careful with its treasure chest of monsters, but after duffing up The Mummy they've not done well by their hairiest monster. I won't go into the story much, other than to say it somewhat resembles the original but has many major changes.",/review/rw5796301/?ref_=tt_urv

","Gory, gory hallelujah! This remake of a classic, that's been forever in the making, has finally arrived! Admittedly, I became aware of this film rather late in the game (ie. last year) and was unaware of all the troubles surrounding it. I think that if I'd been anxiously awaiting the release of this film as long as others have, I'd be quite a bit disappointed with the final result. As it stands, this film isn't at all 'bad', it's just that it's not quite up to the standard I'm sure a lot of people were hoping for.",/review/rw5796301/?ref_=tt_urv

12 February 2010,TheFinalAlias,7," Everything a (Monster)kid could want!
","Remakes, especially of horror films, generally tend to fall into three categories: 1)Crap. 2)Improvement. 3)Ones which improve on some things, but aren't so effective at others. This film is a textbook example of #3; it manages to come up with a remarkably clever twist on the original's plot which ties together a lot of disparate elements of the original and fleshes out character back-story. But it also fails at capturing the magic of the original's themes, or comes up with great new ideas, but does little with them. For example, here we are given a plausible back-story for Larry Talbot(Benicio Del Toro, who looks like a cross between Lon Chaney Jr & Oliver Reed)'s estrangement from his father, Sir John(something only vaguely explained in the original), a traumatic event in his childhood which builds up sympathy for him, and a plausible reason for why everyone dislikes and suspects him(he was once committed to an asylum in his youth). But the pathos Lon Chaney Jr built up in the original was based off of how no one believed him and thought he was insane; here, he gets caught after his first night out! A major theme in the original, subtly handled(not often you can say subtle discussing a Universal horror film)was how Sir John was inadvertently the film's real villain for his terrible parenting; here, Sir John flat out IS the villain!!! Another example of this problem comes from this version's handling of Larry's romance with Gwen(Emily Blunt); it comes up with a plausible reason for why she falls in love with him so swiftly(she was engaged to his deceased brother, who he reminds her of), but their romance doesn't come into play until late into the film, so no one really cares by that point.",/review/rw5796301/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2010,dbjdpb,10," I really liked it
","Being in the late 50's in age, I grew up on Universal horror and truly love the originals. But I have to say this remake exceeded my expectations. There are many suspenseful moments and the movie makers seem to have a clear grasp of what the objective was. Also there is a clear difference between a Hollywood werewolf (looks like a big wolf on two legs) and a ""Wolfman."" The wolf-man looks like an indistinguishable combination of both. A monster. I like the werewolf movies but this tops the bill. Forget the professional critics. They get paid to say negative things and most often don't seem to know what they are talking or writing about. If you like this type of stuff, it is top shelf. I may see it again.",/review/rw5796301/?ref_=tt_urv

","THE WOLFMAN remake bombed when initially released in 2010. Initial reviews would have you believe it was the worst movie ever. A classic monster fan, I avoided it for a long time and only watched it when it was lent to me by relatives who enjoyed it.
