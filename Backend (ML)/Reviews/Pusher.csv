22 April 2019,kosmasp,7," Kyrie Drew
","I have to admit, I loved the ads when I first saw them a couple of years. What ads some might ask. The ads where Kyrie Irving played a fictional character called ""Uncle Drew"". I don't know how staged they were or if especially the first one people actually knew that under all that (really well done) makeup, was one of the best ballers - Kyrie.",/review/rw4365563/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2018,Jared_Andrews,5," A Movie for Basketball Fans and Young Hoop Dreamers
","Uncle Drew is based on a series of Pepsi Max advertisements that began in 2012, which introduced its titular character. A feature-length film based on a few television-length ad spots should spell disaster and may appear to be nothing more than a cash grab. Yet, surprisingly, it works. ",/review/rw4365563/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2018,jtizzlejt,9," What a Sports Comedy should be!
","Great movie that had a lot of comedy, but NBA and basketball lovers would really understand the jokes. Overall, if you haven't watched it yet, you NEED to watch it!",/review/rw4365563/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2018,charlie-krausse,5," Uncle Drew laughs and dunks but is very predictable
","What started out as a Pepsi Max commercial then evolved to a YouTube chapter has now taken its next step in evolution... an Uncle Drew movie. For those who haven't seen the original commercial, think Grandmama from the early '90s. Instead of Larry Johnson, insert Kyrie Irving who 'philosophises' youngbloods on the game of basketball and how it should be played.",/review/rw4365563/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2018,orellana_ut,8," Not bad
","I'm a basketball fan, this movie was funny, and had a lot of celebrities in it. I enjoyed it.. wasn't bad.. chris Webber is awesome as the preacher, the chase scenes were funny... done expect an Oscar for best picture like some of these other ridiculous reviews were expecting a masterpiece.. it's a comedy calm down.. it was fun movie for the whole family..",/review/rw4365563/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2018,cricketbat,3," An unfunny joke that takes way too long to tell
","You know that uncle who likes to make unfunny jokes and then you have to force a laugh so he'll stop repeating the punchline? That's Uncle Drew. It takes a semi-amusing premise and stretches it out way too long. Plus, there's far too many attempts at drama in this silly comedy based on a Pepsi commercial.",/review/rw4365563/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2018,White_Prophet,7," Fun for basketball fans of all ages - 72% (Pretty Good)
","I'll admit, even though I'm a huge basketball fan, I went into this movie with very low expectations. The trailers didn't entice me much and the movie itself didn't start off too strong for me. However, as the story progressed, it got funnier and I was having a pretty good time! I was pleased to see that the movie had some heart to it, with some good messages towards the end. Lil' Rel Howery and Tiffany Haddish were pretty much the only strong performances, but you're not really looking for good acting in a cast comprised mainly of NBA players.
Overall, Uncle Drew is a pretty predictable movie that doesn't do anything particularly special, but one that made me laugh, smile, and ultimately won me over.",/review/rw4365563/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2020,canuckteach,8," A lot of fun...
","Ok-I admit I watched this 'on spec' after seeing the UNCLE DREW clips on YouTube (you know they dress Kyrie Irving up as an old man, Uncle Drew, & send him out to play street ball
With the young guys, ehðŸ˜Š?). So, I invested $$ in renting the movie, and it is a lot of fun. There's a few touching moments, but it's not overly sentimental. Some aging former NBA stars (Reggie, Shaquille, etc.) are made up to look even older, but these guys can still shoot. Irving is maybe 28, but looks like a convincing pensioner.",/review/rw4365563/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2018,rannynm,9," Pretty funny underdog sports film. Great for families!
","Uncle Drew is a very funny, underdog sports film. While I am unfamiliar with all the NBA and WBA stars, I enjoyed the film because I related to the feelings and thoughts of the senior athletes. The use of make-up and prosthetics makes it even funnier. ",/review/rw4365563/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2018,mildredwalters,8," Laugh Out Loud Funny
","A senior citizen, I went to this movie with my 29 year-old daughter and 13 year-old granddaughter. We all had our laugh out loud moments during the movie.It's fun and appealing. I can't think of anything not to like. Even the despicable characters were so extreme you had to like them. If you go to the movie for the fun of it-not to critique-you will enjoy.",/review/rw4365563/?ref_=tt_urv

7 August 2021,docm-32304,8," All That a Comedy Should Be
","It's so hard to find a good old fashioned comedy these days with all the crass and vulgar garbage being passed off as humor. BUT, this one mails it. This is a comedy about the seniors not being counted out, similar to movies like Space Cowboys, Hot Flashes et al. It starts off slow, but once they get into the van, the hilarity starts and goes right to the end. Good writing and excellent performances by all, delivers.",/review/rw4365563/?ref_=tt_urv

4 May 2019,headheadhead-46127,8," Surprisingly Enjoyable
","I found Uncle Drew, to my surprise, wildly entertaining. I felt the cast choices of former NBA/WNBA players was perfect and they seemed to mesh well. In my opinion, Uncle Drew has the potential to became one of those lower budget cult classics.",/review/rw4365563/?ref_=tt_urv

21 March 2019,bobarobbob1,8," 3 pointer
","If you want a funny sports film with a great cast and lots of heart this one is for you. The moral is a bit too on the nose but still enjoyable even in it's predictability. The cast chemistry was palpable and you could tell they had fun making the movie while still taking it seriously enough to avoid being too goofy. I would have been just as happy without the nudity, some things you can't unsee, but even that was done with a sense of fun. One last thing, the incredible ability and grace of all the athletes would have been enough to make the movie worth watching once but the humor and heart will definitely bring me back again.",/review/rw4365563/?ref_=tt_urv

10 October 2019,muamba_eats_toast,7," Enjoyable family fun
",A film the whole family can enjoy some great laughs and set pieces other times it's slightly average but had enough laughs to get by without breaking any new ground and being a tad forgettable. Perfect viewing on a weary Sunday night.,/review/rw4365563/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2018,Pwillsborgstede,7," Much funnier than I anticipated
","Based on trailer had no plans to ever see this movie. So glad a friend ordered it on pay per view. Tell you up front that the storyline is trite and cliche ridden. Also tell you up front that the movie is much funnier than I anticipated. First half of the movie has belly laugh, laugh out loud lines sprinkled liberally throughout. Second half the hand sprinkling the laughs is a bit restrained. Perhaps there should be an early disclaimer that some of the laughs require some level of basketball and cultural insider knowledge. Not sure the quick ""watch your tone"" would resonate unless you've also heard ""you better take that base out your voice."" Do not go in thinking that you are going to see ground breaking cinema. What you will see and hear in this movie is great basketball players not taking themselves seriously (imagine that), cultural references that take you back to the day, music that reminds that old school music hasn't always been about sampling, and just enough ball that you can say that this is a basketball movie.",/review/rw4365563/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2018,spicyjackroasts,6," Basketball brought alive
","When I watched this movie back in August, it just made me even more happy and glad I played the game of basketball as well. Also it was cool to have Kyrie Irving, Lisa Leslie, Shaquille O'neal, Chris Webber, Nate Robinson and Reggie Miller as stars of the movie. It was so cool that they would work together taking time away from basketball, retirement, etc to make an all around great movie.",/review/rw4365563/?ref_=tt_urv

2 July 2018,jon.h.ochiai,8," It's About the Love, Youngblood
","""Uncle Drew"" is not near one of the best movies of the year. However, it's the most fun I've had at the movies so far this year. Absolutely. Watching NBA All-Star Kyrie Irving, Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal and other NBA greats in grey beard old-geezer makeup is hysterical. Especially, when the ""Seniors"" school street ballers on the basketball court. Kyrie is surprising hilarious gravitas as fictional ESPN 30 for 30 street basketball legend Uncle Drew, who mysteriously disappeared after his Team's tragic collapse in the Rucker Classic Finals in 1968. Never heard from again, until now 2018. Predictable? Yes. Genuine? Amazingly so.",/review/rw4365563/?ref_=tt_urv

",Uncle Drew (Kyrie Irving) is a legendary basketball player from Harlem who is remembered by all the old-timers. Dax (Lil Rel Howery) loses his Rucker team and gets kicked out by his girlfriend Jess (Tiffany Haddish). He is penniless with no team. He's at a neighborhood court when he witnesses Uncle Drew take down an arrogant youngster.
