2 August 2018,richard-1787,10," A remarkably imaginative, creative movie
","This movie could have been very preachy. It deals with a middle-aged woman who is very concerned about the effects of industry on the Icelandic environment and decides to take a very active role in opposing it, sabotaging efforts to create a new aluminum processing plant. All very PC.",/review/rw5121037/?ref_=tt_urv

","While the narrative may not physically reflect the lengths most of us would go to, it certainly promotes the psyche that anyone with a shimmer of a conscious about the ecosystems of the earth would or should feel. Enjoy it for what it is, a fight against the forces that see profit above people and the planet, twinned with a sweet and sentimental heart driven right through its centre.",/review/rw5121037/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Woman at war"" it is a story about strong female who trying to do all she can, at any price, in order to save her homeland ecosystem. She is in partisan war against big technological giant who pollute her land.
 I give my salute and an applause to Halldóra Geirharðsdótti for her amazing performance both twins sisters Halla and Asa. The way how Halldóra run on Icelandic mounts and survice in wild nature would make to envy every single trail runner in the world together with Bear Grylls. 
Of course Cinematograph - Bergsteinn Björgúlfsson. The camera of this man shows magnificent landscapes of Iceland. I know it was shown many times ago in many movies. But in ""Woman at the war"" we don't see warm and green Iceland, as well as cold and snow land of Vikings. No we see foggy and grey tons, but this fact doesn't bring shade to Mr. Björgúlfsson work. Because the weather and colors of nature represent mood of protagonist.
If you look at main banner of this film you may find hidden symbol. Treble clef. Because music is playing very important, or even A Key role in the movie. When Halla takes an actions and fights against police, government and spies systems we can hear\see her feelings & mood ""in hands"" of Icelandic music trio (Drumms\Sousaphone\Pianist &accordion). When, suddenly, in her life appears a hope, that somewhere in Ukraine there is a small girl (Nika) who lost her parents, at the war, from that moment, every single thought of Nika create for Halla a group of three Ukrainian choir singers. During all actions and all circumstances main heroine participate in, we see those 6 musicians represents different sides, and always split. But only at the end, we saw all of them standing together, when Halla and Nika finally met. I think these unity of different music styles together shows that Halla has finally find a peace in her life.
This movie have everything. Good Acting performance. Great - cinematography. An Amazing music. Without any doubts - One of the best movies of 2018.",/review/rw5121037/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2019,paul-allaer,8," Playful yet intense comedy-drama from Iceland
","""Woman At War"" (2018 release from Iceland; 104 min.) brings the story of Halla. As the movie opens, Halla in sabotaging the power lines nearby a Rio Tinte plant somewhere in Iceland, causing an overall power outage. The police are out looking for the perpetrator, and she manages to evade the police chopper, but just barely. Meanwhile back in her regular life, she is a community choir director. Then one day, she receives a letter that her adoption request from 4 years ago, finally has been approved: a little girl from Ukraine awaits her! But how can she reconcile this with her environmental activism? At this point we are less that 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.",/review/rw5121037/?ref_=tt_urv
21 April 2019,gcsman,8," A total pleasure to watch: engaging, serious, eccentric, and fun.
","Halla (played by Halldora Geirhardsdottir), a middle-aged Icelandic woman leading a seemingly ordinary life, is secretly a fierce eco-warrior. Staying completely off the radar, she conducts lone daring missions of sabotage against a big industrial plant that is endangering the environment of her region and her entire country. Her weapons of choice are small-scale explosives, and bow and arrows. The bare bones of this plot sound like just the sort of thing for a Hollywood action film, but Woman at War is stylistically so different, so NOT Hollywood that it inhabits practically a different universe. And it's all the better for that. We care about what's going on on the screen, and about the protagonist Halla, far more here than we ever would for things like Mission Impossible or Fast and Furious or the Bond films or a dozen other franchises like them which are basically just eye candy.",/review/rw5121037/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2018,guy-bellinger,9," A lady, a bow, arrows and aluminium
","A virtuous man alone against the system, there has been a lot on the silver screen, particularly when it comes to American movies where the figure of the individual hero is set, in accordance with the American ethos, as the paramount role model. From early cinema till today, examples abound, among the most seminal ""The Life of Emile Zola"", ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"", ""The Setup"", ""Harvey Milk"" come to mind, but they are but a few samples of a practically endless list. By contrast, their female equivalents can be counted on the fingers of one hand: women fighting alone like Sally Field (""Norma Rae"") or Julia Roberts (""Erin Brokovich"") are the exceptions that prove the rule. But, well, The Times Are-A-Changin', as Bob Dylan once sang and are slowly acquiring (not everywhere alas!) the role they deserve. A point illustrated by this excellent Icelandic film, aptly titled 'Woman at War', offering the striking portrait of a modern-times female warrior, the wonderful Halla, played by the equally awesome actress Halldóra Geirharðsdóttir (""Regina!"", ""Of Horses and Men""). Inventively directed by Benedikt Erlingsson (the author of the already mentioned ""Of Horses and Men""), it may well become a cult classic.",/review/rw5121037/?ref_=tt_urv

","Positives:
I did like the Gandhi & Mandela non-violent posters. The focus on future generations of humans & Earth (not something of interest to our top U.S. politician), and the namaste shout out of greeting your inner holy goodness vs. your outer appearance. The embedding of Iceland & Ukrainian musicians and the foreign tourist were oddly amusing. Not sure what the symbolism might have been.",/review/rw5121037/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2019,Top_Dawg_Critic,5," Too much filler, little substance. This film should have been a short.
","Wow was this film dragged out. The slow pace made the 101 min runtime feel like 3+ hours. There was too much filler for such a simple story, that 70% of this film should have been left on the cutting room floor.",/review/rw5121037/?ref_=tt_urv

","The film works well on an absurdist or symbolic level, but certainly not on a literal level. She's fighting the good fight against corporate pollution, but if this were reality rather than an absurdist film, she'd probably be hurting the environment, not helping it.",/review/rw5121037/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2019,Horst_In_Translation,6," This journey to Iceland is very much worth the time
","""Kona fer í stríð"" is a relatively new Icelandic movie from 2018 that already garnered a pretty solid amount of awards recognition. It runs for 100 minutes approximately and was written and directed by Benedikt Erlingsson, his second full feature non-documentary and from what I saw here he is also a pretty prolific actor. But now to this movie. The main character is played by Halldóra Geirharðsdóttir and the name tells you of course that she is also Icelandic as is the rest of the cast pretty much, so don't worry if you have never come across any of the cast members here. You don't need to in order to enjoy the watch. By the way, the lead actress also plays the character that is the main character's identical twin sister, so she is really in each and every scene here, sometimes twice in fact. This film is about eco-terrorism, not only, but that is very much at the center of it all. And despite how likable the main character is depicted here, it should not be forgotten that she is a criminal and not just a petty thief or so. Her actions cause millions of dollars damage to companies and to the country. So no surprise the police is constantly after her. It is also interesting to discuss how much she maybe loves the thrill of it all, but actually I believe it is more about the message and her motivations really than about a need for thrill. It is also a bit of an addiction you could say because even after she has a chance to find private happiness by adopting a daughter, she cannot stop with her actions and they become more and more intense. Sure you can also see it she wants to stop with these sabotage procedures at a peak and that's why she virtually blows stuff up, but yeah. I would not be entirely surprised if she gets back to what she does when having her daughter. Sounds fairly serious so far and there are many serious moments and plot components for sure here, but there is also some comedy. Of course you'd think immediately about the tourist fella who keeps getting arrested and humiliated instead of the actual offender and this is a pretty nice running gag, even if it is entirely realistic. But it is funny for sure, especially in the last scene. What else is funny? How she constantly keeps getting away with tricks from the police. It's the little details there like the Mandela mask etc. You will recognize them when you see them. Or the guy they call the uncle. The only recurring comedic reference I did not approve of was how the soundtrack was displayed visually by depicting the actual musicians on many occasions, also have them walk through the water at the very end. Not that the music was bad or so and of course my perception there is also entirely subjective. Maybe this lighter side is also an indicator that the film ended in a happy fashion perhaps. I am not sure if this was the right choice or if the sister's actions felt really realistic given what happened to her because of her sister's crimes and if she'd really give up on her 2-year plan. Maybe it does not need to be entirely realistic to succeed. Still there are more than enough realistic moments. It was for good reason this film got picked by the Icelandic film comitee to represent the country at the Oscars, even if it did not get in. May have needed a 15-country field perhaps. Anyway, this movie is definitely worth seeing. Not only because of Erlingsson's vision, the beautiful cinematography, the strong lead performance, but also for elaborating on an important and serious subject while still managing to put a smile on people's lips and never become condescending or so. It is a smart movie. It is an entertaining movie. It is a good movie. Go check it out if you get the chance. Always nice to see such little countries produce quality films like this one we have here.

","Halldóra Geirharðsdóttir is the gritty, determined environmental campaigner Halle in this sensitive exploration of environment vs heavy industry. There are the familiar issues of employment vs environment, who really benefits from development, the harshness, loneliness and tedium of traditional lifestyle contrasted with western comfort from employment and town life, and the relativities of power between big business, government, the police and ordinary people. Halldora really earned her fee in the things she had to do in the great Icelandic outdoors, which is as much a star of the film as the leading characters.",/review/rw5121037/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2019,Chris_Middlebrow,5," Either the Screenwriter Was Environmentally Clueless, or I Am
","I did not understand this movie plot, at all. It was ecologically sloppy, never being anywhere close to clear on what exactly the woman's sabotage or rationale was all about. Iceland gets about 24% of its electricity from geothermal, and about 76% from hydroelectric. Fossil fuels only generate about 0.1%. So Iceland makes electricity in a comparatively environmentally friendly way, far better than even Idaho in the U.S. with its rivers and its low population. It seemed to me that the electric grid therefore would be the last thing an Icelandic eco-radical would have reason to attack, even if the sabotage was some sort of broadside against pending industrialization possibly including Chinese investment...which was hinted at but never explained.",/review/rw5121037/?ref_=tt_urv

8 March 2019,gortx,," Amusing serio-comic Icelandic tale
","Director Benedikt Erlingsson's WOMAN AT WAR is in the tradition of brittle darkly comedic dramas from that region (RAMS, last year's UNDER THE TREE). The tale it tells of an unassuming looking Icelandic music teacher Halla (Halldóra Geirharðsdóttir) who becomes an Eco-warrior is certainly dead serious, but, Erlingsson (who also co-wrote) imbues it with frosty wit. While the plot isn't precisely complicated, there are enough twists and turns to keep it interesting even if it never really develops into anything truly substantial.",/review/rw5121037/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2020,blott2319-1,8," Funny and poignant. Well worth watching.
","Woman at War is a film about a woman who has taken on the role of eco-terrorist to try and fight increased industrialization in Iceland. The question is, can she fight for what she thinks is right, keep her identity hidden from the authorities, and live a normal life in the meantime? This movie was exhilarating in all the right ways. I was totally invested in her adventures, and always wondered if she would take things too far. When regular life comes into play, I was even more interested to see what she might do, since balancing life as an outlaw with domestic life could be impossible. I was totally intrigued by this character. She is likable, and feels like one of the most friendly women you could possibly meet, and yet she is also fiercely passionate about a cause and does what she can for the betterment of her country (without hurting anyone in the process.)",/review/rw5121037/?ref_=tt_urv
