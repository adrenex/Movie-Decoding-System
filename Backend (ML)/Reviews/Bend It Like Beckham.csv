18 October 2003,Buddy-51,," A Crowd-pleasing Charmer
","`Bend It Like Beckam' is a heartwarming charmer about a young girl's search for identity in 21st Century England.  Like `Fiddler on the Roof,' `Beckam' deals with the painful struggles tradition-bound cultures must go through as they enter a looser, more freedom-loving modern world.  The culture in this case is that of immigrant and first-generation Indians living in Great Britain.  As with all such tales, it is the young folk who feel the need to pull away from the stuffy values of the past, and who end up dragging the reluctant older folk kicking and screaming into the future right along with them.",/review/rw0816111/?ref_=tt_urv

","Jess is 18, very smart and wants nothing more than to play football, when she joins a local team she has to lie to her parents again and again, as they would never approve of her chasing her dream, they want her to settle down with a nice Indian boy and learn how to cook.",/review/rw0816111/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2005,DrunkenMasterIV,9," Fun, Energetic, and Altogether Wonderful
","Wow, I can't believe I waited so long to see this film. I just never got around to watching it. The plot has nothing that interests me. I know nothing about soccer (football.) I am one of those American fools that has no clue. I had never even seen David Beckham before this film. I chose to ignore the buzz surrounding this film at the time it was released in America. Enough about me. ",/review/rw0816111/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2005,lee_eisenberg,10," I will always remember this movie.
","As someone who's never been into sports, it seems like it would be hard for me to get into the football (or as we Americans inexplicably call it, soccer)-themed ""Bend It Like Beckham"". But I gotta say, this was one cool movie! Anglo-Indian Jesminder Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) and her WASP friend Juliette Paxton (Keira Knightley) love to play football (yes, I'm going to say it the British - and international - way) and just adore football player David Beckham. But Jesminder's traditional Sikh parents don't approve (her mother offers a really whacked-out description of football early in the movie). Okay, so maybe it was sort of a cliché in that sense, but you gotta love this movie! And if like me, you go to this movie not knowing the definition of ""bend"" in football...don't worry, the movie explains it (I'd also never heard of David Beckham prior to this movie). And we all know that Keira Knightley hit it big: a few months after ""BILB"" came out in the States, she starred in the equally cool ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"".",/review/rw0816111/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2003,giatime,10," I LOVE THIS MOVIE.
","As a former 2 time Okinawan Karate world champion, I like movies about sacrifice for sport.  But this movie is about so much more.  This movie is so good and so deep.  I have recently been plagued by very serious injury and pretty much a disastrous lack of passion.  Almost lights out for me. And this silly little movie touched me so deep that like out of a daze it reminded me about what life is supposed to be about.  This is a movie about living.  Living your life for yourself and respect for others.  Empowerment. God, bless ""Bend it like Beckham"" I believe it is a true gem.",/review/rw0816111/?ref_=tt_urv

","The title of this film nearly put me off watching it.  Not being a Manchester United fan, the mere mention of Beckham was a bit off putting, however I put my prejudices behind me and I'm glad I did.",/review/rw0816111/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2008,CitizenCaine,8," Bend It Is Great Fun
","Sports movies are often predictable and enjoyable, but they are not always as fun as Bend It Like Beckham. I'm certainly no soccer fan, but Parminder Nagra completely won me over as the young girl Jess, who is trying to simultaneously pursue her dream of playing soccer and appease her traditional Indian parents. She is befriended by the gawky Keira Knightley, who recognizes the potential Jess has. Nagra accurately portrays the typical naiveté of someone with controlling parents, unsure of her own abilities. Nagra is believable and sensitive in her starring role. Knightley is used in support here, but she is equally as good. Both girls' mothers are caught up with traditional ideas of what their daughters should or shouldn't do, and this provides the comic fodder for the audience to feed upon. Here the fathers are the rational parents instead of boobs, which is otherwise too often the case in these kind of movies. Juliet Stevenson is hilarious as Knightley's well-meaning but idiotic mother who jumps to one conclusion too many. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers plays the girls' soccer coach with his own parental demons. The film is co-written and directed by Gurinder Chadha, and it's a lot of fun. *** of 4 stars.",/review/rw0816111/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2020,nicholls_les,10," Brilliant!
","Just re-watched this and I had forgotten what a great movie this is. I love teh way that Gurinder Chadha portrays Indian family life in such an entertaining way, I loved another of her movies, Bhaji on the beach, which was even funnier than this, but Bend it like Beckham is a great story, brilliantly told and wonderfully acted by everyone.
Parminder Nagra, Keira Knightley and Jonathan Rhys Meyers were all good in the lead roles, but I thought that Anupam Kher was brilliant as the father.
It is wonderful how Gurinder Chadha shows the lives of immigrants to this country in such an entertaining, but thought provoking way.
I have this now on DVD and it is definitely one to keep.",/review/rw0816111/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2004,robbiezangel,10," A fun, refreshing movie
","Okay, first of I hate commenting on this thing but I felt like I had to stand up for this movie. So many people were bashing on it and I felt like people who might want to see it should get a second opinion.",/review/rw0816111/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2005,jeannine1980,9," No pact with the devil here
","My scalp still smarts from the burning coals heaped on it when I vowed I love this film. Bring on the coals; I'll walk over them as well to say again that I love ""Bend it Like Beckham."" Granted, there's a lot of ""in spite of"" in that confession. It's a bit movie-of-the-week; the screenplay is on the paint-by-numbers side. And, most troublingly, the director's commentary implies that in this film beauty can be found primarily amongst the white of skin.",/review/rw0816111/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2005,husnain_05,7," A good Hollywood/bolywood film with a good mixture of cast.
",I love playing football and I thought this movie was great because it contained a lot of football in it. This was a good Hollywood/bollywood film and I am glad it won 17 awards. Parminder Nagra and Kiera Knightley were good and so was Archie Punjabi. Jonathon Rheyes Meyers was great at playing the coach. Jazz (Parminder Nagra) loves playing football but her parents want her to learn how to cook an want her to get married. When Jazz starts playing for a football team secretly she meets Juliet (Kiera Knightlety) and Joe (Jonathon Rhyes Meyers) who is her coach. When her parents find out trouble strikes but her dad lets her play the big match on her sisters Pinky (Archie Punjabi's) wedding. At the end her parents realise how much she loves football and let her go abroad to play.,/review/rw0816111/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2003,hheston,," Mississippi Masala meets Chariots of Fire
","This movie might best be characterized as a collection of formulas - underdog sports flick, culture clash flick, generational conflict flick, young-love-overcomes-obstacles flick.  The setting of transplanted Indian-ness makes it feel like one of Mira Nair's films - `Monsoon Wedding' or `Mississippi Masala.'  There's also quite a bit of youthful, flippant, foul-mouthed, blue-collar London impertinence going on - an episode of `Eastenders,' perhaps.",/review/rw0816111/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2002,mcvitie_hehe,10," So much more than you'd expect!
","As an anti-football person, I (on the surface) grudgingly took my younger brother to see this film, although secretly I hoped it might be East is East II. The trailers looked fun so I thought I'd give it a go.",/review/rw0816111/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2019,Easygoer10,8," A Terrific Little Film
","I really liked this film, and I have seen it many times. Besides the then unknown but future superstar Keira Knightly in a good film, along with Parminder Nagra and Jonathon Rhys-Meyers are brilliant as well. It is great to see how a well cast and (especially) very well directed low budget film can be wonderful. It reminds me a little of Colin Farrell in ""Tigerland"", which made almost no money, but you got to see about 6 future stars and 1 future superstar (Colin Farrell) in their early roles on film.",/review/rw0816111/?ref_=tt_urv

17 February 2019,davyd-02237,7," Great Fun!
","Thoroughly enjoyable film about a Sikh girl wanting to be a footballer. Highly unlikely in real life but you want her to be victorious and the film is put together very well to hold your attention. Whilst the football element isn't worth very much, the film is well worth watching",/review/rw0816111/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2020,akriti-sondhi,10," Still great in 2020
","As a 90s kid (and a girl) who loved playing football in India, I always enjoyed this movie. I rewatched this movie today (in 2020!!) and it's still fantastic! There are such few movies that I enjoyed in early 00's but don't find cringey now.. this is definitely one of them.",/review/rw0816111/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2007,Benjamin_Cox,8," Shoots and scores - 80%
","Eight? Eight for a predictable sports-based movie where the lead overcomes every obstacle thrown at her and triumphs at the end just like every other sports-based movie? Have I gone mad? Well, no actually because although ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is as original as a boy-band cover version, it is still a surprisingly enjoyable film which somehow manages to avoid becoming another chick-flick cliché. A solid cast add to the mix but while there are plenty of goals, there are still one or two holes at the back which threaten the side. Incidentally, whenever I talk about football, I refer to soccer in case any US readers get confused.",/review/rw0816111/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2018,Majikat76,7," Humorous and a good rewatch
","It's really refreshing to re-visit this film, 16 years later, lots of know British actors, the most famous of course being Keira Knightley. Perhaps football has moved on slightly for women and some cultural traditions too, but I'm sure both still have a relevance.",/review/rw0816111/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2003,clydestuff,8," Predictable but charming film, well written, well acted, beautifully directed
","A while back when this film first began it's run at the cinemas, it seemed I was bombarded with ads for it on the internet whereever I went.  I found it quite irritating after a while.  Fortunately, being the fair minded individual that I am, I didn't let the ads deter me from viewing what turned out to be a pleasant little film.  Not perfect, mind you, but enjoyable on many levels.",/review/rw0816111/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2017,sanchuj,10," fantastic football movie
","I love this movie a lot. The story takes place in Europe where an Indian girl, Jess is obsessed to play football but her parents would not let her play. Her friends Jules and Tony and her coach Joe convince her to play football. Before watching this movie I thought football was boy's games but after watching this movie I am so interested in football. I suggest everyone to go for this movie.",/review/rw0816111/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2016,Tweekums,8," An enjoyable coming of age film
","Eighteen year old Jess dreams of playing football like her hero David Beckham even though her playing is limited to having a kick-around in the local park. Here she is spotted by Jules; who plays for the local women's team. Jules tells Jess that she should try out and she quickly impresses Joe, the coach. She is invited to join the team but there is a problem; her Sikh family expect her to go to university and marry a nice Indian boy not 'waste her life' playing football. She tells her parents that she is going out to a job but it isn't long before they learn the truth. She manages to continue to play and Joe thinks that both Jules and Jess have what it takes to go to the top in the women's game. As well as the drama about the football there is confusion when Jess's family fear she is seeing a white boy, Jules' mother thinks she is a lesbian, Jules and Jess fall out because the both like Joe and Jess's sister is getting married inevitably the wedding clashes with the football final that is due to be watched by a talent scout from America.",/review/rw0816111/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'm glad when a movie like this finds an audience.  First of all, its not typical Hollywood product, which is a magnificent beginning, and you know that the director/screenwriter just had a vision of what kind of movie that they could make and didn't get all caught up in all that LA garbage you hear about.  They actually had a story to tell, had to sell it, and someone believed in the project. ",/review/rw0816111/?ref_=tt_urv
