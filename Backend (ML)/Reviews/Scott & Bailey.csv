14 August 2022,lewilewis1997,8," Beautifully Understated, Show, Don't Tell...
","It starts with a minor 'thing' that turns into a full blown public row about a baked potato. Turns out Sean's character is just scared of flying, but he won't say so, so the potato is the problem. This sets the stage for some wonderfully observed characteristics of a long term relationship. Some of you, although apparently very few based on current reviews, will recognise those moments that define real love and friendship.",/review/rw8453151/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2022,Sleepin_Dragon,7," It's an interesting watch.
","Ian and Emma have a marriage like any other, the usual squabbles, demanding relatives, and all of the complexities that come with a marriage.",/review/rw8453151/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2022,mrjolly1,8," Acting at its best.
",Sean Bean and Nicola Walker are such amazing actors. This drama is not fast paced but that was intentional to get the feel of how the characters are suffering in sometimes a tedious world.,/review/rw8453151/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2022,Linmalut,10," Masterpiece
",Sean Bean never disappoints! Brilliantly made series about long-term relationship with fantastic acting! The characters have depth and they are very down to earth. The brilliancy of the series is that many things are communicated to the viewer without being said. Slow-paced show so not for those who prefer action or more drama.,/review/rw8453151/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2022,smartarsebutler,10," Transfixing, multi layered, Golaszweskis finest work to date
","Please ignore the negative reviews. I think the issue is that the BBC overestimated it's audience, as opposed to any flaws with the show. Golaszweski's writing is astounding, slowly peeling back painful truths, whilst subverting narrative expectations the world of tv has lulled us into needing. I watched it all in one sitting and the last episode truly had me a blubbering mess. This is a masterclass in writing, acting and direction. Characters are exceptionally observed, multi dimensional and complex. If you have half a brain and an attention span, you won't regret investing in this. Truly magnificent.",/review/rw8453151/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2022,stavpapis,10," Refreshing
","People who have rated this poorly really don't understand acting. It's a fresh look at how to do these dramas. It's the most real portrayal I have seen in years. Silence and real life mistakes. People expect everything polished these days. Brilliantly written and amazing acting. Don't listen to the bad reviews. If you like genuinely good portrayals of normal life, watch this. More of the same please.",/review/rw8453151/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2022,katiebob74,7," Don't be so quick to judge
","I'm not sure why people were quick to rate this so low but I found it to be worthy of more. People saying it's boring and banal but that's what some marriages look like after nearly 30 years. They're past the point of swinging from the ceiling and fireworks. They're settled into a groove where sometimes words aren't needed. Both on the 'wrong side of 40' Emma is trying her best to impress her boss who is a nasty piece of work and Ian has been made redundant and finds it difficult to fill his time, desperately trying to engage others in conversation just so he doesn't feel so invisible. They're trying to navigate through life whilst dealing with the death of a child, an adoptive daughter who's in an abusive relationship and Emma's father who doesn't have a nice thing to say but commands her time and attention. Yes it all sounds pretty grim but it's beautiful and sensitive and it's true. Marriage is called a life sentence but it doesn't mean it has to be a punishment.",/review/rw8453151/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2022,apsherman,9," I find it intriguing
","I love it, understated, off beat in a good way. Superb actors and I'm desperate to carry on watching to see how it all unfolds . I can understand why others don't 'get it', it's very subtle but very clever.",/review/rw8453151/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2022,plynch181,9," An absolute masterclass in acting.
",I can only imagine the poor reviews are from people who haven't been in a long term relationship and can't understand the dynamic.,/review/rw8453151/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2022,praestandum,9," Wonderful exploration of relationships
","This is a wonderfully crafted and thoughtful work of microscopic analysis exploring the complicated multi-faceted layers of a long-lasting marriage and the extraneous interactions and relationships that effect its health and trust of each other in that relationship. Sean Bean is brilliant (socially awkward) and Nicola W (put upon and says nothing) is just superb. Finally, a decent BBC drama! Maybe the BBC will learn and commission more quality productions line Marriage. This is a wonderful watch but you have to invest in the characters and get past episode one. It's worth the investment of your time you won't be disappointed.",/review/rw8453151/?ref_=tt_urv

",I really enjoyed it.,/review/rw8453151/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2022,irnbru-333,4," Seriously one-paced and dull drama that lacks any drama - a big miss
",I love the two lead actors who are both at the top of their game but this series defeated them. It was just a really odd fish but not in a good way.,/review/rw8453151/?ref_=tt_urv

16 August 2022,karenchapman-87572,6," Not all that bad
","I don't think it's as bad as everyone says. If you're of a certain age and have been in the same relationship for years you will absolutely ""get it"" but if you're younger than say 40 you probably think it's just a bit banal and slow. The one part I really hated (apart from the music what the blazes was that about?) was the totally unconvincing relationship they had with their step daughter they apparently adopted when she was about 5 I recollect. Every conversation was stilted like they were talking to a total stranger at a bus stop... weird.",/review/rw8453151/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2022,laurent-saletto,10," 11 out of ten if I could
","This is not for everyone, heck, not for most. It is all about what is NOT being said, NOT being seen, NOT being pointed out. Just like life really. Every nuance, every shade, every breath matters. If you get it you get it. If you don't well.. there's always ITV and formulaic crap to fall back on. To enjoy it, just immerse yourself in it totally. Phone off, kids to bed, conversation and comments for later. But utterly amazing. Blessed that we still have the Beeb to comission such brilliant drama, without the ever present need to please all.",/review/rw8453151/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2022,sharissedesilva,10," Boundary pushing jarring drama
",Having watched the first two episodes I felt compelled to write a review based on the unnerving atmosphere the series has already created.,/review/rw8453151/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2022,murada1967,2," Boring is an understatement.
",Two decent actors wasted in a show were literally nothing happens. The little dialogue the show contains is frighteningly bad . It is like a poorly improvised art house project. It amazes me how garbage like this gets commissioned and makes it onto prime time TV.,/review/rw8453151/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2022,rnf100,1," Mike Leigh gone wrong
",Despite the excellent as always Sean Bean and Nicola Walker this did not reach the heights of anything Mike Leigh has done on a regular basis over the last40 years.,/review/rw8453151/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2022,jckdgwalker,8," Captivating
","When Marriage was advertised on the BBC I said to my wife ""That doesn't look very interesting "" but. I like Sean Bean so we gave it a go.",/review/rw8453151/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2022,markhamilton-12723,8," Fascinatingly awkward
",Wonderfully observed banality of everyday life and love. Superb characters and actors pushing the boundaries of what goes for normality and the resulting paranoia leaves one feeling like a voyeur. Great stuff. Ignore those that can't see this and just get disappointed by a slow burn.,/review/rw8453151/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2022,vincent-11557-49690,10," Provoking
",It's a about a mid life marriage crisis and it's torture to watch but you watch anyway . Bean is actually 63 and walker is 51 . This age gap is quite plausible for the two characters and gives the relationship a stress which is palpable.,/review/rw8453151/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2022,PeteThePrimate,2," Tedious and badly written
","A waste of 2 good actors, really annoying, jarring music, poor voice audio, no plot to write home about and worst of all, nothing really happens, except a long boring piece about a jacket potato.",/review/rw8453151/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2022,Chillihead1,1," If you think the theme tune is annoying!
","Despite a great cast there is absolutely no way on earth that this dross is worth watching. A new genre perhaps, I really do hope not otherwise mankind is truly doomed. Edge of your seat stuff, waiting for anything to happen, well absolutely nothing happens at all. Dire.",/review/rw8453151/?ref_=tt_urv
