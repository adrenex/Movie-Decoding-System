11 January 2023,shaikhirshad-41223,4," Just Average...
","Strictly for Thalapathy fans. Movie has the same old basic plot that we have seen a lot. Same old typical family business story just to enhance the story director has added more characters to stretch the film and make it a proper entertainer but fails to deliver. 1st half feels very stretched with long boring screenplay and nothing new to add in the storyline whereas 2nd half is good as compare to 1st. Vijay's acting steals the show as compare to rest of the actors because while seeing the movie the director has pretty much involved in Vijay's character and it seems like it. Rest of the cast was average nothing that different as compare to the story. Rashmika is totally wasted. She is there only for songs and distraction. She looks good in songs though but not in the movie. As a movie lover this film is just an average for me though it has action, emotions and songs by the due to long stretched screenplay and old storyline this movie completely falls down. Only for Thalapathy fans. (4/10)",/review/rw8796181/?ref_=tt_urv

",A complete wholesome family movie. The movie was so emotional and sentimental. It's been long time never make a movie for family values. This movie is about right time to be released. In now days era ppl are less in love and family bonding. This movie shows what does a family stand for. A big applause to the varisu team for a such wonderful movie. To the director and producer who make quality movie for family audiences. With alot of actor and actresses. Everyone did well they're role very best. The music and bgm give a goosebumps. The anmma character very lovely. The movie is about conflict in the family and how they outcome it. And that's doesn't mean this movie have no action or comedy. U will laughing till end of the movie. As usual vijay movie must have treats for his fan. A highly performed dance and stylish action scenes. Varisu the boss return.,/review/rw8796181/?ref_=tt_urv

","A wholesome entertainer for all center crowd. Don't listen/watch the negativity spread around you about the movie. To be honest I am a Thalapathy fan, even I had loads of negative thoughts before watching the movie so I went and watched the movie with very low expectation but surprisingly it's not that kind of content which must be trolled. Yes I agree it's a regular template and very old fashioned family drama but Thalapathy's screen presence, Vamshi's presentation, Thaman's BGM, Karthik's cinematography and the grandeur in frame to frame of the movie that really matters. It's definitely a watchable movie for all age groups and for all kind of audience (except Ajith fans - because without no reason they will troll). Go and watch this movie with zero expectations along with your whole family it will definitely entertain you without any doubt.",/review/rw8796181/?ref_=tt_urv

11 January 2023,chand-suhas,5," All you get is one family, no matter how toxic!
","Varisu is all about family values. No matter how unforgivable one person's mistakes be, if they are family then all is forgiven. Having said that, Varisu sticks to the age old family drama template mixed with masala elements to do justice to it's superstar lead. The rebellious younger son who is ousted from the family makes a comeback to mend the broken family. With enough father-son, mother-son, brothers sentiment, Vamsi Paidipally presents a done to death screenplay as a festival treat.",/review/rw8796181/?ref_=tt_urv

11 January 2023,revinsworld,10," The film that reminds why we started watching cinema and the power of thalapathy vijay's screen presence
","MY REVIEW FOR VARISU
If an actor can make the audience entertained and engaged in the content with only his screen presence, Thalapathy Vijay is a MASTER in it because the story actually took off when nearing the interval but till that vijay made sure that no audience should be bored or scatter their attention and he succeeds. Yes the movie has its flaws like predictable plot, forced climax and poor characterization but does it affect the experience of watching the movie, the answer is absolutely NOT! That is where VIVEK come in as a dialogue writer his dialogue is one of a kind and adds life to the scene and heart warming moments, he is the pillar of the movie, he made sure what to deliver at that time in terms of dialogue which may reduce or vanish the cliche moments.. Thaman is also one of the biggest reason for the elevation and thrill of the movie, his bgm & songs makes the movie a wholesome entertainer, especially the interval bgm. FINALLY this movie reminds why we started to watch cinema, we started to watch cinema for entertainment, time pass, relaxation but now it is evolved and we see cinema as a project to be reviewed, we have moved to where is the reality in the cinema, where is the logic. But, that is happening in our real life(reality) why expect it also in a movie, let it cross the boundaries and entertain you. So that is what vamshi and his writers have done to this movie an extraordinary message about family which is much needed in this generation where we forgot for what we are running in life MONEY? FAME? No it's to take care of your FAMILY and that is what vamshi has accomplished, even though some scenes didn't actually connect it has been registered in your mind( the message about family) it may affect your decisions directly or indirectly in your life. See the movie with a open mind and come back relaxed and refreshed!",/review/rw8796181/?ref_=tt_urv

","The world is very fast paced with the rapid growth and access to technology. Once in a while it's nice to look back and say thanks to FAMILY. This movie for me touched all the right chords, from music to acting to comedy to dance to emotions literally had it all, a perfect family entertainer, however I feel Vijay needs to go slow with his dance moves he was literally killing it there. Like Vijay in the movie says every family, rather person has his own flaws, don't let go of your family for petty things. You have only one family!!! People critical of this movie might rub it off as one from the 90s, in so many ways we were happier then than now.",/review/rw8796181/?ref_=tt_urv

","I was so hyped when I saw this movie,as all of my family members love the movie. But when I saw the first half of the movie,I was kinda of disappointed,that it was so boring. But my family has good taste so I decided to give the movie a chance. And omg I saw the second half with a smile on my face. It's really really good. You can not miss this movie,not in a million years. This is the next good Vijay movie. I was so happy. Sure the message was kinda corney,but everything else was amazing.

","This movie has everything as Dil Raju said and movie is going to storm the box office. Can see a Gilli Vijay back with such energy. Vamsi you have shown why you are the best director. Great movie and everyone watch on theaters and enjoy Pongal happily. Frame by frame Vamsi has crafted the movie & purely with class. Vijay cuteness is overloaded, sentiments, dance, joke & love. It's a well packed movie with lots of goosebumps. Watch it in theatres and you'll enjoy as family. Those who rate this movie low can either be Ajith fans or Vijay haters. But the movie is thoroughly great & we enjoyed it.",/review/rw8796181/?ref_=tt_urv
