","Good times once again as we return with our turtles in a half shell, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze is the popular sequel to the very popular and successful movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. We had some minor changes to this film, while the first movie was a success, parents complained of it's dark nature and mild cursing. So this film was a little brighter and family friendly, while it drug the film down a little for some odd reason I still loved this movie. Not only me but some of my other friends loved it as well, I don't know if it's because we grew up with this film or whatever, but we still have so much fun watching it despite it's cheesy themes and the fact that Vanilla Ice makes a cameo with the ever infamous Ninja Rap that he knew the lyrics and dance too before he even knew the song existed.",/review/rw5654658/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2015,ivo-cobra8,9," I love this sequel and my second favorite in the trilogy!
","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze (1991) it is a worthy follow up top the original classic action film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990). This sequel is way improvement over third film and both of reboot films. It is my second favorite film in the trilogy and it is almost good as the first movie! I love them both to death and it is an excellent sequel.! It is my childhood film and I grew up with it. The first one was dark and awesome kick ass film, my favorite childhood film of all time, this sequel is good on the same level as the first is, just the first one is the best and far way better than all the films about Ninja Turtles were made!

6 September 2005,hu675,8," This sequel is entertaining enough to overcome certain silliness and flaws.
","The fearsome foursome turtles go after the glowing cannister that mutated them as babies. While the turtles are trying to find the meaning of their lives and the ooze is slipped into the hands of the evil Shredder (Francois Chau). Shredder asks the help of an unwillingly scientist (David Warner) to make his mutant allies, Rahzar and Tokka. The Turles seeks help with the young pizza deliver boy-Keno (Ernie Reyes, Jr.). The Heroes dive into action and of course, Pizza! ",/review/rw5654658/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2004,CuriosityKilledShawn,6," Pretty good sequel
","This film opens with tremendous confidence and energy. The humor of the Turtles may be so 1990 but I still dig it. The opening scene in the shopping mall is way funny and a great way to introduce is to the sequel. At the time the style of the Turtles wasn't so stale, so the plot may seem a bit childish or dumb now.",/review/rw5654658/?ref_=tt_urv

27 May 2014,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,6," It could have been just as good as the first
","It was obvious that with the successful release of the Ninja Turtles comics, cartoon TV series and first theatrical release, that another story of the turtles was asking to be told. As told by the released date, it seems that the production of the next installment was already being set up very quickly after the first film. This is OK if everything is thoroughly prepped but most of the time, this isn't the case. The product becomes rushed and comes out nothing like it's predecessor. From the trailer it may seem like nothing changed, when in fact there are, and its rather distracting.",/review/rw5654658/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2005,enjoiskaterguy,9," Superb but lacks darkness like the original
","The sequel to the smash hit 1990 TMNT, starts off greatly with an introduction to a new character (Keno) and has a great pizza scene showing how the city loves New York pizza as well as metaphorically showing the viewers watching that this indeed is a turtles movie...The opening music is great and is perfect for the city scene.",/review/rw5654658/?ref_=tt_urv

20 August 2014,KineticSeoul,6," Go ninja go ninja go!
","To be honest, I think I might have slightly liked this one more than the first installment in this trilogy. Although the actress that played Search April O'Neil was just horrendous and the worst Search April O'Neil portrayal in the trilogy. The fight sequences was goofy but fun to watch and the chemistry between the turtles and character still works for this one. Shredder didn't seem that much sinister at all this time around until the very end when he gets jacked up on ooze steroids. The bad guys using the ooze to power up the dog and snapping turtle to fight against the Ninja Turtles was a bit lame. But it did make sense to a degree and didn't really take much out of the movie. However the best part was Vanilla Ice rapping a Ninja Turtles rap while the turtles kick butt on the dance floor. Overall this is a good follow up to the first one in my opinion. This installment even has the most in depth connection when it comes to the turtles on where they came from and what their purpose is (no, not that we were all made from a tube of green ooze). Looking back now, it isn't as cool as I thought it was when I was a kid, but it still has enough to make it watchable even today.",/review/rw5654658/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2013,lagudafuad,6," a nice film for the kids
","Looking for great lines and dialogue, there is none here. Looking for cool costumes that look extremely realistic, not here Looking for pure turtle fun you have come to the right place",/review/rw5654658/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2001,Monika-5,," Less gritty than the first, but more fun
","Well, this second film was more kid-oriented and played more for laughs, but I still got a kick out of it. Paige Turco made a better April than Judith Hoag (and what a cool apartment April has!) and Ernie Reyes Jr. (whatever happened to him?) is a lot of fun to watch too. What WAS the secret of the ooze? I haven't seen the film in years!",/review/rw5654658/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2007,dee.reid,8," Go, Ninja, Go!
","As I sit here on the eve of what is sure to be the greatest event in the history of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (more accurately, the greatest Turtle event of the new millennium), the release of the much-anticipated animated film ""TMNT,"" I feel it's only proper to go back in time to when the original Turtle-mania was at its peak. I was only five in 1990, when Turtle-mania was sweeping the nation and now I'm 21, as Turtle-mania Part II threatens to grab a hold of a new generation of young fans of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.",/review/rw5654658/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2020,view_and_review,7," Sillier but Just as Fun
","The TMNT's had so much fun in 1990 they did it again in 1991 in ""The Secret of the Ooze."" They came back with a different April O'Neil eschewing Judith Hoag for Paige Turco. And they dropped party crasher Casey Jones for another little sidekick in Keno (Ernie Reyes Jr.).",/review/rw5654658/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2010,Geeky Randy,9," The best of the series.
","The turtles are back in a more family friendly--either a good thing or a bad thing, depending on the viewer--and well-balanced story. The plot digs deeper into the back-story of the ooze that transformed all of the dudes into surf-slang talking' ninjas, and it leaves the viewer watching a more concrete story. Because of this, the film succeeds in avoiding the sequel-cliché of being redundant because it answers and develops things that the preceding film didn't do. Vanilla Ice's ""Ninja Rap""--and also the presences of Vanilla Ice himself--may have been appropriate for viewers at the turn of the decade, but watching it anytime after 1992 is just cringe-worthy. Also, very peeving, is Tokka and Rahzar being obvious substitutes for Bebop and Rocksteady. However, its few flaws don't reflect the overall film at least, not too heavily, that is. Aside from Tokka and Rahzar, who actually become likable the more times you watch the movie (if you're willing), the film should be complimented for being strikingly similar to the 1987 animated series that popularized the franchise.",/review/rw5654658/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 1999,dew-11,," A regular Fan
","When I saw the first debut of the turtle's  movie I did not want to miss a second. And I did'nt. When the 2nd one came out I loved every second as the 1st, and to this day I still have the collection, and the credit I want to give to is the puppeteers and the suit performers they were awesome bringing those characters to life. Great Job. My full respect for these movies is still strong. Some say I'm too old to watch it still. I don't think so! TMNT Rocks. Let's keep it that Way!",/review/rw5654658/?ref_=tt_urv

24 January 2000,Quinoa1984,8," Great fun, but nothing beats the original.
","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 is a pretty good movie, funny, and very effective, but it's not as good as the original.  The original was better and more dark.  This one has some good fights (choreographed by Pat Johnson of the Karate Kid fade) and plenty of silly humor for the kids, but it's not as directed to a general audience as this one.  By the way, look for a professional wrestler as Super Shredder.",/review/rw5654658/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2022,hellraiser7,8," Turtles Oozing Fun
","After the first one of course it was inevitable that a sequel would follow, and it did. I was a kid from the 90's so I remember seeing this in the theater and having a blast. It was practically an event, I remember from the very beginning of the film when the Turtles finally came out and they jumped into the air, everyone in the audience was cheering along with myself. That's not something I get in the theaters much but when I do, it's just a great feeling just to be excited to see your heroes/superheroes back ready to kick butt once more.",/review/rw5654658/?ref_=tt_urv

7 March 2007,FiendishDramaturgy,6," Not as charming as the first.
","I have to say this installment was just plain disappointing. It lost nearly all the charm of the original. There are still a few desirable elements, but I won't spoil the few good things about this film by listing them here.",/review/rw5654658/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2022,aidanratesmovies,5," Meh- another unfortunately forgettable turtles flick
","A less than stellar sequel- Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II feels too dull and mechanical to truly ooze the charm the original had- even despite its smaller successes. Yeah, needless to say, I wasn't a big fan of this Turtles film. It has some cool fight scenes, I enjoyed the look of the new baddies- although they did prove to be quite pointless, and of course Super Shredder is freaking awesome. Besides some little things though, this film just wasn't as fun to watch as the original. It had a few fun and funny moments, but the puppets feel a whole lot more fake this time around- the plot is wire thin and the recasting of April O'Neil in all just makes the whole film feel like a total cash grab. It does have a bit of a higher budget this time around so the cinematography is a bit better, hell, I even liked the Vanilla Ice Ninja Rap single. Where the film fails though is in spirit and in plot. It feels too corny, to thin, and too dull to be any fun- honestly for a less than 90 min runtime- this film felt twice as long as the original. In the end, TMNT II is a mess. It's not a total disaster, but more often than not it disappoints. Cowabummer!",/review/rw5654658/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2020,jeremycrimsonfox,7," A Good Sequel That Bows To Parents
","The Turtles are back, and are still fighting crime after the Foot has fallen. However. The Shredder has also survived being crushed in a garbage truck, and is now out for revenge, going as far as to steal a canister of the ooze that mutated the four and creating his own mutants, Tokka and Rahzar. Now the turtles must stop the mad man, as well as find a new hideout and keep Keno, a pizza boy who saw them stop a mall robbery, out of danger.",/review/rw5654658/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2008,brando647,6," Ninja Turtles for a Younger Demographic
","The Ninja Turtles return! And this time, they're more family friendly. Gone is the moody atmosphere of the original Ninja Turtles film. It's been replaced with goofy slapstick and twice as many one-liners. In this installment, the Shredder has returned and, rather than returning to his master plans of using ninjas as pick-pockets, he has upped the ante. Shredder has learned from one of his Foot soldiers that a company called TGRI is in the process of disposing of chemical waste that has extreme mutagenic properties; he acquires the chemical ooze and uses it to create Tokka and Razhar, two powerful mutants who will assist him in his revenge against the Turtles. It's nice to see the Shredder has set higher goals this time around.",/review/rw5654658/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2020,MrMovieReviewer,10," Not as good as the first but still awesome
","Okay truth is it's no where near as good as the original
Yet it's still brilliant why I was disappointed that they left out Judith Hoag Elias Koteas Corey Feldman I was not happy with Judith being left out Paige Turco does an amazing job, But i didn't like Hoag not being in it",/review/rw5654658/?ref_=tt_urv
