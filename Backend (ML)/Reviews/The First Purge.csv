","I enjoyed this movie. I liked the characters and the setting. It doesn't have the most original story, but they made the most of what they had. It was definitely worth the watch. As far as how well I remember it, it didn't leave a burning impression on me, but I think it is above average on every level.",/review/rw7919564/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2021,darkreignn,5," Not a bad film, but not really a good one either
","""The Old Ways"" is, in many ways, your run of the mill horror flick. In other ways, however, it manages to pull its own weight and elevate itself beyond what you would typically expect from a film in this genre. For better or for worse, there is ultimately not enough fresh and unique ideas at play here for me to recommend this, but at the same time this movie wasn't nearly bad enough for me to tell you to skip it. At the end of the day, ""The Old Ways"" simply is.",/review/rw7919564/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2021,kosmasp,7," Exorcism ... necessary?
","Exorcism movies do have a really tough job. Because of the Exorcist. It's almost impossible to top that movie. That's how I am feeling about it. That being said, it doesn't mean that some movies have not done something fairly nice with the theme.",/review/rw7919564/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2021,Tweekums,7," A refreshing take on the exorcism genre
","Cristina Lopez is an American reporter who has travelled her ancestral town near the city of Veracruz in Mexico. Here she hopes to write a story about the local folklore. After going to a cave she was told to avoid she is held in a small hut. Here she is told that she now has a demon inside her and that getting it out will be difficult, dangerous and painful. A local bruja, or witch, leads the exorcism with the help of a man named Javi and Cristina's cousin Miranda.",/review/rw7919564/?ref_=tt_urv

27 August 2021,el7,7," Unfolds like a dangerous flower.
","The plot of The Old Ways concerns a Mexican American journalist named Cristina, who goes back to the town where she was born in Veracruz, on an assignment to write a story about the titular old ways. While exploring a cave site called La Boca, she is kidnapped by locals who then explain to her that they're only trying to save her soul. For you see, only the possessed deliberately seek out La Boca.",/review/rw7919564/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2021,onebengalcat,6," I liked it.
","I throughly enjoyed this movie. Great acting. I liked all the main characters. The atmosphere was perfect for the storyline. Old fashion exorcisms, Mexico and a bruja. About time something a little different came along.",/review/rw7919564/?ref_=tt_urv

25 August 2021,DaegT,7," Love the Latino style
","It's another trapped journalist/tourist story, and the initial cinematography constantly reminds me of another movie called The Ruins. With an element of exorcism against a backdrop of Central American jungle (Mexico??), this story cannot be described as original. Yet it is quite a unique one.",/review/rw7919564/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2021,krice23,8," Surprisingly good!
","First of all, you should know that I am not a fan of the horror genre. Suspense, yes, horror, not so much. So the very idea that I am reviewing this film makes a statement. I felt every aspect of this film was well constructed, a work from the heart, I would Imagine. The actors were excellent and worked very well together. The casting, plot, setting, dialogue, soundtrack, the few special effects they used(and not abused), and particularly, the demon were all admirably executed and pulled a rating of 8 from me. I probably don't need to add that's likely the highest rating I've ever given a film of this genre. There's some blood and guts, as it were, but no real gore. It didn't try too hard, it was a relatively simple plot, yet creative, and they didn't attempt to overshoot it, which frankly, is refreshing in any film. In short, they did it right. I would easily recommend this film to anyone, regardless of their film preferences; it's just that well done. It's a good viewing and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised, as I was.",/review/rw7919564/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2021,elhonig-902-129896,6," Exorcism with slightly different twist...
","Not a bad exorcism movie. Went a bit long in my opinion, but it did take the time to create a mood and certain tone. The setting in Mexico added a little different angle to a worn exorcism story line. All the acting was pretty good. Perhaps the writing could've been better. If you enjoy this kind of horror movie without a ton of CGI, it's worth checking it out.",/review/rw7919564/?ref_=tt_urv

","Talk about going pretty far for a story. Cristina Lopez, a Mexican-American reporter, has come back to her hometown near Veracruz - do I needlessly need to remind horror movie characters to never go home again - to write about witchcraft when she became the story itself as the bruja believes that Cristina is possessed. Well, you know, when your mother was possessed and that demon left you all scratched up too, you kind of become a suspect.",/review/rw7919564/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2021,neosoul1500,5," Average
","I went into this movie with high hopes. At the time of my review there was a 95% critic score of this movie on Rotten Tomatoes. To say I was disappointed was an understatement. Its not that this movie is bad, it just does not do anything that separates it from the pack of horror movies on Netflix. The pacing was okay, the main protagonist has uneven character development. The atmosphere was the only positive thing out of the movie. Lets all treat those critic reviews with a grain of salt as they just seem to just have a motive behind them.",/review/rw7919564/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2021,Pairic,7," Bruja Exorcist
","The Old Ways: A refreshingly new take on possession and exorcisms. Cristina (Brigitte Kali Canales) returns to the remote Mexican village where she left as a child; now a journalist in the U. S. (Cristina was fostered there) she wishes to write an article about local folk traditions. She's kidnapped, though not by gangsters, her relatives are involved, believing that Cristina is possessed by a demon. As far as she is concerned her only demon is her heroin habit. A Bruja begins the ceremony, milk instead of holy water is thrown on Cristina. The ritual proceeds using methods alien to the Christian forms of exorcisms. Snakes, bird skulls, even spirit surgery are used as She appears to do battle with a demon within. Some really disturbing scenes as the demon reacts and Cristina is scarred as the Bruja and her assistants fight on. A tale of two cultures, a clash which brings about some surprising results. Directed by Christopher Alender from a screenplay by Marcos Gabriel. On Netflix. 7/10.",/review/rw7919564/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2021,jmbovan-47-160173,8," Not your typical possession film
","Reporter goes back to her place of origin to search for ""lost cultures,"" and instead she is held captive as the local bruja reports she has a demon inside her. This film shies away from the typical startles and jump scares, leaving more of the personal journey that an exorcism entails. To watch and appreciate this film, one has to embrace the struggle of a ""modern"" person facing the ""backwards"" perspective of a traditional culture. What scares and special effects that are present are more to depict the insidious way evil can exist rather than to shock or scare the audience. Long story short, this is a character study set in a possession and excorcism movie. Watch it with that in mind, and you may be surprised at how captivating this movie is.",/review/rw7919564/?ref_=tt_urv

","""The Old Ways"" was released in 2020 and contains a lot of classic ingredients from horror movies that came out during the 1980s. And that is what I like because the movie was created with a nice blend of everything that puts you on the edge of your seat. We have that classic exorcism rituals, an ideal timing of jumpscares and a bit of a confusing story. Let me get into that latter aspect.",/review/rw7919564/?ref_=tt_urv
