","On her thirteenth anniversary, the teenager Jenna Rink wishes to be a successful single woman of thirty. Her dream comes true, and on the next day she wakes up older and powerful. However, she becomes disappointed with herself, since she is an awful colleague in her work, she has no friends and no contact with her parents, and her best friend is going to marry another woman, and tries to be thirteen again and rebuilt her life.",/review/rw4604487/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2009,insomniac_rod,8," Funny comedy with a slight touch of fantasy. Recommended.
",This is a very entertaining movie oriented for a teenager audience that is able to enjoy romantic light comedies mixed with fantasy and some situations that deal with the imagination of a young girl.,/review/rw4604487/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's a teen film and Im struggling to find things to watch in lock-down so anything almost goes. But this was great! Fun, funny, happy, silly, lovely costumes, lovely Mark Ruffalo and Jennifer Garner is terrific in it. Loved it.",/review/rw4604487/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2004,anhedonia,7," Garner shines, Ruffalo's wonderful and that makes all the difference
","Having criticized the writer of ""Connie and Carla"" for not recognizing the writers of ""Some Like it Hot"" in the credits, I'd be a hypocrite not to fault the writers of ""13 Going on 30"" for not thanking the writers of ""Big"" (and probably ""Vice Versa"" and all those switch-comedies of the 1980s).",/review/rw4604487/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2006,mercywriter,10," Wonderful!
","In a time when most movies turn out to be a waste of my time, what a pleasant surprise to find this gem. On the surface, it might look like just another romantic comedy. But there was a depth to this movie that surprised and captivated me. A lot of good messages for young girls, 13, 30, and any age before or after. And what an interesting commentary on society. Through the eyes of an innocent 13 year old, who just happens to have the body of an adult, we see just how shallow, false, and empty modern society can be.",/review/rw4604487/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2018,jmazznyc,7," I Never Realized what a Schmuck I Actually Am
","Until I forced myself to sit down and watch this entire movie. Completely prepared to despise it after reading all the negative reviews; but am a big Ruffalo fan, and have always liked Jennifer Garner. After the first 20 minutes, my tv remote channel change button was almost completely pressed until Michael Jackson's huge ""Thriller"" party number commenced. Admittedly, I'm a big '80's fan; which of course factored into my thorough enjoyment of this flick! Madonna, Pat Benatar hits...awesome dude!! Honestly Ruffalo and Garner had great chemistry and gave sweet performances. Any movie that makes me laugh and cry is a keeper. No spoilers; but if you loved ""Big"" (who didn't...and yes a better movie), you will also love ""13"". You'll just need to give it a little time :)",/review/rw4604487/?ref_=tt_urv
28 April 2004,Rogue-32,6," Jennifer Garner rules
","It's impossible to imagine this film with anyone other than Jennifer Garner in the lead role - she shines so brightly and so brilliantly in every scene, elevating what would most likely have been a flat and shallow affair without the seemingly-effortless magic of her performance.

4 August 2004,=G=,6," Fun and frolicky
","In ""13 Going On 30"" Garner is a 13 year old with a guy best friend and an impossible dream of becoming one of her school's ""in"" crowd. She pulls a ""Rip Van Winkle"" and suddenly finds herself 15 years older, with boobs, and the editor of a glitz and glam NYC femme fashion magazine. The rest is a fun frolic about coming to grips with what is important in life...what's steak and what's just so much sizzle. Garner and Ruffalo work well as the leads in this good old family values bop flick which keeps the momentum up 'til the very warm and fuzzy end. An unabashed chick flick, ""13 Going On 30"" should be an enjoyable watch for teen females and anyone in the mood for a romcom who can still remember what it's like to be 13 going on 30.

8 December 2004,christian123,6," Jennifer Garner makes this movie watchable
","Jennifer Garner plays Jenna, a 13-year-old girl who makes a wish to become older, and she finds herself thrust forward 17 years into the body of a gorgeous 30-year-old executive. Trying to discover what happened, she gets back in touch with her old high school friends, who've all lived 17 years of life, while she is still just a girl in the body of a woman.",/review/rw4604487/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2005,blanche-2,8," adorable fantasy, winning star
","Jennifer Garner is wasting her time with action flicks, if this film is any indication. She is a delight playing a young woman with the body of a thirty-year-old whose mind is just 13, having just gotten her birthday wish to be ""30 and flirty."" The character of Jenna, in true fantasy movie fashion, gets a glimpse of her life if she stays with a decision she made in one critical life moment.",/review/rw4604487/?ref_=tt_urv

28 March 2019,ThomasDrufke,8," For the Kid in All of Us
","Some actors are just born to play certain roles. Though I've never been the biggest Jennifer Garner fan over the years, she is beyond perfect for the role of Jenna Rink in 13 Going on 30. Conveying the perfect amount of innocence, charm, and earnestness, the joy of seeing Garner play a 13 year old trapped in the body and life of a 30 year old woman is unparalleled. I love the nostalgic feeling of the film, even though I didn't grow up when Jenna did, and the overwhelming feeling of 'needing to remember what used to be good'. Mark Ruffalo is an instantly likable and relatable love interest for Garner, and they have remarkable chemistry. We've seen this type of story before, but it's all in the execution, and they nailed it here.",/review/rw4604487/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2005,Lady_Targaryen,7," cute cute cute!
","This movie is so...cute! I don't have better words to define it. I absolutely adore Jennifer Garner,and she is funny and cute as Jenna Rink. The story is about a girl called Jenna Rink(Garner), a 13 year old girl who strongly wishes to be 30 and have a wonderful life and a beautiful boyfriend as the women she sees in the magazines. One day, at her birthday, she wishes to all her dreams to become true. When she wakes up the next morning, she's 30 years old, a successful magazine editor with a great life and a famous boyfriend.However,as days were passing, she starts to know what she had become and how was her behavior since her 13 years old birthday.She lost her contact with her best friend Matt and even her parents,has no true friends,betrays her boyfriend and her friend of work is Tom tom, one of the popular girls in her days of school who was a total b.i.t.c.h.",/review/rw4604487/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2004,jon.h.ochiai,8," Remember What was Good...
","I put off seeing ""13 Going On 30"" when it opened this past spring. Though it starred the stunning Jennifer Garner, the movie looked to be a rip-off of ""Big"" or Disney's ""The Kid""-- 2 movies I really loved. I finally saw director Gary Winick's movie on DVD when on vacation a month ago. I was wrong. ""13 Going On 30"" is a funny, charming, and sentimental romantic comedy noteworthy on its own. The screenplay by Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa is unexpectedly bitter sweet, and quirky at the same time. This is truly a star vehicle for ""Alias"" star, Jennifer Garner. Here in ""13 Going On 30"" she is radiant, vulnerable, beautiful, and very grounded. Although Garner's next project is the action movie, ""Elektra"", her talents and gifts are so tailored for romantic comedies-- that being good romantic comedies like this. Jennifer Garner is a more glamorous Julia Roberts. Well, this is enough of my point of view. ",/review/rw4604487/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2007,Two_Pieces_of_Christina,10," Much more than a female version of Big...
","The body swap genre has been done before, and to much success, but the sweet nature of this film cancels out any lack of originality. Jennifer Garner, transported from a 13 year old girl into her 30 year old future self, gives a thoroughly appealing performance which is backed up with strong support from the likes of Mark Ruffallo, Judy Greer and Andy Serkis. Greer in particular is very well cast, she displays subtle but perfect comic timing, some of it improvised (watch out for the Bambi line towards the end of the movie).",/review/rw4604487/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2004,CitizenCaine,7," Garner Carries Film With Familiar Formula
","Sometimes a formulaic movie rises above its material due to the charm and performance of its star. 13 Going On 30 is one such movie. We've seen this plot before in Big with Tom Hanks and in its numerous followers the last 15 years. We have a female version of Big this time, starring the wonderful Jennifer Garner from ABC's Alias. It's impossible not to like her performance, which is charming, heartfelt, full of wide-eyed innocence, and star-making. It's clear from watching this film that Ms. Garner is headed for major roles in the future. While the film seems geared toward a female teenage demographic, there's plenty of wish fulfillment to go around for guys too. I mean who wouldn't want to be Mark Ruffalo in this film? To have a hot girl like Jennifer Garner calling you Matty and trying to make things up to you is enough for any male to maintain interest. The 13 year old Jenna wishes she was 30 when her birthday party goes awry and she blames it on her best friend Matty(Ruffalo). At 30, she wakes up as Jennifer Garner, and is forced to try to make sense of what's going on. In the spirit of the better recent body switch movies, like Freaky Friday with Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis, 13 Going On 30 isn't just a movie with comical results. There is also sort of a moral to learn, which makes the film all the more endearing. Sure there are several parts to the movie that require an enormous suspension of disbelief, such as how Jenna goes from 13 to 30, how Matty would even want to bother with her at 30, working with her magazine colleagues with a 13 year old brain, and especially what she proposes to revamp the magazine she works for. Do we really believe the public is ready to discard celebrity gossip and layouts in favor of ordinary people? Do 13 year old girls really wish they were 30 at times? I'm not so sure about that. However, the complications that ensue via the charming Garner captivate us, and make us yearn for a second chance for something in our pasts too. We can all identify with that. The dance sequences weren't as fun as they were intended to be; because, most of the songs in the film were released long before Jenna would have turned 13 in the movie, making them seem out of sync with her time line. Garner's bounce and energy were enough to carry this film, which is above average of its type. *** of 4 stars.",/review/rw4604487/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2007,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,7," Cute and sweet... accept that it's relatively formulaic, and you'll have a great time
","My fiancée and I sat down to watch this, not expecting much more than a cute romantic comedy, and Jennifer Garner playing herself(as seen in the blooper reels and behind the scenes interviews of Alias)... we were both very pleasantly surprised. The movie is genuinely entertaining and charming... Garner is sweet(and seeing her play this role has made us appreciate her performance on Alias all the more), as is the overall tone, and the movie is actually rather engaging. Admittedly, the script is formulaic to a degree, but if you look beyond that, you may very well like what you see. And the movie was effective and surprising to us both. The pacing was spot-on. It never dragged nor went by too fast, and the movie doesn't overstay its welcome. The humor was one of the best things about the movie; it's truly funny, it doesn't try too hard and it comes off as very real. It's reasonably inoffensive(apart from a few sexual innuendos), too. The cinematography and editing are both good, and tight enough, no real complaints there. The dialog is well-written and equally skillfully delivered. The acting is all great. The 80's feel and look were captured perfectly. The music, both selection and use, was also fitting and great. The message was really good, too, and it wasn't preachy, either. All in all, an entertaining and charming romantic comedy which will tug at your heartstrings if you only just let it. This gets a good treatment on DVD, as well... based on the Special Edition release(which I would say is worth owning for any fan of the movie), the menus and design are all good and there are several deleted and extended scenes, two music videos of 80's songs from the film, two games, a still gallery in video form, a blooper reel, two commentary tracks and two well-produced specials, one being a behind the scenes production. I recommend this, to any fan of the genre and/or Jennifer Garner. Oh, and children of the 80's as well. 7/10",/review/rw4604487/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2020,SofiaHedge,10," A great, pleasing classic!

15 August 2006,anagal,10," MAGNIFICENT Mark Ruffalo!!!!
","Ah, Mark Ruffalo is at it again! No one can escape his tearfully cute charm and sweetness nor Jennifer Garner's equally hilarious performance in this laugh-out-loud comedy, superior to the similar 1988 film ""Big"", featuring Tom Hanks. I just could not get enough of this movie! It just makes you want to marry Mark Ruffalo (even if you're a guy) and curse the day he married Sunrise Coigney (honestly, he is THAT CUTE in this movie!!!!) Everyone played so well and you can easily tell that everyone had so much fun working in this film, on set and off. It was an absolute delight to see Garner go from enigmatic super spy to bright but clueless 80s sweetheart. You even regretfully start loving the ""antagonist"" Tom-Tom for her totally ""happening"" skanky personality!!! The greatest theme of the film, to be true to yourself, resonates sweetly but powerfully in every scene. It is an utter joy to watch over and over again (Mark Ruffalo is beyond STUNNING and just reduces you to tears at the end, not because of the movie's ending but because of the realisation that you can't be his wife!!!!! Honest!)",/review/rw4604487/?ref_=tt_urv

13 November 2020,cricketbat,7," Jennifer Garner's innocent enthusiasm carries the movie
","13 Going on 30 is fun to watch because of Jennifer Garner. Her innocent enthusiasm carries the film and makes the outlandish premise more believable. There's definitely also some nostalgia involved in my feelings toward this movie, as well, because the 80s references are entertaining to see. There are a few cringe-worthy moments in the story, but overall I enjoy watching this movie.",/review/rw4604487/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2019,tabuno,7," Entertaining, Charming, and Refreshing
","23 April 2004. Jennifer Garner offers this comedy-romance a refreshing innocence in the title role with her playful awe as a 13 year old who wakes up to be 30. There are the funny comments, good ones and then there are the more serious moments, somber and sad moments, even tender moments particularly between mother and daughter. We learn about how people can change, what some people can become. This entertaining movie has its own charm and wit, a delightful date movie with an uplifting as well as delightful performance by Jennifer. While not breaking any real new barrier, Jennifer's acting and script raises this comedy romance above others of its kind, lifting the bar and offering a solid and witty experience for female movie-goers and those that accompany them. Seven out of Ten Stars.",/review/rw4604487/?ref_=tt_urv
