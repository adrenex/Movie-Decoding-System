30 September 1999,EAT Alex,," The master work of a great humanist director.
","When it comes to drama, The Sweet Hereafter represents the finest cinema of the decade. The film lifts the director Atom Egoyan to the highest place of Canadian directors -right next to David Cronenberg. With extraordinary intelligence, Egoyan -the maker of ""Exotica""- creates labyrinths of relationships. Brilliantly using flashbacks the director reveals the emotions of the characters to the viewers -a powerful way to make the audience feel anxiety.",/review/rw2786643/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2008,Turfseer,4," The Sweet Hereafter of Bogus Film Criticism
","'The Sweet Hereafter' concerns the tragic effect of a school bus crash on the townspeople in a rural town. Many critics were afraid to judge the film on its own merits and placed it on a pedestal where they declared such a film ""off limits"" to any kind of real criticism. Unconsciously the subject matter affected their judgments. Here was a film about a very delicate subject--the death of innocent children. The characters in the film (parents of the deceased children) were all shattered. It was as if criticizing the film was akin to criticizing these parents as well as any parent who had experienced such a tragic loss. But from the point of view of effective drama, the film is virtually a complete failure. Very little of it rings true at all.",/review/rw2786643/?ref_=tt_urv

25 February 2003,WriterDave,10," The Best Film of the 1990's
","Brutally honest, haunting, cold, austere and elliptical in the unfolding of plot and story, Atom Egoyan's restrained but powerful look at a small Canadian town ripped apart by tragedy and now invaded by a troubled lawyer (played expertly by Ian Holm) looking to make a killing off their grief is one of the most artistic portraits of the sorrow of everyday people ever conceived. The scene where Bruce Greenwood's character witnesses the school bus carrying his two children and all the hopes and dreams of a small town skid nonchalantly off an icy road and onto a frozen body of water that can't possibly hold the vehicle's weight is among the most chilling, heart-wrenching and gut-dropping scenes ever put on film. The revelations unearthed during the lawyer's investigation are both quietly disturbing and all too true to life. The intertwining tales of the townsfolk and the ultimately heartbroken lawyer are exquisitely handled by Egoyan and leave the viewer feeling the same loss as the characters. Tragedy befalls us all. Luckily, every once in awhile, so does great art.",/review/rw2786643/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2004,Carl_Tait,10," One of the great ones, but not for all tastes
","""The Sweet Hereafter"" was arguably the best film of the 1990s and is one of my twenty favorite movies of all time. Everything comes together perfectly: fine characterization and acting (especially by Ian Holm), beautiful photography, and a hypnotic musical score featuring Armenian folk instruments. The mood is deeply elegiac but never maudlin or weepy. There's not a false note in the movie.",/review/rw2786643/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2009,jaredmobarak,10," Wiggle your noses and have fun  The Sweet Hereafter
","How much money is your child worth? Is that a question you could ever fathom yourself asking? Atom Egoyan's The Sweet Hereafter broaches the subject with devastating results, showing the many ways in which one could lose their offspring and the pain and suffering it causes. But can that pain be tempered by a monetary settlement or a name being punished with a slap on the wrist? No, of course not. Vengeance will only feed your lust for blood; it will only make you go deeper and deeper into a descent towards hell. There comes a time where you must look at your life and feel rewarded for the time you've had and be able to move on, no matter how slow and painful that transition may be. This film is pretty much perfect on all countsstory, acting, pacing, directing, you name it. As it went on, I couldn't help but think of David Gordon Green's film Snow Angels and the comparisons of loss and renewal as thematic backbones. Interestingly enough, both of these films were my first foray into the two director's oeuvres, both possibly their most sorrowful and heartfelt, making me want to visit the rest of their works. What the similarity also does, over ten years later, is prove Egoyan himself correct. My screening of The Sweet Hereafter was followed by a Q&A with editor Susan Shipman who spoke of how just that morning Atom told her, upon revisiting the film, that ""I think it holds up"". He couldn't be more right; its relevance has stood the test of time.",/review/rw2786643/?ref_=tt_urv

","Atom Egoyan's The Sweet Hereafter is a drama of loss and internal conflict within and among the people of small town which has lost its children to a winter bus crash.

27 June 1999,Nedward,," Deeply moving and subtle
","This was one of the saddest films I have ever seen. I do not mean that in bad way though. I have seen sad films that made me depressed and I usually disliked them because of this. The Sweet Hereafter is different though. It is a sad film without being manipulative and fake. The film brilliantly shows how people need to have revenge. After a bus accident where all but two are killed the people of the town, after a lawyer pushes them on, become obsessed with suing those responsible. Egoyan looks at how people can not accept that things happen by accident. The people of the town feel that someone has to pay for the pain they are feeling and in the end they are the ones to pay for it. The acting is excellent, especially Ian Holm. Once you become accustomed to the time shifts this is an incredibly rewarding film that you will always remember.",/review/rw2786643/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2005,sol-,5," My brief review of the film
","A very strange drama, the film has a few interesting questions about responsibility and Ian Holm and Sarah Polley do superb work with intriguing characters, however it is not a film that is likely to satisfy every taste. The ideas and performances are all undermined by the narrative structure - it juggles three (or more) different story lines, with different time periods each, all at once, which achieves no effect other than to make it harder to follow. The film also fails to resolve everything by the end. It finishes in a too open-ended manner in which it is hard to know what to feel at all, and some aspects (such as the mental condition of the protagonist) are never sufficiently explained. The film has quite a glowing reputation, and it certainly has the markings of a great film - wonderful camera movement, appropriately bleak setting, stellar cast, etc.. It is just a bit too awkward to be a film that could satisfy all tastes. Sure, it is worth checking out, but I would advise carefully before recommending it.",/review/rw2786643/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2015,imbluzclooby,6," Interesting concept that is unevenly executed.
",Tragedy and moral ambiguity are explored at a very elongated and deliberate pace in this tale of a small rural town coping with a colossal tragedy. This is one of those Art house films that will most likely test the patience of viewers in that it's about 45 minutes too long. At least 30 minutes could have been shaved off this film to deliver its intended purpose or message whatever it may have been. ,/review/rw2786643/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2011,moonspinner55,4," Gaspingly pretentious would-be tone poem is variably enacted and generally overrated...
","A lawyer with a troubled personal life reflects back two years on a case in which a school bus went off an icy road one morning, killing several of the children on-board; attempting to stir up interest in a negligence lawsuit within the circle of working-class residents involved, he runs into an emotional roadblock...and an outcome he didn't expect. Writer-director Atom Egoyan, working from a book by Russell Banks, uses location and mood to fuel his bitter story, yet he has no grip on the character-driven drama which takes the better part of an hour to become absorbing. Ian Holm manages an affecting performance in the lead, but there are occasions when he shows the indecisiveness of an actor unsure of his inspiration. The supporting performances are also uneven, with Egoyan going to some length to make these small-town Canadians as eccentric and off-putting as possible (particularly the bus driver who survives to tell her story). Opening the film with a pretentiously staged portrait of an unclothed man, woman, and child asleep in bed, the filmmaker keeps a dogged pace--coupled with the colorless cinematography, is it any wonder many viewers tend to give up on the picture before we even get to the hearing? Hoping for an elegiac tone, the ironic aftertaste of helpless poetry, Egoyan alienates audiences without the spark of keen, natural-sounding dialogue and people we can relate to. *1/2 from ****",/review/rw2786643/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 1999,Aldanoli,10," A haunting tale about how nothing is ever as it seems
","On the surface, this is simply the story of a small Canadian town traumatized by a school bus crash.  Personal injury lawyer Ian Holm arrives on the scene in his expensive car, cellular phone at hand, ready to sign up victims for a lawsuit because, ""I believe there is no such thing as an accident.""  But that summary really tells nothing, because this haunting tale is not about a grasping lawyer or greedy victims, but about how nothing is ever as it seems on the surface.",/review/rw2786643/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is innocence lost, but it isn't just the children who lose their innocence: it's the whole town and all the adults. Nicole (Sarah Polley) dreams of being a rock star, and her father lovingly fosters the dream. He does everything for her including being her first lover. And then there is a bus accident and she ends up in a wheel chair and is told she is lucky, since many of the other children died. But she doesn't feel lucky. She turns her bitterness toward her father. She has read Robert Browning's 'The Pied Piper of Hamelin' to two of the children who died, and now sees her father as a piper who has failed her. The love they had, now in the light of the loss of her innocence, is seen as a fraud. And she hates him.",/review/rw2786643/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2005,Spuzzlightyear,6," One More Try..
","It seems that my passion for Atom Egoyan peaked when The Adjuster came out, then slumped when Calendar and Exotica came out, then hit the ""I'm not really seeing anything else this guy does"" with The Sweet Hereafter. Oh, damn, and that was cemented with Felicia's Journey. Now, you would NEVER get me to see THAT again.. But since this title became available for me to watch again, I decided to watch it again to see if I liked it any more the second time. And I do believe I had the same reaction as from the beginning. And that is.. What happened? I mean, there is some of the quirkiness so evident in all of his films,. And the acting is always great (Egoyan IS a actor's director for sure). The main problem is nothing really HAPPENS in the movie. Although people make a big production about how wonderful this is, and you know what? I can SEE their point, and it's really quite a clever script.",/review/rw2786643/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2005,howie73,4," A disappointment
","After the excellent Exotica, Atom Egoyan misfired with this warped and uninvolving 'adaptation' of Russell Banks's novel. Using the same understated and unsentimental style he employed in Exotica, Egoyan tries to make the story of a bus tragedy in a remote snow-laden Canadian town an intellectual puzzle of sorts; yet this story of small town immorality is in dire need of a Lifetime TV movie makeover rather than a deconstruction of its own willfuly obscure narrative. This is where the film is a spectacular failure - the story is too human for Egoyan's dehumanizing narratives. Egoyan is at sea when it comes to dealing with conventional emotions; he would rather intellectualize as he did in Exotica and The Adjuster. That's why I feel the film feels forced. It's simply not deep enough for Egoyan. So what does he do, he constructs a simplistic analogy with the Pied Piper (not in the novel)that seeks to add depth to the original novel but feels too literary and self-conscious to be cinematic.",/review/rw2786643/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 1999,Peach-2,10," Mesmerizing.
","This film has so much atmosphere, I actually felt like I was in this small town reliving the tragedy with the survivng parents. Atom Egoyan has made one of the most perfect films I have ever seen. The style he uses for his direction is one of distance and mood. Egoyan sets the tempo right from the opening shots and it never lets up. Ian Holm plays his role in a very understated manner, but brings passion to the role as well. The music to this film, by Mychael Danna, is very atmospheric and haunting. This is as close as I have ever seen a director get to a Kubrickian film. Sarah Polley is also very good in her role, the film also has some twists I wasn't expecting at all. This is an absolutely great film.",/review/rw2786643/?ref_=tt_urv

","Marvelous acting, excellent photography, cinematic brilliance. Those are just a few of the words, that describe this movie. It's a shame that it did not receive the attention it should have. Not even at the Academy Awards where only Egoyan received a nomination. Titanic is not half as great as The Sweet Hereafter. So go and get it... and watch it and watch it and watch it. It'll be an unforgettable experience. Because of its subtle atmosphere it seems as silent as a silent film, but its so rich in character and story development - with great actors in the lead.

23 April 2013,FilmCriticLalitRao,5," British actor Ian Holm gives a new meaning to a tale about selfishness directed by Atom Egoyan.
","After an attentive viewing session,most attentive viewers would not fail at all to notice that the most recognizable feature of ""The Sweet Hereafter"" is its candid portrayal of selfishness. It is precisely this feeling which helps us to understand how some selfish individuals want to derive advantage from other people's suffering.This has been depicted through British actor Ian Holm whose extraordinary performance suggests that selfish people are always armed with their own ingenious explanations about their acts which in the long run bring them their fair share of misery instead of happiness.Canadian auteur Atom Egoyan whose film is an adaptation of a best selling work by Russell Banks is hardly partial when it comes to describe how ordinary people deal with guilt especially when it concerns untimely death of loved ones.No viewer would like to side with the film's characters who are full of idiosyncrasies as nobody is innocent.It is no wonder that good photography and natural setting enhance this film's viewing experience for viewers at a time when its slow pace acts as a veritable spoilsport. Finally,The Sweet Hereafter is a film to be watched at all costs if you have not seen a film which has been praised excessively.",/review/rw2786643/?ref_=tt_urv
