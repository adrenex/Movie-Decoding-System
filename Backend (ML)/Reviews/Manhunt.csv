26 August 2017,cherold,7," Entertaining but increasingly unpersuasive
","As a miniseries about an FBI profiler, Manhunt: Unabomber is quite engaging. The series follows the search for the Unabomber, which increasingly focuses on the way he writes, as well as preparation for trial two years later, going back and forth. ",/review/rw4167356/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2017,Thrill_KillZ,8," So far a must see Series, Sam Worthington and Paul Bettany are both incredibly engaging.
","I watch this sort of stuff all the time, too much at times, but I can say that this has an insightful feel to it that draws you in fast and leaves you wanting to spend the rest of your day/evening watching the rest. It's so well made, the writing is very intelligent and doesn't spoon feed you as it goes along. I admit despite occurring in my Country, the entire series of events was nothing more than a series of news-lines as I was graduating HS that year and remembered little more than that infamous sketch and vague details of the case as a whole.

12 October 2018,robertemerald,10," One of the best based-on-fact dramas in recent times
","Alongside Narcos, The People v. O.J.Simpson and The Looming Tower, Manhunt: Unabomber joins some impressive contemporaries. This is way beyond a standard tv drama based on fact. What unfolds is the full intensity of what must have been one of the most researched shows in recent history. The tension builds from two main directions (alas no spoiler) each with their own barbed wire paths to follow, as well as a brilliant insight into the killer's mind, one that aside from being highly unusual, has got to be one of the most sensitive portrayals of the 'why' I have ever seen. Another highlight for me was that the damage done to the detective's life is distilled into poignant moments rather than being incorporated into one of the driving dimensions of the overall drama (a feature of crime drama these days one has to take for granted). This is likely because the breaking of this case was using highly unusual methods, or at least, one's not typically employed. It's all rather brilliant.",/review/rw4167356/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2018,emily-imdb,8," Paul Bettany as Ted
","I initially thought this might just turn into a FBI vs. Serial Killer standard crime series, however, when we are properly introduced to Ted Kazinscky - it becomes truly gripping. Paul Bettany does an incredible job of playing the role of The Unabomber, Ted Kazincsky: dark, ominous, highly intelligent and manipulative. I was young when the real incidents happened in the 90's, but I felt the series was compelling whilst not straying too far from the truth about this story. I'd recommend a watch.",/review/rw4167356/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2017,bola_de_pu,8," Interesting, but I think these show will be better explained by Unabomber's POV.
","Not bad, not bad at all, in my opinion Bettany and Worthington will be Academy Award winners if these show was produced by HBO or another famous trademark. First of all, if you're looking to see desperate violence, gunshots, fights and ""flashy violence"" these isn't a show for you.Is a thriller, a psychological one, between ""The Unabomber"" and ""Fitz"", and the bureaucratic processes in the government agencies that can delay investigations like this. The show have a really slow pace, but it comes alive thanks to the performances of the principal and secondary characters. Will see how the producers develop these show, but the first three episodes are good enough to give these show a chance. Hope ends well.",/review/rw4167356/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2020,ShelbyTMItchell,7," Just Hope the FBI Did Not Act the Way They Did Turf Wars or Richard Jewell like This!
","Really the FBI showed that they threw their weight, acting as high and mighty, and really did not care if Richard Jewell was innocent. That really could ruin a show. For not having unlikable characters. Thinking they are the best but really acted all arrogant and did not know it all the bigger picture",/review/rw4167356/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2017,ferguson-6,7," grinding away
","The line between Reality TV and traditional scripted series is officially blurred. On August 1, Discovery Channel will begin airing an 8 episode anthology that provides the backstory of the Unabomber and the unprecedented resources the FBI devoted to the investigation and manhunt from 1978 to 1996. Billed as ""Based on True Events"", the latest from Producer and Showrunner Greg Yaitanes (""House"", ""Banshee"", ""Quarry"") delivers some impressive TV tension through a talented cast and a fascinating and tragic true story that gripped the country for nearly two decades.",/review/rw4167356/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2020,Chuck4Ever,10," *** Phenomenal Season 2 ***
",Season 2 is PHENOMENAL so far.,/review/rw4167356/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2017,markstylesnyc,7," Interesting
","While the treatment might have been better.. I thought it was fine. What was amazing to me, the depth of detail, the insight, the development behavioral analysis techniques.. Especially the FBI figuring out when he went to college, and finding the 'writing rules, used by a world renowned Newspaper') to track down Kazinski ",/review/rw4167356/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2018,phd_travel,9," Different from other serial killer miniseries
","The first episode of the series has some faults. There is some unnecessary jumping back and forth in time 95 and 97 that is confusing. Don't be put off by this as things get better from the second episode on. There are so many good points about this series. The pursuit is extremely exciting, the linguistic connection is fascinating, the behavior of the stubborn bosses and colleagues at the FBI is frustrating. The episode on the Unabomber's background and reason for insanity is quite shocking. There could have been more scenes of damage to victims and impact on their lives.",/review/rw4167356/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2017,laracall-1,10," Intense, brilliantly performed, and riveting.
","Intense, brilliantly performed, and riveting account of the hunt for fractured genius Ted Kaczynski, America's most notorious bomber. Highly recommended for those who love gritty, well-crafted drama, as well as anyone with an interest in the darker side of American history.",/review/rw4167356/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2017,matthijsalexander,6," Overrated but enjoyable
","An 8.2 on IMDb. Wow. For what I wonder? Acting isn't all too convincing, script predictable and seeing that its based on a true story sometimes far fetched.",/review/rw4167356/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2017,zenmateisshite,9," Very good acting and compelling story telling
","I was unaware of Ted Kaczynski's story, but whenever the Unabomber was referenced in other shows they made it sound like a very dark ominous tragedy, like the Oklahoma bombing, but you can't even compare the two.",/review/rw4167356/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2019,dale-51649,2," Hunt for unibomber portrays psych major as finding him, major cred problems
","Most of us lived thru the Unibomber's reign of terror, so we have a vague memory of the way it unfolded. I actually changed a flight out of LA because of him. Nutty person sending bombs to random looking group of people, extreamly tough case to crack. This series has some decent actors reliving the whole scene, from gum shoe detectives to goofy psych majors, they arm wrestle over the best way to find the perp. PROBLEM : much or most seems to be fake.
I got suspicious when I saw the series claim that the profiler being the one that cracked the case AND Ted saying the most important thing lacking in his life was a ""wife and kids, FAMILY"". HUMMM.... sound eerily similar to Lifetime network movies of the week? after a little googling I found articles that an FBI agent wrote about how the psych major dude played b a minor role and how Ted said the part about the evil Harvard psych studies he was in at 16 yrs causing his lunacy to be false. Sad part is, Discovery producer says its mostly true. How dumb do they think we are? We know their freaky deeky they are for profilers and how they always want to claim they actually work.
The show had a decent amount of entertainment value, but seemed so intent on convincing us that it is ""brainy"" psych majors who have all the good ideas and the old school tough guys who don't. How do screen writers all have the same agenda? As I remeber the case, they published the unibomber's manifesto and the dudes brother recognized the way his nutty sibling wrote and turned him in
To make the story interesting they insert a wife and family and make the psych major get all nutty, kind of going all Donny Brasco on the case and becoming a unibomber clone. I guess the way things turned out they couldn't make a whole series out of a decision to just ""print it"", and like I said they LOVE profilers. Unfortunately, they usually just narrow it down to the entire adult male population so, maybe they just had to write something.",/review/rw4167356/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2020,A_Different_Drummer,10," so much better than it needs to be
","Season 2 gets off to a slow start and then builds, proving that season 1 was no fluke. Superb casting, writing, direction. Wow.",/review/rw4167356/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2018,mrvanin,4," Okay as fiction - far from being accurate
",Apparently the producers thought that the UNABOM hook would pay off - and the high rating for this series certainly seems to validate their low opinion of viewers' interest in accuracy. ,/review/rw4167356/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2017,celestekent,8," Brilliant detective work
",The FBI uses profilers to figure out who their cold case perpetrators are and in this drama our hero develops a whole new form of Forensic linguistics to develop his profile. In the process he is up against the entire FBI bureaucracy who is mired in the old ways and who reject Fitz's new techniques. Even with all that without the brother turning him in there still might not be an end to this case.,/review/rw4167356/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2019,cscigu,2," This is not accurate in the least.
","Sadly, if you do just a little research into the case, its plain that little of what you see in this TV show is true.
Fitzgerald had only a minor role in the investigation. He never met the the Unabomber, never questioned him, and did not write the search warrant as depicted in the series.
Fitzgerald was a paid consultant for the series, which explains his exploded importance here. What a crock.",/review/rw4167356/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2021,figueroa_j,10," When the government destroys your life
","Incredible but true story about a the worst case of police investigation you can see. Plus the worst example of journalism. I don't know how this poor guy Jewell didn't end his life, as he had no life no more.",/review/rw4167356/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2021,stylesm,5," Pragmatic
","The first season was good bordering on great. Performances solid, cinematography in sync. The second season however is a bit of an anticlimax. The story is fantastic but the acting in season 2 is average, particularly the FBI sequences. The 2 agents, the taskforce, their weapons - it's all wrong.",/review/rw4167356/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2020,bt698nhj,5," A joke on facts
","The show is engaging and well done . However, the facts are egregiously wrong on many counts. The timeline is ridiculous. Jewell was cleared three months after the bombing, but the show would have you believe that he was still the prime suspect over two years later when the Birmingham abortion clinic bombing occurred. One example of many examples. Enjoy the show, but do some research to get the real facts. Specifically speaking about season 2 on the Olympic Park bombing.",/review/rw4167356/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2020,mwilsonemtp,5," First season incredible, second season=💩
","The Richard Jewel story is good enough on its own, don't know why all this ""fluff"" had to be added in.. The different perspective was actually a nice, but it's completely offset by the lead FBI agent who's dumber than a tree stump and has the attitude of a turtle.",/review/rw4167356/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2021,mm-75687,9," Very enlightening
","Both seasons were interesting and entertaining. Both serial bombers are very interesting characters despite their lunacy. The show is well written and the acting is good. I especially liked the way the show portrays the FBI as a bunch of arrogant, overconfident, overrated buffoons. That is exactly the way any detective I have ever known describes them.",/review/rw4167356/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2020,MiketheWhistle,10," Jewel was the scapegoat and the FBI were keystone cops
",After the Jewel movie I did some reading about the story and it was close to home as one of my best friends was in the Olympic park when the bomb went off. At the time I was dealing with too much and was just happy my friends were ok and don't recall how much if at all I even remember Jewel.,/review/rw4167356/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2018,xiaoli_shu,6," Fine but not very likeable
","The acting is good. The narration is fine.
However, the portrayals of most of the characters in Manhunt bother me a little bit. It seems like only two people-Fitz and Ted-in the whole series are intelligent and everyone else is just foolish, stubborn, and uncooperative. I like dramas that are cleverly directed and executed , and that show both the likeable and unlikeable sides of the characters. And this one is...a little bit mundane...in my opinion.
Anyway, it is still a fine series. Watch it and decide whether you like it or not.",/review/rw4167356/?ref_=tt_urv
