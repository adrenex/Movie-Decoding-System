23 September 2007,unbrokenmetal,8," Really good ideas and excellent CGI
","I must confess I just watched this mini-series because I watch any film with monsters in it. I didn't expect anything much, but the 6 episodes of series 1 turned out to be a real surprise which left me wanting a series 2! PRIMEVAL is a flawless combination of comedy elements (with cute dinosaurs) and action elements (with big bad dinosaurs), and it manages successfully to appeal to both kids and mature viewers. The special FX are excellent, and conflicts make the human characters interesting. PRIMEVAL also has a whole bunch of really good ideas: let the creatures appear in the neighborhood, maybe next to your washing machine - not on a distant tropical island! Instead of the typical T-Rex, let's have a little known creature from the Perm age or even a predator from the future (so, they aren't even dinosaurs from the scientific POV). Instead of killing all the creatures, try preserve them and bring them back home to the age they came from, as any change in the past is potentially dangerous. Clever entertainment! Which also shows in the characters, since they are far from stereotypes. Helen Cutter (Juliet Aubrey) for example. On one hand, she saves lives and gives help, but on the other hand she won't speak the truth, is unscrupulous and cannot be trusted. Primeval - haven't seen any better series recently!",/review/rw8355307/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2007,rhadeya,10," A breath of fresh air!!
","Well, what can I say about Primeval? How about, that it's a very welcome breath of fresh air after all those godawful ""reality"" shows that we've had to deal with over recent years? ",/review/rw8355307/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2014,lothos-370-690020,4," Wilhelm Scream
","This series could be called Wilhelm Scream the series. The scream usually occurs in films and is used subtlety as in Star Wars or Lord of the rings when someone dies. Primeval has decided to use it in every episode, this becomes very old very quick. The special effects are OK, not terrible and not great, but considering Jurrsaic Park was made 14 years earlier and looked much better, it's hard to be generous even when comparing a film to a TV series. The acting is quite good, and the chartcers are believable, but the but given the sensational subject matter, episodes still manage to drag. ",/review/rw8355307/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2014,A_Different_Drummer,9," Fresh counts in food ... and television
","This show took me by surprise, and that's hard to do. As clever as the current crop of TV writers may THINK they are, they are essentially riffing on someone else's stories. (Like the man once said, there are only 4 basic plots anyway). And then along comes this. It was fabulously clever. Temporal anomalies. Beasties popping through. All kinds of strange dynamics among the group, strange motives, conspiracies, love triangles. When Juliet Aubrey turned out to be bad, that was good. When Hannah Spearritt ignored the protocols and ""adopted"" one of the creatures, that was ever better (and later episodes put the little guy's life in jeopardy more than once). The high rating is for the concept, the execution, and holding interest over several seasons. On DVD or streaming, this should be more fun than a barrel of hammers. And here is a tip -- I peeked at the IMDb page for the sequel, which was little more than an attempt to resurrect a dead show in North America using complete unknowns (something they tried to do, believe it or not, with THE AVENGERS decades ago). The few episodes I saw were wretched. Avoid it.",/review/rw8355307/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2014,ElessarAndurilS,6," Spoiler - could have been much more
","I was interested in Primeval after a few episodes and starting to genuinely like it in spite of some huge holes in the plot and the ridiculous story around Helen. My major problem is constant change in characters, especially killing the main one just when I thought it was going to be a show I was growing to truly like. But the lack of character development coupled with constant turnover of characters leaves us with a science fiction show with a premise grounded without story and characters that as soon as you care whether they are even in the show getting consistently killed off. Hard to maintain a following when all you have is a steady stream of nasty creatures popping up and needing to be contained by whoever is in the show at the moment.",/review/rw8355307/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2007,bill-piety,6," Fun from our friends at ITV
","Interesting premise - 'anomalies' popping up in diverse parts of London. These anomalies are naturally (one supposes) occurring portals to the past. The perfect plot devices - they remain for a limited time only. Just long enough for creatures to arrive and create a bit of mayhem. To date these have been prehistoric eras that ensure dinosaurs and other rabid fauna can come through and wreak havoc. We've had a diverse array of battling creatures that include giant centipedes, spiders and dodos. Yes, dodos. But, if you're looking for originality, you can stop reading and look elsewhere. Everything is game for these writers. Episode 4, with our rambunctious dodos, included hilarious thievery from Stargate, SG1.",/review/rw8355307/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2007,haresmaggot,7," ITV's answer to the Who phenomenon
","Okay, so the dinosaurs are a little hokey, but I really enjoyed the first episode of Primeval. The fact of the matter, you've got to look at it from the perspective that it's a UK-based fantasy series - so you've got to make sure you've taken a huge dollop of irony with the hole thing. I mean Torchwood is set in Cardiff - and making it look like a dynamic city took some hefty salt pinching on the viewer's behalf. So the Forest of Dean being the site of a portal to the past where dinosaurs can hide is really a walk in the park. So,getting past the dinosaur that moved like a Doberman - and the flying dinosaur that seem to have been taking cute lessons from my cat, the cast were interesting. Only Ben Murray and Hannah Spearitt were actors that I immediately recognised. I kind of knew Douglas Henshall's name. But the stand out actor of the first series was James Murray as Stephen Hardy. The tracker and hunter, with a penchant for playing chicken with huge carnivorous dinosaurs, is a good looking bloke. I reckon that he out-charisma-ed everyone off the screen. Ultimately, I laughed my socks off at the machismo, but that didn't stop me enjoying it.",/review/rw8355307/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2011,TheLittleSongbird,3," Pretty good to start with but ran out of ideas
","When Primeval first started it was pretty good and very interesting in its concept. However, in my view the show is getting worse and worse. The special effects are great, I like the theme tune and Andrew Lee Potts does what he can. But sadly, I wish I can say the same for the rest. The first series was good, after that it was clear the series was running out of ideas. There is a lack of atmosphere, because the scares are so predictably done. Then there is the camera work, which is very frantic and rushed to the point it is dizzying, the writing is now clich√©d and banal and the story lines are dully paced, lame and unoriginal. Other than Potts, the other acting is often lacking and it doesn't help that I can't connect to the characters. So overall, to start it wasn't bad, now other than the effects and two or three other things it is rather dull and unoriginal. 3/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw8355307/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2007,Superdud3,9," An unexpected surprise.
","After seeing the trailer for this six-part ITV series. I thought it to be another cheesy attempt to cash in on the current British sci-fi phenomenon. The tag line 'Time For Adventure' was the real put-off for me, though. And I thought it to be another clumsy clone of the massively popular re-make of 'Doctor Who' After watching the first episode (mainly out of pity) I had a change of heart. Sure, the special effects could use some dusting-up, but the show seems to have it all. Massive dinosaur fight scenes for the kids, a love-triangle for older viewers, witty one-liners even a missing wife for all you 'Lost' fans out there. The one thing that worried me, though, is the scenes of Abby jiggling around in her panties due to her humid flat. Now, I have no personal problem against this, but it seems like ITV are just asking for trouble from over-worrying mum's by making a show for kids at around eight on a Saturday night and then going straight on and plonking that in there. My underline: May not be to everyones tastes, but worth a shot for any 'Doctor Who' or 'Life On Mars' fans.",/review/rw8355307/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2007,Bert45,3," Not clever enough
","The first episode of Primeval went to air in New Zealand last night and I'm afraid I'm joining the ""disappointed"" team. I was looking forward to this as a fan of British TV but it quickly lost my vote, and not just because it looks like a cross between Jurassic Park and Stargate. That wouldn't have been a problem if the writers and director had shown any degree of patience with their plot. Instead, they rushed headlong into the story as if in fear of the viewers getting away if they stopped for breath. So there was no tension, no build-up, no clever mind games with the viewer and, by the end of the first fifteen minutes, we already knew far too much - as did the characters. And what the characters discovered didn't scare them anywhere near enough. The main ones are supposed to be serious scientists but they were far too ready to accept things that should have thrown their world-view into chaos. Big, scary creature? Well, clearly it's a dinosaur that's somehow found its way into the present day. Oh, look - big sparkly thing in the forest. It must be a space-time anomaly. We've all heard about those! And yes, let's go through the big sparkly thing despite the fact that we have absolutely no idea what it will do to us or what, if anything, is on the other side. (At least Stargate had the nous to send a mechanical probe through first). And the scenes with the boy were just plain lazy and crude. A dinosaur manages to track the boy right back to his bedroom in suburban England and then proceeds to smash its way through his window and wreck his room without anyone in the other houses noticing. And when his mother comes up to tell the boy off for making so much noise, she doesn't even bother to ask how the bedroom window frame came to be smashed to pieces! Pu-lease! Yes, I know that sci-fi demands a suspension of disbelief but good sci-fi doesn't insult your intelligence along the way. What it should do is challenge your imagination. Primeval doesn't do that - at least not for the adult viewer - so I won't be tuning in next week.",/review/rw8355307/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2007,ocika,10," Goood, good, good, oh yes also good
","Professor Nick Cutter is investigating the sighting of a dinosaur, apparently. A species which has been extinct for 200 million years. With his team, they travel to the region where it was sighted to explain how it appeared. However, as they investigate the dinosaur, a weird creature seemed to be killing anything on its path. Even I'm Atheist, I might say: ""Jesus you are real and thank you for this new episodes, this show looks very very good"". Very refreshing, very positive and very original. Excellent young British casting. I was surprised by special effects. It seems that these series has very high budget. I recommended to all Sci-fi fanatics and adventurers :)) ""Long"" after Jurassic park 2 and 3 painful movies, this is real enthusiastic and successful beginning of a promising story. I'm hoping that they will continue shooting, no I mean please, please, please continue filming.",/review/rw8355307/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2009,dalsgaard,2," Primevil
","It's just evil to make you get hooked to this series, and force you to sit through the end. Nothing less. The first few episodes were watchable mostly because of the eye-candy. The animation is superb, and I got to admit... I absolutely love Hannah Spearitt (Abby).",/review/rw8355307/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2016,tankace,6," Strong start but after season 3, I'm out!!!!
","Primeval was everything I was dreaming when I was twelve years old ,it had time travel, dinosaurs and in general prehistoric beast, science and good drama. The first and second seasons are close to be some of the most amazing television program I had seen and I was pump of my mind when the third season started and here we go down hill very ,very fast and in just 10 episodes these amazing world got tangled and lost its steam.",/review/rw8355307/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2010,Samiam3,6," Great idea, good start, bad progression
","So this is where BBC dinosaurs have come in ten years. Walking with Dinosaurs is without doubt the smartest prehistoric programme TV has offered. Slowly creator/producer Tim Haines and his studio, have made the transition from science, to show times. Primeval gets off to a good start but after one season, It gets clumsy, unstable and ridiculous, with little to hold onto but a few laughs.",/review/rw8355307/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2007,subscriptions-79,8," Refreshing
","Having read the general plot outline I was a bit skeptical about the concept due to some disappointing other movies with the same repertoire. I thought that after Jurassic Park I could only be disappointed. On the contrary, the series' balance between suspense and British humor is very much refreshing. I loved the pilot episode and I certainly will continue watching. The graphics are fascinatingly nice bearing in mind that this is not a heavy Hollywood-Production. In addition, the soundtrack is carefully chosen. All the actresses and actors play their part exceptionally good. Finally, the fact that this is a British series makes the whole concept even more interesting. For those who love the different British accents this is the TV-Seires of choice. Have fun!",/review/rw8355307/?ref_=tt_urv

","I watched this with some apprehension but I have to say I was presently surprised, I'm sure as the series progresses it will be a hit, good performance for Douglas Henshall as the moody professor searching for his wife. The cute flying dinosaur named appropriately ""REX"" steels the show I must admit I forgot that ex S Club Hannah was in the program you know what they say about working with Children and animals. A bit of Doctor Who & Touchwood mixed with a few dinosaurs and the time portal what more could BBC do!After seeing next weeks previews I'll be giving the DVD rental for the time being and be tuning in hopefully for more than two episodes.",/review/rw8355307/?ref_=tt_urv

","When I was younger, this was by far my most favourite TV show ever! I used to be buzzing for every episode on a Saturday, record it and then watch it again on Sunday! The concept to me was fascinating and almost every episode there would be a new dinosaur and I was always questioning what if this happened for real, especially because it was places in the UK which made it so much more relatable.",/review/rw8355307/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2007,twiggystardust,7," Enjoyable fluff!
","I didn't expect a great deal from Primeval which is perhaps why I now find myself pleasantly surprised by it. The casting is excellent and story lines, although sometimes far-fetched, are nevertheless highly enjoyable. It's the little gem on Saturday night TV which these days are pretty much few and far between.",/review/rw8355307/?ref_=tt_urv

","One commented about Hannah (Abby) walking around in brief panties... I am sure young viewers will not think much of it since she looks so young and they are probably used to see sisters or close friends doing the same. I don't think there is anything wrong with those scenes, she is very cute and plays her role well. All the cast does a pretty good job with their character. As another commented, it's a good change, I have had my fill of hospitals, cops, NCIS and soap opera. It's time for Sci-Fi again.",/review/rw8355307/?ref_=tt_urv

21 July 2022,walkingwithprimeval,7," A lengthy review of an almost forgotten cult classic TV show (with only minor spoilers)
","Even if you've never actually watched it before, chances are anyone who's ever lived in the U. K. between 2007 and 2011 has most likely seen a bit of PRIMEVAL at some point in their lives (or just heard of it, at the very least). Hailing from ITV and being branded as the channel's first foray into the sci-fi genre, PRIMEVAL was originally conceived by producer Tim Haines, co-creator of the astounding Walking With... documentaries. Along with his writing partner Adrian Hodges, Haines set out to put his passion project in motion by placing these long-extinct ancient animals in the contemporary setting of a drama programme that'd be more familiar to the home-viewers. To great effect, PRIMEVAL practically became an overnight success, with the show not only earning high broadcast ratings with audiences in Britain but also attaining a particularly strong following over in the U. S.. With 5 Series in total, the show ran its course and had a decent enough lifespan before eventually being put on life-support once the quality took a significantly big dip with the later couple of seasons. But on the whole, has the show stood the test of time? Short answer... yes!",/review/rw8355307/?ref_=tt_urv
