12 February 2003,mighty_pickman,10," brutal & compelling
","One of the best films of the 1990's, a brutal, brilliant & compelling film from New Zealand.  Brilliant performances from Morrison, Owen & Kerr-Bell as Gracie.  Morrison as Jake is one of film's most fearsome characters, full of true anger & hate but by no means a one-dimensional character.  As see the characteristics that made Beth fall in love with him in the first place, the passion, the charisma. A great script based on the novel of the same name. A must see 10/10",/review/rw0345028/?ref_=tt_urv

21 November 2003,FADrury,," A Powerful Depiction of a Family Coming Apart
","There are films where you can see extensive carnage and it doesn't move you. This is a film where you see a man hit his wife and it hits you in the gut like you're being hit yourself.  An excellent depiction of the impact of anger and violence on the members of a poor family.  In this case, they happen to be Maoris living in New Zealand. The father dominates the family because he is so powerless in the other facets of his life.  He's addicted to boozing and carousing and the only way he can really express himself is with his fists.  The wife fights back, but can be beaten into submission. But she's also allowed herself to be seduced by the boozy lifestyle and fears responsibility.  The center of the family is the oldest daughter (13), who is really the only one who can communicate with all the other members. The boys are either lost in life or lost in their own rage.  The youngest daughter is simply too small and clings to her sister. It takes a tragedy to allow some of these individuals to reach out for each other and try to re-create a form of family life.  A very powerful film, not for the faint of heart.",/review/rw0345028/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2005,ExpendableMan,9," Portrait of the self-destructive family
","Twenty minutes into this movie, Jake Heke hits his wife in the face. It's not a slap, but the full power of a clenched fist delivered into her jaw. She smashes backwards into a wall and collapses, cursing at him. Jake then picks her up and beats her some more, dragging her bloodied form all across the house and utterly mauling her, destroying lots of the furniture, trashing the living room and breaking glass over the poor woman's frail body. Their friends quickly scatter and retreat out the front, while upstairs the children huddle together in tears, 13 year old Grace Heke more than likely thinking of her earlier remark that ""people show their true feelings while drunk."" In terms of grabbing the viewer's attention, this entire sequence has more effect than being punched in the gut.",/review/rw0345028/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2003,=G=,8," A great film
","""Once Were Warriors"" tells of one woman's struggle to free herself and her family from the fist of abuse, the grip of oppression, and the slow assassination of self esteem at the hands of an alcoholic  husband. This film's story of a Maori (indigenous New Zealanders) underclass family shows the male turning to violence and self destruction to vent frustration with his plight while the female draws strength from her cultural heritage in an attempt to save her children and restore their dignity. Gripping, intense, and powerful, ""Once Were Warriors"" is a critically acclaimed must see for anyone into serious human drama. (A)",/review/rw0345028/?ref_=tt_urv

","I've been reading the comments that people have made on this brilliant piece of film making that makes me proud to be a kiwi. Although I'm not Maori, I have somewhat of an understanding of, and a very deep appreciation for Maori culture. It is after all a major contributor to the uniqueness of New Zealand, and it's what a lot of the tourists come here to see/experience.",/review/rw0345028/?ref_=tt_urv

10 June 2009,Emunah,10," The most devastating, depressing, and disturbing film I've ever seen in my life.
","I'm too speechless to say anything at length. The movie was... gut wrenching. I don't know if I can even recommend this film to people, because I'm seriously afraid it will give people nightmares for days on end. ""Once Were Warriors"" is a tough as nails, stomach churning, psychologically scarring and disturbing film about people and things that most are not even aware of exists. The whole cast should be commended for their incredible and brave performances. The person who deserves the most credit is Rena Owen who plays the female lead. Her performance blew me to pieces... she was absolutely superb. I've seen a lot of movies in my life, but never... never anything like this.",/review/rw0345028/?ref_=tt_urv

","As a Pacific Islander (Samoan), I could relate to the characters in this film, especially the father Jake The Muss.  As a warrior people, Islander life is hard, and it comes with the damage that was introduced to our people from European intervention back when Island people first had contact with the expeditious Europeans.",/review/rw0345028/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's interesting watching Once Were Warriors as someone who has grown up in New Zealand and lived in a suburb where many aspects of the movie, reflected much of what I saw going on around me. Crime, poverty, substance abuse, violence including domestic violence - all were staple components of where I grew up that relate well to the themes within OWW.",/review/rw0345028/?ref_=tt_urv

Her husband, Jake Heke (Temuera Morrison) is an alcoholic and a very violent person who likes to get drunk in his house and to beat his wife and also he has a resentment against Maori warriors because they doesn't accept him as Beth's husband.

15 January 2006,gelman@attglobal.net,9," Difficult, Powerful, Well Acted
","If you can find this film (we got it from Netflix) and have the stomach to watch a wife being physically abused -- and an even more grueling episode later in the film, this is a must. It is set in an urban New Zealand slum and centered on the deterioration in the marriage between a Maori princess and a handsome brute of a man who is prone to drinking for entertainment and who resorts to unbelievably brutal violence whenever he gets angry, which is often. I never heard of the actors, the director or the novel on which the movie is based. But it's gut-wrenching and extremely well done. The director is Lee Tamahori and the principal actors are Rena Owen, a beautiful woman presumably in her early 40's, as the wife, Temuera Morrison as the husband, and Manaengaroa Kerr-Bell as their 13 year-old daughter, the middle child of five. The story is taken from a novel that was a bestseller in New Zealand, and it is easy to understand why. The clash between the wife's Maori culture which rejected her brute of a husband forms the backdrop as the two eldest children, both boys and both extremely troubled, find themselves becoming immersed in their mother's historic culture. I won't say much more about the plot so as not to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it but each of the key actors is utterly convincing. Violence -- not just between husband and wife -- pervades the film. No guns the way violence is mostly depicted in American films, but fists, heads, knees, feet and any bottle, wall, appliance or piece of furniture that's handy. Morrison is no one you'd want to tangle with, believe me, though he exudes a certainly manly charm as well as physical attractiveness, making Owen's sexually charged desire for him totally explicable. Kerr-Bell is splendid as a sensitive teenager who does all she can to hold the family together and is ultimately defeated by her efforts. Tamahori, a first time director, convincingly exploits the squalor of the urban setting, the beauty of the New Zealand countryside and the simplicity and dignity of the Maori ""once were warriors"" village life.",/review/rw0345028/?ref_=tt_urv

","In urban Auckland, New Zealand, the Heke family is struggling. Jake is unemployed and a violent drunk. He's often drinking with his gang of friends. Beth is a mother with problems of her own. The biggest is that Jake beats on her sometimes. The oldest son Nig joins a Māori gang. The second son Boogie is taken from the family and finds a mentor in foster care under Mr. Bennett. Grace is the sensitive 13 year old daughter who has a homeless friend Toot. The family dysfunctions culminates with Grace's rape by one of Jake's drinking buddies.",/review/rw0345028/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2018,classicsoncall,10," ""Notice how you never see black in a rainbow, do you?""
","Never, ever have I seen anyone in such a constant and consistent rage as Jake Heke (Temuera Morrison) in this movie. The violence he dishes out is perhaps even more intimately visceral than that of Ed Norton's character, Derek Vinyard, in ""American History X"". At one point in the story, his daughter Grace (Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell) states - ""People show their true feelings when they're drunk"". If so, Jake's true feelings were not only inspired by his dependence on alcohol, but fueled by it to an astonishing degree. And like all true bullies and cowards, he blames his wife Beth (Rena Owen) for his daily outbursts. That she was a battered wife doesn't even come close to describing her condition as Jake's regular punching bag. Any one of Jake's fearsomely delivered fists would have been enough to end her life and early on, that's where I thought the story might be headed.",/review/rw0345028/?ref_=tt_urv
