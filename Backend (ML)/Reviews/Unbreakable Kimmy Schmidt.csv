29 February 2020,nancyldraper,8," A great new series.
","{Initial Impression} An excellent, quality production. Fine performances. Great writing, with real heart-pounding action. Not only is it a Canadian ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ production, but it is set in Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ - the first is not unusual, the second is, yet I see a rise in the confidence that good productions, once proven, will be picked up by American and even International broadcasters, which will allow our productions to earn their keep. Based on this premiere, I give this series an 8 (great) out of 10. {Medical Drama}",/review/rw8166766/?ref_=tt_urv

","Canadian TV often throws up some gems, this is shaping up to be one of them. A marvellous and original premise of a well-qualified immigrant doctor finding his way sets up some engaging narratives to challenge the protagonist. This innovation hoists this above the crowded morass of me-too medical dramas.",/review/rw8166766/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2020,rdpeterman,8," Great surprise
",Go Canada! Binged watched all the shows in 2 days. No shortage of effort to create a well equipped and staffed ER. Lead character and back story has great depth.,/review/rw8166766/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2020,sulav_karki,8," Good medical drama
","As someone from medical field, this is a pretty good medical drama with a different premise than so many others. A Syrian immigrant who was a trauma surgeon in his home Country now working at a Canadian hospital.. i have watched 6 episodes till date and it's all good.",/review/rw8166766/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2020,annaleighanderton,9," Pilot Episode is Great!
","Wow... I didn't expect it to be that heart wrenching. Starts off with a jolt! Very ER-esque. Doesn't stop for anybody. My heart was pounding and my pulse was racing as I watched the pain inside and out unfolding. I look forward to getting to know these characters. I hope all involved can keep up this quality and pace! If so, I'M IN!",/review/rw8166766/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2020,Top_Dawg_Critic,6," Thankfully it's not another Grey's Anatomy, Chicago Med, etc. +EDIT
","So far so good. Not your typical Hospital TV show, in fact, it's uniqueness and stellar performances by Hamza Haq and John Hannah kept me captivated.",/review/rw8166766/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2020,stan_c,9," Wow!
","I saw an ad for the show on MSNBC. It grabbed me so I watched E1 on Peacock tonight. It was better than I could have imagined. Lots of heart, great acting and interesting plot. I wish Peacock would drop all the episodes at once!! Thanks CTV.",/review/rw8166766/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2020,damarkle,10," I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!
",I'm really enjoying this new take on Medical shows. This show conveys how misconceptions of people can be really ignorant without getting to know someone's story first. These characters are wonderful. I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!,/review/rw8166766/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2020,bmiller59,9," YEA...please don't screw this show up.....POTENTIAL
","There have been so, so, so many medical/doctor shows and for the most part they all suck, need I mention them? Recently though a few have come out that are actually great (in my views.) This is one of them. So much going on, so much activity and it's all about medicine. LOVE IT!! New Amsterdam is one of the few and what sets it apart from the others is there is no relationship drama, just good old medical stuff.",/review/rw8166766/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2020,pietclausen,7," Touchy, interesting medical stories
","When this series started, apprehension existed about the possible contents being political or biased in one way or another. Fortunately those fears were unfounded and the series developed into good and emotional stories which touch one's heart.",/review/rw8166766/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2020,sophia55,8," Keeps Getting Better
","Transplant seems to be really hitting its stride, with each episode surpassing its predecessor in quality. Instead of focusing on bizarre and inaccurate medical situations to shock and entertain viewers, Transplant uses the setting of a hospital to tell unique and interesting stories about nuanced and realistic characters. It gives voices to the often under-represented, and tackles difficult and topical issues with ease.",/review/rw8166766/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2020,sheva030,8," Dudes, please dont blow this one
","So far its OK, for a ""pilot"" awesome even... The path is obvious - a little bit of PC for the refugees, suspicious law enforcement lurking around the corner, a frendly college or maybe even a suspiciously nice competition - all understandable. If the story keeps the employe drama on a DL, and crank up the medical aspect of the show - it can actually be a welcome refreshment from all the same old med/dramas that we are swapt with.... Truy it",/review/rw8166766/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2020,lightheartedbeing,8," Excellent Pilot, could've been a movie
","Very exciting premier! Lots of action and drama, well acted. It's interesting the Syrian refugee aspect. Uncovering over time the particular jealousy, racism on the part of the competitive medical structure, distrust on that part of refugees from an incredibly unsafe oppressive background and regime, and how that leaves people will be interesting. The premier was good enough that I'll see where it goes. I liked the actors, the production was great. I like seeing Claire from Stargate Atlantis days have a good role here. I like John Hannah too. The lead actor was really good, conveying lots without a word. I hope it doesn't descend into another medical drama. We don't need the edge of the premier over and over either, but it was a really top notch beginning. I like the timliness of it. I don't think we have a good understanding of what's been going on in Syria and the US's hand in it, especially our abandonment and destruction of the balance of power we brought to yet another regime bent on destroying what threatens it's omnipotence. The human cost is very real. I could feel it in his desperation to get out to his person even while wounded and his fear of government authorities. I really enjoyed not knowing what he had wrapped up, what was driving him to get out even while at cross currents trying to help everyone. Here's hoping it remains compelling.",/review/rw8166766/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2021,JohnRayPeterson,10," The one and only 'Hospital' series I ever cared to and was eager to watch all episodes.
","First out of the box, the pilot episode grabs you and won't let you go. It has a perspective no other series of the genre has tackled before; I'm talking about the main character. It was a brilliant idea to begin with, given all the potential an ER doctor refugee with battle tested experience could bring. Dealing with moments of PTSD, his bond with young teen sister as they both lost their parents in the war, a war still raging in their homeland country. Then there's a cast of characters all rich with very relatable challenges of their own. I love the cast, from the mature John Hannah as the ER head doctor and director whose Scottish accent is as sympathetic as it is brutally honest.",/review/rw8166766/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2020,samanthakdcamilleri,9," Australia Votes Yessss!
","Halfway through and loving the dynamic roles and storyline's. I am excited to see the potential directions writers will be going in Season Two and the positive dialogue this show will generate within the industry and for audiences. Well done, Canada!",/review/rw8166766/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2020,Lewis01-228-458550,10," The Best Med Show
","I am a fan of TV Med shows, forever. By forever, I mean since I started washing television in the late 40's. What makes Transplant stand out is there is less drama about the principals in the show and more about the medical activities. The cast is truly outstanding and the writers are in the top 1% in producing great scripts and storyline. You will best be served by watching the series from the beginning as the storyline is a continuous process that will keep you raptured. I am so happy to see that there will be second season and hopefully many more to follow.",/review/rw8166766/?ref_=tt_urv

16 November 2020,Lewis01-228-458550,10," The Best Medical Show on TV
","If you like medicine than you must watch this TV series. Its all about the doctors servicing their patients, with great interactions between the cast. At the same time it focuses on the Syrian doctor, who has a younger sister living with him. It does not offshoot into long side stories, but does go back to Syria.
If you follow medicine in the USA you will notice the difference in Canadian medicine where the patient is more important than profit is in the USA. Great cast and storyline.",/review/rw8166766/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2020,locklearconsulting,5," Another overwrought melodrama
","If you want extreme sadness, then this is your show. Weak acting and poor dialogue that they try to hide by moving the camera in circles around the actors. This show definitely needs some serious attention - stat! Never seen doctors in real life argue and bicker in front of patients as shown on this show. It also seems to be completely missing any nurses. It's like watching a cop show where everyone is the captain. In the end, I thought to myself there's hardly one likable character in the whole show and I would be scared to death to be a patient at this hospital of losers.",/review/rw8166766/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2020,catrionabyers-03732,6," Good beginning but...
","Good beginning, however are there no nurses working in this hospital? One thing that often puts people in healthcare off from watching these shows is that the doctors in them do all the work.",/review/rw8166766/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2020,phillip-ayscue-135-643247,7," intense premier but trailed off fast
","Exceptional pilot episode (would have been infinitely better without token racist cop) but through six episodes, it is clear Hamza Haq far exceeds his fellow castmates. The ""extras"" (weekly overly dramatic patients) are just bad actors but the regulars have had some pretty sketchy performances. Hope we get to see Mr. Haq again soon in a better series.",/review/rw8166766/?ref_=tt_urv

24 October 2020,fetacrumbles,10," Very good show not a soap opera
",I had it dvr'd and finally started watching. What a great show. I can't stop watching. This is real drama without having to deal with everyone sleeping with each other. Shows the trials and tribulations of living as a refugee. Shows the drama of an emergency room along with some personal issues. You find out the reasons patients are there more than just an injury. This is just a fresh look and a lot of good drama.,/review/rw8166766/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2022,estathena2,8," Season 1 Review
","A Canadian medical series is a welcomed breath of fresh air with a strong cast and engaging storylines. Transplant is a drama but one that doesn't feel forced, contrived, or over dramatic for the sake of it. The cast's strengths grow with each episode as we get to know them, the hospital, & their patients.",/review/rw8166766/?ref_=tt_urv
