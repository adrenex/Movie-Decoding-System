5 June 2021,Fella_shibby,9," Definitely deserves to be seen on a big screen but the Director's Cut is top notch.
",I first saw this in a theatre in 2005 and inspite of owning a dvd (theatrical version) i never revisited it but revisited the 194 mins Director's Cut few days back.,/review/rw1092184/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2020,Holt344,10," Director's Cut of Kingdom of Heaven is visually stunning and a superb film
","Kingdom of Heaven, Ridley Scott's epic historical film that many found bad with the theatrical cut myself have never seen it but I went straight to the Director's Cut which is the definitive version and I agree. The whole production is massive and impressive, cinematography and the direction of Ridley Scott makes every scene visually stunning, making every scene stand out with expensive and incredible sets. It didn't take long for me to get immersed into the 12th Century and Balian's adventure to Jerusalem as it felt that I was there with them. Now this movie isn't for anyone as it's over three hours long but I found it amazing from start to finish and my interest with that period of time, the medieval times helped a lot. For me it's a masterpiece in its genre, the Director's Cut that is.",/review/rw1092184/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2019,hugosoup,7," Listen to the other reviews when they say get the Director's Cut of this movie
","I watched the Director's Cut of this movie, which is why I rate it so high. Truly one of the best medieval movies of all time, just do yourself a favor and watch it. Sure, the movie is very long, but trust me, the movie is very well worth your time. Don't waste your time on the theatrical version, it's missing essential minutes that are include in the DC. So yeah, basically, if there was a movie to get the DC for instead of the regular cut, it's this one.",/review/rw1092184/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2019,Walter_Probinsky,8," Watch the 3+ Hour Director's Cut, not the Studio's 2+ Hour Butchered Cut
","There are two versions of this movie that are strikingly different in their impact and emotional meaning. The theatrical release is a 2-plus hour-long studio edit. The director's cut is 3-plus hour-long edit that was released later. I watched both versions back-to-back, and without question, the director's cut is the superior. It's not just a matter of additional footage putting more meat on the bone--more heart is added to the film as well.",/review/rw1092184/?ref_=tt_urv

4 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Great
","A exceedingly good film, it was true, dramatic, and amazing. the cast was perfect in their roles, espically Edward Norton. This movie had an amazing plot, characters, and historical accuracy. On the bonus the action was awesome too, Kingdom of Heaven is a must see.",/review/rw1092184/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2012,Pete-235,9," Best example of ""See the Director's Cut""
","Many of the reviews above I agree with, but I also saw the theatrical version and was very disappointed (6 out of 10). When the Director's Cut came out it was 45 minutes longer, so you fear the worst, MORE of the same. In this case, the story line is filled out and the motivations and characters are fleshed out. Eva Green went from, ""why is she in this movie"" with virtually no screen time and less dialog to a major character who moves the plot, as you would hope given her billing. The opening scenes in France are greatly expanded and meaningful. The action scenes are better, but not substantially. The Director's cut should have been the official version of the movie, the theatrical cut is a poor excuse.",/review/rw1092184/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Why was the Crusader braver then the pirate? Because he fought, not for himself, but for the Cross. What force was it that met him with a valor as reckless as his own? The force of men who fought, not for themselves, but for Islam. They took Spain from us, though we were fighting for our very hearths and homes; but when we, too, fought for that mighty idea, a Catholic Church, we swept them back to Africa.""",/review/rw1092184/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2005,DICK STEEL,10," A Nutshell Review: Kingdom of Heaven
","Kingdom of Heaven in 2005 will be what Gladiator was in 2000. Ridley Scott has delivered a worthy follow up to his Oscar winner, which is also based on medieval times, with a central heroic character, and supporting casts of characters based on history.",/review/rw1092184/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2020,classicsoncall,9," ""By what you decide to do every day, you will be a good man. Or not.""
","Without even a hint of knowing how historically accurate this film is, ""Kingdom of Heaven"" serves as a sweeping and expansive story, wonderfully rendered with gorgeous sets, costuming and cinematography to make the most of it's subject matter. I wasn't quite sure what to make of Orlando Bloom in such an important leading role, as he didn't appear to have the gravitas required of a leader to go up against the likes of Guy de Lusignan (Marton Csokas), Reynald de Chatillon (Brendan Gleeson), and most significantly, the Muslim warrior leader Saladin (Ghassan Massoud). It may have been his age for one thing, but his bearing and forcefulness didn't seem to be as much in evidence as I would have liked. All the others mentioned appeared to have the world weary look of men who had seen and done a lot in a world of intrigue and positioning for power. Quite remarkably, as defender of Jerusalem, Balian de Ibelin (Bloom) demonstrated remarkable courage along with judicious temperament in surrendering the city to a significantly larger threatening force led by Saladin, who in his own way offers a compassionate way for Balian to save face among his people, by guaranteeing safe passage for all among them to Christian lands. Having seen only the theatrical version as opposed to the director's cut of the movie, I'd still recommend it for it's moving story set during the 12th Century Crusades.",/review/rw1092184/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2019,TheLittleSongbird,7," Not quite heavenly, though far from hellish
","'Kingdom of Heaven' had an immensely talented cast going for it, despite being unsure about seeing Orlando Bloom in an especially substantial lead role. It also looked great from the trailer, and have liked a good deal of Harry Gregson-Williams' work which can be one of the better components of films. Ridley Scott is not the most consistent of directors, his best films like 'Alien' and 'Blade Runner' are brilliant but lesser films such as 'Robin Hood' are really not good (personal opinion of course).",/review/rw1092184/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2005,pmitsi,," Some history...
","Kingdom of Heaven is an entertaining and spectacular film, to say the least. However, being an enthusiast of the history of the crusader states, I would like to mention some historical facts and accuracies that generated the film.",/review/rw1092184/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2005,Antagonisten,7," Entertaining!
","I can start by admitting that i'm a fan of ""Gladiator"". And why do i mention this? Because there are more similarities between ""Gladiator"" and this movie besides having the same director.",/review/rw1092184/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2005,Duk,8," excellent, fair to islam, sweeping, narrative could have used tightening...
",I really enjoyed this movie. The way the movie started in Europe and how dark it was there... and the journey to Jerusalem... just wonderful stuff up to that point.,/review/rw1092184/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2006,rileymullins,10," Kingdom of Heaven is a Ridley Scott Masterpiece
","Kingdom of Heaven (KOH) is an amazing film. I saw it in the theater but the reason it's so great is because of the 4-Disc Director's Cut, which is a must own for any KOH fan.",/review/rw1092184/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2008,Theo Robertson,7," Sometimes Wonderful . Often Irritating
",I'd heard a lot about KINGDOM OF HEAVEN when it was released in 2005 . Most of the reviews were rather uncomplimentary so I made a point of missing it until it was broadcast on Channel 4 last night and as I write this review I remember a lot of beautiful things about this movie . Unfortunately I can remember far more things that annoyed me ,/review/rw1092184/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2005,MovieCriticMarvelfan,10," A great film by Ridley Scott!!!
","KOH is not Gladiator 2, first of all the movie is not about a slave dealing with Romans, at the heart of the movie is the battle for Jerusalem and two sides the Christians and the Muslims. KOH in my opinion raises up more issues than what Gladiator did and then some.",/review/rw1092184/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2020,syedsafwaan,10," An Epic Historical FIlm
","What an excellent film. A fascinating film from start to an end. This film depicts a good historical movie. an actor and director did a good job. Eva green was much beautiful in it. I highly recommend to watch director's cut version. In real Salah Uddin ayyubi was a smart, divine, noble and pious person and his tactics were more powerful than him. A great tribute to him through this movie.",/review/rw1092184/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2020,KOOLAIDBRO,10," This is for the Director's cut
","The theatrical version is OK. I might say a 6 or 7 rating.
The director's cut is one of those things after you watch it you question how people are actually getting paid to edit movies down. I get it. Not everyone is going to sit through 3 hours and 14 minutes and it is going to hurt the bottom line. The longer the less showings also, but when you tear a movie down and make it slightly above average when it was a masterpiece? You need to let it roll.
If you have watched the theatrical version and you liked it than you have to watch the director's cut. It's 45 minutes longer and it should be. You will not even consider watching the theatrical version ever again. I choose to act like it doesn't exist at all. If you haven't ever watched this movie WATCH THE DIRECTOR'S CUT!
What I'm trying to say is.... Y'all need to Watch Kingdom of Heaven Director's cut.",/review/rw1092184/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2007,kosmasp,7," 8/10 for the DC!
","The Directors Cut of the movie (released on a 4-DVD Box Set) is the one to watch here! It adds subplots and character moments (i.e. the kid from Eva Green's character) that are missing from the cut that was shown in cinemas. And although that was clear before I went to the cinema, I still wanted to watch this epic in a theatre.",/review/rw1092184/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2006,XweAponX,10," ""Vide Cor Meum""
","I had thought Hans Zimmer did the soundtrack like he did for countless other Scott pictures... Actually, the soundtrack is a clever montage of ""aquired"" music from other films and some other sources- Plus whatever Harry Gregson-Williams wrote original. The music in this film is wonderfully placed, each piece.",/review/rw1092184/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2005,Danusha_Goska,1," Emasculated and Lobotomized by PC & FX
","Let's get this out of the way right up front: Ridley Scott's ""Kingdom of Heaven"" stinks. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, in any category. In spite of its well-earned bad reviews, I went to enjoy the spectacle. Mistake. You could get more Medieval spectacle by flipping through an illustrated children's book about the Middle Ages. Or, you could watch a decent movie set in the same era, from ""Becket"" to ""El Cid"" to ""The Adventures of Robin Hood."" Heck, you could watch Monty Python's ""Spamalot."" ""Kingdom of Heaven"" was lobotomized and emasculated by Political Correctness and Special Effects. The movie is so diluted by its own wishy-washy Political Correctness that it doesn't even have narrative drive.",/review/rw1092184/?ref_=tt_urv
