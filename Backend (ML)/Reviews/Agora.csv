27 March 2021,eyad-bakour,2," Watch the Snyder cut that's the only Justice league
","After watching the Snyder cut i will never ever acknowledge this cut the josstice league , doesn't matter now this terrible corny tacky version is dead to me and surely every comic book fan you don't have to like Dc or love it you can hate it but once you watch the Snyder cut you will be like wow this is a comic book masterpiece.",/review/rw3859949/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2018,TheMovieDiorama,5," Justice League is, unfortunately, plagued with post-production issues.
","Here we are. The Justice League. DC's greatest superheroes come together to save the world...and what is the first scene you ask? Henry Cavill's CGI'd shaved face. Ohhh dear...yup...we're in for quite a ride. So with Superman dead, Batman and Wonder Woman must arrange a team of gifted individuals to stop the world destroyer Steppenwolf from, you guessed it, destroying the world. Sighhhh...I kinda just want to hug this film and repeatedly whisper ""there, there...it'll all be alright."". Apprehensively, I went into this unmotivated and expecting the worst superhero film since Suicide Squad. Fortunately, this isn't that bad. But, it's not great either. The film's greatest achievement is the coalition of the Justice League members. Their interactions, mannerisms and even their physicality was pretty much on point. Aquaman, although absolutely useless in this, had the physical prowess of a beastly underwater warrior. The Flash was quirky and provided several comedic moments. Cyborg was essentially the technological logistics manager. Wonder Woman and Batman were the parents who lead their children into battle. Heck, she even refers to them as children! Yet it all worked so well. Remember, this is a comic book adaptation, so the humour and light hearted nature of its source material does show. The human CGI for the most part was actually executed well (far better than ""Thor Ragnarok"") and the slow motion scenes with The Flash were gorgeous to watch. Snyder is typically style over substance, which is apparent here. The story is so boringly uninspired that it defines the word ""lazy"". I cannot be dealing with another 'save the world' situation. I'm also becoming irritated with underused, bland and weak villains who are supposed to be absurdly powerful. Steppenwolf was wasted potential. Constant use of green screen, hit and miss script, rushed third act...just too many flaws I'm afraid. Was it too soon for a Justice League film considering no origins for Aquaman, The Flash and Cyborg yet? Personally, I think so.",/review/rw3859949/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2020,Sleepin_Dragon,3," I didn't like this.
","I've been getting into the Super Hero movies, I've loved those I've watched, but this one just didn't work for me. If I'm being brutal I found it a bit dull, it feels like a tick box exercise, so much effort to get all of these big character and huge stars in, that they forgot to concentrate on adding a story.",/review/rw3859949/?ref_=tt_urv

","I saw the theatrical version of justice league and felt it as a blatant copy of avengers. After that I saw it's first trailer before Snyder's exit, I felt how awesome it would be if the original version released. One element whedon forgot to add which was one of the reasons for the success of avengers is chemistry between the actors. Avengers had memorable chemistry of tony-cap, tony-banner, thor-hulk, nat-cap, nat-banner and nat-clint. But here there is no chemistry between the leads at all. Batman, aquaman and cyborg were wasted.
Many hate Snyder's style but the fact is he does it with ðŸ’“. He had a clear vision about dceu with the 5 films (mos,bvs and JL trilogy) he had in mind. But after his exit the whole dceu is in mess. First, wb messed with bvs and now with JL. Please release the Snyder cut in hbo max.",/review/rw3859949/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2018,nothimme,2," Just a shattered movie with no heart and identity
","This was such a good downgrade, it's unbelievable. The movie doesn't shelter a soul. You can't show feelings to it. It's ugly. There isn't much thought put into it. It's like not a part of the Trilogy: Forced and lame jokes, casual and uninspiring score, stereotyped and predictable plot, cheesy and generic writing, undeveloped villain, inappropriate atmosphere, wrong character development... I mean how does one go from this ''Tell me, do you bleed'' to this ''There's something definitely bleeding'' It's like a 'joke'. Who wrote this garbage? I mean why, what was your motive?",/review/rw3859949/?ref_=tt_urv

2 April 2018,Movie_Muse_Reviews,4," The culmination of all of DC's superhero woes. At least it's out of their system
","Every time a new superhero movie comes out lately, we wonder if this will be the point that the market finally hits oversaturation, that audiences and critics will just stick a fork in the genre. When Marvel Studios releases that new movie, we tend to pleasantly discover there's more places these films can go; when DC Entertainment releases that new movie, we wonder how the genre hasn't died already.",/review/rw3859949/?ref_=tt_urv

14 September 2020,AlsExGal,6," Big-budget superhero mash-up switched directors in midstream
","When an alien invasion, led by the sinister Steppenwolf (Ciaran Hinds in a motion capture performance), seems imminent, Batman (Ben Affleck) recruits the world's heroes to stop it. He seeks out Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), The Flash (Ezra Miller), and Cyborg (Ray Fisher), but their combined power may not be enough, and they realize the one missing factor that could turn the tide of battle: the recently deceased Superman (Henry Cavill).",/review/rw3859949/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2017,amirmustafaa,4," DC Hasn't Learned from their Mistakes
","I wanted to love this movie, but it suffers from the same mistakes as Batman v. Superman. The plot is jumpy and incoherent, the motivation for the characters are sloppy, and the CGI is lackluster at best. Plus, Henry Cavil's face looked off in this move; you can tell they did a bad job removing his mustache. This movie wasn't all bad though. I think the characters and their interactions with each other are the best thing about this movie, but the characters are failed by a terrible script and choppy editing. This movie also has a villain so boring that even Marvel would be jealous. I think Warner Bros. need to make big changes to the DCEU or it's doomed to fail.",/review/rw3859949/?ref_=tt_urv

23 November 2017,d-beckton,1," Warner Bros. should be ashamed of themselves.
","Everyone knows by now that due to unfortunate circumstances, Zack Snyder (Director) and his wife, Deborah Snyder (Producer) had to leave the project for personal reasons, which enticed to the studio (Warner Bros.) to bring in 'Avengers' director Joss Whedon and ''finish'' it.

","What a butcher job. Let the master (Zack) do his thing, he knows how to make a great movie. I mean come on (Dawn of the Dead , Watchmen, Man of Steel, and the extended version of Batman vs Superman) All 5-Star movies, and then the studio steps in, screws Zack and gives the movie to Joss. This movie should be removed from all media outlets and be replaced by the Zack Snyder Cut. (the real justice league movie) Burn in HELL JOSS.",/review/rw3859949/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2017,luan-penna,," Just okay
","I grew up watching the Justice League animated series and I enjoyed every DCEU movie so far, so I was really excited to finally see these heroes together for the first time on the big screen. Unfortunately, the movie was a letdown. It's not bad by any means, but it was not as epic as it should have been. Here are my pros and cons:",/review/rw3859949/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2018,VVMini,2," There is so much wrong with this movie, it's difficult to know where to start.
","Let's start with the most obvious weakpoint: the villain. Steppenwolf is a laughably bad villain, ripped straight out of a 90ies direct-to-DVD film. He is just a big bland CGI character with absolutely no personality whatsoever. He has no motivation other than being the generic evil guy trying to destroy the world. Apparently it's not even hÃ­s plan. If I understood correctly, he's the henchman for some other character that we never learn anything about. His entire design was just uninspired, and he looked and sounded more like a weaker version of the Beast from the live action Beauty and the Beast than one of the strongest characters in the world, hellbend on creating destruction.

15 November 2017,garethvk,6," Better Than Expected But Deeply Flawed
","The long anticipated ""Justice League"" has finally arrived finally combining the biggest stars of the DC universe into one film. The proposed film has faced many obstacles on the way to the big screen ranging from script issues, massive reshoots and a change of Director for said reshoots due to a family tragedy that Director Zack Snyder suffered.",/review/rw3859949/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2019,Cineanalyst,3," Franken-Justice
","After rewatching ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015) and this, ""Justice League,"" it seems that Joss Whedon, who co-wrote and reassembled this, along with being one of the main creative forces behind the former MCU installment, managed to rework Mary Shelley's book ""Frankenstein"" into the two biggest comic-book superhero movie franchises. Unfortunately, they're both among the most flawed entries in those respective shared cinematic universes, but it's an interesting similarity nonetheless. It's as though he wasn't content with his stitching together of the horror genre and superhero fare for the MCU sequel, or thought that Lex Luthor raising a Kryptonian blood-brother of himself from the grave in the form of Doomsday in ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" (2016) wasn't enough of an homage to the 1931 film version of ""Frankenstein,"" that he had to try again. Too bad this is the worst monstrosity of Franken-supes yet.",/review/rw3859949/?ref_=tt_urv

28 March 2021,justinboone-31036,1," Embarrassment for Warner Brothers
","Rarely do you see another version of a film that is so fundamentally different than the theatrical release. This 2017 theatrical version must be compared to the Snyder Cut, Justice is Gray cut, or any other version that surfaces. Comparatively, this movie is a disgrace and the studio that put it out should be embarrassed that their incompetence is now on display to the world.",/review/rw3859949/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2018,Mr-Fusion,5," This horse needs to be put down
","Rumor has it that DC Comics has little control over the cinematic universe, which goes a long way in explaining ""Justice League"". To paraphrase Mark Brendanawicz, this movie's a camel; a horse made by committee. In other words, nothing about it works; certainly not the characters, each and every team member is either forced (The Flash) or just flat. Their personalities are terrible.

1 June 2021,Venomage03,2," Justice League is a mess
","The movie has a lot of Forced and lame jokes with a boring and uninteresting plot to it. Besides the jokes being forced, the team up itself also feels very forced. The villain is one of the worst I've ever seen, after his entrance he fells of completely and becomes uninteresting. Fight scenes were a mess with terrible CGI.

","I'm not a DC hater, nor am I a Marvel fanboy, and it's sad i have to start my review like this. I want DC to give Marvel some healthy competition while carving out their own identity, however Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, and Suicide Squad haven't given me hope. I had a good time with Wonder Woman but Justice League will be the deciding factor of it was one lucky shot or the beginning of correcting old faults.",/review/rw3859949/?ref_=tt_urv
