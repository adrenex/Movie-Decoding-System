12 March 2008,ThreeSadTigers,," Probably the most misunderstood film of this decade
","Given the vast majority of major criticisms levelled at this film, it would appear that a large percentage of the audience has completely missed the joke, or simply, didn't find it at all amusing. With Death Proof (2007), Tarantino creates such a loving homage to a notoriously cult cinematic sub-culture that many people seem unaware of how to approach it or even how to appreciate the sheer fact that the film purposely goes out of its way to ape the style of late 60's and early 70's exploitation cinema in look, feel and content. The film isn't meant to be taken entirely seriously, but rather, is a parody and/or pastiche of the kind of films that the vast majority of mainstream audiences simply wouldn't want to see. I'm talking about films such as Two-Thousand Maniacs (1964), Ride the Whirlwind (1965), Manos: The Hands of Fate (1966), Satan's Sadists (1968), The Big Bird Cage (1971), Boxcar Bertha (1972), Fight for Your Life (1977) or Satan's Cheerleaders (1977); low-budget films made with often-non-professional actors, little in the way of conventional film logic, and highly controversial in terms of plot, theme and content.",/review/rw1740701/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2007,MaxBorg89,8," Tarantino's B-movie: a spectacular ride!
","It all started as an homage to old exploitation cinema and double feature screenings. It was meant to be one of the most shamelessly entertaining films of the year. Sadly, after flopping in the US, Grindhouse has been chopped in two, with Quentin Tarantino's segment, Death Proof, being the first to be released on its own after competing at the Cannes Film Festival. It is not presented in its Grindhouse version, which included scratches, dirt, missing reels and other visual aging techniques; instead, we get the full cut, containing additional information regarding certain plot points and a few ""juicy"" bits that were left out first time around (a hot lap dance being the best new scene). And while it certainly would be fun to see the entire double-bill in all its glory (hopefully it will get a worldwide DVD release), I must say I really enjoyed QT's half as a separate picture.",/review/rw1740701/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2015,Matt-Canalcon,9," One of the most underrated films!
","I honestly think Death Proof is one of the most underrated films at the time I'm writing this (2015). A lot of people on this board seem to complain about the dialogue or the delivery of some of the actors. I personally think this movie has a lot of punch with a strong car chase sequence, very good actors, well-written script....and a perfect soundtrack!",/review/rw1740701/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2007,BA_Harrison,4," Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk. Crash. Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk. Chase.
","One half of the Rodriguez/Tarantino collaboration Grindhouse, kindly padded out to feature length for us non-American viewers, Death Proof features Kurt Russell as Stuntman Mike, a deranged driver who likes to deliberately cause fatal crashes. But when he picks on a car which just happens to include a couple of Hollywood stunt women amongst its passengers, the tables are turned and poor old Mike gets a taste of his own medicine. An homage to the violent, gritty, un-PC action flicks of the 70s, Death Proof comes complete with dodgy editing and scratchy film stock, in an attempt to deliver that authentic 'grindhouse' vibe.",/review/rw1740701/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2007,DICK STEEL,8," A Nutshell Review: Death Proof
","After the relative success of his homage to kung fu with his Kill Bill movies, Quentin Tarantino turned his sights to the 70s exploitation movies with Grindhouse: Death Proof. However, for us outside the US, we do not get the Grindhouse double bill with Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror and a host of easter egg styled trailers, but rather we get the longer cut of both movies. Many have said that Planet Terror proved to be superior to Death Proof, but without watching the other, I thought Tarantino's offering was pretty decent stuff.",/review/rw1740701/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2013,Al_The_Strange,7," It's okay in my book.
","In 2007, Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez joined forces to create the Grindhouse film experience: a double feature intended to emulate the thrilling grittiness and distinctive roughness of 1970s exploitation cinema.",/review/rw1740701/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2007,DarthBill,1," Quentin Tarantino owes Kurt Russell an apology
","The 2nd half of the ""Grindhouse"" film feature by Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino, respectively.

14 January 2008,luke-346,10," Remembrance cinema at its best!
","This is an absolutely brilliant film and a film that I could watch over and over. Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino this film seems to have divided audiences like no other, it has been adored and despised in many quarters and there seems to be no middle ground for opinion. It is cited, by Tarantino himself, as being a remembrance to the B movies of the 60s and 70s through the guise of Grindhouse cinema. In order to fully appreciate what Tarantino has done then I would agree that you must be at least familiar (on some level) with the films of that genre and era and familiar with Grindhouse cinema and its workings. It is not an absolute necessity to be fully aware of this type of film-making but it helps if you want to completely appreciate this film. ",/review/rw1740701/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2019,BandSAboutMovies,4," Sadly, a waste of time
","When it came time to create his part of Grindhouse, Quentin Tarantino had to figure out a genre. He said, ""I realized I couldn't do a straight slasher film, because with the exception of women-in-prison films, there is no other genre quite as rigid."" What he ended up with is a movie about a killer who uses his death proof stunt car - another obsession of his - to kill beautiful women.",/review/rw1740701/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2010,claudio_carvalho,7," A B-Movie Style Full of Action, Violence and Nice Girls
","In the City of Austin, Texas, the girlfriends Jungle Julia Lucai (Sydney Tamiia Poitier), Arlene (Vanessa Ferlito), Shanna (Jordan Ladd) and Lanna Frank (Monica Staggs) reunite in a bar to drink booze, smoke pot and make out with their boyfriends before traveling alone to Lake LBJ to spend the weekend together. They meet the former Hollywood stunt Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) that gives a ride to Pam (Rose McGowan) in his ""death-proof"" stunt car. Sooner Pam discovers that Stuntman Mike is a psychopath and he kills the girls provoking a deadly accident with his car. Fourteen months later, the infamous Stuntman Mike appears in Lebanon, Tennessee, stalking a group of women that works in cinema industry. Abernathy ""Abbie"" (Rosario Dawson) that works with make-up; the stuntwomen Zoë Bell and Kim (Tracie Thoms) and B-actress and model Lee (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) are chased by the maniac, but the girls are tough and decide to fight back.

24 February 2014,Mr-Fusion,4," Too many talkie scenes make this a slow ride to Grandma's house
","I really liked the pre-show '70s bumpers and the scratched film. Tarantino really knows how to set the vibe. But ""Death Proof"" is terrible. For far too long, this thing just moves at a snail's pace. Even Kurt Russell and his show-stopping (über-violent) big scene just gets lost in the neverending parade of dialogue scenes. Ladies talking about nothing. They converse in and out of cars, dive bars, on-and-on. Wouldn't mind it so much if there was substance - but these conversations are nothing like Tarantino's usual writing. The opening scene in 'Reservoir Dogs"" (Madonna, tipping your waitress) was maybe a few minutes, but there was much more to that scene than we ever learn about these girls in the first half of ""Death Proof"".

2 May 2008,DaveDiggler,6," Quentin Tarantino at his Best and Worst
","Only a Tarantino film can give you the feeling of pure boredom and electric intensity all at the same time. Both can come of simple conversation and over-the-top action. ""Death Proof"" is the quintessential Tarantino film, where he has long, drawn out conversations that are constantly interrupted yet free flowing and very natural as the characters talk about everyday things (pop culture) and use quirky old sayings. Tarantino is easily the greatest writer you could think of for pure dialogue and even though that's his greatest asset, it's also his biggest flaw. The film is cut into two halves and the first half is excellent. The ending is great (in both halves), but man, did that middle nearly put you to sleep or what?!?! It's not that it was incredibly boring material. The problem was: This was two similar movies smashed into one, with a ton of common parallels, Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell), being the main figure. The second half doubles back on the first half; ultimately repeating itself. The women are powerful. They can control men because men are pigs and only think with their little heads as the women in charge tease them with their sexuality. Even though the girls aren't whores, they surely push the limits because when they don't put out, they'll get a guys respect- a common theme with both the first half and the second coming from eight different women who all think the same. The standout female performance came from Vanessa Ferlito (Arlene) who brought a certain flare to the screen that made the viewer care for her more than anyone else. She nailed this performance and carried the first half along with Russell. ",/review/rw1740701/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2019,Vartiainen,7," Way too talky, even for a Tarantino
","Death Proof, directed by Quentin Tarantino, is the other half of the Grindhouse double exploitation experience. The other half being Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror. In it an aged stunt driver, played by Kurt Russel, stalks different groups of women in his souped-up muscle car, getting sick kicks out of their terror.",/review/rw1740701/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2008,dbborroughs,1," emperor has no clothes. This film isn't much of anything
",This started as part of the double feature feature Grindhouse and it has now been released as a single film. I didn't like it in Grindhouse and seeing it alone I think this is a pretty poor film.,/review/rw1740701/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2007,teh_mode,7," It's a bit of a mess, but like all car crashes, you can't help but stare at it.
","Clunky editing, grainy filming, laughable stories, ultra-violence and exploitation in the guise of feminism and blacksploitation. Not the most appealing of conventions when it comes to the modern cinema audience. Perhaps this explains, to a certain extent, why the old drive-in formula of watching back-to-back trashy hardcore exploitation films was lost on American audiences. Grindhouse took a paltry $4.2 million on its opening weekend and has thus far failed to make back even half the double movie's budget. This despite most critics who went to see it having nothing but praise for Tarantino and chums. But apparently only seeing the numbers, Quentin and co-director Robert Rodriguez decided it would be best to split their respective stories apart, and release them as two movies in the UK, flying in the face of Grindhouse logic.",/review/rw1740701/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2008,johnnyboyz,4," A really bad film, bordering on the embarrassing for Tarantino.
","If, like me, you didn't like Death Proof then about an hour into the film you'll start rubbing the bridge of your nose or maybe twitching your right index finger over your left eyebrow and squinting down at the floor, repeating in your head (or aloud) every five minutes of so: 'I can't believe Quentin Tarantino made this, I can't believe Quentin Tarantino made this'. It is sad but equally as surprising just how low Tarantino has sunk with Death Proof, one half of an experiment (nothing more) he did with Robert Rodriguez called 'Grindhouse' which was supposed to recreate a 1970s, exploitation style experience in a Grindhouse cinema in which you'd see low-rent horror/sci-fi in all its gloriously gritty and patchy glory.",/review/rw1740701/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2008,bob the moo,," Stretched to the point of breaking with not enough of value outside of the action

23 September 2007,icdrgon,1," Not even close
","This movie was a total disgrace to the genre and shouldn't be mentioned in the same breath as movies that showed in the old Grindhouses.
