2 February 2017,mjplysaght,10," The best show Nickelodeon has aired
","OK, so I was 12 when this show came out and needless to say, I was completely enamored by it. For a TV station like Nickelodeon, best known for its wacky shows like SpongeBob, Rocko's Modern Life and their sitcoms like Drake and Josh, to suddenly come out with this anime-inspired animated series with deep philosophical themes as well as tackling genocide and war, this was a massive step forward.",/review/rw1933458/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2018,cuzzinman,10," Great show with fantastic messages, lessons, philosophical discussions, character development, plots, and comedy
","This is show is one of the best shows ever created. There are many great lessons in this show that all people (adults and kids) should learn. The show delves into many branches of philosophy, including moral philosophy, that teaches people how to think critically and to always help and understand others. The show has a fantastic plot filled with great comedy and character development. The show has great action scenes as well! I highly recommend this show to everyone!",/review/rw1933458/?ref_=tt_urv

11 October 2010,KineticSeoul,9," One of the best animated shows I seen
","This is a anime style cartoon that kids and adults will enjoy watching. It really is one of the best cartoon show I seen in a while, there is little to almost no flaw to this show. I really wished it was longer though, instead of just 3 seasons. It really is a memorable adventure, which has many elements that will keep your attention from beginning to end. Plus just about every characters in this show is memorable and not just the main characters either, and for a bunch of cartoon characters I actually cared about what happens to them. One of the best animated series I seen, and I highly recommend anyone that enjoys a good story in a cartoon to watch this amazing show.",/review/rw1933458/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2005,ericjcant-1,10," The best in animated storytelling...
","Even though Avatar is of American origin, it has a lot of Japanese anime influence, particularly visually, but keeps the best of both animation cultures with it's American sense of playfulness and more realized characterization. The creators of Avatar have really crafted an artistic piece of fun and creative storytelling that is a rare gem for American TV. Avatar has strength in all the major areas of film and story, starting at ground level with an exceptionally believable world setting where war is taking place among the different nations. The main characters who find themselves caught in this struggle are three teens named Katara, Sokka, and Aang (the Avatar) who have set forth to bring harmony to the world through their influence and through the powers of the still developing Avatar. There is lot of humor and fun in this show, and you can't help but to really love these characters and their pets. But this is just the beginning of the glue that keeps you coming back. Great plots and stunning visuals are just as much of importance to the overall success of the show. The story lines are top notch, being both episodic in nature and chronologically integral from one show to the next. Each episode usually introduces a new and genuinely interesting opposition and/or characters to be overcome by the end of the show, and visually there is plenty of awe inspiring backgrounds and quality animation. With just enough well paced action, some sincere points of moral conviction (can you believe it), and witty humor makes the show a winning combination. This is entertainment for all ages, and definitely a must see.",/review/rw1933458/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2009,Quinoa1984,10," not just a great animated show or 'kids' show, it's a major show of this decade
","Avatar The Last Airbender shouldn't be underestimated. For a while I didn't even look twice at it due to it being on Nickelodeon and me being past the age of watching anything on Nick aside from the classic Nicktoons or Nick shows from the 1990s. But word got around that it was really fantastic, a sort of Kung fu style show where a master goes from place to place having adventures. Turns out the people I heard the word from weren't kidding: the saga of Aang, the last airbender and Avatar, who masters the four elements (air, earth, water, fire) and has to save the world by stopping the power-hungry fire lord, Ozai, is as epic as anything I've ever seen. It's an achievement of storytelling that creeps up on you, and while the first season isn't perfect the second season delivers episode after episode that enriches the characters and makes us care about them as we would in, for obvious example, Star Wars.",/review/rw1933458/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2014,theblackscythe,10," A Statement On Perfection. True Unequaled Bliss.
","This review will be very long. I adore this show with every fibre of my being, and view it to be a piece of animated perfection. I implore people to avoid the disgusting live-action adaptation by director M. Night Shyamalan, as it is a disrespectful sham that mocks everything that the show stood for and mastered.So as for the show itself, where to begin? Well let's start with the story overall.

","Recently, I replied to a thread on the Rocko's Modern Life boards, and I was absolutely shocked to learn that there were those who considered this as Nick's worst. Sorry, I disagree completely. Avatar:The Last Airbender in my opinion doesn't deserve to be included down there with ChalkZone and Rocket Power, if anything this is one of Nick's best shows along with Rocko's Modern Life, Ren and Stimpy and Angry Beavers.",/review/rw1933458/?ref_=tt_urv

","Avatar: The Last Airbender is a very mature show that can be enjoyed at any age. This show has some of the greatest characters of all time and all of them go through realistic character arcs that natural. Gorgeous animation and amazing music give the show a cinematic feel. Despite an incredible first season, each season improves its quality greatly and doesn't cease to surprise and amaze me. Avatar: The Last Airbender is a perfect animated show.",/review/rw1933458/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2014,Alex_Hodgkinson,10," Satisfyingly Well-Rounded
","This series has brought out the child in me. I have been watching a series of TV marathons, and started to grow tired of the situation comedies which are there for humour and the serious dramas where everything is so dark and real. I wanted an adventure that is fun and I don't have to see all of the dark, realistic moments. This show was perfect for that. It brought out my inner child with its silly, fun and happy nature, yet still had an exciting, well rounded and intense story. It hit almost every mark.",/review/rw1933458/?ref_=tt_urv

Well it came to Netflix so I said ok begrudgingly, thinking it was more so a show for him to enjoy his nostalgia and I definitely didn't think it would be enjoyable to see as an adult, assuming it was a kids show.",/review/rw1933458/?ref_=tt_urv

","Where to begin with this series, despite being a series made for children, this is one of those rare shows that could be enjoyed by all ages. The journey that Aang and his team experience is some of the best character development I have seen with a particular praise for the redemption arc of a certain character which is the BEST redemption arc on television. The series tackles a lot of adult con-tent with humorous segments sprinkled in which helps balances the series out with a fantastic world not unlike anything else on television. There is a reason as to why this show has has persisted in the publics' memory and you have to see this to truly experience the legend of the last Airbender.",/review/rw1933458/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2017,BoxwoodExpress,10," Best Cartoon In Existence
","Haters gonna hate! This show is the best cartoon in the entire world! It's not supposed to be an anime, even though it looks like one. Avatar the Last Airbender was a strong show with good writing, acting, storytelling, art/animation, music, pretty much everything. It is set in an imaginative world where people have aerokinesis, hydrokinesis, geokinesis, or pyrokinesis. the Sozin's Comet four part series finale was the best of the series. Even in the filler eps it was still good, I mean watch Tales of Ba Sing Se. Overall this is the best show ever.",/review/rw1933458/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2006,dee.reid,10," An incredibly good show?
","When I first heard of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" I was more than a little skeptic. The fact that it was airing on Nickelodeon was probably the reason I just kind of shook my head. Then about three months ago, on a complete whim, I bought the first two chapters of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" on DVD from Barnes & Noble Booksellers and, boy, was I blown away! This is one of the most humorous, fun, action-packed, and generally all-around entertaining cartoons I've seen in the longest time. It's just a pity that shows like ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" are such a rarity these days. I'll be turning 21 on the 12th of next month; 13 years ago around this time at the age of 7, I remember that Nickelodeon had some of the best of children's programming on cable television. Then, 10 years ago, Nick began to slide into idiocy and continues to do so as I write this. Then around 1999, I gave up on Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network completely. My opinion of both channels hasn't changed. But ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" what I presume is an attempt to add a little pseudo-Anime'-style animation to its lineup in order to catch stragglers from other cultures (and perhaps Nick-weary adults like myself), is a breath of fresh air for this once-tired soul. While I don't think today's kids may completely understand the overall significance of some of this show's philosophy, subtext and terms (how many 5-year-olds know what an ""avatar"" is?), they may not have to be versed in Eastern Thought to get everything. ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" a fusion of Eastern philosophy, Hinduism and martial arts, is set in a far-off land (dare I say, a Middle-Earth clone?) where four tribes rule the world and the most gifted members of each tribe have mastery over the Four Greek Elements: Air, Earth, Fire, and Water. The mastery of each of these is the term ""bending,"" the ability to manipulate each element and use it for creative or destructive purposes. The Avatar, a sort of Christ-/Buddha-like figure, has mastery over all elements and is the most powerful bender of all. The main plot of the story gets underway when the Fire Nation grows too powerful and sets off on a campaign of world domination. But they first need the Avatar, who has mysteriously disappeared. Prince Zuko, from the Fire Nation, is leading a mission to capture the Avatar and gain re-admittance back to his kingdom. Two Water Tribe teenagers, a brother and sister named Sokka and Katara, respectively, make the discovery of a lifetime when they find that Aang, a 12-year-old Airbender who was frozen in a block of ice and also happens to be the last of his kind, is the new Avatar. But he still has many skills to master in a very short period of time, and the show follows the trio's journey to the North Pole with the mammoth six-legged bison Appa and the lemur Momo. If only more shows on Nickelodeon could follow the promise that ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" has. What boggles my mind about this cartoon is its style, which, it really has that is completely original, even though the influence of Japanese Anime' is obviously apparent. We get some fairly funny jokes here and there, way out-there philosophy, and kung-fu-style element-bending battles that are pretty hard to top; it's the single greatest piece of imagination in today's children's programming! But my praise for ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" doesn't really restore my faith in this channel (unless they wipe the slate clean and bring back all the original programs from my youthful years), it just reaffirms a hunch that they do have an ounce of competency left when it comes to entertainment.",/review/rw1933458/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2011,haris_manda,10," The best out there
","I never thought I'd say this, but this is one of the best things ever on TV. It is so mature, yet so childish; the perfect balance suitable for anyone. I am 16y old, and I find this show fascinating. There is so much wisdom in it, yet collided with humor and plain stupidity that you just can't say 'No' to this show. I am just glad they ended it the way they did, without bumping out the money of him, like people did to many shows. It started so naively, and ended so gloriously. What really made this show are characters; each and every one of them - from the king of the Earth Kingdom, to the very Avatar. There's a mix of 'sweet love' of childhood, 'sweet pain' of it, yet there are losses, honesty, discovery of the depths of the souls and so much more.",/review/rw1933458/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2010,Rectangular_businessman,10," Very good series
","This was a very good animated series. At first, one could think that it is something like ""Ben 10"" (Read: an American cartoon that tries too hard to imitate the visual style and characterization from anime series) but I ended liking this series. The animation is nice and detailed, the characters are interesting and have a great development while the plot advances, the storyline is complex and very well made, full of action, drama, comedy and mystery. Many of the elements of the story seem to be influenced by the mythology of China and India, and the result is simply incredible. The writers managed very well to keep the plot interesting, from the very beginning until the end. ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" is one of the best cartoons ever produced by Nickelodeon, along with ""Invader Zim"", ""Rocko"" and ""Ren & Stimpy"" (Despite being completely different to those series) I highly recommend to anyone.",/review/rw1933458/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2014,MissSimonetta,10," We still haven't seen anything else like it
","I became interested in this show after watching the disappointing first season of its successor, The Legend of Korra. I wondered why people loved it so and doubted it would impress. Well, thank God, I was proved wrong!",/review/rw1933458/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2006,Styrophoamicus,10," Avatar
","When I fist heard of Avatar: The Last Airbender, I was a little septic. It seemed like it would just turn out to be another cheesy, serialized anime whose only purpose is to make cash. That, and when I watched the first Avatar episode, I noticed that it wasn't a 'true' anime. Avatar is, what I call, 'hybrid' anime: in other words, anime created here in North America. This only added to my skepticism. I have had bad experiences with hybrid anime. Shows like Martin Mystery and Totally Spies are hybrids, and watching them nearly makes me gag. The anime style is chosen for no reason other than to attract audiences. Their movements are quick, jerky, and you can tell they try way to hard to mimic traditional anime style, but in that sense, they fail horribly. Their written is witless and linear (i.e: the jokes in Totally Spies all relate to some sort of stereotype of girls, like hair, nails, etc) and the plot lines are all contrived (i.e: every episode of Martin Mystery). Yet Avatar: The Last Airbender succeeded where all other 'hybrids' had failed. The anime style was chosen for artistic reasons, and each of the character's movements are very fluid, and almost reach movie quality. There are typical anime elements that give the show a surreal touch without taking it over the edge, such as Appa, the flying bison, or the Spirit World. The action scenes probably impressed me the most, as the animators focus mainly on the ensuing battle, and not so much as the reactions of the fighter's or the onlookers. Each battle has a point, as well, and not just some random duel. The character's are very well drawn out, not just in an animated-sense, but also the depth of each character. But more importantly, we see these characters evolve through their adversities, and we see how they struggle to cope with their tasks, which sometimes require them to question their morals. Again, the humour in Avatar is genuine, and always makes me laugh, whether it be a quick quip from Sako, the running joke of the Cabbage Man, or even the coincidential irony. Even it's serious moments are well written, and the character's words have a deeper meaning. One of my favourite quotes is, ""Part of being a man is knowing where you are needed"". But what impressed me the most is how deep Avatar actually goes. The show has it's own mythology that is easy to follow, but sports a deeper meaning. Each tribe or nation represents a different element, but the fire nation is the main antagonist in Avatar. Yet we gain insight as to why this is. Fire is probably the most dangerous element, as it is essentially alive, and can destroy almost anything. This give us insight into the fire nation's need for power. Yet the fire nation has its own morals too, and we occasionally see things from their side, a technique that helps us gain better understanding for the fire nation, and even creates pathos for character's like Prince Zuko. Each tribe has it's own special abilities, relating to their element, and this relationship between man and nature is a common motif that permeates through many anime movies and shows (Hayao Miyazaki's ""Princess Mononoke"" and ""Nausicaa"" are excellent examples of this). Various symbols of Chinese mythology also show up in the series (i.e: panda bear's, dragons, etc.) giving the show another level of depth. Avatar is, at its core, a story of growing up and facing fate, no matter how hard it is. I am so glad I was introduced to Avatar, and I am pleasantly surprised by its depth and wit. The voice acting fits the character's perfectly, and even the music is a joy to listen to. I would gladly recommend Avatar: The Last Airbender to practically anyone.",/review/rw1933458/?ref_=tt_urv
