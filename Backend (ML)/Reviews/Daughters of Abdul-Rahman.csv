5 December 2022,mgitts1977,5," Get new hosts & judges
","This is such a good show, but it is made worse by the hosts and the judges. Completely cringy at times, and totally uncomfortable moments in the exchanges between the hosts and contestants. The jokes fall flat, the little quips are so awkward, they should be left out. The contestants were so amazing, but there were moments where they seemed over the judges. This is one show that I would love to see the judges walk that walk because they come across overly critical and extremely condescending, it was hard to listen to their critique at times. If Netflix decides to bring this show back... Please, please for the love of God replace the judges and hosts with people with personalities, humor, and grace.",/review/rw8716786/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2022,ceonimdb,5," Snack recreation is fun, the hosts make it bordeline unwwatchable
","The food geek in my likes watching the contestants try to recreate some fun snacks and then come up with their own imaginative version. I appreciate that they have a mix of chefs and food scientists in the mix, that makes it a bit different from most cooking competition shows. However, the hosts are simply awful. And let's be honest, they usually detract, not add, to shows like this. In this case, they may keep me from getting through an otherwise interesting series. The forced laughter throughout from everyone is also pretty painful. The contestants themselves are a mixed bag... easy to pick out the ones that are full of it. We'll see how many episodes I'll be able to watch.",/review/rw8716786/?ref_=tt_urv

",The show has an interesting premise. The challenges are kinda fun to watch and some of the contestants are enjoyable. The two judges are pretty good too.,/review/rw8716786/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2022,waitresstyles,3," Good show, worse than terrible hosts.
","The show has potential and the competitors are actually very funny and sweet! But oh. My . God. The judges drive me INSAINE. They are so unlikeable and their behaviour drives me absolutely insaine. They have a severe lack of humour and any humour they have is cringe worthy, the poor competitors are so clearly fake laughing at each hosts ""jokes"". Sure they have their scripts , they just make the whole audience cringe intensely. They don't have the right energy or behaviour for public speaking, public entertaining or anything to do with hosting. As you can tell these hosts were a bad choice. I found myself skipping over each hosts talking often being annoyed by the nasally screaming at the screen. Even the way they are randomly fidgeting during their few standing scenes is so awkward it makes this hard to watch. Almost looks like they chose random people for the roles and went with it. Could go on and on but they are just trying to do their jobs, they were just the wrong choice for this particular job.",/review/rw8716786/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2022,loganps,6," Good Show, One Big Problem
",It is a fun idea and pretty good show. The contestants are likable and seem equally matched. The show is pretty much what you think it's going to be and an easy watch.,/review/rw8716786/?ref_=tt_urv

4 December 2022,kentareikoku,5," What are these hosts?
","The concept of the show is great. Contestants can be likeable and the judges are knowledgeable. However, these 2 hosts are the most random pair of people ever put together and have no personality at all. This Hari guy looks like he's being held at gunpoint to do this show and looks confused and lost in every shot. He almost never speaks and looks extremely uncomfortable even if all he has to do is taste food. The female host has the most forced positivity ever but at least she can fake a smile while Hari almost never smiles. The judges do a better job hosting than these ""hosts"" who apparently are comedians when they haven't done anything entertaining on this show. The hosts are supposed to be the stars of the show, but these two are just background characters who doesn't add any entertainment value. It should've just been the judges hosting the show just like Masterchef. Netflix should stop hiring random people with no hosting experience to host cooking shows.",/review/rw8716786/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2022,mail-67039-55988,6," Has great potential!
","This show is awesome, but the chefs need more time to create their sncaks. One or two hours is not enough. The show lacks beautiful snacks. Most of the ones presented to the judges looks either halfbaked or plain sad. As a viewer I would like to see more finished presentations presented. I would also like a setup more similar to masterchef. Not just three chefs per episode, but all of them at the same time making snacks. Other than that I really like the show. Its just sad to see great potential go to waste. Hopefully a season two could change up the game. At the very least give the chefs more time in the kitchen. Pringles and similar snacks were not invented in a day, so how on earth could a single chef make one in two hours? Thats not even enough time to think about a proper strategy and execute it properly. Just look at the youtube series ""Gourmet makes"". There needs to be room for trial and error when attempting to recreate something so very complicated. To end on a positive note I'll say that I really like the judges. Very likeable all of them.",/review/rw8716786/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2022,krisztianv,2," What is this supposed to be? Boring show with sleepwalking hosts
","I have no idea what the role of the hosts was, and why were there two of them. Two of them doing basically nothing. The whole show seems very low budget when it comes to the studio setting. The hosts were dressed terribly. The whole show made me feel like I was watching a low budget last minute high school garage recital... You don't even have the sense that something was even happening, just showing bits and pieces of what they contestant chefs (who seem WAY AMATEURS) were doing then a quick tasting and that was it. BOOOORING.",/review/rw8716786/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2022,elizabethhalbig,1," The hosts are the problem.
","Great idea for a show but why are the two unfunny ""comedians"" there? Neither has any energy or spark and they ruin the show. Two people paid to stand there and stare blankly at the camera. The woman in particular might be the most useless addition to a show I've ever seen. I did enjoy the concept of recreating some of these snacks, even if many of them looked really terrible. I think by Netflix trying to have a representation of every single shape, size, gender and race of human they forgot to make sure their hosts are funny and capable of delivering material that would be pertinent to a cooking competition.",/review/rw8716786/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2022,aliehyeg,4," The hosts are so so bad
","The show is somewhat watchable. Interesting concept and filmed really nicely. The colours are pleasing and the contestants are pretty good! However- the ""hosts"" are god awful. They aren't funny, they look like they're just nodding and not even listening to anyone. It's awkward and weird. The two judges are great and should have just kept it at two. Megan's faces and weird mannerisms make me wonder who edited this and thought- yeah this is the best take. I wish I had better things to say but all in all it's a run of the mill cooking show. They're all blending into one. I can't wait for the show where they're making snack food into hyper realistic cakes made by amateurs.",/review/rw8716786/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2022,brockus-71948,5," Hosts and Judges ruined it
","So I enjoyed the concept of having the chefs make popular snacks, that was a very cool idea! The hosting and judging of the contestants was very cringey!! I think if they just eliminated the weird hosts and unimportant comments from the four people on the panel, it would be a great show. Maybe they will bring this back as a better show, one host two judges that have a better personality and not so ""Judgey"" attitude! I usually love to watch these chefs try to re-create a popular snack, so just adding words so that my review will be posted, do not be discouraged from watching just fast forward through a lot of the hosting and judging talking .",/review/rw8716786/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2022,htfkyjrcxb,2," The hosts ruin it
","The judges seem to be carrying the show - while the ""hosts"" add absolutely nothing of value. The premise of the show is great, I love that they have contestants try to recreate a well known snack and then have them do their own thing. The mix of self taught and food science keeps it interesting, I like the two judges and how they explain the science behind the foods, and in fact they seem to do the actual job of the hosts. However the actual ""hosts"" have got to go - how can two ""comedians"" be so boring? Neither have good screen presence or personality, the woman says barely anything and is very awkward. Maybe they should have a host with actual personality? And why does there need to be two of them? I hope to see more of these shows, munis the crummy hosts.",/review/rw8716786/?ref_=tt_urv

9 December 2022,jrd1093,1," Just awful
","Most Netflix shows feel like they were made by and for robots, and this one is no exception. What really makes it awful, though, are the hosts and the female judge. The hosts (both ostensibly ""comedians"") act like awkward high school losers at the party they shouldn't have been invited to - they're not in the least bit funny or charming, and the female host literally sparked a discussion between my family about why and how she even got this job. The female judge is the worst part of the show, though. She's downright rude and everything that comes out of her mouth is snide or backhanded. We almost reached a point where stopped watching the show because we got so sick of hearing her talk in her stuck-up, overly serious attitude. Like the female host, I have no idea how she even got this job. On the other hand, the male judge actually does a decent job, and I feel sorry that he's stuck working with these other people.",/review/rw8716786/?ref_=tt_urv

5 December 2022,harisrinivasan-94697,8," Sorry Hari, your co-host really sucks and makes you look bad
","The show concept is interesting. The judges are ok, nothing special. But can't help feel sorry for Hari Kondabolu (uncomfortable and out of place), with an awkward co-host. As a result any witty comment, despite being subdued doesn't land and the show has this strained dynamic. I was surprised to know that Megan Stalter is supposed to be a comedian too! Strange that nobody finds her funny though...with the forced enthusiasm and witless jokes. And what happened to Hari, whose wit and jokes were top of the line.",/review/rw8716786/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2022,skowbree,3," The hosts and judges were terrible!
","This is my first IMDb review. I finally made an account after 10 years to leave a review for this show. I love watching cooking shows and really like the concept of this show and the chefs seemed great. The hosts, particularly Megan, were awful. Megan's weird faces weren't cute and half the time she just stood there. Hari also kind of stood there but tried a bit harder I feel. The judges were even worse. It almost felt like they were trying too hard to be critical. The only time I laughed is when the hosts made fun of the judges. If there's another season of this show, they need better hosts and judges.",/review/rw8716786/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2022,meganquinn-19842,4," Great idea.. horrible execution
","So, I love the idea of this show... I think this could be great and very popular. The only thing that is constantly throwing me off while watching this is the judges mainly Megan. Ironic because my name is Megan also! But she just seems as though she is trying hard to pull off a host's attitude but doesn't particularly have it. When the editing goes back to show her facial expressions she is mostly making judgemental/disgusted faces which also doesn't look good for the personality and random scripted sounding humor she tries to pull off throughout the episodes. I love the chefs they chose though! Maybe if they switched up hosts the show wouldn't seem so uninteresting and make me want to shut it off.",/review/rw8716786/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2022,jennieambrose,1," Host is Unbearable
","The idea of the show excited me because it sounded like Gourmet Makes. It's not, it wants to be, but it's so bad. It's awkward, no flow, no rhythm, no synergy. The judges are dry and the hosts are terrible. There are frequently ""jokes"" made with sympathy laughs that are just so bad.",/review/rw8716786/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2022,beverleyhunniford,3," It was ok, but formulaic
","I watched this hoping it was going to be a US version of the UK's Snack Master. There are now so many of these skill based knock out competitions. It's a format I enjoy, but this is not the best. What I had hoped for was chefs trying to replicate a well known snack, meanwhile they take you to the factory and you get to see how it's really done. Missed the mark on this one. They only pick out 3 chef to compete in each episode and 1 would go through to a later round. You don't buy into the competitors on this one, which is the whole trick with this genre. The usual format is they scatter interviews the contestants for their reflections throughout the episode, but this was missing.",/review/rw8716786/?ref_=tt_urv

2 December 2022,illisia42,7," 'Gourmet Makes', but a studio gameshow
","First of all, this concept has basically already been done on YouTube, by the channel 'Bon Appetite' with their series 'Gourmet Makes'. That said, this is a competitive gameshow with a variety of different chefs and multiple ""rounds"", not just the recreation of the snacks, so it's different enough in my opinion to not be a rip-off.",/review/rw8716786/?ref_=tt_urv

5 December 2022,pfasolo-60918,3," Could have been good, but...
","Cute concept and it should be fun to watch but the results of the cooking are too low quality to really be entertaining. The contestants claim to be experienced food scientists working development with big brands but they don't know basic tactics. They have a lot of lab equipment props that they show in the background, but all they use are molds, fryers, syringes, and basic ingredients. It would be more fun IMO if they got somewhat close to what they're imitating but the end results look more like what you see on Nailed It. And the creation challenge ideas are just dumb. Where is the science and chemistry of them trying to get the flavors and textures?",/review/rw8716786/?ref_=tt_urv
