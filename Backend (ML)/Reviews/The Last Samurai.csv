22 November 2008,ccthemovieman-1,9," Best Of The 'Pirates' Trilogy, And Demo-Quality For Blu-Ray
","After seeing all three of the ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" films, I still think this second one was easily the best of the three. Most friends disagree with me on this, but.....hey, we all look at films differently.",/review/rw1449248/?ref_=tt_urv

10 July 2006,skyblueangel-1,8," Viva Pirates!
","Well, first of all, when I read the review for the movie in my hometown paper, I was a little scared that Pirates might be a let down. The trailer and the movie clips, it seemed, didn't really let on that there was much of a story line -- that it just kind of goes on and on and on, like the Matrix 2, with no storyline -- just fighting. Plus, most people do agree: sequels are hardly ever as good as the originals. And in this case, it's true... Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest isn't the original. But, its an awesome movie in its own right! There are a few surprises in this movie. A few characters come back from the first that you wouldn't expect to see in the second. but... um! that's all I'm saying. This movie is definitely a lot more violent and gory than the first one. Don't bring the little kids to it. But, trust me -- this is not a Matrix-type movie... There is an actual storyline. And a good one at that. Capt. Jack Sparrow is back as well as Elizabeth and Will, who are forced to find him and obtain his compass, or else they will face the gallows. Well, actually, Will has to find him. Elizabeth escapes, and yes... as you've seen in the trailers, she does dress up like a man for this movie. Making it all the more comical. (you'll see what I mean).",/review/rw1449248/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2009,TheLittleSongbird,8," Overlong, but this is a lively and hugely enjoyable sequel!
","This film is a little too long, and doesn't quite have the charm of the predecessor. But it is solid entertainment, with a good plot, and consistently good acting, as well as the whole production looking stunning. Johnny Depp is as lovable as always as Jack, and Kiera Knightly is as lovely as ever. Orlando Bloom, while less charismatic than he was in the first movie, is still charming. Jonathan Pryce and Jack Davenport also delight, as does Stellan Skargaard as Bootstrap Bill. But an unrecognisable Bill Nighy almost steals the show as the rather creepy Davy Jones. The special effects and the stunts were very impressive especially with the very scary krakon, so was the outstanding music score and although the script lacks the sparkle of the predecessor, this is a resoundingly entertaining film nonetheless. Oh, and be prepared for a surprise at the end. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",/review/rw1449248/?ref_=tt_urv

1 August 2006,wliia,10," The Best Movie of the Summer (even though it was winter in Australia)
","I only have one thing to say about this film... BRILLIANT (with a capital B)! Although there were some brilliant moments in the film, it was Johnny Depp who was a standout for me. His witty moments (especially when he says 'Oh, bugger' when confronted by the tribe) were wonderful. There are some moments here that were nasty (not gross/gory nasty), so the little kiddies may want to avoid this one. (It is rated M in Australia, PG-13 for America) But, it was a brilliant film. If you don't get to see it on the big screen, get the DVD when it comes out. You will not be disappointed! P.S. Did anyone love the new Walt Disney Pictures logo at the beginning? I did. I can't wait to see it again on DVD!",/review/rw1449248/?ref_=tt_urv

6 July 2006,Jozxyqk,9," Better than the first, and that's saying something
","I will firstly say that after seeing the trailer and previews for this film I had serious doubts. I was afraid that the producers would just try to cash in on the original's success, and forget about any content.",/review/rw1449248/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2006,connmoore,5," NOT even close to a complete movie
","It is usually a bad sign if a popcorn movie like this clocks in at well over two hours. the amazing thing about that running time is, that not a single plot point is resolved in this film. Everything that is brought into the movie as being there for our hero's to overcome, is still there when the credits roll those ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MINUTES finally end. Two and a half hours, just to set up a third movie? I'm sorry, but that has to be the biggest rip off since Manhatten and those beads and trinkets used to buy it.",/review/rw1449248/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2006,I_Like_Turtle_s,9," More than equals its predecessor.
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest does the right thing as a sequel: It maintains the same carefree spirit of the original and creates an even more fitting story to the whole Pirates lore. After narrowly escaping the gallows--with the help of his friends Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley)--and reclaiming his cursed Black Pearl, it still seems Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) has a few more fish to fry. More specifically the barnacle-encrusted undead on board the ghostly Flying Dutchman, lead by Mr. Octopus Face himself, Davy Jones (Bill Nighy). Jack apparently owes a blood debt to the inky captain and if he can't find a way out of it--namely locating the secret contents of Jones' famed locker--Sparrow will be doomed to eternal damnation and servitude in the afterlife (insert Jack Sparrow's face of disgust here). Making matters worse, Sparrow's problems manage to interfere with the wedding plans of Will and Elizabeth, who are forced to join Jack on yet another one of his misadventures.",/review/rw1449248/?ref_=tt_urv
29 June 2006,editor-299,6," 'Pirates' is visually stunning, but drifts due to convoluted plot
","Based on the massive popularity of the first installment, ""Piates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl,"" in 2003, it was only natural for a sequel to this Disney swashbuckler to make its way to theatres.",/review/rw1449248/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2006,WithoutWings,10," Captivating
","As a sequel, it had much to live up to the glory of the first film, and personally, I thought it had done rather well. The special effects on Bill Nighy (Davey Jones) and his pirate crew was perhaps the best; it was very realistic. The movie had a bit of a slow start, but overall was a wonderful film. Johnny Depp did well in his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow, as previously in the first film. Keira Knightley and Bill Nighy were also of mentionable performances. I thought Orlando Bloom was a little wooden, as I thought of his performance in the first film, but still believable and he managed to pull it off. The ending which was rather interesting, served its purpose in suspense. It left the audience hanging, and it also left me hanging in a buzz of questions. I'm extremely eager to see the next Pirates of Caribbean film. However, the film did contain quite a number of references to the first film, The Curse of the Black Pearl, and I advise you to recap your knowledge of the first film and re-watch it to get the gist.

14 December 2019,sauravjoshi85,8," Entertaining movie backed by strong acting
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is the second movie of the franchise starring Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightely, Stellan Skarsg√•rd, Bill Nighy and Jack Davenport. The movie is directed by Gore Verbinski backed by powerful music of Hans Zimmer.",/review/rw1449248/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2006,baelara,8," Great fun, perfect visuals
","This movie has everything a good blockbuster should have: star cast, special effects, a healthy dose of drama, romance, a villain (so to say), sadly also a rather weak story, with an ending just calling for ""part three"" (just like the last second in the Matrix trilogy) I didn't get that feeling, that the adventure is finished somehow, more like a soap opera ending. On the other hand some dialogs are really funny, and the whole movie is more like a parody on pirates. ",/review/rw1449248/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2006,ExplorerDS6789,9," Arrgh! We Be Back for More!
","Today was to be the wedding day of Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner. But before the ceremony, the bride and groom are both arrested, by order of Lord Cutler Beckett. Elizabeth was clapped into jail, while Will was brought before Beckett. It seems they were incarcerated for aiding and abetting known pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow. And since Will and Jack were so close, Beckett decided to strike a deal. He tells Will to seek out Jack Sparrow and acquire his compass, in exchange for freedom. Meanwhile, Captain Sparrow is reunited with Joshamee Gibbs and the rest of his crew aboard the Black Pearl. They were now in search of the greatest treasure in the history of the sea: a chest belonging to Davy Jones himself. But first, they must find one very crucial instrument to aide them in their quest: the key to unlock the chest. Later that night, Jack meets a suspicious stowaway. It was none other than the mutated form of ""Bootstrap"" Bill Turner, Will's lost father. Bill warns Jack of Davy Jones, as well as something far more deadly and dangerous...the biggest, nastiest, monster in the ocean: the Cracken.",/review/rw1449248/?ref_=tt_urv

22 January 2019,tabuno,5," Major Disappointment
","9 July 2006. Long, boring, and uninteresting. This sequel tried mightedly using all the past comedic, action techniques of past movies. There was the cannibal scene from King Kong (2005), there was Romancing The Stone (1984) action-comedy, there was even the now tiring and worn out Johnny Depp replaying his comic one-liners using a weak script. There was only warmed over character development, a scattered smattering of connections. The movie by attempting to be everything ended up being too thin on most everything. The violence level was raised far beyond a family movie. The comedy was forced and lame. The only new movement was the rather new action scenes for action scene sake without really contributing to the plot. Most of this movie has been seen before in one form or another. And like Star Wars trilogy there is the romantic triangle at play here leaving for the third installment a much darker psychological conflict. Missing from this movie was the light hearted fun (that was seriously attempted) that didn't seem to balance the more darker, sinister forces at work here. Five out of Ten Stars.",/review/rw1449248/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2006,bmelanie,8," Shamelessly entertaining
","Some blockbuster movies pretend to be more than they actually are. They sometimes even try to be philosophical. 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest', thank goodness, does no such thing. From start to finish, it practically flaunts the fact that it is pure and utter entertainment, comic yet breathtaking. The slapstick comedy involving the various sequences on the cannibal island and the water mill are amusing, the scenes at sea with the Flying Dutchman and the Kraken draw gasps, and, as ever, the antics of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow brings endless pleasure. Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann does her share too, but Orlando Bloom as William Turner is still somewhat...wooden, perhaps because of the insipid character that he plays. His (almost idiotic) chivalry and goodness simply does not click with the mischievous magnetism that Jack Sparrow and Elizabeth Swann delivers. He still does amuse from time to time, however. The supporting cast is truly stellar; Bill Nighy as Captain Davy Jones, Stellan Skarsgard as Bill 'Boostrap' Turner and Naomie Harris as Tia Dalma are simply brilliant. Bill Nighy delivers his lines with aplomb, smacking his lips as if he relishes each syllable. Stellan Skarsgard is completely believable as the wretched Bootstrap Bill, a man who has fallen to the depths as far as he can go, and yet can still find the strength to endure it all in the love he has for his son, William. Naomie Harris is just as charismatic as the former two, but her charisma is not menacing or stoic but mysterious and even alluring. When she grins her black-toothed grin, one cannot help but grin along with her. In the end, 'Dead Man's Chest' is a roller-coaster-ride of a movie that thoroughly exploits every minute of its two-and-a-half-hour running time, ending with a final cliffhanger that leaves people feeling excited yet frustrated. (Remember when you watched 'Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' and realized that you would have to wait another year for 'The Two Towers'? Like that.) NB. If you have the patience, stay till the end of credits. It's mildly amusing.",/review/rw1449248/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2006,Gubby-Allen,1," As bad as the first film was good.
","Sums it up really. The first film was completely original & a refreshing change and while the sequel - indeed any sequel - by definition can never have that trait, they can at least retain some of the values of the first film.",/review/rw1449248/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2006,billiejoefreak,10," Does not ruin the first one!
","This had to be absolutely wonderful. Usually a lot of movies that have a second or a third tend to ruin the first one, and this one certainly does not. It was one hundred percent better than the first one, actually. It was still action packed, funny, and it features people you would not expect, I was even dropping my jaw the whole time! If you liked Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl, you're going to have to love this one too. Of course, Johnny Depp's acting is still wonderful as the last one, as well as Orlando Bloom's and Keira Knightley's. The effects are absolutely stunning and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I do suggest though, if you have not seen the first one, you need to see that before going to see this one..otherwise, you're going to be a ""tad"" clueless on some parts. The movie does total justice and I would see it again and again!",/review/rw1449248/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2006,charliecheswick,1," corporate scam + enormous commercial for 3rd movie
","This movie blowed goats.I felt violated after going to see this, I was sucked in big time by all the hype and my liking for the first movie. This film however , is just a cash in on the interest generated from its predecessor and didn't need to be made.NOTHING happens in it.Well apart from the last 45 minutes , which is a huge advert for the third film. Plus , Knightely - did she actually have any lines in that film? Brief plot synopsis- Jack Sparrow and his mate Bloom have a sword fight on a big wheel while Knightely pouts.I will definitely not go to see the third one. Id rather pour acid down my pants.Avoid this movie unless you are completely brain dead or want to feel like you have had your wallet stolen.",/review/rw1449248/?ref_=tt_urv

12 August 2006,bob-1135,4," A big disappointment
","I am beginning to believe that I am the only person who was disappointed by this sequel. The film distinctly lacks pace and often grinds to a dead stop. Scenes which should be rolling along with the velocity of a runaway train, stagger and falter like a drunk. For example the overlong scene between Jack Sparrow and the cannibals.
