21 January 2019,henryshear,8," A Show That Is Very Educational!
","Well, to be honest, I never thought I would be writing a review on Sex and the City as a teenage guy. I do not see myself as someone who is into the New York scene of style, glamour, or fashion but the show helps me understand where men and women go wrong in relationships.",/review/rw8059923/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2020,Calicodreamin,8," One of a kind
","Endlessly rewatchable, sex and the city is a one of a kind tv show epitomizing the early 2000s. With a long running tv show it's inevitable to have some good and not so good storylines. But for the most part, SATC got it right, showcasing four single girls navigating love and life in New York City. One of my all time favs.",/review/rw8059923/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2005,didi-5,," The fifth woman is Manhattan
","In its 6 year, 94 episode run, we've seen the four girls grow and develop through their relationship, neuroses, and daily life in New York. The main narrator and the girl who 'knows it all' is Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) who writes a sex column for the newspaper and has a bizarre taste in fashion. Her on-off boyfriend is the mysterious Mr Big (Chris Noth), who has dreadful chat-up lines and a big ego, but there have been others - notably the sweet Aidan (John Corbett, fresh from 'Northern Exposure') and the mysterious Russian artist in the final series (played by Mikhail Baryshnikov).",/review/rw8059923/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2008,sts-26,6," Sex and the City Deviated Way too Much for My Liking
","I first caught SATC in the late nineties, and thought it was great. At the time the show really captured a certain nineties sensibility - it was cynical, tongue-in-cheek, adult. Though not your average SATC fan - heterosexual, thirty-something male working in IT - I became obsessed, and was sure to see each new episode the first time it aired. However, over time I became disillusioned with the series.",/review/rw8059923/?ref_=tt_urv

10 October 2004,rmphw9,," About Sex and the City
","This is decidedly one of the best written and acted comedies I've seen in a very long time. The trials and tribulations of Carrie Bradshaw and her three friends is as riveting as it is true. As a straight male viewer of this show, I think that it gave me a lot of insight into the female aspect of a relationship and the world as a whole. This show also changed the way the public views women. Carrie and company are strong, self-sufficient women who even dislike serious relationships and the prospect of marriage. This is far from the housewife days of ""Leave it to Beaver"" and ""Father Knows Best"". ",/review/rw8059923/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2006,JuveeJun,10," My all time favorite TV series!
","Now, admittedly, this show may appeal to a slightly more female audience, but I think men may appreciate ..well, the sex...(uncensored versions can be a bit graphic with nudity) and the comedic aspect of the show. The writing is truly phenomenal, with some of the funniest lines I've ever heard.",/review/rw8059923/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2005,Lady_Targaryen,8," My favorite TV Series!
","I always imagined that it would never appear a better TV series than Friends;thanks God, I was wrong! I continue liking Friends very much, but Sex and the city has a bigger place in my heart. Since I live in Brazil, the episodes take a longer time to come here; that's why I always stayed anxious for my father to buy the new Dvds released.:) The story of Carrie,Samantha,Mirand and Charlotte is captivating,funny and very interesting,since is about men and women nowadays,and their relationship's problems and inner questions. I recommend to everybody who wants to have a good time,specially women, who are going to laugh a lot, and see many of the situations in common with our real lives.:)",/review/rw8059923/?ref_=tt_urv

","I am a 23 year old single woman living in Manhattan and I love and relate to this show.  All though I am younger and poorer than these women, and I don't get nearly as many men as they do (not to mention the fact that I'm Black!), I think this show has alot of insightful and funny things to say about being a woman in New York.",/review/rw8059923/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2000,jimmyplm,," Great, honest, and funny show
","I absolutely love this show.  Every episode is fascinating and thought-provoking.  Carrie, Miranda, Sam, and Charlotte are all wonderful to watch.  I learn so much about myself and humans in general by watching this show.  Anyone who has not experienced ""Sex and the City"" MUST do so as soon as possible.  This is the best show to come to television in a long time.",/review/rw8059923/?ref_=tt_urv

","the truth. about sex relations, friendship, women and men, business, gossips, feelings, fears, pain and hope, children, strangers, first meet, age and sickness. and, about honesty. and this mix does the success of a series who has the science to give the right speech about facts and details who are ignored by film industry in the direct manner. result - memorable characters, charming manner to present everyday facts. and the flavor of a city, the spice of Brasil, the links who define friendship. this is the series who could be the best choice for fans of chick-lit and magazines. but, after the first superficial verdicts , it is not complicated to define Sex and the City as a wise exercise , almost admirable, exercise of honesty.",/review/rw8059923/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2009,lee_eisenberg,7," quite good
","I wouldn't call myself a particularly big ""Sex and the City"" fan. But what's really good about the program is that it doesn't simply adore its protagonists: it shows how the main characters are mildly screwed up and often do self-destructive things as part of their lifestyle (although they are well-meaning individuals at heart). The adventures of Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), Samantha (Kim Cattrall), Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) reflect the true-to-life issues that people face every day.",/review/rw8059923/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2002,VivienLeighsnumber1fan,," Splendid!!
","..""Sex And The City"" is so unique, so original, so fresh, I totally understand why it appeals to men, women.... These stories are delivered with such honesty, and rawness that you can't help but say to yourself: ""oh my God, I feel like that too!"" or ""that happens to me!"" We all know of someone, who has experienced 'something' similar to the story lines. That's the beauty of ""Sex And The City"". It tells it like it is. And Something has to be said for the BRILLIANT performances each and every one of these women (and men) gives. Sarah Jessica Parker is amazing. She radiates every emotion to perfection. Kim Cattrall is my favorite. She's a blonde bombshell who does not beat around the bush. Her character is so openly honest with 'everything', you can't help but love her character ""Samantha"" and either cheer or crack up at her episodes. Cynthia Nixon's character is awesome. I think we all have a little bit of ""Miranda"" in all of us. And Kristin Davis as the annoying, ""Charlotte"", gives the story lines that feeling of ""hope"" and ""innocence"". This show truly deserves all the praise and awards it's currently getting. Do yourself a favor, buy and see ""Sex And The City"" and see for yourself. You'll be hooked, and you'll discover a world that many try to ""avoid"". We're only human! We deserve a little ""Sex and the City"".",/review/rw8059923/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2004,Facehugger2K8,10," Fabulous!!!
","From Carrie's first date with Big, to Miranda's unexpected pregnancy, to Charlotte's divorce, to Samantha's outrageous statements, Sex and the City has touched all of us in one way or another, whether you're a woman or a man, I am brave enough to admit. The common misconception surrounding this show is that it is pornography, that these women are sluts, that they are ""male-bashing, unmoral, unfocused, drunken losers"" to quote a certain user. At the beginning, we were introduced with the theme of Sex and the City: If men can go around having sex with as many women as they want, why can't women benefit from the same right. Thus began an era of cosmopolitans, manolos, men, breakups, makeups,shakeups, tears, and many surprises. The show expressed a series of views, social standards and taboo statements opinionated by the women, which before were considered to be unlady-like, associated with men's sleazy mind.",/review/rw8059923/?ref_=tt_urv

28 July 2021,m-47826,8," Deserved a nine, but season 5 is an utter disappointment.
","People love trash « war against each other » shows, these days. So one that is trying to mend fences, is automatically outdated, cheesy and unrealistic. Their world, not everyone else's. Under it lightweight and shallow exterior, Sex and The City gave accurate portrayals of single life in big cities. In a mostly unflattering light. Nobody was spared by criticism, even the heroines. And that's what I love the most about this show. It takes no prisoners and is straight to the point. Feminism wasn't a weapon or something toxic like it is today. It was simply women living their lives for themselves. And making choices based solely on their own feelings. A little selfish maybe? Not exactly, as it was never out of disdain or hate towards others. And men in general. Early seasons format were the best I thought. It spared us some unnecessary dramas, even though season 3 is best known for it. Seasons 1 and 2 are those I watch the most. The first one being the best, with qualities that were never matched since. It is something you don't see very often in « old » series, that usually thrive around its third or so year. I guess seasons 4 and 5 especially, were the show struggling to give exciting storylines and stand alone episodes that stick. I have nothing against season 6, but it was definitely time to move on. And recharge. The hate some actresses get lately, is outstanding. It really makes you question your tastes... Not really. I can overlook SJP's « weak acting », for bringing to life such an iconic character like Carrie Bradshaw. And can't see it being played by any other actresses. Same thing implies to her former co-stars. They were perfect throughout. And the show itself, deserves the best, even to this day. It's a shame producers want to milk the concept dry. This version, is strong enough to stand on its own for many years to come.",/review/rw8059923/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2018,davispittman,10," Classic show full of steamy love and laughter
","Sex and the City (1998-2004) is one of my absolute favorites for many reasons. First off, it sports an incredible cast! Sarah Jessica Parker stars as Carrie Bradshaw, Kim Cattrall plays Samantha Jones, Cynthia Nixon is Miranda Hobbes, and Kristin Davis plays Charlotte York. The casting is spot on, every actress plays their character perfectly. It's true that they're all a joy to watch, Samantha Jones is my personal favorite, she's truly hilarious and just when you think she can't think about anything other than casual sex, she surprises you with her big heart. I love that each character has their own style and they are so different as people, yet they fit together perfectly as a friend group. The writing is just great. It is full of witty, hilarious humor, touching moments between these well developed characters, and it's all pulled together by the great chemistry that hovers over the whole show. Another thing I love is how real the show is, especially about sex. All is revealed. The dialogue is uncensored and that works for the show. Overall, this is a very entertaining, well written show that I definitely suggest! 10/10.",/review/rw8059923/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2008,Chris Knipp,7," Happily ever after, with love and chic clothes
","This film, over-long for non-believers, a mere capsule for avid fans, celebrates the HBO series that went on for years and features the same tight quartet of women whose Jewish princess centerpiece is the inimitable spotlight-grabber and narrator Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker), a chic New York newspaper and magazine writer who's forever trying to secure her relationship with the well-heeled Mr. Big (the suave and appropriately king size Chris Noth).",/review/rw8059923/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2011,TheLittleSongbird,4," Sorry, not a fan
","I like the striking production values, the music which is infectious and somewhat sexy and the acting of Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattral and Chris Noth. Otherwise, I am not a fan of this show. I find the characters shallow especially at the start, the writing clichéd and unfunny with the over-analysis on relationships often making me cringe and the stories predictable and uneven in pace-often on the dull side.",/review/rw8059923/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2000,vox-sane,," Hedonism Run Amok
","One can easily identify with the characters on this show -- if one is young, attractive, and affluent or rising (with money to feed a cutting-edge fashion sense).  One can also identify with the characters if one is supposed to be intelligent and capable yet is really vapid and narrow-minded.  The stars' ages range roughly around my own, late-thirties and mid-forties, but their mentality is barely past puberty.  These are prosperous career women who talk like junior high schoolers.  It's as if they never had a deep thought in their lives.  They seem intelligent enough to grasp Dostoevsky, and it would do them good -- but they'd probably think that meant something sexual since, as the title implies, they think of nothing else.

","If Jane Austen had been alive today this is what she would be writing about: women having relationships, looking for that Special Guy, and tripping quite a bit along the way -- and not because those Manolo Blahniks were so high and unfit to be run on. ""Sex and the City"" is the antithesis of romance while sticking quite close to romance. The four women of the piece -- Carrie, Samantha, Miranda, and Charlotte -- go throughout their existences, meeting men, falling in love, making horrific mistakes, and getting right back on their feet once their grieving period was over. None of them wallow in the throes of self-pity; as a matter of fact, Carrie in one episode answers Charlotte's question of needing to be rescued with the statement that they don't need such a thing. Even when all they can do is talk and talk and talk about the men in their lives, they're all fairly independent and quite able to stand on their own.",/review/rw8059923/?ref_=tt_urv

","Is the most unrealistic bullsh*t series i ever seen before, in this series the world is beautiful,we don't see poor people on the streets (hum, really strange), we don't see afro-Americans and Asians ppl in the streets too (REALLY STRANGE!man,we are talking about New York!),there is no misery, there are plenty of money all the time, parties every day, really expensive clothes,houses, cars...wow,what a world!!(i wish live in the world like that!).

Comedy is one thing, and pseudo-serious-comedy fantasy bullsh*t is other...""Sex and the City"" is an superficial world, so superficial,unrealistic,Utopian and bad done, that make me puke! The series could be Utopian, but ""New York"" have 10 million ppl, and a life like that, hum maybe 200 thousand ppl, not so much...see what I'm talking about?
