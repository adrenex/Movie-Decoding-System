","Greetings again from the darkness. The Brady Bunch, this isn't. It's also not the place to look for helpful parenting tips. In fact, the story revolves around Eva, a woman (Tilda Swinton) who apparently didn't want to have a child ... at least not at this time, and certainly not THIS child. If you have seen The Omen, you probably gave thanks that you didn't have a child like Damien. At least we knew Damien was the spawn of Satan. Eva's son Kevin, is instead a good old fashioned psychopath. One who has an inherent need to cause pain and misery for his mother.",/review/rw2566943/?ref_=tt_urv

30 May 2012,planktonrules,7," I wanted to like this film more than I actually did...but it's still well worth seeing.
","While the idea behind ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" is exceptional, I was put off by the direction of this film. While I know that a non-linear way of film making is popular these days, it's often overused--and here it is not used effectively. Too many times, the film jumps about in time and this took me out of the experience. This makes the film too unnecessarily confusing--so I am glad that I knew the plot so I could understand what was happening. Additionally, the film used a very deliberate artsy style--such as the overuse of the color red (the tomato fight, the stack of tomato soup cans, the paint)--resulting in sledgehammer symbolism. For me, the story was very strong on its own and didn't need all these tricks.",/review/rw2566943/?ref_=tt_urv

","In an interview with Lionel Shriver' about her highly successful 2005 novel she commented on the difficulty of the project: 'It was admittedly draining. And throughout, I was anxious that because I had never had a child myself, I didn't know what I was talking about and readers who were parents would catch me out.' As adapted for the screen by director Lynne Ramsay and Rory Kinnear this story becomes a terrifyingly realistic exploration of the subject of inherent evil and the manner in which we deal with it. The film is particularly timely as we read almost daily of youngsters killing classmates in schools across the country. But first the story:",/review/rw2566943/?ref_=tt_urv

21 October 2019,Horst_In_Translation,8," We need to talk about We Need to Talk About Kevin
","""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" is a British/American co-production from 2011, so this 110-minute movie is getting closer and closer to its 10th anniversary. The writer and director is Scottish (then not yet) BAFTA winner Lynne Ramsay and this movie here is probably still her most known work by far if we look at the number of votes on imdb, but also if we look at awards recognition. Oscar winner Tilda Swinton here got as close as it gets to her second Academy Award nomination, but just like Daniel Brühl and Idris Elba she had to learn the hard way that sometimes GG, BAFTA and SAG award nominations are not enough to also get in at the Oscars, even if it doesn't happen too often. Here pretty much Rooney Mara sneaked in over her. That should be all in terms of awards now. Let's take a look at the film. It is really all about Swinton. Short mentions to supporting players John C. Reilly (as the husband here a bit surprising as I expected a British actor) and Ezra Miller, who was already despite his age a pretty prolific actor at that point. Now it is arguable if he's really supporting as he plays the title character, but so do other actors and honestly, overall this film is nobody's but Swinton's, not only because she is in basically every scene.",/review/rw2566943/?ref_=tt_urv

19 March 2017,Tweekums,9," Brilliant but difficult to watch
","Eva Khatchadourian was once a successful travel writer but now she lives in a tiny house; as she leaves we see the house and her car are daubed with red paint. Her neighbours ignore her and people she meets in the street abuse her both verbally and physically. It soon becomes apparent that her son, Kevin, has done something terrible. Through a series of flashbacks we see that he was always an awkward child but only with her. Eva's husband, who we only see during these flashbacks, thinks Kevin is just 'being a boy'. There are suggestions that something is seriously wrong; the disappearance of a pet and an 'accident' which causes his sister to lose an eye but there is no proof that he was involved. The only time Kevin is seen to be nice to his mother is when he is ill as a child and she reads him the story of 'Robin Hood'; shortly afterwards his father buys him a toy bow and arrow; something that eventually leads to a proficiency in archery. Eventually we learn what Kevin has done and even though there were hints at what happened it is still disturbing.",/review/rw2566943/?ref_=tt_urv

9 December 2011,freemantle_uk,8," Your worst nightmare
","We Need to Talk About Kevin is certainly a movie that will be every  parent and would-be parent's worst nightmare. This movie gained a lot  of praise at the Cannes Film Festival and attempts to explore the  themes of society, parenting and psychology.  Eva Khachaturian (Tilda Swinton) is a middle-aged mother hated by her  community and struggling with the aftermath of a tragedy. Her  sociopathic teenage son, Kevin (Ezra Miller), has committed a school  massacre and she has to deal with the results of the sins of her child  and explore how Kevin turned out this way in a dual narrative.  After being unable to make her version of The Lovely Bones, Lynne  Ramsey turned to adapting this Lionel Shriver novel instead. She  delivers a haunting, slow-moving film that looks at the personal and  social impact of the tragedy through one person's eyes as well looking  at the struggles of raising a troubled child. Ramsey made sure there  was a grim, somber tone and kept a minimalist view of the world, yet  still adds her own visual flair with intense, slow close ups and red  imagery throughout the film to symbolise blood on Eva's hands.  There is a deliberately disjointed narrative throughout the movie,  cutting from the present to the past as we examine Eva's inability to  bond with her son. Ramsey took the bold step to avoid showing any of  the actual massacre and most violence is committed off screen. We do  not need to see it to understand its impact on people. Nor did we see  Kevin's preparations for the massacre: We Need to Talk About Kevin is  Eva's story, not Kevin's.  But there is a major problem with Ramsay's approach to the story: she  seems to ignore the entire concept of nature vs. nurture. Eva being  portrayed as a bad mother is outweighed by the way Kevin is shown as  practically the product of Satan's loins. Throughout the film, Kevin is  always pushing his mother's buttons and made out to be evil from the  day he is born. There is no subtlety in his portrayal, even with basic  things like reaction shots. We Need to Talk About Kevin should have  been more ambiguous, because the whole point of the film is to raise a  debate. The audience is not meant to have a clear answer.  Swinton's performance was highly praised and she is worthy of an Oscar  nomination as her character Eva, who starts off both as a woman at a  real low end and her struggles with a child she does not want. She is a  disaster of a mum to Kevin as a young child, a child who tests her  patience. Swinton was able to bring real depth to her character. When  she does make the effort, the damage is already done. Throughout the  movie, Swinton plays a tragic and lonely figure who is isolated in some  form, a character who is a shell of her former self.  Kevin is strongly played by two actors: Jasper Newell plays Kevin as a  little brat, pushing his mother with his behaviour and playing Eva and  his father (John C. Reilly) against each other. As a teenager, Erza  Miller portrays Kevin with a sociopathic and nihilist outlook. He has a  sharp mind, but enjoys inflicting pain on others, including his little  sister (wonderfully played by the young Ashley Gerasimovich). He is a  character who believes in nothing and takes a destructive path as a  sinister air is always around him.  Reilly plays Franklin as a normal suburban dad, someone who wants to do  the right thing for his children. It was a wonderfully natural  performance of a man who just sees Kevin's behaviour as being typically  boyish. He is very deserving of a Best Supporting Actor nod for such a  believable performance.  There is a permanent, chilling sense throughout the film thanks  Ramsay's low key direction and the power of the performance. This is a  film that should stick in your head, but We Need to Talk About Kevin  should not have been so clear-cut.",/review/rw2566943/?ref_=tt_urv

","I can always appreciate when a movie or TV show gives us an entirely different perspective on a subject than we were accustomed to before. 'We Need to Talk About Kevin' centralizes a story about a mother dealing with the massacre her son has committed at his school. It's not often these tragedies make it to the big screen, but this one separates itself from the pack with a poignant performance from Tilda Swinton, as the mother to Ezra Miller's 'Kevin', a troubled boy who commits an unspeakable act. At the very least, this is a fascinating look into how a mother deals with the horrific things her son does while trying to balance her public presence in a town that despises her and family life, which isn't much better. An unsettled story like this is certainly difficult to direct, which is why Lynne Ramsay deserves a great amount of credit for grappling with the source material in a meaningful yet non-exploitative fashion.",/review/rw2566943/?ref_=tt_urv

19 February 2012,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,4," We Need to Talk About Kevin (2011)
","They certainly did need to talk about Kevin. I'm fine with difficult subject matter and ambiguous storytelling. But this film just seemed lazy in its search for answers. Tilda Swinton plays a mother that is haunted by something in her past. Her son is in jail, the whole town hates her, and her husband is no longer around. No prizes for guessing what is going on here. She tries to live a normal life but the town just wont forget the past. She looks at her past to see how her son turned into such a monster. The film angered me by dong nothing of note. Swinton is a terrible mother, as she never seeks help for her son. I've seen kids misbehave, but this film takes it so far. It comes across as some cheap Hollywood horror film. There is no way a sane woman wouldn't reach out or get out. Even when her daughter's safety is put at risk, she does nothing. Then we have Reilly as the father. He believes nothing his wife says, which makes me question why they are married in the first place. Even when Kevin acts out in front of him he he does nothing. Swinton also lives in the worst town in the world. The people are so horrid, you'd probably want to massacre their offspring yourself. I understand the anger, but this entire town is filled with vicious human beings. I was able to connect with one character in this entire film, the boy in the wheelchair. Other than that, you have a film of unbelievable, stupid, and cruel people. The acting is great, and it's shot beautifully. I've already read up about the book which seems more cohesive, and the narrative obviously works better than it does in this film.",/review/rw2566943/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie ranks a damn fine 8 or 9 for ""realistic portrayal"" because Kevin shows much of what we understand about sociopaths today: a deep-bred lack of empathy, perhaps a little charisma, a lot of manipulation, impenetrable self-involvement, and a calculated disinterest in the well-being of others. Focusing on his face is, as Ramsay points out in the ""To watch me"" monologue, basically the reason why we're here to see this movie.

","I had been looking forward to this movie. Many film critics raved about it, and it stars Tilda Swinton who had some role in getting the movie made. Tilda is a great actress and only appears in outstanding movies, right? The subject sounded fascinating: parents desperately try to compensate for the sociopathic behavior of a child who grows up to do something terrible. It is a great crucible for a story, and gives us a chance to peer into the mind of such a person. It's a story that, properly told, should bring tears to any parent's eye.",/review/rw2566943/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2011,rickcote,9," extraordinary filmmaking, very disturbing
","I saw this film at Telluride by the Sea (Portsmouth, NH) prior to its general release. This is not a film I would choose to see normally, based on its subject matter. However, as a festival-goer, this was what was offered for the late evening screening. This film is visually stunning, and masterfully composed. You know early-on that a Columbine-style ending is inevitable, nonetheless hope that some miracle may yet occur to avert this disaster. Swinton is absolutely magnificent (as always) as the mother desperately trying to cope with raising a psychopathic child, but equally impressive are the performances of the actors who portray the developmental stages of Kevin from early childhood to the brink of adulthood. What elevates this film is the visual and musical narrative that accompanies the initial time-skipping introduction and then the more linear progression of Kevin's growth to its final, terrible conclusion. Interestingly, the emotional crescendo of the film occurs not near the end when Kevin carries out his horrific violence, but rather in the middle of the film at moments when we observe the impossibility of living a ""normal"" family life with a child who is incapable of feeling or expressing the human emotions that bind us together.",/review/rw2566943/?ref_=tt_urv

All this to make place for slow motion shots of several kinds of red substances over an awkward score while she cheaply generates tension by making her characters behave stupid for no obvious reason besides deliberately stressing the viewer (which makes the movie extremely hard to watch), striping this down to some odd melodrama about a woman who had an asshole child.",/review/rw2566943/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2011,zetes,3," Truly bad
","A staggering failure. I don't know what anyone involved in this film was thinking, except for Tilda Swinton, who is the only one who walks away from it clean. Swinton plays a mother whose son has committed an atrocity. She's frequently assaulted. The only people willing to defend her are complete strangers, and even she herself believes she deserves it. The film is told in a mixed-up chronology, and we observe her relationship with her son. Here's the thing, though: Kevin, from the moment of his birth, is a demon child, no less supernatural than Damien of The Omen fame. Ramsay (and presumably the author of the original novel, Lionel Shriver) have no interest whatsoever in what makes a person do something awful. They don't have much interest in how someone deals with the guilt, either. Instead, the characters have no relation to the real world. They're just stick figures. Ramsay's excuse is that she just seems to want to make a visually interesting movie, but really, the subject is too interesting to dismiss as offhandedly as she does. Even the visuals are so stylized the film almost becomes laughable - I was always thinking, ""Oh, where's the red splotch going to be in this scene?"" You see, because red symbolizes blood, which is what Kevin shed. That's about how obvious Ramsay spells everything out. The kids who play Kevin (I think there are three of them, not counting the baby, whom Ramsay couldn't quite make seem demonic when he actually appeared (when he's unseen in the stroller, he's constantly shrieking)) are really awful. John C. Reilly has a completely underwritten roll as the father (you're always wondering just what the Hell this guy is doing that he doesn't see how evil the kid is). A few years back there was a much better evil child film called Joshua that covered a lot of the same beats. It wasn't great, either, but it beats the Hell out of this sophomoric project. Call me when you have something to say, Ms. Ramsay.",/review/rw2566943/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2016,Coventry,8," Actually, I just want to forget about Kevin
","We need to talk about Kevin? Whenever I encounter something or someone as depressing as the titular Kevin of this film, I just want to forget and focus on the more cheerful aspects of life. But the hard truth remains that I can't forget about Kevin, and I sincerely doubt that anyone who watches this film will ever be able to forget about KevinThat's just how disturbingly realistic and petrifying this motion picture by writer/director Lynne Ramsay, in fact, is! I've been a huge fanatic of controversial and shocking cult/horror movies for more than two decades now, and I've seen pretty much every notorious film and/or documentary there is available on mass murderers, serial killers cannibals, torture and bizarre fetishes, but I guarantee that almost nothing equals the nightmarish thoughts and painful aftertaste left behind after watching ""We need to talk about Kevin"" Anyone who reads a newspaper or watches the TV-journal from time to time knows that this film deals with a topic that is sadly very real and relevant, namely the story of an emotionally unstable and introvert teenager who caused a bloodbath at his/her school. Yet, the story – adapted from the novel by Lionel Shriver – doesn't gratuitously depict these gruesome actual events. The whole film is an extremely sober and stylish character study of Kevin's mother Eva Khatchadourian; who's trapped in the worst imaginable type of hell that a parent can encounter: trying to understand why all this happened. The film has a narrative structure that isn't chronological, with long sequences of a practically lifeless Eva facing the hatred of her surrounding after the tragedy (the scenes in the supermarket are so harsh), interfered with flashbacks of typical family situations of Kevin growing up from a difficult baby into a troublesome toddler and nihilistic teenager with archery as his sole passion. The flashbacks naturally hint already that Kevin was a ticking time bomb since birth and that pure evil might have been in his genes, but they simultaneously also draw a not-so-flourishing picture of Eva's mother role. Where all those little moments of infighting at the breakfast table really necessary? Isn't corporal punishment outdated since decades already? All these and more dilemmas are causing Eva to wonder whether she isn't fully responsible for what happened herself Needless to say that a film such as this one almost entirely relies on the acting capacities of the tormented mother character, and Tilda Swinton truly gives away a downright phenomenal performance. Hers is one of the most integer, honest and substantial female roles ever captured on film and she should have won every price there is to win! Does this mean that ""We need to talk about Kevin"" is an impeccable masterpiece from start to finish? Not exactly, since the role of John C. Reilly as the passive and good-hearted father (although flawlessly acted) is far too clichéd. His contradictory ""everything-will-be-alright"" and ""he-is- just-a-kid"" attitude is too obviously penned into the script to make both the characters of Eva and Kevin even colder and harsher, and on top of that, Mr. Reilly is horribly typecast. ""We need to talk about Kevin"" is a film that I will probably never watch again in my life if I have the choice – it's sad enough that we unquestionably will witness several more similar stories in the daily news – but for fans of the more challenging type of cinema, I'd say this is fundamental viewing.",/review/rw2566943/?ref_=tt_urv
