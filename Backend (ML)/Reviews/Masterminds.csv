4 February 2022,andrewchristianjr,9," I AM INDEED IN RUINS.
","Brilliant, heartbreaking viewing experience. Give yourself over to this wonderful story and be ready for a genuine rollercoaster. Graphic intimacy in many movies and tv series often seems gratuitous and difficult to watch. I was immediately and pleasantly surprised, therefore, by this story which explores the sexual awakening and the ultimate love story between two young people. The scenes of their lovemaking are both graphic and beautifully choreographed.",/review/rw5694067/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2022,southdavid,8," Dublin down on this one.
","Another show lifted from the Guardian's Best of 2020 list was ""Normal People"", a show I'd seen hyped quite a lot, but evidently missed when it aired. I'm glad I took a little bit of time to watch the show slowly over the Christmas break, as, despite not being as salacious as I thought it might be, it has some truly wonderful performances.",/review/rw5694067/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2021,Kirpianuscus,," the freshness
","I suppose, the freshness is the main virtue of this series about life. The freshness of story and storytelling and acting. An old fashion film, like one of the most profound useful refuges in the circle of eccentric or political correct projects.",/review/rw5694067/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2021,SnoopyStyle,8," compelling characters and new faces
",Outspoken student Marianne Sheridan (Daisy Edgar-Jones) is an outcast at school. Connell Waldron (Paul Mescal) is the quiet popular jock. His mother works as a cleaning lady in the Sheridan's large family home. The two Irish teens have a secret sexual relationship but he refuses to acknowledge her in public. Their lives and loves would intertwine over the years.,/review/rw5694067/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2021,nancyldraper,9," Tender and moving storytelling
","This was an incredibly moving drama. One of the most tender and sad love stories I've watched (warning: nudity and sexual situations). The two primary characters are so complicated and vulnerable, I couldn't help loving and suffering with them, myself. This is beautifully performed, written and directed. Based on a book, of the same title (which I just downloaded on Audible), nominated for 44 media awards (Emmys, BAFTAs, etc.) and winner of 17. I give this limited series a 9 (superb) out of 10. {Drama, Love Story}",/review/rw5694067/?ref_=tt_urv

26 April 2020,fayandlola,10," Heartache-ingly brilliant!
",Beautifully written characters and amazing acting. I LOVED this! I hadn't read the book this was adapted from but now want to and couldn't imagine anyone else being Marianne & Connell. Daisy Edgar-Jones' beautiful doe eyes and Paul Mescal's soulful gaze. I was mesmerised by the chemistry between these two. Very few love stories make my heart actually ache! I cried my way through 6 hours of this brilliance!,/review/rw5694067/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2020,silvana_popa,9," A Rare Gem
","It felt almost like reading a book where you envision the characters so vividly, you can almost touch them. The chemistry the two leads have, their acting, the cinematography, are all so well blended together, so seamless, it's palpable. A melancholy trip worth taking, if only to remind the ones past teenage years how vulnerable and all-engulfing a young love is.",/review/rw5694067/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2021,daniel3a,9," An Irish masterpiece.
","An intimate, exciting and mature series with a combination of exceptional aesthetics. A series no less good than the book on which it was created.",/review/rw5694067/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2020,jay-95578,9," An authentically emotional triumph
","This absolute stunner of a TV series crept up on me in the way only the best stories do. Initially it seemed like an honest but moderate enough coming of age story, however soon the sweep of time takes us further along in these people's lives. We watch them grow as their world around them evolves. The melancholy atmosphere, yearning soundtrack, Misty Irish setting and expansive time span lends the whole experience an epic quality, like a modern War and Peace. It feels incredibly rich for a series only 6 hours long and at times left me as an emotional jelly. Let it wash over you and enjoy.",/review/rw5694067/?ref_=tt_urv

29 April 2020,fshardlow,10," Powerful
","I watched this series in two days, it completely pulled me in and mesmerised me. I don't know what more a person could want from a love story, it really has everything. It's not an easy-breezy story either, there are parts actually quite difficult to watch and a rawness not many shows/films of a similar nature manage to capture, in my opinion.",/review/rw5694067/?ref_=tt_urv

5 May 2020,crystalcharee,10," Why does this show hurt so much?
","I started watching this show, thinking it'd be another high school drama with pretty twenty-somethings acting out a middle-aged dude's regurgitation of every other high school drama. I figured that if it didn't suck too bad, it'd be good to have on in the background while I did other things. Instead, I found myself just stopping to watch. Everything about the show, the writing, acting, cinematography, design, etc. captures the tiny moments they way they feel instead of what they look like. It's like life. Beautiful, bland, and, oh, so painful.",/review/rw5694067/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2020,skam_platform,," Frustrating.
",This is a show about two children/YA who have a serious adult attraction/bond but are too stupid to ever actually just have a conversation about how they need each other and can offer each other support. They ruin what could have been because they are both too presumptuous/naive to discuss the reality of their situation.,/review/rw5694067/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2020,f-keys,9," Love isn't always straightforward
","It can be hard to capture the words and feeling of a book into a visual and emotional piece of film, and this show does it. Sensual, tender, and intimate, it gently clutches your heart and makes you remember what it means to feel the complexities of love. Quiet, beautiful, and subtle, just a beautiful piece told perfectly by two absolute stars in the making.",/review/rw5694067/?ref_=tt_urv

","I lost so much sleep when I discovered this heart-warming, heart-wrenching, and heart-breaking masterpiece. It's uncanny how I can relate to such genuine and unexplainable attraction and emotion.

28 May 2020,Azanspy,10," 12 episodes of magic.
","Choosing to watch Normal People is one of the best things that have happened in my life. This series is made with love and is pure art. It teaches us many lessons and makes us cry or laugh with happiness. I'm so in love with Daisy Edgar-Jones and Paul Mescal. Kudos to the whole team. Thank you all those who worked behind for bringing this beautiful piece of work to us. For those of who haven't watched, what are you waiting for?",/review/rw5694067/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2021,A-90,6," Beautiful but boring
","I was really invested in the first couple of episodes but it went downhill from there. The lack of communication between the two leads made me want to rip my hair out. I also found it hard to believe they were meant to be so unusually intelligent when they could barely string a sentence together to express themselves. It was, however, well acted and beautifully shot with some poignant reminders about the importance of mental health support. Could have worked better condensed into 5 episodes or so.",/review/rw5694067/?ref_=tt_urv
