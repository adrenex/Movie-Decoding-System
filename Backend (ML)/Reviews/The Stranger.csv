18 January 2023,DiCaprioFan13,9," Had me hooked throughout the series!
","See was a very entertaining sci-if series led by Jason Momoa. I have to admit that when I first read the premise about a world full of blind people at war with one another I didn't think I would like it. Then after seeing the trailers and that Momoa was in it my expectations rose. Well, after finishing the series I can say that those expectations weren't on,y met but were exceeded. I couldn't stop watching this. Sure some if it is unbelievable but it's sci-fi, it's suppose to be. Bautista was also a great addition to the cast in the second season. He was perfect in his role as Momoa's brother. It's too bad that it was only three seasons long but they couldn't really go anywhere else with the story without overstaying its welcome. At least it didn't end on a cliffhanger. Bottom line is I really liked the show overall and recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy, sci-fi or action!",/review/rw8788427/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2022,Supermanfan-13,9," Entertaining but the Queen & kids are annoying AF!
","See is absolutely, without a doubt, a very entertaining series and I can't wait for another season! My only real gripe is that this show has two very annoying characters. The first is by far the worst and that's because of how bad her acting is and that is Sylvia Hoeks as Queen Kane. All she does is scream and it's such an annoying high pitch scream that it becomes intolerable. When she does actually talk it's a weird annoying voice. The second character isn't so much the acting as the character itself and that's the daughter, Haniwa (Nesta Cooper). I was hoping the entire time in Season 1 that she would be killed. The way she dismissed everything her dad said and did and how she always though she was right (even though she never was) was just annoying. Maybe we're not suppose to like her character but it would be better if we liked both kids. I do have to admit that she was better and was a little less annoying in Season 2.",/review/rw8788427/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2023,WeWatchMovies,," Thank goodness for Baba Voss!!
","Other than Jason Momoa and his portrayal of Baba Voss the rest was just on in the background for me. It was too hard getting past the why having matching clothes, hairdos, makeup, other stuff like hand bags that had decor etc if you can't see?? That shouldn't matter, but for some reason it does and to me it ruined the show. There were some great scenes and characters but it just had a hard time getting past that. The best part was the end with Baba in his true warrior, protector person went through the soldiers and saved everyone there , at least for a while, against the bomb. Other characters to hate, queen kane, momoas two kids (well not really his), characters to like, maghra, the colonel (later) and Ranger. Dave Bautista sucked as usual. If I had listen to queen kane and her inane inflections talk any more I'd jump off a cliff. Don't know how to rate it, so I won't, just give my opinion.",/review/rw8788427/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2022,jmjones-34107,10," How could you not?
","Wow! Just wow!! I wish I could just leave it at that but I got a required amount of characters. This show is so good and original I don't think I've seen anything like it. I'm usually a big fan of historical time period shows but one set in the future where everyone lives like it is 2-300 yrs in our past. And everyone is Blind from some kind of accident that wiped most of us out leaving the earth population to about 2mil I think, but there are some so can see and that's where it gets interesting. Amazing cast and no Mamoa doesn't have to carry the whole show but he is one of many amazing characters. Sad there's only 3 seasons I felt that they could keep going for 10 if they wanted. But anyways highly suggest to everyone to See it with your own eyes.",/review/rw8788427/?ref_=tt_urv

3 January 2023,fmdead,9," Abandon logic and just go with it!
","""See"" goes some way to fill the void left by GOT! Sure it has some derivative elements from other post-apocalyptic stories, but its premise is completely fresh and thought-provoking. Of course, it requires suspending a lot of disbelief - for example, that people who are 100% blind can travel long distances across unknown terrain without cracking their noggins into trees or falling off cliffs. Or that in the chaotic scrum of battle, each fighter knows, without sight, whether they are attacking friend or foe. Or even that they can move from room to room with minimal touch to guide their way. No matter. Just go with it. The story is intriguing and each episode is surprising, exciting and leaves you eager to learn what happens next. The fights and battle scenes are beautifully choreographed. Jason Mamoa is a stand-out amongst the characters - a fierce warrior with a past, made of stern ethics and possessing a heart of gold. There are certainly quibbles - completely puzzling decisions made by the characters and plot leaps. The American accents and colloquialisms were jarring to me in this world. However, the three-season story arc was completely satisfying to this viewer. It's a gem I stumbled upon and I'm glad I did.",/review/rw8788427/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2022,AfricanBro,8," Good timing
","If you love dystopian series you'll love this. Concept isn't visionary(feels like a twist on A quiet place to me) but it's not one that's been explored much; premise is on par with any other dystopic, difference being this is backed by a powerhouse in AppleTV giving it a big enough budget to have someone like Jason Mamoa on it. First season was the best one but the next two still hold their ground. It's gory, bloody and it's about survival, politics and family, all paced well to keep your attention throughout.",/review/rw8788427/?ref_=tt_urv

19 October 2022,thajose,8," Great Show
","This is a fantastic show. I've not see a concept like this before, and it was so well executed. Jason Momoa crushes everything he does and his ""Baba Voss"" character might be my favorite that he portrays.",/review/rw8788427/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2021,fibulator777,5," Throw all logic out the window.
","To be enjoyable, you, as the viewer, have to turn a blind eye to barrage of absurdities. Once past that, if you can shut brain off entirely, it's a pretty decent show.",/review/rw8788427/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2022,jakethesnake-42007,5," Season one ok season 2 bad
",Season one was ok it wasn't amazing but it was interesting and it had me hooked. Season 2 was so bad the storyline was so slow and the acting was bad. The Queen has to be the worst acting character of the show. I won't be watching season 3.,/review/rw8788427/?ref_=tt_urv

17 January 2023,luckysevenleather,9," The actors truly lived this!
","I didn't expect that I would enjoy it that much, especially since the first season was a bit slow (but needed to be). What I noticed as I watched episode after episode, was that the actors were more and more into their roles - they became those people! And it was amazing. Queen Kane was probably the most annoying BUT her acting was great (and that was the purpose, wasn't it?)",/review/rw8788427/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2019,twittkamp,4," Well shot, good actors.
","Not bad for a fantasy show. It's just... the world makes no sense. No sense at all. I actually liked the first episode, like the action sequences, the sets, the costumes... it looks really good. And then the show reminds you that they are all blind and have been for generations and you ask yourself, how did they build this, why do they wear clothes just like we do, why does it all look so much like things you know just with a rope for guidance... how do they gather food, hunt, weave clothes... why is there any decorative jewelry... why is sight viewed as dangerous... why why why",/review/rw8788427/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2022,adnan_ovcina,8," 8 Stars for first two seasons

24 September 2022,william-rahul,8," Perfect except moron kids
","This is a brilliant execution of the time it shows. Everyone acted well except so called kids ( Haniwa and Kofun ) Understood they were kids at first but thereafter even after becoming father of One ( Wolffe ) Kofun acts childish and Haniwa is as it is hopeless. Almost all the series and movies I have seen with kids in them just hate em all just because of weird actions. Not their fault though coz the scriptwriter thinks they can do anything once they have kids in the show they can make them do anything stupid. Hence, Brilliant show except for the kids. Furthermore, Jason Momoa is at his best and rest of the casting is superb as well. Going towards end just wanna say one thing to the script writers.. Grow up with the kids!! 💐🙏🏼",/review/rw8788427/?ref_=tt_urv

22 October 2022,Harry_Pamiaqui,9," Like never seen before
","A fantastic trip to a completely different world. It is impossible for a warrior like Baba Voss to have raised a son as useless as Kofun. If we find the Queen to be annoying, insufferable, and disgusting, is because the actress gave life to such an aberration of a character, that was her job, and she did it excellently. Bad idea the end of Baba Voss, awfully bad idea. After suffering each one of his adventures for three seasons, all the struggle and sacrifice like never seen before, we lost him. Knowing what the audience wants does not require guessing, it requires being able to identify with the feelings of others. In what mind fit that the death of Baba Voss served a purpose, it only managed to wither a wonderful adventure. Leaving Maghra a widow was a slap in the face to the audience, which is your price for following faithfully. Please stop killing our heroes, since we have already lost enough in real life let us be happy at least in our dreams.",/review/rw8788427/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2021,mariaadam,5," Sylvia Hoeks, can we re-cast her?
","If you ignore all the plot holes considering a world of blind people... its not a bad series. Mamoa is, as always amazing. But I found the actress Sylvia Hoeks (queen) and her character choices extremely annoying. She looks great with the shaved hair but high voice is just drawing me crazy.",/review/rw8788427/?ref_=tt_urv
