26 March 2021,Sylviastel,10," How is Superstore Not A Super Hit!
","How is Superstore.not a super hit? It's a collaborative effort with s great ensemble. I love watching Dina. Jonah Simms is the character and reluctant employee. He and Amy have instant chemistry. Six seasons and over a 100 episodes, the cast looks like they're having fun and so are we, the audience. I loved Sandra and Glenn. Dina points out that Sandra moved from Hawaii to St. Louis. Glen Is just a lovable manager. I think the series could have gone on further too. It wasn't promoted enough. Once you start laughing, you can't stop at the absurdity. Anyone in retail will tell you the craziness is real.",/review/rw5260150/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2021,livebeyond,10," How is this not more popular?
","I had never even heard of this show until it was suggested for me on Netflix, and I cannot believe how surprising it is that it is not much more popular. This show is such a pick me up. It's wholesome and sweet and romantic. I audibly laugh out loud at least once every episode. The writing is smart and quick. The characters have unbelievable chemistry, though, to be fair, America Ferrera is such an amazing actor, I would find it shocking if she ever didn't have chemistry with anyone.",/review/rw5260150/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Underrated Comedy!
","Superstore is an incredibly underrated comedy that was so much better than I thought it would be, it really is laugh out loud funny. It's about about a bunch of odd employees and their everyday work and private lives at a megastore called Cloud 9. The characters are what drive this show, each one shows what living in today America is. This show has such a diversity in its characters, everything from race, age, sexual preference, body type, etc. It's rare when a show has so many hilarious characters that are all almost equally funny all on one show but Superstore definitely pulls it off. I've heard such great things about this show for a while but put off watching it. I thought I'd finally give it chance and I'm so glad that I did because everything I heard was true...it's one of the funnier shows of the last few years.",/review/rw5260150/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2016,supermaggie,10," Perfect fun with responsibility
","I disagree completely that the plot is underdeveloped, and the characters might be somewhat clichÃ©, but that's the idea. In my opinion this is what every story with a message does. It takes archetypes as representatives of all people in a society and shows their reactions, no one would say that Breakfast Club is clichÃ©d because it plays with the archetypes to convey the message. And Superstore does the same, it shows prejudice, narrow-mindedness (from poor to educated and the other way round, both sides!!)wrongly understood sense of love or duty etc. etc., in short: all the topics that emerge between people at a workplace or in society and it does this very cleverly, very holistically and most of all: with a lot of great and refreshing humor -and without mocking its characters - great fun with sensitivity and a message, perfect entertainment, 10 points!",/review/rw5260150/?ref_=tt_urv

18 March 2021,glitterstarwipeout,10," Loveeeeee the show
","This show is actually funny. Not like one of those shows that get boring or unbearable after the 1st season. Thanks to Netflix, I started watching this show from season one and love the characters so much. Definitely respect employees of each store more after watching this show. Love it! 100% recommend",/review/rw5260150/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2021,leoalexanderscott,10," Hilariously High Cloud Comedy
","I have been in stitches since I discovered this gem. Certainly added to my all time favourite shortlist of comedies. If you never seen this comedy before, start from the pilot, and become a Cloud 9 vip. You will get to know the team members and get some of the inner jokes.",/review/rw5260150/?ref_=tt_urv

18 January 2020,ArcherAdam,6," Well, damn....
","I gave the show a great review in season 1, and it only got stronger through season 4. The jokes were sharp, funny, and witty, and the background gags were even better than the one liners. Dina is one of the best characters on TV (later joined by Marcus), and there have been episodes that have literally been a laugh a minute.",/review/rw5260150/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2015,KyleBel,9," I hope they don't spoil this one (2020 they are on Track to Ruin a Good Show)
","Just when you miss Park and Recreation, and the Office is long over - comes Superstore; another look into an exaggerated part of the American Culture. It's an obvious mock on Walmart / Target style stores (With coloring similar to Walmart), and over the top characters that we may grow to love (If the network doesn't cancel it next week that is). Hopefully this show will pull the much needed ratings to stay alive for a few seasons to gain a following.",/review/rw5260150/?ref_=tt_urv

11 April 2021,Kingslaay,8," Decent and enjoyable
","I will never look at a major supermarket or retail store the same again. Superstore changed this for me by showing us the bland but quirky lives of staff. This was an enjoyable sitcom that seemed to land well most of the time. The humour also is on point and I found myself laughing out aloud quite a few times. I also enjoyed when they jumped to short scenes of customers who seemed just as neurotic as the staff that worked there. For the first time I actually agree with the rating on IMDB as its strong in parts but just below an 8. I'm glad I gave this show a go and found it enjoyable. Superstore was smooth sailing from start to finish, ending on a high note.",/review/rw5260150/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2021,SnoopyStyle,8," fun group
","It's a Cloud 9 store located in St. Louis. Amy Sosa (America Ferrera) is the single mom struggling to work and advance. Jonah Simms (Ben Feldman) is an associate who feels superior to his position. They and the other people who work in the store form bonds, and friendships.",/review/rw5260150/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2021,socrfan-80182,10," As usual
",This is a great comedy without an annoying studio audience or laugh track. As usual they're cancelled it. They get a popular funny comedy and they dump it for something that isn't worth your time. Thanks for nothing NBC.,/review/rw5260150/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2018,almosthalo,10," Love this show!!!
",I decided to give this shot one day while surfing Hulu. OMG I am so glad I did. It is one of my favorite shows. I've seen it so many times that I have it playing in the background while I work. All of the actors are fracking hilarious. Being able to watch a show that lets me escape the realities of life is such an awesome thing. Please give this a shot.,/review/rw5260150/?ref_=tt_urv

5 September 2019,Ivan_Digitalian,6," this vote is for 1 character
","I like this series but i don't like Amy as character. I got nothing against america ferrera as actress. I find that character annoying and exaggerated. My initial vote for first 2 seasons was 8, but when they decided to force things in the most predictable way (i can't write it beacause i hate spoilers, but you really can imagine it...) i found it stupid and now every scene with amy get me nervous.",/review/rw5260150/?ref_=tt_urv

11 January 2021,jenny-jd,10," One of my absolute favorites
",Instantly became one of my very favorite shows soon after starting to watch. At first I thought it was too strange for me but I just had to get into the vibe. It's just so entertaining and easy to get into. The characters that they've created and the way the actors bring them to life is just delightful. I have watched the whole series through multiple times ðŸ˜ƒ,/review/rw5260150/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2017,kaymillar,8," Hidden Gem
","The more I watch it, the more I like it. The characters are all progressively more defined and interesting and they all mesh well together. Anyone who's ever worked in the service industry might feel nostalgic watching it-- crappy corporate jobs bring the little guys together and you become a family without even realizing it. This show is an inside look on that. It's fun for the whole family to watch and the jokes are always fresh. Definitely recommend it.",/review/rw5260150/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2022,Alistair_Bugeja,8," It's fun to watch, but not quite amazing.
","It's fun to watch, well written at least as far as sitcoms go and I was pleasantly surprised with the foreshadowing and the nice way that it looped back around at the end. The characters are great and synergize very well together. I laughed quite often but it wasn't quite constant laughter. Although in season six the main character isn't present it's still somehow funnier than normal.",/review/rw5260150/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2021,vivianla,," Good series
",The last episode was emotional. There were some hilarious scenes especially from the tornado. I agree with other reviewers that some of the acting was cringe.,/review/rw5260150/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2019,braquecubism,3," I want to like it better
","It has some mildly funny moments. Ensemble cast with likable diverse characters, who I like until they start getting on my nerves. the story lines are mundane. OK it's a light comedy. But often I stop watching. I keep hoping it will be a funny episode. It's a feel good show about working people - in a big box store - kind of Best Buys, kind of Costco- Some of the ""problems"" they tackle are not funny or interesting. Seinfeld, Curb Your Enthusiasm and Taxi were funny about the mundane. can see why someone would like it, bec it's likable. My favorite is Mark McKinney from Kids in the Hall. I wish it were funnier.
some complained it got too PC, & political. My complaint is they don't know how to take the ordinary and make I funny.",/review/rw5260150/?ref_=tt_urv
