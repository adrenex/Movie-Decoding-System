6 November 2010,DICK STEEL,8," A Nutshell Review: The Housemaid
","The buzz on this film is ringing out loud. A remake of the original film by Kim Ki-young, widely considered one of the top Korean films of all time, this updated version by Im Sang- soo is a lot more revealing and explicit in nature for the modern audience probably sensitized to it, being one of the films selected for competition at this year's Cannes Film Festival, and its two limited screenings during our Korean Film Festival were one of the earliest to have sold out. Needless to say it makes good sense for a commercial release here.",/review/rw2720149/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2012,kluseba,6," A misunderstood artistic drama with a couple of flaws
","This movie is a remake from a film of the same name released back in 1960 but both movies are quite different and don't have the same story line. In the original feature, the housemaid seduces a composer and menaces his family until a bloody ending. In the new version, the sexually predatory femme fatale has become a poor and naive girl that gets seduced by an arrogant, cold and pitiless rich man. When she gets pregnant, the host family wants to get rid of her. But neither several attempts on her life nor money can't convince the young woman that wants to keep her child. She even ignores good advices from several friends and colleagues and decides not to quit the powerful family. When abuse, hatred and pressure reach their highest point, the young woman seeks for justice and has to fight not only a very influent and wealthy family but also her inner demons.",/review/rw2720149/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2011,tigerfish50,6," The housemaid who lost the plot
","One evening in a busy city center, a restaurant worker, Eun-yi, witnesses a young woman preparing to throw herself from the upper floor of an apartment block, and the incident leads her to change her way of life. She takes the position of housemaid to a wealthy tycoon, who lives in a luxurious residence with his beautiful pregnant wife, their precocious young daughter and a strict housekeeper. Eun-yi likes the job, but it's soon apparent she and her handsome employer are attracted to one another - and one night he shows up in her room, offers her wine and commands her to pleasure him orally. Later he adds a bonus to her salary, and Eun-yi is not displeased when he returns on a subsequent night to have sex with her. Unfortunately the housekeeper observes them and informs her boss's wife - whereupon the wheels of intrigue are set in motion with a vengeance.",/review/rw2720149/?ref_=tt_urv

24 September 2010,harry_tk_yung,," A ""reversal"" remake?
","On the surface this is a remake of the 1960 Korean classic with the same title. The simple plot remains the same: a housemaid cum nanny hired into a rich family in anticipation of a second childbirth becomes sexually involved with the master and gets herself pregnant. The protagonist's character, however, has been completely reversed. In the original, the protagonist Eun-yi was a scheming villain that purportedly caused the audience to scream ""Kill the bitch"". In this updated (cell phone included) version, she is somewhat of an enigma but with one distinct, clear attribute â€“ complete incapability of any malice.",/review/rw2720149/?ref_=tt_urv

","In this remake of a popular 1960 Korean film of the same name, Jeon Do-Yeon plays the titular character, Eun-yi, who is hired as an upper class family housemaid, tasked to take care of the family's small daughter and her pregnant mother, Hae-ra (Seo Woo). Overseeing her efforts is Byung-sik (Yun Yeo-jung), an older housemaid who has been with the family for a long time and holds many secrets. Hoon (Lee Jung Jae), the master of the house, takes advantage of his social position and begins a secret affair with Eun-yi. Once it is discovered Eun-yi may be pregnant, Mi-hee, Hae-ra's mother, plots a way to get rid of Eun-yi's unborn baby despite Eun-yi's wish to keep it and leave the house.",/review/rw2720149/?ref_=tt_urv

10 September 2010,KineticSeoul,7," Will stick with you for a few weeks
","This reminded me of Ki-duk Kim films and the visual style of Park Chan-wook films. It's basically a remake of the 1960's movie, that basically has to do with the downfall of a housemaid from working in some rich guy's house. Although the 2010 version differs from the original in many aspects, but that doesn't necessarily mean a bad thing because it has it's own style to hold it's own. Jeon Do-Yeon plays a sweethearted and kind housemaid that grew up in a harsh environment and tries to make a living by becoming a housemaid. Her performance was amazing and Seo Woo did a decent job of playing the spoiled brat as always. And later gets tormented by the wife and the wife's mother of the house, in a very vicious manner. In fact the whole family is crazy except the daughter. This is a dark movie with a handful of sex scenes and graphic parts. There are few foreshadowing in this, but the end irritated me, because karma does not come into play. But it just shows the dark side to reality.",/review/rw2720149/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2010,Atavisten,9," Wonderful homage to Kim Ki-young's 1960 classic
","For once a remake that's not a blueprint of a classic movie with its integrity taken from it to cash away on its acclaim. This I watched the following day from watching the 1960 one, a bit sceptical I must admit. That turned out to be unwarranted as this adaptation is more inspired by than copying the original.",/review/rw2720149/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2011,dbborroughs,5," Okay in parts but over all didn't add up to anything for me
",Off base remake of a classic Korean film concerns a young woman who gets a job working for a rich family and quickly ends up a mostly unwilling target for their games and in the case of the husband advances.

18 June 2011,dromasca,8," rich and servants drama in Korean style
","'The Housemaid' is based on a Korean classic movie from the 60s which I have not seen, but which is referred to by many critics and viewers knowledgeable in Korean cinema. With no term of comparison I have the (maybe) advantage of judging the film by itself. As with many other Korean films it takes a well-known genre (the rich home family drama and the relation to the servants in the house) into directions unexpected for viewers accustomed to the European or American cinema styles.",/review/rw2720149/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2011,thomvic,7," Beautifully filmed but in the end the film is simply about a cheating love affair
","The Housemaid tells an erotic tale of seduction, affair and scheming people all out to get their own way. Do-yeon Jeon plays Eun-Yi Li who is hired as a maid for an extravagant rich family - the wife is currently pregnant with two twin boys, they already have a little daughter and the husband is a very business businessman but just so happens to have time to fool with many women (supposedly) and one of them...surprise! just happens to be Eun-Yi.",/review/rw2720149/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2011,pc95,7," Mixed Bag - Starts Out Strongly
","""The Housemaid"", directed by San-Soo In and staring a gorgeous Do-yeon Jeon maintains a high level melodramatic atmosphere for much of it's runtime. The central character, Ms. Lee is in the middle of a tough blue- collar life, and she enters into a magnetic situation being a beautiful maid under the direction of a coarse hard-shelled Nanny. (spoiler)Yeo- Jong Yun does particularly well as the Nanny of the family. The theatrics and melodrama steam up and are at high-tide, but the filmmakers seem to waver on how to resolve the situation. That's when there's some trouble. The ending becomes obvious black-comedy flailing away from it's earnest earlier tone, the filmmakers run-away from what was making the movie so good earlier. The final shots are meant to be ""tongue and cheek"" but is a mild letdown. Still ""The Housemaid"" is entertaining.",/review/rw2720149/?ref_=tt_urv

","Lim Sang-Soo's ""The House Maid"" is why we have cinema. Lim Sang- Soo masterfully retells Kim Ki's original tale (1960) with imaginative alterations capturing a striking balance between eastern and western cultures. It is the sort of film, a thriller that excites the audience to no end. Lim Sang-soo has already acquired significant commercial and artistic notoriety for his movies ""Girls' Night Out"", ""Tears"", ""A Good Lawyers Wife"", ""The Presidents Last Ban"" that expertly critique Korean society. He uses his movies to explore the political and sexual tensions and repressions built into Korean Society. He is renowned for his remarkable ability to bring a richly textured and multi-layered story to the screen.",/review/rw2720149/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2012,lasttimeisaw,6," The Housemaid
","A remake of a classic masterpiece is always been a thankless task, but since half a century has passed since 1960, when Ki-young Kim's original version came out, it is a considerable and understandable timing to do it against all odds. With the A-list actress Do-young Kim on board, at least, tedium has been successfully blocked entirely through its 106 minute running time, plus I am plain oblivious to Ki-young's version, so no prejudice by preconceived ideas will hobble my judgment.
