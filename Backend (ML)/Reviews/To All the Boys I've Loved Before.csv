22 July 2006,jaredmobarak,10," ""Where do you eat lunch?""
","This is a film I have been highly anticipating for over a year. After first hitting the festival circuit in January of 2005 it went through the cycles, finally getting a stateside limited release at the end of March 2006. Buffalo, I ask you now to open your eyes to a masterpiece of cinema as Brick finally debuts at the Amherst Dipson.",/review/rw1369488/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2008,ametaphysicalshark,," Phony, gimmicky attempt at a noir story in a high school setting
","""Brick"" is completely lacking in any sort of believability or even plausibility, and even if you pretend that it takes place in an alternate universe where everybody speaks 'stylized' as opposed to English, the dialogue sounds silly and ridiculous spoken by typical high school kids. I can buy this sort of stylized dialogue if spoken by gangsters and private detectives, but high school kids? Even in a fantasy universe the characters have to be believable but in this case the characters, their motives, their lives (lifestyles, more like), their way of speaking, and their mannerisms completely lack believability or plausibility and while I SHOULD be invested in the outcome of the film's events I simply cannot be because I'm reminded over and over again that these characters aren't plausible.",/review/rw1369488/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2006,El Gato-4,8," Transposing geography
","The geography of film noir is usually a neighborhood, a city, a region ... BRICK transposes this geography onto a high school with surprisingly successful results. Watching it brought to mind not only the black & white films of the 40s and 50s, but glimmers of Gus van Sant, David Lynch and River's Edge. What gives BRICK its filmic authenticity (much different from realism) is its language -- the language of Chandler and Hammett, but re-imagined from the lips of contemporary teens.",/review/rw1369488/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2005,FritzdaCat,," Outstanding detective film-noir
","Brick Opening shot: A young man squats next to a stream, his head in his hands. What is he looking at? The body of a young woman, lying half in the stream. Next we jump to 2 days before, to follow Brendan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), an intelligent, cynical high school student, self-exiled from the cliquish world of jocks, stoners, and socialites. He is stoically heart-broken 2 months after being dumped by his girlfriend Emily (Emilie DeRavin), who left him to pursue that world. A frightened phone call from the missing Emily asking for help and filled with incoherent references to a ""brick"" and ""the pin"" prompts Brendan to launch back into high school society. He does this in the movie detective style of Sam Spade (""The Maltese Falcon""), shaking things up with a relentless directness punctuated by well-timed acts of cunning. Once found, Emily recants and asks Brendan to forget everything she said. Of course, we know from the opening scene that things aren't going to go well for Emily, and by this point we also know that Brendan isn't likely to back off from anything.",/review/rw1369488/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2020,jtindahouse,5," Very different to Johnson's later works
","I love Rian Johnson. I think he is one of the best filmmakers working today. 'Brick' from way back in 2005 was the only film of his I was yet to see, so I finally got around to going back and seeing it - and a part of me kind of wishes I hadn't. I'm not sure if it was a case of him not having found his touch yet, or just the fact that he made a very bleak and desolate film that I simply wasn't able to understand or appreciate. Some people seem to have found the magic behind this movie and absolutely love it, but I just couldn't see what they were seeing.",/review/rw1369488/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2006,jazzamind,1," Disappointment with capital D
","Well this was one of the movies I was really looking forward to see this year, not only because the whole concept of the film sounded exciting(for instance, on the DVD-box it said that it was the smartest indie flick since Donnie Darko!), but also because it came highly recommended by my brother, whom I consider(AND STILL DO)someone who truly knows what he is talking about...",/review/rw1369488/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2006,Flagrant-Baronessa,5," Kids playing grown-ups playing noir icons
","'A blast from the past' can best be attributed to Rian Johnson's ""Brick"" for it is set in present day California but heavily coated in a neo-noir atmosphere. It features postmodern, esoteric lingo that sounds like it belongs in 1930's hard-boiled crime stories. It invests the film is a decadent noir feel and a great literary flow throughout the dialogue. It becomes apparent that Johnson has done something exceptional here; he has created a modern world filled with lonely detectives, drug-lords, wiseguys and femme fatales.",/review/rw1369488/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2006,eroka,1," Absolute rubbish!
","I am a true film lover. I watch for indie stuff and I respect efforts even if they are mediocre. ""Brick"" is an absolutely well-made student film, and that's where it should stay. Watching this in the West End after weeks of inclusion in ""London's best films at the mo"" list I went and watched it. Awful. Sound is horrible. Dialogue is trite if you can actually understand it. Locations are ""no budget"" and ineffective. The movie is not engaging (with 15 minutes I realised this was a major mistake) and at best will make you smile. Characterisation is bad. But all that is just not the real bottom line: it's damn boring and acts as a very long joke in cinematic reference. There is nothing brilliant about unless the whole production was under-aged, which would be admirable. Total rubbish - avoid at all costs. and I am writing this comment JUST because someone here must sound the siren, amongst all these favorable reviews. Can't get it how so many thinks highly of this flick. AVOID!",/review/rw1369488/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2005,dylan-89,9," Film Noir meets 90s High School flick
","I saw this film at a sneak preview the other night not knowing what to expect. To say the least I was pleasantly surprised. Film Noir being one of my favorite film genre's, ""Brick"" follows the same story structure, odd-ball characters, right down to the very smart and quick paced dialogue of a 30s/40s hard boiled detective thriller. The twist that lifts it above parody and even a mere homage is the presentation of these elements with high school kids in Southern California. The direction by Rian Johnson is very expert and confident in telling the story, giving the audience smooth and quick editing along with skewed and distorted camera angles. He manages to maintain suspense throughout the film, only in a couple of parts letting it drag (the scenes with the Drama Queen are some of the weakest). The actors are great, the most memorable being the ""villains"" Pen and Tugger. Rather than just being atypical baddies, their portrayals give them depth, sympathy, and at the same time a degree of likability. Kudos also goes to the actor who played Brain, the partner of Frye, who is nearly flawless in his somewhat small role. John Shaft himself, Richard Roundtree, shows up as the Vice Principal, but it is obvious they only had the budget to hire him for one day. I have to say this isn't a classic film by any means; I merely decided to give it such a high rating because it attempts something different and succeeds fairly successfully. I've been tired of the mundane films that get released every year, and for once this is something that is completely different; the use of archetypal characters in the setting and delivery not expected. It's a low budget film, but it is obvious to me that that this filmmaker will be heard from again. Keep an eye out.",/review/rw1369488/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2006,rlaux,1," Why?
","Why does everyone feel they must rave about a movie simply because it was not made by a major studio? This isn't just a movie about teenagers and starring teenagers, it looks as if teenagers wrote, produced, directed, filmed and edited it. Kids with a video camera could have made a film that looked better. There are way too many holes and credibility gaps in the story and far too many unsympathetic characters. They finally show Brendan in some pain, although he probably should have died from his untended to internal injuries a third of the way into the film, and the ""profoundly moving"" and carefully kept secret revealed at the end was hardly a secret, and not very meaningful. The use of a single key word as a title has become rather annoying, but there is a common street term for excrement used in the movie that would have served just as well.",/review/rw1369488/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2005,non_cur,9," extremely enjoyable and unique film!
","OK...I have never actually commented on a movie on IMDb, but this movie was so great I really felt I had to let people know about it. When I first read the synopsis of Brick at Sundance I was immediately interested in seeing it. ""Film Noir set in a high school."" I started hearing really terrible reviews of it and almost did not go until the very last day I could. I am so glad I did. It is a very unique film, such a refreshing one for people who have seen it all. So if you want something new and different you will definitely enjoy this. Others may find it is too over-the top for them--it took me several minutes to understand what the characters were even saying at first, in their language that mixed old film noir slang with the new generation of slang. Its very dark and the sound design will even make a person feel uneasy. The director linked sound and image in ways I have never seen, completely enthralling me from beginning to end. This movie is not a relaxing ride. oh! but there are great comedic and ironic moments as well! I think a lot of the criticism I heard of this film was that it was too incomprehensible and unbelievable. I personally really got into the world of this film and it had me on the edge of my seat until the very end. It was so enjoyable to buy into the rules of the film noir/high school drama world and its characters. I did not even recognize the lead character as that kid from 3rd Rock until the end! I hated 3rd Rock, but I absolutely loved and believed in his character here. I loved it! One of my top picks at Sundance this year. sorry I have never written a review...I hope this reveals something about the movie. I really, really hope that it gets released soon! It is one of those interesting movies that could really be a cult classic.",/review/rw1369488/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2006,tamemlin,1," Kids Playing Grown-ups, Talking Nonsense
","This is a very irritating film. It's like Bugsy Malone without the songs. It all comes across as kids doing Film Noir for their school project - badly. It is an unengaging story about an unlikable girl who goes missing, and her miserable ex-boyfriend who tries to solve the big mystery. Yawn. The dialogue is perhaps the most annoying part of Brick. Clearly the writer has mistaken 'incomprehensible' for 'clever'. It's all gabbled nonsense like ""Jimmy C got goosed by the bulls and now I'm half-galloned to Milwaukee. Find out where Eddie Cheerio hides his cake and then meet me behind the Flapjack shop at a quarter past lunch."" Or something.",/review/rw1369488/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2006,big_novak,10," Brilliant modern day Film Noir with color, drugs and a twist
","That's the story, right? Going back to the days of ""China Town"" with Jack Nicholson chasing lead after lead, turning corners left and right, only to find more corners. Who's duping who? We don't know until the very end in this fast-paced, hipster lingo drenched wild revival of the classic Black and White Film Noir. Joseph Gordon-Levitt (yes, the kid from Third Rock) is a brilliant hero/foil as Brendan, the bitingly dry, quick-witted, scrappy and yet reluctant detective trying to walk his way through a web of lies, more lies, murder and lots of missing drugs. His character is bright, he can read a situation like a psychic on crack, turn things to his favor in seconds and play people as deftly as he is ultimately played himself. ...And he can take a punch. The plot turns this way, then that, keeping you constantly guessing as to where it will take you next. As soon as you think you know what's going on, you don't. Nora Zehetner is a beautiful and beguiling femme fatale. ""The Brian"" (Matt O'Leary), who is constantly feeding Brendan his facts and keeping him on track, knows his stuff but never let's you know how. Rian Johnson has written an amazing script and directed it into a whirlwind experience of near misses, painful betrayal and love/love lost. The lingo takes a second to catch. I'm reminded of Swingers, had it been as thrilling as it was funny. The words fall into place and give the film a slick, quick delivery like the best exchanges between Bogart and Bergman, Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake. Take all that and drop it into a dark, starkly brutal modern world... In a high school, of all places. There's even some quirky humor thrown in, though most of the laughs from the audience were really nervous release from all the tension built into the story. A must see.",/review/rw1369488/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2006,hpmc6,1," Worst movie I've seen in years
","I tried stretching to watch this movie with an open mind, some 'arty' movies take a while to build toward a payoff. But the clues that were shown to me in this mystery pointed toward no payoff whatsoever, so I didn't finish it. It sucks. I hadn't heard much about the movie, so I was wondering 'is this an un-funny farce?'. I guess it isn't a farce, it's supposed to be a noir. It's a disaster.",/review/rw1369488/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2006,PipAndSqueak,3," Thick as a brick...
","It is one thing to pay tribute to the works of others, quite another to use a pick and mix approach in cobbling together a teen quest movie. Nothing is right, setting, dialogue, or story. Brick is neither off-beat enough to be an original take on the death and drugs story that is often peddled to signal a young man's transition to maturity, nor is it realistic enough to convince that this might be happening at a school near you now. Brendan is at once too 'knowing' and too 'naive'. There are no real relationships between the characters. What on earth motivates 'The Brain' to assist in the story? The Pin decides he must start selling 'the brick'....why? Watching this movie is about as engaging as looking at the collage of pictures stuck on a schoolboy's bedroom wall until someone comes to unlock the door.",/review/rw1369488/?ref_=tt_urv

28 March 2007,The_Void,4," All the brains of a brick and twice as dull!
","Well, I'm a big fan of film noir, and originality in cinema; so when I heard that someone had fused the noir and high school styles of filming, I eagerly anticipated the film. The good reviews that Brick was getting increased my expectations further - but unfortunately, the title of this film has turned out to be apt for all the wrong reasons; Brick is as dull as a brick. To put it simply; director Rian Johnson has attempted to join together two genres that simply can't be joined, and the result is a big, boring, mess of a film that is both impossible to take seriously and really difficult to take an interest in. The plot focuses on a 'loner' who decides to investigate the disappearance of his ex-girlfriend, who naturally he still has feelings for, after he receives a call from her. This endeavour means he has to talk to various different parties and it ultimately leads him to uncover the 'seedy underbelly' of the school, which involves drugs and crime and stuff. His only help is a geeky kid called 'The Brain'.",/review/rw1369488/?ref_=tt_urv

","The best way for me to describe this film would be a high school neo-noir mystery. The story is interesting enough and the acting is decent. However, the dialog seems strange.

17 May 2006,dhealey-1,1," Dire
","This film is nothing more than an example of someone trying to be clever and seriously failing, ending up being smothered by their own pretentiousness. I watched (endured, suffered, was tortured by) this film at the Deauville Film Festival in Sebtember 2005 and I can safely say that this was, without any doubt and by a very big margin, the worst offering that I saw all week and I have to say I've struggled to find anything worse since then, even when I leave the DVD choice to my 10 year old son. The film is dull, turgid, lifeless and shambolic, it provides no interest or excitement and was viewed by myself as a waste of 110 minutes of my existence. If you want to spend some money and waste a few hours, got to a bar, have a few drinks, believe me you'll enjoy yourself more. If looking at glowing images on a faraway wall that offer you no intellectual stimulation whatsoever without any hint or promise of enjoyment then this is the film for you. For myself, it was too much like group voluntary euthanasia and not an enjoyable experience.",/review/rw1369488/?ref_=tt_urv
