24 February 2007,ccthemovieman-1,9," Tough To Beat A Good Man-On-The-Run Action Movie
","I don't think this is really considered a ""war movie"" in the normal sense but it might as well be since it involves all military people and the focus is an American Navy pilot who is shot down over Bosnia and runs for his life while waiting to be rescued.",/review/rw1182652/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2003,Theo Robertson,2," So Badly Written It`s Offensive To The Dead Of The Balkans Conflict
","What`s fundamentally wrong with this movie is summed up by the opening voice over about "" The Cincinatti peace accord "" . I jumped out of my seat screaming "" The whaaaat ? . It`s the Dayton peace accord you bloody fool "" . But I realised this was a complete work of fiction even though it`s set against the background of the aftermath of the early 90s Balkans conflict . Or is it ? Is it set before the signing of the Dayton peace accord of 1995 or after it ? Is it set before the Kosovo campaign of 1999 or after it ? This vagueness of chronology is irritating as are the politics . Why is the Serb faction so anti- Mladic ? Despite his unforgivable behaviour against Bosniak ( Bosnian Muslims )  and Croat civilians during the conflict Mladic was by far the most popular Bosian Serb leader amongst the Bosnian Serb population , and once again I`ve got to ask when BEHIND ENEMY LINES is set ? If it`s after 1995 Slobodan Milosevic should be the hate figure for these Serb rebels for signing the Dayton peace agreement . Another thing that annoyed me was the false picture painted of the NATO command structure which has always been commanded by Americans . There is exceptions to the rule such as NATO`s ground offensive in Kosovo in 1999 being led by British general Mike Jackson but NATO has nearly always been an entirely American run show and there`s no way Uncle Sam would allow an entire NATO task force to be run by a French admiral as seen here . And another unforgivable error that shows the screenwriters don`t have a clue what they`re writing about is the line "" The F-18 was shot down over southern Bosnia "" ! Even when the Bosnian Serb army made its greatest gains in the summer/autumn of 1992 they never reached as far as southern Bosnia , this area remained in the hands of the Bosnian Croats before , during and after the war while most of central Bosnia was held by the Bosniaks while the rest of Bosnia was held by the Serbs so if the hero was shot down over "" Southern Bosnia "" how come he`s being chased by Serb militia and tanks . Oh and if there`s a peace deal how come everyone is fighting again ? Wasn`t there a large UN presence before NATO arrived ? Wasn`t there a large NATO ground force ( I-For it was called ) sent into the country to implement the Dayton peace accord ? So how come we don`t see any NATO ground forces stopping the fighting between the factions ?  ",/review/rw1182652/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2001,Quinoa1984,5," Really, really stupid (even for this usual genre)
","How they got Owen Wilson and Gene Hackman, guys with talent and skill (Wilson also with writing) to act in this movie is beyond my thinking (outside of the money factor).  Behind Enemy Lines wastes their talent, and wastes the time of the audience as well.  Wilson plays a navy pilot who gets shot down with his co-pilot over enemy territory in east europe (Bosnia, serbia, wherever-ia) and after he witnesses his co-pilot get shot by the enemy, he goes on the run from him to try and get rescued by his commander (Hackman) who wants to get him out but repeatedly gets told not to.

14 December 2019,Prismark10,5," Behind Enemy Lines
",Once the Bosnian war ended and the western nations realised how much their own policies had contributed to the genocide of Bosnian Muslims. You had a spate of Hollywood movies that tried to atone for this by showing Serbs as unreconstructed bad guys. Obviously this would all change after 9/11.,/review/rw1182652/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2018,paulclaassen,8," Great action suspense survival drama.
","Note this is not a war movie. Instead it is a survival story set during a war. Viewed in that sense, it is an incredible action-packed drama. The photography is insanely good, with some fantastic aerial shots. Hail to director John Moore for having such a clear vision of what he wanted the end product to look like. This was so incredible, it is hard to believe it was his directorial debut feature.",/review/rw1182652/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2008,ma-cortes,6," Survival game by Owen Wilson against Servian soldiers
","This is a taut and compelling film based on true events ; it focuses a pair of brave pilots , two crack fighter pilots , the Air Force Lieutenants Burnett (Owen Wilson) and Stackhouse (Gabriel Match) . The F-14 Fighter pilots have only seen the war from 40.000 foot until they're shot down behind enemy lines , in Bosnia territory . Now the Admiral McMahon (Gene Hackman) in charge to get him out , before the Servian soldiers (Olek Kupra) and enemy forces bombing the area . However US commanding doesn't want intervene but is about a peace treatise . Stranding two pilots in enemy territory , now in order to survive , there starts a game of survival . They must fight the rebel forces that threaten their lives and retrieve photographs about massacres .",/review/rw1182652/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2022,planktonrules,6," A good film that plays fast and loose with the actual story.
","""Behind Enemy Lines"" is a film with a bit of controversy. The story clearly was based on the experiences of US Air Force pilot Scott O'Grady...but they took great liberties with the facts and O'Grady felt he was maligned by the movie because the lead (Owen Wilson) had a lousy attitude at the beginning of the film and was insubordinate...unlike the real life O'Grady. The film also changes a lot of the facts--making the plane a two-seat Navy plane (an F-18 Super Eagle) flown from an aircraft carrier instead of the single seat F-16 O'Grady flew from an air base. Regardless, the film still is quite exciting and worth seeing.",/review/rw1182652/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2016,dilarasdad,9," Not Enough Credit Given
","I truly enjoyed this movie, because it took a lighthearted approach to 'running for your life' while serving in the forces. I was, however, disheartened by the fact that Scott O'Grady brought down a law suit on the study for ""portraying him"" in a bad light. This movie was about anything else but Scott O'Grady. Note: Sorry Scott, but it's not about you...",/review/rw1182652/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2007,johnny-08,1," Let me tell you that...
",Americans need this kind of movie especially today. Why? Well they have to lie to their nation (Bush) and saying that Iraq was a good move. Wake up! Americans are in Iraq because of oil. And these kind of patriotic crap movies are watchable only to Americans or to those who don't know or don't want to know what Americans are doing today.,/review/rw1182652/?ref_=tt_urv

1 December 2001,gbnf,1," Big Mistake (SPOILER ALERT !)
","SPOILER ALERT ! This was the sorriest movie I can ever remember seeing.  I realize that everybody is still in shock from 9-11.  I personally lost a family member because of it.  But that doesn't mean I'm so starved for patriotism that I would blindly love this crap.  A US Navy pilot and navigator disobey orders then get shot down.  Suddenly he can dodge automatic fire from assaults rifles, 20mm cannons, and grenade launchers?  He runs in the daytime, stops to transmit in open territory, and suddenly knows the area better then they people who are chasing him?  His commanders are unwilling/unable to help him.  The end is the worst, he's running around in between crossfire of his rescuers and his pursuers without ever getting hit?  Grabs some disk of pictures that would have been transmitted automatically to base as soon as he took them anyway?  Then runs and jumps off a cliff to someone hanging from a helicopter rather than having the stupid helicopter land for 3 seconds to pick him up.  I realize that some people may need a boost of patriotism but we can do much better than this crap.  See 'Saving Private Ryan' again if you're that desperate.",/review/rw1182652/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2004,bob the moo,," An average action movie that is slightly offensive in its exploitative attitude to a terrible conflict
","Lt Chris Burnett is a US Navy navigator working on a NATO mission around Bosnia. Bored with routine in the Navy and fed up flying uneventful missions to survey the peace, Burnett annoys his CO one last time by putting in his notice to quit and return to civilian life. Of course his reward is to be put on a mission on Christmas Day doing routine reconnaissance. An error in the intelligence data leads them over an no-fly zone where they see a convoy of Bosnian soldiers who should not be there and, in the process of recording them, they are attacked and shot down. Separated form Burnett, the pilot is captured and killed, leaving Burnett to evade capture for as long as he can until he can be rescued. ",/review/rw1182652/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2016,tigersbleedblue,7," critics ate ""critics""
","Behind enemy lines is an intriguing movie. If it was based on a true story, I could see why people would be so ""critical"". Well folks, it's not based on true events and it's just a movie. We don't have to break down why an Admiral puts forth an order for no search and rescue or why sailors on the deck are playing football. ",/review/rw1182652/?ref_=tt_urv

23 October 2015,Leofwine_draca,7," An old-fashioned, action-packed war movie
","This fluid, adrenaline-fuelled addition to the recent wave of war films to hit our cinemas in the wake of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is less serious than most, instead preferring to simplify the characters and situations of the (real-life) war situation - and using them as a basis for what is pretty much a straightforward action offering, utilising the old-fashioned ""chase"" style plot as a basis for the continuous shoot-outs and battles between enemies. In fact the film has a minimalist style, preferring to keep things low key, as a sole man - played by Owen Wilson - must try and make it to safe ground before the stereotypical bad guys shoot him dead. BEHIND ENEMY LINES may not be a work of art, but as an action film it exceeds all of our expectations. The pacing never flags for a second and the action is plentiful and exciting.",/review/rw1182652/?ref_=tt_urv

","F-18 Fighter navigator Chris Burnett (Owen Wilson) is tired of boring meaningless flying over the Balkins. On a routine Christmas mission, he gets stuck on a recon mission. They go off course to scout a target, but get shot down. The Serbs find the pilot and executes him. Chris goes on the run alone against massive forces. Meanwhile Admiral Leslie McMahon Reigart (Gene Hackman) in command of the carrier sets out to rescue the down pilot despite orders not to.",/review/rw1182652/?ref_=tt_urv

","Well despite what others thought I really enjoyed this. I hadn't seen it in ages and had a great time watching it again, a thrill ride with solid characters, excellent special effects, and some cool looking camera work. Just as an FYI this is a great movie to watch on the treadmill as it's essentially just one long chase sequence set to some decent music.",/review/rw1182652/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2003,imdb-583,1," Incomprehensibly bad
","I'm sure there have been worse movies made. I just haven't seen them. Even if you are not looking for an intelligent handling of international politics, and don't care about the horribly jingoistic attitudes portrayed, I think it is still difficult to fathom how this movie could be enjoyed. Action sequences are never resolved, they just **SPOILER WARNING** end with the main character miraculously transported to another location. It is unfortunate that the U.S. military can not extend the range of its transporters to actually get characters completely out of the battle zone, instead of a mere few hundred yards.",/review/rw1182652/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2006,jeroen-106,1," American propaganda
","I've seen a documentary where an agency is helping film producers to deliver them army material such as boats, tanks, weapons, whatever you need to make the movie. In return the army wants the filmmaker to portrait the US Army as heroes and warriors, turn it into propaganda. If the filmmaker denies, you're on your own. Now of course every army on the planet does not want to be criticized, but in the US it has gone too far. ",/review/rw1182652/?ref_=tt_urv

As an avid American, please, world, accept my humble apology for this poorly made, sloppy, unrealistic, technically inaccurate and laughable, dark, hateful, hideous mess.
