29 April 2020,cardsrock,7," Entertaining for what it is
","If you have low expectations going into this movie, you'll enjoy it a lot more. Yes, it is ridiculous, but it's also pretty funny and has some decent commentary on the world. It can be a little too over the top at times, but this is a film that doesn't take itself too seriously and you shouldn't either.",/review/rw3147629/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2014,paul-allaer,8," ""That was a gift from Stalin."" ""In our country, we pronounce that Stallone""
","""The Interview"" (2014 release; 112 min.) brings the story of how an entertainment reporter Dave Skylark (played by James Franco) and his producer Aaron Rapoport (played by Seth Rogen) get an opportunity to interview Kim Jong-un. the ""Supreme Leader"" of North Korea. As the movie opens, we see a young girl (maybe 7 or 8) sing a patriotic song for North Korean officials. The song turns hilariously into an anti-America rant. Soon thereafter, we see Skylark interview Eminem (another hilarious scene). When Skylark and Rapoport find out that Jng-un is a big fan of the show, they manage an invite to North Korea. The CIA then pays a visit and convinces the guys that they need to ""take out"" Jong-un. At this point we're barely 20 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience.",/review/rw3147629/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2020,ni6hant,10," It's so dumb, I love it.
","This is a perfect example of a very good execution. The movie is directed and produced and acted so beautifully that you forgive it for every plot holes, every stupid thing that doesn't make any sense in this movie at all.",/review/rw3147629/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2014,sweetboyy_99,7," The Interview: An Actual Honest Review
","The Interview has created a lot of crazy rumors and a lot of things have been making this movie one of the biggest happenings this year. A lot of speculations were made when Sony got hacked and they suspected that North Korea was behind it. This generated a lot of interest for the movie and people were talking about it over and over again. So, after several threats they decided to pull the movie from all theaters. Later on, they decided to release it for streaming purposes, and that's how we finally got to watch the hard work that was put into The Interview.",/review/rw3147629/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2020,Med-Jasta,7," Really funny!
",Sure there are some moments that are too over the top or that go on for too long but all in all really funny. James Franco as the idiot is really good. Reminded me of South Park with their take on a dictator. How do you make fun of them? Turn them into everything they hate.,/review/rw3147629/?ref_=tt_urv

24 December 2014,rprince-832-6294,6," Honestly hilarious.
","-The Interview, maybe you have heard of it, follows two idiots, played by James Franco and Seth Rogan, who host a talk show, when one day they are invited to interview Kim Jong-un. This prompts the CIA to recruit the two to 'take out' the leader of North Korea.",/review/rw3147629/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2014,namashi_1,7," Some Wicked Fun!
","Despite the doomed controversy surrounding it, 'The Interview' is a pretty cool & funny film, that deserved a wider release. Its limited release may restrict its appeal, but I'd suggest anyone who wants to laugh on Christmas, should check this one out. ",/review/rw3147629/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2015,SnoopyStyle,6," some hilarity but not as funny as I hoped
","Dave Skylark (James Franco) is a celebrity interviewer with his tabloid TV show ""Skylark Tonight"" run by producer Aaron Rapaport (Seth Rogen). World tension is rising as North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un (Randall Park) test missiles that can hit the American west coast. The Times reports that he's a fan of Skylark Tonight and Dave wants to do an interview. CIA Agent Lacey (Lizzy Caplan) recruits them to assassinate him. Seth Rogen as straight man isn't as funny as his usual self. James Franco is funny as a stupid idiot. Diana Bang has some funny moments. The movie has some hilarious moments but it is not as densely packed with comedy as I hoped.",/review/rw3147629/?ref_=tt_urv

26 December 2014,PyroSikTh,7," Enjoyable if you like Rogan/Franco comedies.
","I was fully prepare to be disappointed with this movie. It's garnered a lot of hype recently and for all that to be about nothing would be a big shame. Thing is though, it's a Rogan/Franco comedy. If you've seen the likes of Pineapple Express and This is the End, you know exactly what to expect. The Interview is no different really. The plot is simple yet outrageous; an interview show is invited to North Korea to interview Kim Jong-Un, but the CIA butts in and asks them to assassinate him. Franco and Rogan then blunder around failing to assassinate him and get themselves in ridiculous situations.",/review/rw3147629/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2014,alci350,10," Not bad at all
","Reading all the bad comments, I was expecting something in style of Borat or Dumb and dumberer to. Or some sort of embarrassing Ben Stiller humor. Those are uncomfortable to watch. But not this, not by a long shot.",/review/rw3147629/?ref_=tt_urv

9 August 2020,Kingslaay,5," These type of films are past their shelf date
","I remember all the news around this film, how controversial it was. However once you watch it you see how pitiful and silly it really is. It also made me think of the shelf life of certain types of comedic films. The 80s and 90s gave us Adam Sandler, Chris Rock & also Rob Shneider who peaked in the 90s and early 2000s. The early 2000s then ushered in a new type of comedian with the likes of Seth Rogen, James Franco & Jonah Hill. They starred in over the top but different kind of films that were enjoyable. However whats happened to Adam Sandler's movies is starting to happen to Rogen and Franco. These silly and ridiculous plots with no sense aren't that original anymore. We've all seen a fair bit of them and the mindless fun and novelty has worn off. I am pleased I didn't spend money watching this in theater and saw it on Netflix instead.",/review/rw3147629/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2020,TheHoodOfSwords,8," The First Comedy In A While That Made Me Laugh!
","First off, I will start by saying I usually don't watch comedies because I never laugh at them. This movie however had me laughing the most I have been at a comedy in at least half a year. The movie starts off very comedic-ally centered, but in the second and third act it becomes much more of a action movie. Which I actually enjoy. I look at this movie as a movie, not as any of the controversy surrounding it.",/review/rw3147629/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2014,heaan-lasai,1," Forced situations, shock value & ""Never go full retard.""
","The premise and subject for this movie gave the writers the opportunity for an entertaining future cult film. It could have been an entertaining political satire, the possibilities were endless. Additionally the media attention could have made for a legendary movie. Alas, no such luck. Lazy writing turned this film into a waste of a good afternoon. The entire film consists of forced situations, stupidity and shock value humour. Forced situations; When done smoothly situational humour can be very entertaining, but here the writers seem to have been too lazy to set up each situation smoothly. Instead they just force each situation into existence. Full retard; Some stupidity can often be humorous, but never go full retard. Here the main character Dave here cannot recognize a tiger, and describes it as ""a strange big stripy orange dog"". Apparently that's supposed to be funny. Shock value humour; Shock value is seldom entertaining, and it's a hallmark of lazy writing. When Dave isn't ""going full retard"" he is yelling profanities like how his genitals smell like guacamole. Aides from these themes there is nothing humorous in this flick. Save your time and money, watch something else.",/review/rw3147629/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2014,misterphilipj,10," Better than the neighbors and this is the end. James Francos best movie yet
","From start to finish this film is witty fresh and original. The chemistry between Franco and Rogan was fluid as ever, leading to a light and easily digestible comedy leaving me wanting for more. ",/review/rw3147629/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2014,thesar-2,1," The un-Comedy
","Dang, you were so close, Kim Jong-un. You failed at stopping probably the only comedy I've ever seen that could make The Love Guru incredibly funny.",/review/rw3147629/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2020,aidanratesmovies,9," Stupid and absurd, but quite enjoyable
","Completely absurd in all the right ways, The Interview does a pretty well job at making you laugh, even if the film as a whole does certainly have its flaws. The film is quite over the top, which if you know what it is about, you probably already know. However, some gags in the film seem more forced than others, making it all together less enjoyable than it seems it could be. At its worse, The Interview can seem like a lazy political comedy that relies on gross out humor to play its own game. At its best however, The Interview harnesses its potential, jokes, and all the talent involved, for one truly hilarious ride, which may be ridiculous, but is so in the best of ways. The pacing works quite well, with it always being entertaining throughout, despite some awkward moments. In the end, The Interview is far from a great comedy film, but is certainly worth a watch, and certainly earning of the laughs that it may try too hard to achieve.
My Rating: 8.5/10",/review/rw3147629/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2014,alcosta-197-774442,1," Nice marketing technique

11 January 2015,StevenKind97,8," Very Funny But Underrated
",Overall I did enjoy this film I did get a few good laughs out of it. But what mainly drew me to watching this film was all of the controversy that was surrounding it. This movie is a comedy but it shows us how North Korea is ran by a crazy manipulative man. I did enjoy this film it was very funny and shows us about Kim Jong Un and North Korea. Seth Rogan and James Franco Played excellent roles and so did Diana Bang on her role. And Randall Park did a great job portraying Kim Jong Un in a comedic way. This film is definitely a funny movie but I have seen movies that have given me more laughs than this. Its ashamed that this movie did not get that much time in theaters but it made plenty of money on digital purchases.,/review/rw3147629/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2014,rzajac,7," Sorta reminds me of Python's Life of Brian
","The Interview has at least one key thing in common with Life of Brian. They both reflect a need for people who assemble boffo stuff to eventually get around to taking on the Big Dogs. With the Python, it was the life of Christ; and with Rogen, it's geopolitics and heavy power.",/review/rw3147629/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2014,tinovalkki,1," just bad
","Making comedy is a hard thing to do well. Especially when we speak about political comedy. You can make political comedy in slap-stick style, if you know how, but then we speak about masterpieces like Charlie Chaplin's Dictator. The Interview won't get even near to that. All that bad humor may make you laugh if you are six years old, but normal audience even with a little sense of humor this is more like an insult. I wonder how they got James Franco and Seth Rogen to get involved with this. Just reading a script would keep any actor avoiding this kind of garbage. Maybe they have some terns of agreement with Sony Pictures which obligates them to do something like this between real projects, I wonder. All the speak about hacking Sony Pictures must be some panic marketing after getting evaluation of test audience screening just to maximize the profit out of it. Not even the government of North-Korea could be so stupid to make such efforts. I wonder how they got President Obama involved this marketing campaign? Maybe he got few Sony Pictures shares in his pocket. I am not a huge fan of comedy, but even slap-stick humor can make with some style. This piece of junk mostly insults of it's audience.",/review/rw3147629/?ref_=tt_urv
