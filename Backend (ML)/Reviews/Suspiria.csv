16 June 2021,cindyrellaexists,7," Very fun but drop the Jenny character
",This is a cleverly written show with superb performances by wonderful actors. My only complaint is the drippy very unnecessary Jenny character. Just skip any additional involvement with her because her story is B-O-R-I-N-G.,/review/rw7232540/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2019,rawlinsc-97463,10," 4-4-4, on the floor!
","I don't see how ppl can possibly say this show isn't funny. I don't even HAVE kids and it's hilarious. From what I know from friends who do have children, this show is pretty spot on. Plus it's original and totally speaks to me as a woman.",/review/rw7232540/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2022,sdowen-59793,8," Back on track after an lukewarm Season 5
",The first 4 seasons were on the mark. Other reviewers complain about the Characters being selfish. The selfish behaviour drives the comedy. Perfect people are not funny. The cast of Seinfeld was very selfish.,/review/rw7232540/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2021,painsville1,5," Season 5
","I guess season 5 ruined this series for me. Everything is exaggerated and not realistic anymore, jokes are meh, storyline is dull. What a pity.",/review/rw7232540/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2019,Just_watching,8," Don't understand all the hate.
",This is a solid show. It is funny and emotional. It shows the choices some mothers are faced with and things that they experience and go through. Of course some of it is exaggerated and some of it is unbelievable but it's fiction!!! It's a tv show. It's entertainment. Keep an open mind watching it. It's worth it.,/review/rw7232540/?ref_=tt_urv

14 January 2019,thepinkladies50,8," I love it
","I find it funny, relatable and unique. The storyline and sense of humour isn't predictable which seems rare nowadays. The main characters are gold. Love love love it!",/review/rw7232540/?ref_=tt_urv

28 May 2018,alison_young-21400,10," Very funny!
","I was on a long flight, and was planning to check out a single episode before going to sleep.. I didn't think I'd like the show based on the ads I'd seen, but turns out I couldn't stop watching. I ended up seeing seven episodes, laughing out loud, waking up the people next to me. Great show! Very funny, compelling characters, love the writing. I'm baffled by the bad reviews here.. were they watching the same show?! Of course the characters/situations are exaggerated - it's a comedy.",/review/rw7232540/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2019,dreamseven-450-575026,10," Very funny
",I don't understand why some reviewers have such low ratings. This is a good show and I enjoyed the story as it based on working moms' real life.,/review/rw7232540/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2019,candacemartin-69748,7," Sneak attack of likability
","I'm sorry, but IMBD the ratings of this show is all wrong. I actually chuckled out loud at this show, like literally caught the giggles.
It's utterly relatable and very close to what life can be like as a working mom. Yes, some of it is exaggerated hyperbole, but I think that's what resonates with me. Because real life motherhood can be extremely humorous and overly dramatic .... just like this show. I totally get it. I'll continue to watch.",/review/rw7232540/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2021,Alturego,9," On point

15 January 2019,juliadanila,8," Don't take it too seriously
","This show has some good bones! Cute at times, funny at times, and at other times downright ridiculous but as a young mom I can definitely relate to some moments and I enjoy watching it. I think a lot of the negative reviews on here go way overboard in expecting this show to be some perfectly leftist don't offend anyone whatsoever and portray motherhood in a way that pleases absolutely everyone but quite frankly that's impossible. So take it easy and give it a chance. And don't take it too seriously",/review/rw7232540/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2017,lotsoletters,9," A+++ an excellent , warm, honest, funny portrayal of motherhood
","I have just finished watching the first three episodes of this new series and joined IMDb specifically to write this review as i am completely flummoxed by the current rating for this program. This TV show has fast become one of my new favorites. The extremely funny dialogue and relatable portrayals of what its like to be a woman dealing with the challenges that come along with being a mum, is a definite must watch. Even if you are not a mom, it is just freaken funny and uplifting. I am truly impressed with the engaging writing and brilliantly portrayed characters. A much needed antidote to all the superhero based shows currently on television. My hat is off ladies, well done!",/review/rw7232540/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2018,sharonsso,10," Great show! Underrated and under appreciated.
","While not realistically portraying the experience of many working moms (as some of the negative reviews insist), it has a humorous and engaging way of highlighting many issues that come up with the challenge of juggling numerous and unrealistic expectations for working mothers (i.e., expectations to do it all, work like you don't have kids, parent like you don't have a job, etc). Really enjoy this show! Fun discovery that Kate and Nathan are both producers and married in real life too.",/review/rw7232540/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2019,mary-179-677383,2," Don't get the hype
","This show does have some funny parts, I admit. But when the show finishes you get a feeling of sadness. Not that it's over, but that you just laughed at the most ridiculous characters. I guess it just makes parents or really working mothers look extremely bad. Yes, extremely bad. As a woman, I'm not really okay with that. Every female character is messed up, selfish and shows little attachment or love towards their children. They also treat the men in their lives like rubbish. Working mothers work hard, but most of them are working bc of need to support their families and put food on the table. This show really focus only on woman who had kids bc their husbands or partners wanted them then they hate every moment and want to go right back to work bc being with the kids isn't a priority. Not once do the woman seem happy raising a baby or children, the men do though . The main character Kate at one point takes a business opportunity to work in another city. She shows some compassion when she leaves the job to see her child in hospital. But most mothers wouldn't even consider leaving their young baby in the first place. Look, yes it can be funny. But it's not realistic. It's not relatable. The female characters are not likeable and it gives a bad name to working mums while also insulting stay at home mums. The show got its inspiration from bad moms the movie but took all the likeable characters away.",/review/rw7232540/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2019,jennfinn,8," Funny
",I binge watched all three seasons of this over the weekend. I thought it was funny and definitely relatable to real working moms. Anne (Dani Kind) is by far my favorite character along with Val (Sarah McVie). Catherine Reitman is very talented and I love the chemistry between her and Philip Sternberg who is her real life husband. To me though Catherine will always be Maureen Ponderosa from It's Always in Philadelphia. The show has lost a little steam from season one to three and it has incorporated some really crude humor but I guess it's to be expected. My one complaint would be that I think the show depicts lesbians as promiscuous.,/review/rw7232540/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2019,dbutcher-47332,10," Funny and love that it's filmed in Toronto!
",My sister told me about this show first and so I started watching it on Netflix. I was hooked from the first show and couldn't stop watching. I had to get the cbc gem app to start watching the third season and the show even had me running to the store to learn about streaming from phone to TV and bought a Chromecast! Watching third season as I write this. Cool that it is filmed in Toronto!,/review/rw7232540/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2019,luciabcn86,5," I wanted to like it but just can't
","I was looking for a new show to watch, and I am just about to become a mum, so this seemed like a decent show to try. However, having struggled through season 1 and toyed with the idea of starting season 2 (i watched about 10 minutes of the first episode) I have finally given up.",/review/rw7232540/?ref_=tt_urv

23 June 2021,tc2284,1," Nosedive in Season 5
","This show was so good until they got on the woke train in season 5. And they did it without any subtlety at all. They might as well just like directly into the camera and yell: ""WE'RE WOKE NOW!!! SEE?!""",/review/rw7232540/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2019,Bluechinaspecial,4," Not Good Caricatures of Motherhood
","Hoo boy, where to begin?
1. The three women focused on in the pilot are far too successful to be relatable, so listening to one whine about being able to afford a third child, while living In one of Toronto's poshest neighborhoods, is annoying.
2. Three lily white women protagonists with women of color in servile positions taking care of their children. Ehhhh...
3. Show runners got point two after a screening, I suppose. They suddenly add an Asian character to focus on in episode two.
4. All the husband characters are as bland and uninteresting as saltines. Perhaps to demonstrate how fiery and awesome the women are?
5. Breastfeeding irregularities that could have been easily remedied by consulting a few women who have actually breastfed?? So many things that make you say, ""that's not how it works "" or ""that wouldn't happen"". When a kid is supposedly 9 months, dramatic pumping is not a big issue. You can do it like once at work, you're not rushing to the pump room every two hours like with a newborn. You also don't really leak anymore, and in case you do, you always have breast pads.
6. I think they used babies of different ages thinking no one would notice. It's definitely annoying when you know developmental stages and milestones well and the babies they are holding and talking about are well past or not even close.
7. Working mom support group is not where these irreverent women would ever go. It exists to make the other women sound like whiny, rigid miquetoast.
8. There are too many character inconsistencies that are so distracting, you start to not be able to focus on the storyline. They are supposedly highly successful, but exhibit behavior so unprofessional and erratic it borders on being fireable.
a. The realtor who speaks of death with buyers and dunks her head in the pool during a showing to get a taste for drowning.
b. Corporate Kate with her inexplicably loud and profane ringtone that repeatedly goes off with the board, crying over work dinners and is late to every meeting. Yet, they say she is ""so good"" they want to promote her on her first week back? Based on what?
c. The therapist who is unable to see her own daughter's destructive behavior.
d. The Asian lady who is supposedly so meek she *raises her hand* to speak at the women's group, then conducts a private activity while pumping milk in an unlocked room at work?After being uncontrollably ""moved"" by an emailed erotica? Then she uses a confrontational meeting with her new boss to leverage power over him? From submissive mouse to she-dragon?",/review/rw7232540/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2021,bisslestefan,5," Season 5 Ruined It
","Was a funny, intelligent, at times Sex in the City rip off that made you laugh. In strolls Season 5 dripping with cliché stereotypes and PC nonsense that targets a certain audience at the expense of being overall relatable and entertaining. Watch 1-4 and if you're having a ""Traditional Tuesday Brunch"", you can stomach season 5.",/review/rw7232540/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2021,kmagers-48514,5," Went downhill
","I really enjoyed the first 4 seasons of this show. They were fun and easy going but then season 5 came along and it just got way too political and predictable and it made me despise it. I just want to laugh and enjoy a show, not get politics shoved down my throat.",/review/rw7232540/?ref_=tt_urv
