18 June 2022,WatchAndSmile,8," Great Feel Good Movie
","Very good movie and cast. All actors did an excellent job. The trailer sums it up, if it's your cup of tea, you will enjoy it. It has love story, humor, adventure, suspense and evil.",/review/rw8269788/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2022,liggett-00649,9," What a refreshing movie!
","First new movie in a long long looonnngg time that I throughly enjoyed. Great actors playing believable characters, that you liked, and were just decent human beings. No guns, no sex, no CGI showing totally improbably stunts, no cheating husbands or wives, no child actors who were paying cute and only one bad guys that could be excused because he is just young and that you hope may have learned a lesson in being a decent person. Great story based on something that really happened. If you are tired of all the crap that's being put out by Hollywood and yearn for a good old fashioned movie with a wonderful story this is for you.",/review/rw8269788/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2022,gab-67599,10," !Great Story!
","This was a beautifully told story with so much heart. I could only WISH for ppl like Jerry & Marge in my life! For this story to be really close to the REAL life story, made it even better. I am sure this will not have the same effect on a younger group of watchers. But for me and my mom on a movie night it was perfect! I am sad for them that one bad Harvard egg spoiled the whole bunch! They could have kept living their dream for more years if their were not any spoilers! At least they got to do what they wanted and help the ppl that mattered to them the most. As always Cranston is an amazing actor in this and completely believable! I will definitely be watching this one again, great feel good movie, not many of those now a days.",/review/rw8269788/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2022,balthesaur,8," Cute little heartwarming story
","'Jerry and Marge Go Large' is the retelling of real life story of lottery winners, Jerry and Marge Selbee (played by Bryan Cranston and Annette Benning, respectively) who find a loophole in a lottery game that guarantees winning if they buy enough tickets. Together, they start a small investment firm and gather enough capital to win nearly $27Million, all while helping their town return to its glory days.",/review/rw8269788/?ref_=tt_urv

",How could you not like this movie. Original story...great acting .Beats most of the crap out there. Highly recommend. Watch !!! ...You won't regret it.,/review/rw8269788/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2022,ramo140,8," A light and charming movie
","Bryan Cranston and Annette Bening are brilliant in this small but charming film about a retiree gaming the lottery. Although the movie isn't very funny and the stakes are quite low for the characters, the story is interesting enough to make it engaging.",/review/rw8269788/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2022,steadypaceswinsallraces,9," Wow!! Was Not Expecting That!!
",This movie appeared on my home screen of my Paramount app and I clicked on it without looking it up or doing any research which is unusual for me because usually before I watch any movie I want to know what other people thought of it so I don't waste my time on a stinker. But I rolled the dice with this one and watched it without looking at the reviews first or knowing anything about it at all. The payoff on this was big. Because within the hour and 36 minutes that this film is in length is one of the sweetest most human comedies I've seen in years. Well up there with some of my more memorable favorites like patch Adams or Batteries Not Included. This is one of those movies that will stick with you long after the credits have rolled. And definitely one of the best movies about the golden years that have come along in a long time maybe even since bucket list. I would highly recommend not missing this movie it is well worth the time and it's a great movie to watch if you're depressed because it will lift your spirits by the end. Because even though the story is about lottery tickets at the heart of it it's more of a movie about human relationships and have one man's act of kindness can change an entire town.,/review/rw8269788/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2022,redbaron-86192,8," Not Enough Films Like This
","Steller acting, heartwarming story. No gunfights, no explosions or CGI, just a good story well told. Not enough films like this these days. Bryan Cranston and Annette Bening are perfect for the roles and are superb. Loved the comic relief from Rainn Wilson and Michael McKean's understated performance is very good. Excellent all around.",/review/rw8269788/?ref_=tt_urv

18 June 2022,hobogirl-39603,8," A break from breaking bad
",Great movie for us older folks. The fact that it's loosely based on what happened is the reason I wanted to see this movie. Most of the movies today have so many CGI scenes to make up for a lack of a story line.,/review/rw8269788/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2022,dan_slentz,7," Feel Good Movie! Great Story & Acting!
","Excellent movie loosely based on a real life event of a couple who figured out one lottery game had much better ""winnable"" odds. WHY some people rate movies like this a 9 or 10 truly makes me wonder WHAT they think a BIG movie (Gone with the Wind, Star Wars, Wizard of Oz, Forest Gump, Titanic, The Ten Commandments) should be rated? Though a sweet story and great acting, visually it's not a ""major feature motion picture"" deserving of a 8, 9 or 10. It's really worth seeing, and I'd give it a pretty solid 7 rating.",/review/rw8269788/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,7," A cute and fun true story film.
","It's nothing revolutionary as a film, nor will it win any awards, but I'm sure you'll remember the story, as its real-life events are amazing and unique. But even at only 96 min runtime, it felt too bloated with cliched filler, and the substance stretched out to the max. It'll be the casting and performances that hold your attention, especially Cranston and Wilson. I found Bening's character to be too aloof and cliched. The filmmakers should've cut this one down to a max 60 min TV-length movie, because even with the great casting, many of the scenes felt dragged out to the point you could fast-forward, and not miss a thing. The ending credits where they show photos of the real Selbee's was a nice touch. It's a fun one time watch, and a 7/10 from me.",/review/rw8269788/?ref_=tt_urv

","Did I win the lottery on this perfect score ? Given it's based on a true story, it deserves the jackpot for pure humanity. Great cast, wonderful chemistry. This event clearly shows what an errant Harvard can churn out once in a roll down aka Wall Street Enron types. What puzzled me was why weren't the character, Tyler, weren't reported to the authorities or FBI for hacking, intimidation, collusion and cyber threats and crimes? That would have had easily booted him out of the way. Whichever way, it felt good knowing that all that good in the movie was real and not just reel. And trust our good ole BBB, Breaking Bad Bryan, to use academics to win big again, this time with a happy ending for all. Takeaeay= Go ace that education-Pronto!",/review/rw8269788/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2022,planktonrules,8," A very sweet little movie.
","""Jerry & Marge Go Large"" is a film based on a true story. However, since I couldn't find a ton about the real life Jerry and Marge Selbee, I have no idea how closely it sticks to the facts. What isn't in dispute is that Jerry was an ordinary sort of guy who has just retired. However, he has a real way with mathematics and statistics and one day he reads a flier about the state lottery. He notices a flaw in the state's math...and realizes you CAN play a certain lottery game and statistically always come out aheard. Unfortunately, his state's game soon changes....but it is the same old game in Massachusetts...so he and Marge begin trekking back and forth there from Michigan...and they keep winning. Apparently, the Selbees weren't 100% greedy AND what they were doing was legal....and so they cut their entire small town in on their scheme. Soon they were making millions. What's next? See the film.",/review/rw8269788/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2022,caseypthompson,10," Who would give this a low review?
","There aren't many 'feel good' movies out there these days. Everything is drama, horror or action with ridiculous amounts of CGI. Not many movies being made with good plots with interesting characters and something that leaves you smiling.",/review/rw8269788/?ref_=tt_urv

26 December 2022,JohnRayPeterson,8," A feel good movie that should make anyone feel good
","At Christmas I wanted to watch a feel-good non Christmas movie; I've had my fill of Christmas movies at my age so I remembered an article about a true story a friend had sent me a link to a while back and which I was told was made into a movie. Sure enough, the true story of Gerald and Marjorie Selbee published in the Huffington Post, a very detailed article, some time ago, was indeed set to a flic in which the main characters were played by actors I really like. Bryan Cranston and Annette Bening play Jerry and Marge in this movie. They both make their characters feel very real, and of course as sympathetic as could be. Based on everything I read about these two Michigan residents, they were/are undoubtedly sympathetic.",/review/rw8269788/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2022,silverpinkcity,5," Way too fluffy and cute, but sort of fun to watch once.
","I was really looking forward to this movie! And then? I was a little disappointed. I was hoping for a fun sneaky sort of ""edgy"" vibe, which it had...at first. But only in the very beginning. Then it devolved into a sort of mushy cute warm fuzzy family-first Hallmark channel vibe.",/review/rw8269788/?ref_=tt_urv

20 June 2022,Nightmarelogic,7," Cute based on true life movie
",Look this is a cute movie. If that isn't your thing then so be it. It is a simple idea based on real life about a retired couple that used a flaw in a states lotto game to win millions for themselves and the small town they lived in. If you are looking for Breaking Bad action this won't be the movie for you. If anything it is a Disneyeque movie about a town coming together to beat the odds.
