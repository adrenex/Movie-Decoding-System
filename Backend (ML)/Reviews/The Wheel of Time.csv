29 December 2021,kshutch-16590,6," Who is the intended audience?
","Seems that most book-to-show projects either aim to please the readers or the new watchers...and that is generally ok. If the aim is the readers, stay true to the material to bring it to life. If the aim is the watchers, use devices to thoroughly explain the plot and make it easy to follow. I feel like they missed the mark here. This is not aimed at readers because its missing a lot, changes elements, and does not have the same feel as the books. Its not aimed at the watchers because its moving to fast for newcomers to understand and in a seemingly boring fashion.",/review/rw7804778/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2021,Athanatos173,6," And So the Wheel Turns
","To start with, I have read the series of books and although they were not perfect, they were highly enjoyable and epic in their scale.",/review/rw7804778/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2021,cloetehenri,6," Decent as a TV fantasy series, poor as a The Wheel of Time adaption
","As a big fan of the books, I've always been of the opinion that The Wheel of Time (WoT) would be impossible to adapt for TV, mostly due to the huge scale of the story. It was therefore with great scepticism that I received news about the Amazon TV adaptation some years ago. However, as I learned more about the project, I actually became very hopeful that this might be something good, considering that the show runner, Rafe Judkins, is a big fan of the books and that Amazon was putting a lot of money into this for a first season. Therefore, against my better judgement, I went into this with pretty high expectations - and was ultimately left pretty disappointed.",/review/rw7804778/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2022,yousefnada-72311,," Very bad
",When I saw the frist two episodes of this tv-show I felt that I was wasting my time ... I don't like the story and the Cast is not good but I like the music of this tv-show.,/review/rw7804778/?ref_=tt_urv

24 December 2021,priyesh221292,6," Meh....
","I really wanted to like it and even after the bias i can only give it 6/10 . Cast is really felt flat and i dont know why in every scene there should be mix of 1 Chinese , 1 arab ,1 Black and 1 White . If u want diversity , u can show a whole kingdom of Chinese/Arabs/europeans but it this mix looks so forced in the name of equality.",/review/rw7804778/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2021,aboalhyjaa,8," 3 episodes in..
",I watched the first episode and that made me understand why Amazon streamed the first 3. Because obviously one episode is not enough for this kind of shows. But after watching the second and the third i cant say they're enough either.,/review/rw7804778/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2021,fcc_amccaleb,6," The books have me hooked. But not the show.
","Maybe it's because I haven't read all the books yet (still working on it) and they are taking short cuts to plot points further on in the series, but the show is so far off from the first book that I barely recognize it. It started to come back to the book towards the end but then the season finale blew that up. The way it ended in the book was so much better.",/review/rw7804778/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2021,OneAnjel,8," So far a bit choppy and incoherent but some worthwhile scenes
","Wow, only 3 episodes and over 900 reviews. So, sure, I'll chime in. I love fantasy series. I don't read books much (anymore) unless they're related to biography, documentary, science, health, etc. So when I want to be entertained I turn to film. I love the classics like Merlin, Legend of the Seeker, Lord of the Rings. But honestly, anyone who is comparing Wheel of Time to any of these is an absolute rookie and needs to stop talking. WOT is Amazon's GOT? Please. Are those the only 2 series you've watched until now?",/review/rw7804778/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2021,jmf_taborda,6," Sorry, but I'm just sad by how weak this turned out
","First of, I'm a relatively recent book reader, stared a year ago and I'm on book 7
Coming into this show, I had somewhat high expectations, with even though the first book being the worst of the first 7, it was still a pretty good book with such indept explanations of everything and everything was tied in such a way that kept us wondering and guessing and rooting, a fearing..
On the first Episode I understood how fast they had to move for such deep plot... But that was to be excused if they weren't gonna waste an entire Episode around a useless depressed warder and his issues.. The chacters are bland, the tone is weird because it wants to be a jolly show with dark elements and fails miserably at both, shadar logot was the biggest missed opportunity of the whole show..
The VFX and CGI of this show is simply bad, really bad! The worst I've seen in an Amazon show, let alone the one with the highest budget of them all.. everything from the creatures, the cities, everything that was soo fake and the sets in tar valon looked really cardboardy, and lets not talk about Ishamael because he just looked like a mashed potatoe. I feared for no one, i felt zero empathy, nothing of it looked reall and so one of the worst experiences of my life..",/review/rw7804778/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2022,Supermanfan-13,4," I was hoping it'd be better
",After watching the first season the first word that comes to mind is disappointing. I was really hoping for better. I'm a big fan of sci-fi and fantasy so I was really looking forward to this. I know it's hard to adapt a great book into a great series but I still had hope that it would be watchable. I do admit that the visuals here are incredible. It seems to me that most of the people who dislike this are really die hard fans who don't like that the changed some things up from the books. I've never been one to mind when a show or movie has to change up a few things from the original source material because I know they have to adapt it for tv/movies and that's hard to do. As long as it's entertaining I'm ok with it but I get why some people may not be. But this is not that entertaining.,/review/rw7804778/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2021,lucabartolozzi,8," Worth watching, interesting and catching
","1) I haven't read the books, so I don't care about those disappointed watchers.",/review/rw7804778/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2021,DLochner,6," Wheel of Boredom
","The beginning is tough and slow. You hardly understand the connections, but over time the story at least picks up a bit of speed and tension. A little Lord of the Rings and a little Game of Thrones but none of that right. You can see it, but you don't have to. Excruciatingly boring.",/review/rw7804778/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2021,FishBibble,2," If you are going to make Wheel Of Time then make Wheel Of Time, not some other trash...
","The best source material really any show could hope for, and what is the first thing they do, change it all, change the characters, the way they behave, then changed the settings which were so amazing in the books, changed the dialogue to the point that most people are bored silly. This is not Wheel Of Time.",/review/rw7804778/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2021,Venom5970,," I think and hope the rating will go up
","Yes, the show has its problems, but is has much more good than bad. I have not read the books, but I can understand why some people who have might not like it or agree with changes. However, some things have to change when switching a medium, and who knows maybe they could even benefit the show in the long run. People are really overreacting and I think fans should be happy their series even gets an adaptation, even if the story somewhat changes. If you want to experience the exact same story again, just read the books. Otherwise, take the show for what it is and don't hate it on it for doing things different because it hasn't been given enough time to justify those changes. I do think the rating of the show will go up as there is a lot of 1 star ratings from book fans that are really weighing it down unfortunately. Solid 8/10 for me so far, and I am eagerly awaiting more!",/review/rw7804778/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2021,gnc6971,10," LOVE It! Can't wait to see the rest!
","I am a huge fan of the Wheel of Time book series and couldn't believe my eyes when I saw this was being made! I was a little bit worried that I might be too critical of it and wouldn't be satisfied however good it was, but fortunately, I was wrong- lol. I read The Eye of the World back when it first came out and was excited how it all came rushing back to me as the show went on. I noticed a couple of differences from the book, but that's normal. I don't exactly know why they do that, making changes to the show when the books are perfect as they were, but that's Hollywood- lol. I knew Perrin's girl was going to have to die early, unfortunately, I don't remember her being mentioned in the book at all, but Perrin would never have left if she weren't killed off, so she had to go. Also, Rand and Egwene was a relationship I had hopes for when I read the books but it never actually materialized as they both ended up with others a few books in. I kind of like the twist here, tho, it shows they do have love for each other but are being pulled in different directions. I was a little bummed we didn't see Thom Merrilin at the Two Rivers, but fortunately he's introduced before the end of the first 3 shows. And I can't wait to see Loial. I wonder how he'll look? And Lanfear and the Forsaken? Even now things are still rushing back to me! It was great to see Michael McElhatten can raise at least one normal fantasy son, as opposed to that lunatic Ramsay Bolton- lol! Also glad to see Salli Richardson- Whitfield is involved, I am also a huge Eureka nerd! And, of course, Rosamund Pike! She looks a little different from the books but she makes an excellent Moiraine. The girls all seem a little different than I pictured in the books, but this is fine! It took me 25ish years to realize Nynaeve isn't pronounced Nin A Ev lol, so I'm learning things even I didn't know here! Anyway, I'm in this for the long haul, so I can't wait to see the rest! And if you're reading this, PLEASE spread the word, post on your social media, tell all your friends to watch this, I want to see the entire book series brought to life, don't let it get cancelled prematurely! SPREAD THE WORD!",/review/rw7804778/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2022,SithHunter,6," Are the characters trash humans on purpose?
","I pretty much hate every character in the show, everybody is a grumpy entitled little Sht. I'm not rooting for anybody, all the dragon born people are the worst and I wish they would all be killed off.",/review/rw7804778/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2021,thahirkhan-19241,9," Surprisingly entertaining to watch
","Let's get the minuses out of the way. Clearly, heavily influenced by Lord of the Rings, especially the ""Twin Towers"" book (so not copying ""Game of Thrones"". The 4 characters who ""might be the dragon reborn"", are fairly boring.",/review/rw7804778/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2021,TheVictoriousV,6," The Light illumine us
","Though I was extremely worried the Amazon adaptation of the Wheel of Time series -- now streaming in Ultra HD -- would prove far too rushed to do the size and scope of its world justice, it's about time we got a reimagining of something where very little needs to be changed to appease modish attitudes and political narratives. Was this so hard, guys? We finally have a situation where the social studies majors AND the metathesiophobic nerds get to be happy!",/review/rw7804778/?ref_=tt_urv

13 October 2022,DiCaprioFan13,3," Disappointing
","I never read the books for The Wheels of Time so I didn't know what to expect but the trailers looked pretty good so I gave it a chance. Also, after listening to all the people who actually read the books and the hype that was surrounding the show I was expecting the next Game of Thrones. It's not, I was hoping it would be better. I should have known since the reviews are so mixed but people were hyping it up for months and again the trailers were pretty good. I'm about halfway through right now and it's going to be a struggle to finish it. I know it's already been renewed for another season so hopefully it'll get better but I'm not expecting it to.",/review/rw7804778/?ref_=tt_urv

27 January 2022,karinahatem,1," This was really bad
","Don't understand the great reviews, this show is so bad, that I could barely pass beyond E5, very poor performance, weak storyline that got too many holes, every episode there new characters and storylines out of the blue, and without any explanation. The show even uses words and references that Don't make any sense.",/review/rw7804778/?ref_=tt_urv
