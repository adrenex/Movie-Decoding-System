29 November 2022,UniqueParticle,9," Excellent a little cheesy beginning I'm sure gets better
","My cousin recommended this classic awesome series figured I'd give it a try, I needed a long series to be into for awhile. I can already tell Tom Welling was perfect as Clark Kent/ legendary Superman! Micheal Rosenbaum was a unique choice role for Lex Luther he's perfect as a villain. The directing feels oldish it's heartwarming I'm gonna love the whole series I have a feeling and I'm loving the series; only thing that bugs me is some parts feel like a soap opera reality otherwise spectacular! A perfectly insightful depth to Superman packed in a perfect treat that I'm already craving from the pilot.",/review/rw3706566/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,10," Fantastic!!
","I have to admit that I'm a big Superhero fan and love the majority of the shows that are out there (of course there are some that are awful) but Smallville is absolutely, without a doubt, one of my favorites of all-time! It tells the story of Clark Kent before he became Superman and how he learns to control his powers and fight against different villains each episode. Every episode is just as exciting as the one before it and I can't say enough about Tom Welling, he was just fantastic as Clark Kent. It was on before the Superhero genre exploded but is still considered one of the better shows and it absolutely still holds up today. If you are a fan of superhero shows then I can not recommend this show enough. Do yourself a favor and go watch this!",/review/rw3706566/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2022,alekspredator87,9," The story of growing up of the most famous superhero
","""The Secrets of Smallville"" became a unique project that lasted on TV screens around the world for 10 years, giving viewers an interesting story of the formation of Superman. The series approached the creation of a whole world with special respect, where the young Clark Kent grew up and became the hero we know well. The project got better and better from season to season, expanding its mythology, carefully introducing heroes and villains known to fans of comics, introducing other interesting characters. Successful scenario solutions, beautiful and cool actors, good-quality special effects that looked good for the series - all this allowed ""Secrets"" to become a cult project, which is still remembered with special warmth today.",/review/rw3706566/?ref_=tt_urv

","My DC adaptations marathon came to Smallville, one of few shows I ever saw completely and even fewer I wanna see again. I just finished rewatching of the first season that shows high-school days of Clark Kent. Tom Welling is great playing young Clark who gradually discovers his abilities and tries to juggle between normal teen life and hiding the fact he's an alien. In first season he discovers his inhuman strength and speed, then he gradually discovers extent of his invulnerability and at the end he finds out about his X-Ray vision. The rest of his powers will come in seasons to follow. Here we meet Lex Luthor, Clark's best friend, who changes into villain in front of our eyes, partially because of his egomaniac father and partially because of distrustful treatment from everyone around him, caused by his wealth and infamous family name. There's also beautiful Kristin Kreuk, playing Lana Lang, Clark's unrealized love, and many more talented young actors. But the most impressive of all is John Glover, playing Lionel Luthor, Lex's father and main villain. Story combines typical teenage show with superhero elements, which slowly grow from season to season until they completely take over the show and change it beyond recognition. But for now special effects are at minimum and show is more teen romance drama than story about Superman. It may not be the best, but it's certainly my favorite DC show so far.",/review/rw3706566/?ref_=tt_urv

19 September 2016,MuttleyAndTheHeliumGang,," My favorite TV series of all time.
","There are more than a hundred reasons as to why I personally love this show more than any other. I could go on and on and on, the reasons are quite possibly endless. To keep it short, however, I will just go ahead and say, never in my life have I been or have felt so happy while watching a TV show. From episode one on wards I knew that this was going to be my show, you know? I just had that feeling, that particular, good feeling. I was really looking forward to watching this from the start. When I got into Smallville, it had been off TV for a while, but I used to watch random episodes here and there about ten years back - I just never found the time to get properly into it. When I did, man was I glad. It is simply the greatest series ever made, in my opinion.",/review/rw3706566/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2022,alan-50673,8," I wish there were more shows like this.
","Superheroes like animated shows, are for everyone. This show starts off slow and even if you hate superheroes you will like this. It starts with a couple desperately wanting children who find one from a spaceship. Other than rocks falling to earth and this ship there is very little scifi at the start. Martha and Jonathan are the nice farming couple looking for a child. They have no idea what else to do and raise the boy as theirs. Years later he goes to school, being a teenager named Clark. He thinks he's a normal human until some slightly weird things happen. Clark has three friends his age who go to school with him. Together they investigate weird murders. Some get connected to meteors. This is all to show he cares about saving people, one of Supermans most unique personality traits. The show focuses a lot on Clark saving people and one future villain for Superman.",/review/rw3706566/?ref_=tt_urv

21 January 2023,seattlebruin,10," Impeccable casting
","This show is great on so many levels, but none of it works without being cast right. Welling is really the best Superman we have had except MAYBE Henry Cavill. Rosenbaum IS the new Luthor we have ever had....and Erika Durance really captures the essence of Lois Lane. I could go on, but without those 3 it just doesn't work like it did.",/review/rw3706566/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2016,mjpetty7,10," The One that Started It All
","Smallville is one of those shows that many comic book fans, after a few seasons anyway, loved to hate. They complained about this or that not fitting in just right with how Superman mythology worked, and in the end they were never satisfied. But they didn't get the point of the show. Smallville isn't about Superman. It's not about superpowers. It's not about relationships or about superheroes. Smallville is, and always was, about growing up. Starting off with Clark Kent in high school and sending him off getting married to Lois Lane, Smallville is ten years of finding your way.",/review/rw3706566/?ref_=tt_urv

","When I first heard of the idea behind Smallville, I rolled my eyes and thought that is the dumbest idea ever. I mean, who wants to see Superman as a teen? Well after seeing it, I can say I sure as hell do. It has been a long time since I have been glued to the TV screen, waiting anxiously to see what will happen next. The reason this show is so good is because you already know the characters. Unless you were born yesterday, you know the story of Superman, you know who Lex Luther is. Superman is a permanent pop culture icon, like Batman. When I watched this show, I already knew these characters, it was so simple to get into this show. The WB must have dished out the big bucks for this show because for TV, the special FX were amazing. Everything about this show is pure gold, I know I will tune in every week, and watch one of the best shows on TV.",/review/rw3706566/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2001,TxMike,," The TV series we Superman fans have been waiting for.
","""Smallville"" is an excellent idea for a TV series. I am one of those who grew up in the 1950s with Superboy and Superman comics. I loved the Superman films with Chris Reeves. I loved the ""Lois and Clark"" TV series. But this one, which chronicles Clark Kent's high school life, the period when he began to realize the extent of his super powers, and began to see his life's mission, has not been depicted before, as far as I can recall. They've done it extremely well, and the actors are very fitting for the parts. And, naturally, good always prevails over evil.",/review/rw3706566/?ref_=tt_urv

18 May 2003,Old Joe,," This show will take you up, up and away', in a modern kind of way!
","As a fan of the superman legend for many years, I waited in anticipation for the new TV series , Smallville'. I have been richly rewarded by it, as we now get to see how difficult life must have been for Kal-el', as an American teenager. Although we never get to see the super-being' fly around in his tights and cape, he is a fascinating character to watch, as he comes to terms with who he is and what he can do. This is the tale of a teenage Clark Kent in the days before he was Superman.",/review/rw3706566/?ref_=tt_urv

8 October 2020,m-47826,7," For non fans of the genre, like me.
","The thing I loved the most about this show, was how it managed to stay away from the cheesiness of its super hero theme aspect. It was mostly a re-reading of Roswell, with Buffy and Charmed monster of the week formula. And it worked. You even have all these up-and-coming TV and movie stars starting out. Which is why season 1 through 4 are those I enjoy rewatching the most. The fact that it is filled with Pop/Rock gems of that time, and Mark Snow's score, helps a lot too. Then the main plot said seasons touched upon started developing, and that's where I began to lose interest, as I felt the cheesy super hero vibe pouring through. And I wasn't wrong. Season 5 to 7 start becoming more about comic book stuffs than characterizations. And the rest of the series is just what I feared it would be. The kind of mindless thing CW is force feeding us lately. With plots only DC universe fans can enjoy. I guess it's a no win situation, as people like me only enjoy the first half and genre fans do the rest. Aside from my personal opinion on this series, I can acknowledge its quality writing and acting. And despite its flaws, it's still a superior show to everything of the same kind made afterwards.",/review/rw3706566/?ref_=tt_urv

","The story of a young Clark Kent/Superman tells us how clark discovers his past and see how he also faces him his friendship with lex is literally brilliant his symbolism development and writing is fantastic many do not see that and should pay attention to those details BECAUSE PLEASE DO IT They also gave us the best cast and the best characters Jonathan, Martha, Lex, Jimmy, Pett, Clark because if Tom Welling is the best superman many say that he is not because he did not wear the suit or because he was a young clark but friends literally His altruism and symbolism were always marked and apart from that, he is the most powerful superman, the perfect balance.

12 May 2017,Kingslaay,8," The best Superman adaptation I have seen
",Smallville was captivating from the start. The background and early years of Clark Kent as he evolved into Superman is both unique and great viewing. We can see so many other aspects to the future superhero and the producers have room to grow ideas and other characters. This long running show was so well received because of good character development and great story lines. Even though he wasn't superman we saw him save the day usually every time some new problem or force arose. The special effects deserve special praise especially when showing Clark's super powers and other supernatural effects. I felt Smallville breathed new life into the Superman franchise and gave it a great new outlook and spin.,/review/rw3706566/?ref_=tt_urv
