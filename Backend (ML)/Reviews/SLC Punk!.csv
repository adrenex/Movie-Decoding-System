10 November 2001,tcbaker,10," Incredible!
","I saw this movie for the first time tonight and I must admit, I wasn't expecting much but it left me almost crying in the end, and recommending it to all of my family and friends. I don't claim to know what the 80s punk scene was like, especially in Utah, but regardless of whether punk life was portrayed correctly or not in this movie (I think most of you who bitch about that aspect wouldn't know anyway), it was written extremely well and the acting was just incredible.",/review/rw0513015/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2004,heat95pd,," Matthew Lillard's best role
","This film is about anarchy and the whole 1980's punk rock scene with references to many early punk bands such as Sex Pistols and The Ramones.  If you're expecting this to be another Matthew Lillard teen flick, you are greatly mistaken.  Sure it has its funny parts, but mainly this film survives on great acting by Lillard and Michael Goorjian.  Lillard and Goorjian's characters believe that they are the only ""true"" punk rockers in Salt Lake City, Utah and go about their lives liberating against conformity. Their characters, like every punk, need to be different and their main focus in life really is anarchy.  Film would have suffered if not for the casting of Lillard and his narration throughout the film was another plus. I recommend seeing it because it is something far different than anything Matthew Lillard has ever done.",/review/rw0513015/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2001,Miles-10,8," Excellent quirky slice o life
","I did not expect much from this movie and was pleasantly surprised, and having been to Salt Lake City a few times, I was particularly amused. I was there in 1980, at the outset of the decade in which the movie takes place. That visit turned out to be the one and only time I set foot in a disco club. It is a good thing I didn't run into Stevo and Bob, the twin protagonists of ""SLC Punk!"" They would have kicked my butt because they hate mods, hippies and rednecks. Whether or not to pound on a disco-goer wouldn't even be a question. At one point, Bob asks a British punk band's lead singer why he would never come back to SLC. ""Too bleeding violent,"" says the bruised singer. ""Thank you!"" says Bob.",/review/rw0513015/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2000,JohnSeal,9," Outstanding fictional take on punk rock
","Anyone who has spent time in the American punk underground will find many points of reference in SLC Punk. The film is an amazingly realistic portrayal of the suburban punk subculture. All the issues are here: poseurs, sell outs, authenticity, straight edge, rebellion, boredom...and of course the perennial problem of whether mods and punks can get along! I can't recommend this gem strongly enough.",/review/rw0513015/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 1999,TeaBunny,," deep, moving, fun
","Matthew Lillard - what a surprise! I have always found him to be annoying, but in this film he was likeable and quite clever. ""Stevo"" is the blue-haired punk son of silly, over-hippified parents who went from mohawk to a more low-key look after graduation. He is obviously not stupid. He uses his audience-addressing monologues to amuse us and let us know exactly what's up, instead of merely whining at us or grinning and nudging us with his elbow. The kid is downright charming. And I appreciate the fact that he actually gets along with his parents, even while fighting against what they want. It's refreshing. I am in his age group (in the movie - 80's teenager) but I am not familiar with punk lifestyle, and now I feel like I have been exposed to something I've always found interesting, but never delved into before. Stevo goes through a bunch of changes and realizations, and by the end decides that you can ""F--k stuff up more from within the system that outside it"". And that being rebellious comes from inside, and not from your haircolor (even though blue hair is still cool). Great message, neat movie. Recommended.",/review/rw0513015/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2001,votequentin,10," MUCH better than the box says
","If you pick this up at the video store, you'll probably expect the wrong thing: kind of a goofy, teen-oriented, mock angst trip by a couple of overdone punks through Salt Lake City's holy land. That's not even close to the heart of this film, which is smarter and more vital than most.",/review/rw0513015/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2022,NCRodriguez,10," Incredible performance from Matthew Lilliard

1 October 2005,Gordon_123,9," Superb - But this movie is not about punk or anarchy
","I just viewed and enjoyed this movie a lot. Not everything was great all the time, but in general it is a great work. The talk at the Mall near the beginning about the origin of punk etc is hilarious!!!",/review/rw0513015/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2021,hugagun,10," Heartfelt, and honest portrayal of the punk scene in BFE America.
","There is a lot of good that can be said about this movie. If you're in, or have been in the punk rock scene then a lot of this movie will resonate with you.",/review/rw0513015/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2021,shawnmikedryer,9," Punk at its finest
","Set in the early/mid 80's during the dawn of Punk Rock Music. Stev-o and Heroin Bob are your typical anarchist punks only problem is they live in Salt Lake City, Utah, a very religiously oppressive city where the locals look at punks as only devil worshippers. The film chronicles an entire day in the life of a punk, the realism is unmatched as the film is also guided by the narration of Stev-o who gives us a somewhat rational take on anarchist kids morals and intentions. Believe it or not Bob, Stev-o & Mike were College graduates that have loving families with successful careers. All had the urge to rebel against a system the only way the knew how, waste their college minds in order to keep this new found party going in hopes forever. Unfortunately all things comes to an end and in the case of sex, drugs, & rock and roll, it ends how it started, crashing and burning.",/review/rw0513015/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2002,LebowskiT1000,7," Not bad, but not great either.
","I thought SLC Punk! was an alright movie, but nothing terribly exciting.  It has a somewhat interesting story and has some pretty good acting.  There were a few times where the filming absolutely drove me insane (for instance near the beginning of the film, when Heroin-Bob is standing up and talking to Stevo while Stevo is laying on the ground looking up at him).  The way it was filmed was just awful, there was way too many film cuts that shouldn't have been there.  I can't figure out what kind of effect the director was trying to get there, but it just angered me.  I don't think it's a good idea if you're paying more attention to the editing than the dialog that's being said.  Anyhow, there wasn't a lot of this kind of filming, so it didn't bother me enough to ruin my movie-watching experience.",/review/rw0513015/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2001,Graffin,10," This movie will change your life!
","It's unfortunate that more people have not seen this movie.  Well at least people in the 15-28 age range, that is.  If you have ANY interest in punk rock and the attitude that comes along with it, you have to see this movie. If you have ever wanted to just tell the world to F*** off, then this is a movie you should see.  Granted, it's not for everyone, there are those who may not be able to look past the language and violence, but that's what being punk is all about.  I was very impressed by Matthew Lillard in this movie, his performance in the ending of this movie shows just how good a dramatic actor he can be, too bad he's typecast in all those teen movies, not that he isn't great in them.",/review/rw0513015/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2001,Frequency270,7," Not what I expected.

13 January 2021,thesupershadow,8," A philosophical cult classic
","Out of all the films featuring anarchistic punk characters this one has to be my best, not only does it cherish the subculture but pays homage to the fact that 'punk' is more than just a uniform/dress-sense; it's a lifelong mindset that you shouldn't need to shed as you become an adult. The internal struggles of the main character were highly relatable, his journey for meaning and the core understanding of why he became a punk in the first place are timeless.",/review/rw0513015/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2008,oslane,4," if you're a punk fan before watching this movie, you will hate it!
","Sure the film is marginally entertaining but if you were into punk rock music before seeing it and are familiar at all with the culture of punks in general, then you really will feel this movie is more like a stupid hipster version of punk culture than a good comedy/drama depicting it.",/review/rw0513015/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2003,livingdeadboy999,," Awesome!!!
","SLC Punk is about Stevo (Matthew Lillard) and Heroin Bob (Micheael A. Goorjian) a couple of anarchists who hate their town and all the rules and rednecks in it. This movie was awesome, its really funny, but I wouldn't label it a comedy, its way more than that.  Everyone stupid kid who thinks their original and thinks their not a poser should go see it! One of my new favorite movies 10/10 .....last",/review/rw0513015/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2003,DarkSparkles,10," Not trying to be punk by any means, and a great movie.
","SPOILERS. The bad reviews I'm reading on the website say that the movie appeals to Hot Topic kids and Avril fans, but I'd disagree.  Mind you, I did first see the movie when I was a Hot Topic kid [Avril wasn't around yet], and I loved it. Things are different now, and I STILL love it.  This movie is not trying to define punk, nor is it trying to make its characters the most punk they can be.  Notice the quote from the end: ""In the end, we're all posers.""  Stevo reforms his life after Heroin Bob dies and he sees how f***ed up things are and how pointless all of what he's doing is.  It talks about how working the system from the inside does ""a lot more damage"", which is an incredibly good perspective that isn't seen too often in movies involving punks.  Most kids walking around with a store-bought anarchy t-shirt would yell about how they want to stay outside the system, and unfortunately they fail to see the ending and ruin the credibility for other fans of this movie.",/review/rw0513015/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2021,tneighborsu,10," Unexpected
","I came into this experience with little knowledge of the existence of this film. So it's safe to say that I had no expectations set. SLC Punk! Surprised me in the best way. It felt like a coming of age, face the music type of movie and maybe that's why I liked it so much.",/review/rw0513015/?ref_=tt_urv

19 March 2000,kejava,4," Alienated youth in search of their true calling. Who cares?
","SLC Punk reminded me of somewhat of Sid & Nancy, and somewhat of The Commitments. But not in a good way.  SLC Punk was simply not all that interesting, despite the premise of young punks in Reagan-era Salt Lake City. Their individual voyages of self-discovery (with one exception) ended where you'd expect, and the trip wasn't that interesting.",/review/rw0513015/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2004,gregitsltd,," Pretty much how it was
","I saw a review that said this movie wasn't realistic then buddy you weren't there. This movie was my life in high school, from nazi asses, to mods, rockers and hicks. All the characters were like people I knew, I guess I'm a poser because I grew out of it just like the main character but if you want to see a movie about American punks in the late 70's early 80's then this is THE movie. Most other movies are documentaries check out decline of western civilzation for this. This movie is very well written with a great soundtrack, I think there were maybe 3 songs I didn't know but all the ones I did really brought me back. I even busted out some of my old albums,,,that's right I still have 'em although not fun at the end but isn't that like life anyway. 8 out of 10 but for what it is,, it's a 10",/review/rw0513015/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2010,raulfaust,," I don't know
","Well, first I have to say that I feel I'm not qualified to rate this movie. From what I've heard about punks, ""SLC Punk"" portrayed their lifestyle faithfully, but something about it didn't entertain me. I mean, if you aren't able to watch an English language movie without subtitles, this movie won't work. The film worked kind of a documentary, and the storyteller talked too much and too fast, so you didn't have time to understand what he says, read the subtitles and analyze the scenes. And although I don't wanna live like a punk group does, I admire them for their authenticity and respect them as I would respect any other group of people. A must see for punk lovers, either to like it or not.",/review/rw0513015/?ref_=tt_urv

","I saw the trailer for this a few years ago and wasn't really intrigued.  It looked like a run-of-the mill teen flick and I just wasn't a big Matthew Lillard fan.  After one of my friends told me that I reminded him of Mike in this movie, I decided to check it out to see what he was talking about. Last night, I put this one in and was very suprised.

15 January 2000,XjwalkX,1," Punks with perfect skin: the exploited culture of SLC Punk
","I am a huge fan of punxploitation films, and usually I can get something out of them, even if they are basically bad movies. SLC Punk is one of the most unenjoyable films of ANY kind I have ever seen.  It offends me as a punk, as a film lover, and as a human being for having wasted my time watching it.  At many points just plain boring, SLC Punk is always irritating, and seems to be targeted to appeal to those with the pseudo-rebellious mentality of a spoiled 12 year old.",/review/rw0513015/?ref_=tt_urv
