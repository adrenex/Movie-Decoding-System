13 August 2014,slicedbread117,5," Missing the basics of a great TMNT movie
","Like many other people, the original 1990 ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" movie has a very special place in my childhood. Even if the movie wasn't all that great, it was fantastic for what it was trying to be. Now we're in 2014, where our beloved turtles have been given a whole new lick of paint with a straight-up reboot and have the daunting task of winning the long time TMNT faithful over. Needless to say that for the most part, I am one fan that was not entirely won over.",/review/rw3160221/?ref_=tt_urv

29 August 2015,son012189,1," A Story Written in the Corporate Boardroom!!!!
","The script for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014) was written during a corporate boardroom meeting at Paramount Studios. Like all lame, boring, stupid boardroom meetings, people (with no artistic talent) take turns blurting out the dumbest ideas. That is why we should not be giving non-artists such as MBA wallstreet types any creative control. They come up with the dumbest ideas with no respect to the source material. This movie is nothing more than a cash grab.",/review/rw3160221/?ref_=tt_urv

","That is if you don't get your childhood dreams crushed of course. And I say crushed, because if you say this ""killed"" your childhood ... well I think it would be a poor choice of words. Though I get the sentiment and the anger if one doesn't like someone tempering with their memories (especially the good one). But still this is just a movie and even if you liked the TMNT as a kid, be aware that this will not be your childhood ""heroes"" coming alive again.",/review/rw3160221/?ref_=tt_urv

","There's hardly a kid born from the 80s who has never heard of this totally bodacious group of walking, talking, pizza-eating, street-fighting reptiles.

28 November 2014,stermix501,10," avoid critics and enjoy
","I luckily avoid reading opinions before seeing a movie. This movie was a perfect entertainment for the less than 1h50 that it lasts. Although I had enjoyed watching TNMT anime when I was adolescent, I've never been a hardcore fan and it is true that I cannot spot any of the traits that other purists criticized about. What I certainly know is that it was a nice combination of Transformers/Batman/Martial-art material based on a plot that seemed solid and justified. ",/review/rw3160221/?ref_=tt_urv

","What a stinker! These Turtles are big gross slimy steroid freaks. They may crack wise and talk about pizza to appeal to fans but they're lifeless and empty shells of previous representations of the characters. Abby Elliott is wasted in a bit part as Megan Fox's roommate. She would have been a better choice for April O'Neil than the Botoxed and colorless Fox. The script isn't great but some of the material could have worked better had they cast an actress with the slightest bit of talent. But no, instead we get this vapid woman who should have faded into obscurity years ago. What the hell was Will Arnett doing in this? Oh and did anyone doubt when you first see William Fichtner that he would turn out to be a bad guy? If your answer is yes, congratulations on seeing your first movie ever. Wish it was a better one. The changes made to the backstory are unnecessary and add nothing good. Poorly acted, shallow, dumb, downbeat -- it's a crappy excuse for what should be, first and foremost, escapist entertainment. The late '80s / early '90s Turtles cartoon and movies were hardly high art but at least they had an enthusiasm about them that was fun to watch. Skip this tired garbage. It's an hour and a half I'll never get back.",/review/rw3160221/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2014,cloudsurfer,3," A Bad Movie, Not Just a Bad Turtles Movie
","Folks, it's no exaggeration when I say this one is bad. And I'm not just reviewing it as a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie. The Ninja Turtles are a lore. Every telling of the story deserves its own version, like Dracula, Sherlock Holmes, or Batman. Adam West, Michael Keaton, Christian Bale, and Ben Affleck all play different versions of Batman in different universes. Though I have a version of the Turtles I like best, I can set aside that prejudice for this review. It's just a very awful film. It's so bad, I don't understand how the current rating stands at 6 stars.",/review/rw3160221/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2018,vithiet,4," Went in with low expectations and got what I expected
","I had very low expectations and nothing else to watch in the plane, so I found it more entertaining than I thought it would be. But if you have better things to do or watch, by all means skip this one.",/review/rw3160221/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2014,PartialMovieViewer,1," The Fail is Beyond Epic
","As with most redoes, the original is so much better. The ""Turtles"" of the 90's relied heavily on snarky one-liners; likable characters and some really good humor. This move effectively discards all aforementioned attributes and glues its storyline to over-the-top CGI (typical), oh-so-very-special effects and poor lighting. Oh, and the powers-to-be smacked this chelonian trio with the un-funny stick so hard, I suggest discarding any plans for sequels. I did watch this movie and felt overwhelmed by the hum-drum boredom spewing from the screen. At first I thought all would be saved when April O'Neil entered. At least in the original, that's what happened when Judith Hoag's strong personality came on scene. Hoag's April successfully bridged the gap between real-world and sewer world, and further strengthened the brotherly bond of the turtles. I'm sorry, but Megan Fox just seemed wrong for the part. She is a very pretty woman, but she was not the right fit. I must be fare and say that it is not all her fault. These personalities of these turtles seemed much more superficial than the ones in the earlier movie(s), and that might have made her job more difficult. Anyways, like 'The Green Hornet', 'The Green Lantern', and - even 'Superman', I am over redoes. I will not watch the sequel and will try to erase this fail from my memory.",/review/rw3160221/?ref_=tt_urv

8 February 2015,Bruce722,1," The worst reboot I've ever seen.
","Jonathan Liebesman, Michael Bay, Josh Appelbaum, and anyone else involved in the casting, writing, production, or direction of the film should be beaten with their choice of a sword, a bo staff, sais, and nunchakus. I didn't think it was possible to ruin a franchise more thoroughly and absolutely than they did. Let's start from the beginning, shall we? The concept of the movie was a complete and total failure. From the introduction sequence of the film to the look and origin of the turtles and Splinter to the overall storyline to how April O'Neil's character would be integrated to the absence of other key characters (Casey Jones anyone?) to how the conflict would be established to the decision to show Shredder's face and eliminate part of the mystery behind his character... it was all bad. I would assume that after they had the preliminary blueprint for the film, they would begin the writing process. Oh man, the writing was terrible! The dialogue felt forced and disingenuous and the script made it just about impossible for any cast to save the film. The characters are not developed at all and the plot is developed even less. How about the casting decisions? Megan Fox? Really? What about Megan Fox screams April O'Neil? Nothing, that's what. Why not go for Emma Stone, Amy Adams, Isla Fisher, Emma Stone, Jessica Chastain, Christina Hendricks, Emma Stone, Karen Gillan, or Rachel Nichols to play everyone's favorite redheaded reporter? Any of them could've provided the appropriate overall look for the character and they all would have their own unique spin on the feel. Whether it be sense of humor, acting style, sensuality, etc. What they all have in common is that they all would've been a better choice than Megan Fox. Oh, and did I mention Emma Stone? Because why bother going after the one actress every single TMNT fan wanted to see in the movie when you can land a brunette with too much plastic surgery and not enough acting chops. Yeah, that makes sense. The casting decisions for the turtles was nearly as bad. Outside of Alan Ritchson (Raphael), none of the other turtles even remotely sounded like their characters and the casting of Johnny Knoxville as Leonardo may have been the worst decision of them all. So now we have a mediocre script and cast, maybe the cinematography and special effects will be good, right? Ha! That's funny. No, instead we got a combination of some of the worst shaky cam, cgi, and overall cinematography I've ever seen. Honestly, it feels almost as if some idiot studio exec gave $125 to some bums off of the street and told them to reboot this beloved franchise. Actually, no, I think they would've done a better job.",/review/rw3160221/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2014,CowherPowerForever,2," So, you're... Ninja Mutant Turtle Teenagers?
","After years of trying to bring this franchise back to the big screen, Michael Bay and his company, Platinum Dunes was able to do it. Sadly, the effort was just as sad most of the recent Michael Bay films. Without Bay behind the camera on this project, we are left with an even worse story(if that is possible), and just awful action.

","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, a series that holds a special place in my heart, as well as the hearts of many people. Ever since the heroes and the half shells entered our homes decades ago, fans have enjoyed outrageous jokes, comical fights, and colorful creatures to face up against our noble four. So when Michael Bay announced his plans to produce a new film to modernize the Turtles, mixed reviews poured in about what was in store. The evening has dawned, and once again I've gone back to the hallowed halls of the movie theater to bring you a review. Was Bay's latest project another prolonged mess, or did we get a turtle adventure worth seeing? Read on to find out. ",/review/rw3160221/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2014,quincytheodore,3," This is not froth in coffee, it's that white stuff that accumulates at corners of your mouth when you're really thirsty
","There's a certain level of absurdity in movies that I'm willing to overlook. Some may have convenience timing or occurrence, but TMNT has gone beyond any hope of logical salvation, it discarded any plausibility or decent common sense in that matter, and opted for samurai robot and explosion. I knew it was going to do that, but apparently my expectation was still too high. One of the characters embodies Michael Bay's philosophy, saying that knowing what people like is good, like froth in coffee. Well, this movie doesn't even resemble that, it's that white stuff that accumulates at corners of your mouth when you're really thirsty.",/review/rw3160221/?ref_=tt_urv

","When we are children, there is a toy we love above all others, that is a holy grail of imagination and enjoyment. For me that was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I loved the TV and toys so much, and the films still hold a special place in my heart. So here we have a reboot, This will not end well. OK, let me get over my own personal hang ups towards the film straight away. It's not the Turtles I knew and loved, it's not the same premise, it's not the same message ideas and for this reason alone the film should not be watched or tolerated by anyone. Ever. I can't guarantee this side of me won't return later in this review but for now, I'm going to try and judge Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as best I can without bringing in my personal feelings for the product. The Turtles Movie Is a film that attempts to have it's cake and eat it. It wants the integrity and prestige of the original movies and cartoons, but it wants massive set pieces and unoriginal thinking. That's the main problem with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, we have seen it all before. There is nothing to make the movie stand out and be proud of itself, I mean in truth there is nothing horrifically wrong with it enough to make me angry, but considering what the film had to work with I just wanted something more remarkable.",/review/rw3160221/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2014,marc5477,1," Why are these people allowed to make movies?
",The good news is that this is better than the last turtles movie. The bad news is the last turtles movie was horrendous. The title should tell it all. I really don't understand how certain people retain their jobs in Hollywood. The only reason this movie is afloat is due to legacy. It could have been written by kindergartners and it would have performed just as well. Might as well let someone new have a shot instead of paying these idiots for doing average or below work.,/review/rw3160221/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2014,billygoat1071,5," Hinting The Real Joy
","No matter how the name Michael Bay is attached to a fantasy adaptation, people will complain anything about the project. But as a producer, does it affect much to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles? Surprisingly yes. As the same as the public response about the Transformers franchise, people turned out to be ranting at the wrong stuff. At the post-viewing, maybe we can accept the heavy reliance to cartoony CGI, or the large amount of explosions, or the really poor plot. The real sin of these movies is its lack of interest to its main heroes and instead focuses on the human characters. Which is a shame, because it somewhat gets it right with the turtles, their stories are more interesting than the one we ended up seeing. The film does have some rewarding moments, but it just keeps hindering us to the less interesting parts which makes it disappointing.",/review/rw3160221/?ref_=tt_urv
