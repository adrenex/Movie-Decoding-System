","I enjoyed this movie immensely.  This is one of the best examples of storytelling that I have seen.  The structure of the movie - alternating between the past and present, with multiple intertwining plots - keeps the viewer hooked on how the story will unfold.  It unfolds gracefully and is enjoyable throughout.",/review/rw0294329/?ref_=tt_urv

18 March 2006,screenman,10," As good as it gets.
","This movie might easily pass you by. It's quirky, long-winded title suggests something arty or perhaps comical in a needlessly pretentious way. Well; it is arty, and it is often funny, but there isn't a particle of pretentiousness. I got to see it only because my newspaper included it as a free DVD in the weekend issue. But for that, I might still be in ignorance now.",/review/rw0294329/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2017,davispittman,10," Comfort food in the form of a film
","Fried green tomatoes serves up a serving of feel good entertainment, heartfelt moments, female empowerment, and important messages. This film tells the powerful story of Kathy Bates and Jessica Tandy in 1991. Kathy's character meets Tandy's character in a rest home while Kathy's husband is visiting his sick aunt. They quickly form a very special friendship and Jessica begins to tell Kathy stories about two women from years ago. Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary Louise Parker come in then, idgie and Ruth. Kathy starts to get inspired by the stories of idgie and Ruth and she starts to change her life for the better, getting into shape, improving her dull marriage with her husband, and becoming less scared to be herself and speak her mind. The stories told about idgie and Ruth involve going through tragedy, becoming lifelong friends and being there for each other. The performances in this sweet southern film are outstanding! Tandy and Bates are riveting and a joy to watch. Masterson and Parker have incredible on screen friend chemistry and their acting is nothing short of amazing, it's raw and real, you believe every thing they do and say. Cicely Tyson is good here too, a very brave and fearless character. The movie offers up great performances from the entire cast, very well written dialogue, heartwarming stories and a great score. The ending makes me cry happy tears every freaking time! 10/10.",/review/rw0294329/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2003,Ouarda,10," The Story Stays With You Long After the Movie Ends
","This is one of my top five films of all time.  I was somewhat skeptical the first time I saw it because I adored the book and I knew there were some changes, but I found the essence of Fannie Flagg's fabulous novel in tact. This is a story that burrows into your heart and mind and stays there.  It is absolutely magical storytelling with a stellar cast and beautifully written characters that never fade from memory.",/review/rw0294329/?ref_=tt_urv

","I am running out of words to describe how good Fried Green Tomatoes was. It may be two or three minutes too long, but other than that, there is very little wrong with this film. The film is amazing to look at, with gorgeous scenery and cinematography, and the score was beautiful. Fried Green Tomatoes also has an intelligent and heart-warming story, strong direction and some charming, funny and touching dialogue as well. The ending was suitably uplifting, but I admit I did shed a tear, mostly because I was so impressed by how beautiful the film was.",/review/rw0294329/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2006,gradyharp,10," An Old Friend of a Movie
","There are films that linger in memory for the warmth they exude and the impression they leave. So it is with the now 15 year old film FRIED GREEN TOMATOES based on the novel 'Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe' by Fannie Flagg and arranged for the screen by that author. This is a film that explores racism, feminism, respect for the elderly, women's rights, and so very much more in a manner that is infectious to watch repeatedly and defies forgetting.",/review/rw0294329/?ref_=tt_urv

","I must admit. When I first heard of this movie many years ago, the title didn't sound that appealing and the few scenes that I saw didn't look very interesting. But what can I say? I was little then and didn't know what I was missing. My mother kept telling me how good of a movie this was, but I was just too stubborn and didn't pay attention. It was only a few months ago that I decided to watch it when it appeared on TV and boy was I surprised!!",/review/rw0294329/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is such an awesome movie.  I remember watching it as a girl, and when I found it in a clearance bin a few months ago, I jumped on it. I watched it then, and now, having watched it again...  Mary Stuart Masterson is AMAZING. Tears fall unwittingly down my cheeks during her performance.  I was also enchanted by Mary-Louise Parker, and I always always LOVE Kathy Bates. Jessica Tandy is also her usual fit self, and Cecily Tyson was great (""Shoo! I ain't scared of you!"") and I could go on for ages about all of them.",/review/rw0294329/?ref_=tt_urv

22 October 2012,robert-temple-1,10," An authentic classic
","I have just seen this wonderful film for the third time, after many years, and it is such a classic, and has not lost any of its interest or appeal. Indeed, it is more relevant now than it ever was, considering that it is about the plight of women and how they cope with their various life situations. It is based on a novel, and has a screenplay by, Fannie Flagg. It is set in Alabama where she comes from, and the story presumably has some basis in truth. Not many people know that Fannie Flagg used to be a brilliant comedienne. I knew her in the mid 1960s when she was a stand-up comic, and she was hilarious. She used to perform at a marvellous comedy cabaret night club in Manhattan, now long gone, which had two floors. The upstairs was called Upstairs at the Downstairs, and the downstairs was called Downstairs at the Upstairs. It was at 37 West 56th Street and was run by an amusing and eccentric woman whose name I have forgotten, alas. Fannie played there at the same time as Madeline ('Maddy') Kahn, who was also wildly funny. Fannie told me she had wanted to perform under her own real name of Patricia Neal, but was told by her agent or manager, I believe, that she could not do that because there was a famous film actress of that name already, so she invented the name Fannie Flagg for herself. It was only years later that she wrote this marvellous heart-felt novel, which was rejected by many publishers, but which finally came out and then resulted in this film. And it is this which really made Fannie Flag famous. The film was shot in Georgia, which is next door to Alabama. But the story is mostly set in Alabama in a little town called Whistle Stop. That name arose because it was a settlement situated beside the railroad. Many small Southern towns fell into desuetude (i.e. withered away) when the railroads started collapsing, after the construction of the interstate highway system, which shifted so much travel and freight transport onto roads and destroyed the rail industry, from the 1950s onwards. In this film which takes place at two different times, during the pre-War period which constitutes the earlier story, the two young women, Idgie and Ruth, open a railside café called The Whistle Stop Café. In those years, it thrived and became the heart of the town, where everyone went to eat real home cooking, which included the favourite local delicacy, fried green tomatoes, which were sliced and fried in batter in what in the South is called a skillet, which is an old 17th century English word for a frying pan, the word surviving only in the American South and nowhere else. (I still fry my eggs and bacon in an old iron family skillet which was cast in the family forge at Taunton, Massachusetts, in the 17th or 18th century. We have been using that skillet for many generations. Just imagine how many bacon fat molecules survive in the crystalline interstices of the cast iron after those centuries of use every morning. The outside of the skillet looks like something dug up by an archaeologist, but the inside is shiny and ready for anything. But this question arises: can bacon fat go rancid after a century or two? It does seem to improve the flavour anyway. However, I am ashamed to say that I have never fried any green tomatoes, which is doubtless a great personal failing of mine. The skillet has thus been deprived of what Ruth and Idgie would perhaps consider to be its main function, to deal with those green tomatoes.) Idgie, who is a hopeless cook, cannot prepare them, so Ruth has to do it. Throughout the film people keep tasting them to see if they are up to standard. The modern story of the film consists of tales told by an old lady in a retirement home to a much younger woman, and the effect this has on transforming her life. That younger woman is played by Kathy Bates, whose performance is breathtaking in its sensitivity and brilliance. But then, Kathy Bates has always been one of everybody's favourite and most endearing actresses, and we all know what a genius she is. The old woman is played equally brilliantly by the famous Jessica Tandy, veteran of a lifetime of superlative achievements in both stage and screen. Before TV wiped all the brains of the public as clean as a virgin hard disc, people used to tell stories, and there was such a thing as verbal communication. (And people didn't even have to use their thumbs to communicate, like today's simian-thumbed and simian-brained text messagers.) This film is all about the power of stories to stir the imagination and transform lives. Even as late as the 1960s, some old women still survived in the South who could tell stories for hours on end. They are all gone now, and it is like what happened after the time of Homer, when the last of the bards died. The best rendering in fiction of the 'power of stories' is probably the novella by Mircea Eliade entitled THE OLD MAN AND THE BUREAUCRATS. (Eliade wrote the story of Coppola's film YOUTH WITHOUT YOUTH, 2007, though that film was very disappointing and a poor adaptation.) The stories told by Jessica Tandy are about Idgie and Ruth. In those lengthy flashback sequences, the two young women are brilliantly portrayed by the two Mary's, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Mary-Louise Parker. Certainly this is one of the greatest 'sisterhood' films ever made. Their story is full of love, pain, pathos, loss, tragedy, and joy. Not unlike life. If you can see this without shedding a tear, then there is no hope for you. Good old Fannie, may she long keep flying her Flagg.",/review/rw0294329/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2007,FiendishDramaturgy,9," Bittersweet Masterpiece In An Authentic Southern Setting.
","Born and raised in lower Alabama, I found this work thoroughly enchanting. It truly depicts the life in thousands of little nowhere towns peppering the deep southern US from Georgia through Alabama, Mississippi, and select areas of Louisiana. But beyond that, this movie does more than enchant you with its whimsical Southern tones, and Georgia notes. It weaves a spell about you and transports you to 1930's Alabama, where it holds you in thrall until the bittersweet end.",/review/rw0294329/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2005,Lechuguilla,6," What An Authentic Flavor This Film Has
","The twenty year friendship between two young women in the early twentieth century American South is the focus of this 1991 film from director Jon Avnet. Told in flashbacks, the story adopts a modern POV, with social empowerment being the theme. As such, the story is both unusual and unexpected, given its historical time frame. Viewers will be disappointed if they expect a more traditional Southern story ... about some dark, sinister secret emotionally repressed, and set among the lazy willows and old Magnolia trees.",/review/rw0294329/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 1999,vijayr,10," Consummate story-telling, served well by superlative performances
","Fannie Flagg's novel of immense complexity (huge cast and innumerable separate stories) could have been impossible to film. However, it is made possible, in large part, by the performances of Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary Louise Parker in what should have been billed as the lead roles. They play the two southern women who's joint story this movie revolves around. Jessica Tandy's role is to relate the story to a lost and longing Kathy Bates (in modern times). Director Jon Avnet ties the two together nicely at times, awkwardly at times, but always (except the end) without doing damage to either. He (and the production crew) bring to life a 'peaceful' southern town very nicely.",/review/rw0294329/?ref_=tt_urv

4 August 2002,tfrizzell,," Smart Story-Telling.
","Ignored housewife Kathy Bates becomes fast friends with nursing home shut-end Jessica Tandy (Oscar-nominated) in this fine little slice of entertainment. Tandy weaves a heart-touching story about a small diner in racially-driven Alabama in the 1920s that is the site for one amazing tale. The film flashes between Bates and Tandy in the present-day and then shifts its focus throughout on the loving sisterly-styled relationship between two young women (Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary-Louise Parker) in the past. Top-notch story-telling is the key in making ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" a blue-ribbon winner in the end. 4 stars out of 5.",/review/rw0294329/?ref_=tt_urv

22 October 2003,carflo,10," I love this movie
","Fried Green Tomatoes is a movie with 2 stories: Idgie and Ruth, and Evelyn and Ninnie. It is about friendship and love and how friendship and love can sustain women through hard times and crises. Idgie gives Ruth strength and Ruth gives Idgie redemption. Without Idgie's strength, Ruth would have buried and broken by her violent husband. Without Ruth's love, Idgie's wildness would have destroyed her in the end. They became more than the sum of their parts. Ninnie's early life had been so full of love, from Idgie & Ruth, from her husband and son, that it still illuminates her present life, even though she old and in a nursing home. Ninnie gave some of that love and strength to Evelyn and helped Evelyn survive her journey to self enlightenment. I love this movie. I made me laugh (Evenlyn's husband asking her how she could accidentally hit another car a dozen times) and it made me cry. It is a wonderful tribute to the sustenance that can be derived from true friendship.",/review/rw0294329/?ref_=tt_urv
