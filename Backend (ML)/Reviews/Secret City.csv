17 June 2011,cosmo_tiger,8," A very moving and somewhat funny movie about a porn star trying to change her life. Not what I expected its better. I say B+
","""What kind of person are you?"" Retiring pregnant porn star Elektra Luxx (Gugino) fills her days by teaching a sexology class. After being approached by a stranger with a tie to her dead ex-boyfriend her day starts to get weird. If you have seen the previews to this then you think you know what the movie is about. You would be wrong. From what I saw I expected a very funny comedy. While this movie does have it's funny moments, at its core it actually a very moving story. A woman who is trying to figure out where her life is is the one everyone seems to go to for advice, help or anything she can provide. Being that the movie is about a porn star there are a few pretty raunchy scenes and dialog, but no where near what you would have expected. There is a shot a a male and female butt and that is the extent of the nudity. The acting and characters are very entertaining that it makes you want to watch and see everyone get what they want. This is not at all what I expected, it was better. Overall a very touching, and somewhat funny story about finding out and being comfortable with who you are. I give it a B+.",/review/rw2782425/?ref_=tt_urv

","Bert Rodriguez (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a fast-talking self-styled porn commentator reporting on 90s porn star Elektra Luxx (Carla Gugino) from his mother's basement. She is famous for a porn with herself as twins but she actually has a twin in prison for real. She is pregnant and out of the business. She's teaching sex class in the community center. Cora (Marley Shelton) admits killing her baby daddy Nick while having sex with him. Cora gives her songs written by Nick about her. In return, Cora wants her to seduce her fiancée Ben (Justin Kirk) to even the score. She tries to accommodate but he wrongly mistakes robber Dellwood Butterworth (Timothy Olyphant) for him.

","I would bet that Sebastian Gutierrez, the writer and director of ""Elektra Luxx"" is a big fan of the acclaimed Spanish director Pedro Almodovar. ""Elektra Luxx"" is kind of like an American version of a Almodvar film. It is full of funny, quirky and sexy characters.",/review/rw2782425/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2010,ScottDMenzel,9," ""Elektra Luxx"" is a fun and enjoyable film with great performances all around.
","On March 14th in Austin, TX, I headed into the World Premiere of ""Elektra Luxx"" at the Paramount Theater and boy was I in for a treat. I was so pumped just being at SXSW but sitting a few seats away from me were Malin Akerman, Carla Gugino, Emma Bell, Emmanuelle Chriqui, and director/writer Sebastian Gutierrez. About an hour into the film, the worst thing that could ever happen to a director happened...the movie screen went blank during the world premiere. Within a few minutes, Sebastian Gutierrez appeared on stage doing a one man show entertaining the audience to the highest level possible. After about 20 mins, the cast came on stage to help fill the time. This is when my brilliant ass decided to ask the most awkward question to ask a filmmaker period, let alone during a chaotic screening. I began to ask ""how do you make a sequel to a film that no one saw the original of?"" After that sentence came out of my mouth, I actually felt really bad for asking it because I didn't realize how harsh it sounded but luckily for me Sebastian Gutierrez decided to answer it honestly and poke fun at me a bit in the process. The guy is awesome. I have met a ton of directors and celebrities and he ranks up there as the coolest guy I met in showbiz. He just seemed like the kind of guy who really valued his fans and I truly admire the man now. But as the 45 minute mark drew near, Janet Pierson let everyone know we would not be able to see the ending of ""Elektra Luxx"" tonight as the projector could not be fixed.",/review/rw2782425/?ref_=tt_urv

","The famous porn star Elektra Luxx (Carla Gugino) has retired from the adult film industry since she is pregnant and now she survives giving sex class to married women. One day, the flight attendant Cora (Marley Shelton) meets Elektra after class and tells that she killed the rock star Nick Chapel, who is the father of her unborn child, and stolen lyrics that he had written about Elektra. Cora offers the lyrics to Elektra provided she seduces her fiancé to compensate the one night stand she had with another man.

","I was fortunate enough to see this movie at a special screening last night and had no idea what to expect. The poster and tagline made it seem like a raunchy romantic comedy aimed at women or young men. What I saw instead was one of the smartest, most heartfelt and profound comedies I've seen in years.

12 February 2011,rocketship-2,9," Weird, Wonderful, Sexy Elektra
","This movie, several steps up from ""Women In Trouble"" in terms of consistency, further evolves the weird, wonderful and sexy world of the title character. Carla Gugino is so winning as this confused but sometimes wise former lady of porn that it makes you wonder what movies would be like if she got more leading parts. Returning from the first one are the awesome duo of Adrienne Palicki and Emmanuelle Chriqui, who are maybe the most moving part of the story. Joseph Gordon Levitt is hilarious in it too and Malin Akerman, who I wasn't all that keen on from ""Watchmen"", actually proves she's a very good actress. Sex-positive and lesbian-positive without being preachy or sappy, this is a smart, weird comedy with a ton of personality and GREAT DIALOGUE.",/review/rw2782425/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2016,TdSmth5,5," Not the best vehicle for this couple
","Gugino is lovely (not so lovely with a blonde wig) and can act. Gutierrez is a bright guy and can write smart, insightful, and occasionally funny lines. But in this ""story"" of a former major porn star who's pregnant and giving ""how to have sex"" courses their talents are wasted. There isn't really much of a story just pieces as an excuse for Gutierrez's musings. Gugino is placed in a couple of unlikely scenarios. A ridiculous and ridiculously articulate porn industry vlogger obsesses about Elektra and is nervous to meet her. Two friends travel to Mexico and meets some guys but one of them has a secret. What does all of this have to do with anything? It doesn't. What's the point? There isn't one.",/review/rw2782425/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2011,Chrysanthepop,," When A Pornstar Retires
","Sebastian Gutierrez's dialogue oriented 'Elektra Luxx' is somewhat better than his next film 'Girl Walks Into A Bar', at least in terms of writing, especially where dialogue is concerned. It's wittier, fresher and funnier and fits well with the situations. 'Elektra Luxx' also has a film-noire style feel to it. The story of the title character juxtaposes with two others: one about Luxx's 'diehard' and desperate fanboy blogger Bert who's trying to move on with life post Luxx's film career (she quit) and another involving Luxx's former costar Holly. I thought the latter story, though well acted in by Adrianne Palicki and Emannuelle Chriqui, barely contributed to the film and perhaps it should have been left out as it only slows down the pace. The overall pacing is also uneven. At times the lighting feels excessive. The score is well utilized and pleasant to the ears. Carla Gugino is terrific in the title role and she is well-supported by Adrianne Palicki, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Kathleen Quinlan and Marley Shelton. There's also an interesting cameo by one of the finest actresses.",/review/rw2782425/?ref_=tt_urv

7 February 2013,BeneCumb,7," Better than I expected - and pleasantly weird
","The topic of porn industry and their performers usually bring along ambivalent feelings related to shame, sympathy, or disgust, and those thinking broadly beyond have thoughts related to abuse, humiliation and human trafficking. Elektra Luxx can nicely ""hover"" above this, depicting a deliberately hectic story of porn stars trying to leave their regular track and start to live ""normal"" life - whatever it means... The cast is even and strong, especially Carla Gugino as Elektra Luxx / Elektra's twin Celia, but also many supporting roles are performed by talented actors, e.g. Timothy Olyphant as Del, Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Bert Rodriguez. In fact, the latter was the reason I decided to watch this movie (I had not about Women In Trouble, for which Elektra Luxx is sequel) - and I was not disappointed. Not a family movie, but recommended to those fond of twisted humor and ""minced"" but interrelated scenes.",/review/rw2782425/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2011,slake09,2," Not a comedy, not a drama, not a good movie
","Elektra Luxx tells the story of a porn star's personal life, but fails as both a comedy and a drama. You can see the potential for laughs or serious drama, but the movie never gets there. There isn't much in the way of nudity, so the potential for exploitation is also missed.",/review/rw2782425/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2011,threecrows,9," Incredibly Sweet!
","Wow. What a sweet movie. This is a really original comedy that takes a look at the kinds of people (a porn star, a sex blogger, a call girl) that other movies might look down upon or simply make fun of and instead it crafts a very surprising manifesto for becoming better people. More like episodes than a proper narrative, the movie centers on Carla Gugino (Karen Sisco herself) as she tries to make a living in the straight world after leaving her porn past behind. It should be noted that there is nothing pornographic in the movie, nor is it a satire on the porn industry itself, it's more... well, it's hard to explain. It's more a character study of a confident but confused beautiful woman that you root for despite her job. Joseph Gordon Levitt is very funny as the blogger obsessed with her and Emmanuelle Chriqui is luminous as the all business call girl who finds out her best friend (Wonder Woman herself) wants to be more than friends. This is one of those movies that grow by word of mouth and it is a very pleasant surprise. Great, GREAT funny lines in it. Can't wait to see the third one.",/review/rw2782425/?ref_=tt_urv

16 March 2011,mbs,9," Incredibly Quick Dialog And Wonderful Dialog Gives This Sequel A Real Kick
","Amazingly Strong Semi Sequel to 2009's Women In Trouble,improving on that one with its dialog alone. Elektra Luxx starts out strong right out of the gate plunging first into a wonderfully noirish plot providing so much fantastic dialog that it becomes a pleasure to listen to. The dialog IS the reason to seek this one out however you can because it is that good. There are so many fantastic one liners, and conversational two handers throughout. There are exchanges of dialog flying at you in all directions throughout that you end up just trying to absorb everything that was just said just so you can process it all-- reminding me a bit of ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" in that sense. This dialog not only provides the movie its spark--it made me want to hang around the theater for the 40 odd minutes after the end credits finished rolling to catch the next showing. I can only think of a handful of films that I've seen in theaters that have made me want to do that but i just had to hear this movie again pronto. Movie has three largely separate plot lines, but the characters do all know each other as they were all featured in the director's previous film ""Women In Trouble."" The main plot line involves now pregnant ex porn star Elektra Luxx--played by the dependably wry and endearing Carla Gugino-- who finds herself thrown into a plot line involving unpublished songs written about her by her dead lover from ""Women In Trouble"" as the young woman who was with him (when he died--and blames herself by the way) promises to give her those very songs which Luxx would like mostly for sentimental reasons in exchange for the tiny little favor in which Luxx seduces her fiancée. Lets just leave it at that because i can't really say what happens next but i will say that the film's not really plot driven as much as it is character driven, which would normally be a turn-off but when the characters are spouting as terrific dialog as they are here, there's a lot of pleasure to be had just from sitting back and listening to them talk their talk.",/review/rw2782425/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2015,grantss,4," Better than expected, but still mediocre...
","Better than expected, and disappointing, at the same time. Initially better than expected, as I was expecting a lame send-up of the adult film industry, but Joseph Gordon-Levitt's opening scene is hilariously funny. Next few scenes were in the same vein, so I got my hopes up, thinking this could be a great comedy.",/review/rw2782425/?ref_=tt_urv

","A sequel to Women in Trouble, this movie has just as much talk and even less action. If you loved the first film and thought Carla Gugino was the best thing in it, you will revel in this motion picture. If it wore you out with non-stop blather and thought Gugino was just one among many other members of the cast, wellyou're probably not going to be watching Elektra Luxx in the first place.

14 April 2013,pacotigre,8," Let's not go crazy.......! !
","Well, Here we go again. This movie is definitely much better than expected. Not only the script : witty and with a lot of zest. The structure is interesting without being quite as original as it could have been. The acting is quite good with a lack , unfortunately, of true emotional rendering.The director has taken cues from , among others, Woody Allen. But Woody he is not... To reach such heights, granted in his best movies, one must be able to do the full swing = a.k.a : bring nicely the comic situation and then give it an unexpected and glorious twist. Please for sex ""farce"" take a look OUTSIDE the USA : Almodovar, "" Gazon Maudit"". So if you still can do widen your horizons.. IMDb is way too America centric to please the true aficionado in any genre. And by the way the Latinos are coming with their powerful popular culture.Here lies a lot of my hopes : Latinos have the only such cultural might to nearly ignore American pop culture. They are pervading all corners of life in the USA . At last in any diner I can get strong coffee not dishwater as in the 80's when I lived in Maryland. ... That's all folks..........:)",/review/rw2782425/?ref_=tt_urv
