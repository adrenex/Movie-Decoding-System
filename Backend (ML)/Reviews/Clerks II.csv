15 May 2010,claudio_carvalho,8," Has Potential to Become a Classic in the Future
","In 2174, the natural resources of Earth are exhausted and the spacecraft Elysium is launched to the planet Tanis in the last hope of mankind. Due to the long travel, the crew-members are divided in teams that travel in extended hyper-sleep, rotating in shifts along the trip. When Corporal Bower (Ben Foster) from Flight Team 5 wakes up due to a malfunctioning of his chamber, he is disoriented and with amnesia. But sooner he realizes that the reactor is not working and provoking power surges in the ship. Then Lieutenant Payton (Dennis Quaid) also awakes and they find that they are locked in a room but the access door to the bridge is not reactivated. Bower moves through the ventilation trunk trying to open the door from outside. Sooner he discovers that there is some weird threatening life form in the ship and running is always the best option to survive. When he meets the biologist Nadia (Antje Traue) and the strong farmer Manh (Cung Le), they team up trying to reach the reactor and save their lives. Meanwhile, Payton rescues Corporal Gallo in the room, but the menace of the paranoid Pandorum psychological trauma seems to be affecting Gallo. ",/review/rw2132983/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2009,dfranzen70,7," Better than Event Horizon and Ghost Ship combined
","Echoing such luminous sci-fi classics as 2001 and Alien, Pandorum is a terrific psychological thriller, although it does struggle at times to be coherent and original. But it's a true mindbender, and it's packed with action that moves so quickly neither the actors nor the audience can really catch a breath, which is a good move if your plot is shaky to begin with.",/review/rw2132983/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2009,freaky_dave,7," Better than most critics say
","I saw Pandorum last night and was somewhat impressed with the movie. After reading critics reviews, and how they trashed it, I was going in expecting less and was pleasantly surprised.",/review/rw2132983/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2009,ciscokid1970,9," A good Sci-fi Scary movie
","I have to say this movie was better than I expected. If you liked Aliens and Resident Evil...this is like both of those movies got together and had a sequel. Well not quite, but the story was good and had no gaping holes in it. The acting was good without going over the top.",/review/rw2132983/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2011,Sleepin_Dragon,9," Very scary, one of the best sci fi horrors.
","I very nearly allowed myself to be put off this movie by all the negative press and reviews which it received. I took a chance and bought the Blu Ray of it, wow, I was expecting a movie similar to Event Horizon or Sunshine, what i got was something way more impressive. I found myself with that scared sunken in the stomach feeling that i've not had for many a year, and certainly not had with recent horror films. What a very clever idea, strong acting, gorgeous effects, very novel to have such a mix of a cast. I find it very frustrating when i expect a lot from a film and don't get it, here the reverse has happened. I think most people would enjoy this. Think Dr Who Ark in Space meets Silent Hill, perhaps that's an idea of the mix. 9.5/10.00",/review/rw2132983/?ref_=tt_urv

21 June 2011,TheLittleSongbird,8," Wasn't expecting much, but the film was much better than I expected
","When I first heard of Pandorum, I was intrigued but to be honest I was not expecting much. The character development could have expanded perhaps in places, and Cam Gigandet overdoes it a tad, but Pandorum was much better than I expected. The story mayn't be the most original concept on the block, but it was intriguing, worked well and remained interesting. The script is credible enough, the music is atmospheric and there is a compelling atmosphere too. The direction is competent too, and the acting from the likes of Dennis Quaid is better than expected, but the real stars are the production values and special effects which are pretty much superb. All in all, far better than I'd hoped. 8/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2132983/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2009,TheDeadMayTasteBad,8," Pandorum: A terrifying and atmospheric, if flawed, sci-fi odyssey.
","Anybody wanting an intelligent, insightful, or mesmerizing motion picture should readjust they're expectations before walking into Pandorum. There are a few themes here that are interesting and the characters aren't dumb (some are engineers and scientists, after all), but chances are you've already seen these archetypes in countless movies already. As for whom to recommend this film to, if you enjoyed Event Horizon and/or AlienÂ³, there's no reason why you wouldn't find anything to like in this film. However, contrary to what many people have said, Pandorum seems to resemble another film, Eden Log (a French sci-fi/horror picture), much more than either of the previously mentioned. As in Eden Log, our central characters wake up with no memory of how they came to be in their isolated environments. Likewise, they also have to explore an isolated world around them were horrible things have occurred and monsters seem to be looming. Even more interesting is that both films feature protagonists caught up in the mix of highly mysterious projects entitled ""Eden."" Our two main characters are Corporal Bower and Lt. Payton, played by Ben Foster and Dennis Quaid respectively. The two wake up disoriented and contained (i.e. trapped) in a small hypersleep chamber designated for the Elysium (the name of the large vessel of characters are aboard) crew of Flight Team 5. Unaware of what has happened to the other crew members the two begin to analyze their situation and Bower, being a technical/mechanical engineer, notices electrical surges throughout the ship signal that the nuclear reactor core in the Elysium is about to overload and shutdown. The two begin a makeshift mission to try to save the ship, with Bower climbing through ducts and exploring the wasteland left of the craft and Payton guiding him over a comlink and a crank-generator powered computer terminal. If you've seen any of the Alien films or played the videogames Doom or Dead Space, this should sound quite familiar.",/review/rw2132983/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2009,aiga,9," I'm no horror fan but, man, I had a great time!
","Yeh! As I said, I'm no horror fan or expert for that matter. Particularly I don't like the slashers and, if you are looking for that, this is not the way to go. This movie has a quality to it. I believe in the saying 'it is all in your head'. So, this is the sort of horror that messes with your head. I think it is the best kind. You get the most thrill out of it. I had a great time watching this film. I bit my nails, I jumped in my seat, but I couldn't tear myself away from the screen even though at times I was terrified to my core. I disagree with those who say that the story is boring. It had twists and turns and you can never guess the ending. To me it is one of the key elements in movies. I want a surprise. And Pandorum has a surprise!",/review/rw2132983/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2009,joselnieves81,6," Aliens meet The Descent!!!
","I simply loved the posters for PANDORUM, they were edgy and graphic enough to make me want to give this movie a shot even thou i'm not a Dennis Quaid fan at all. I gave it a shot earlier today and i have to say it was a pretty good movie.",/review/rw2132983/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2010,fwomp,8," Parts Make Pandorum Better Than You'd Think
","Part psychological thriller, part sci-fi, part ALIENS, PANDORUM is a unique hybrid. Although nothing new in terms of things we haven't seen before (encapsulate a group of men/women and see how they react), the film is strung together differently enough to hold your attention. You never really know what's around the next corner.",/review/rw2132983/?ref_=tt_urv

","The talent/actors on hand here, are amazing. Ben Foster, Dennis Quaid, Norman Reedus and Cam Giganet to name the ones you might have heard of. But even the woman (a German actress), who you might never heard of, fits the bill. It's a great (action) story, that definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat. Without feeling cheap, like another movie, that I won't mention again here.",/review/rw2132983/?ref_=tt_urv

","Pandorum is about two astronauts aboard an Ark ship who wake up from their cryogenic sleep tanks with memory loss. They don't know what the mission is, where they are, nor what has happened to the rest of the ship. As they explore their surroundings, they learn that the ship is teeming with mutants who are super-fast, super-strong, and super-loud. Chase scenes abound as the crew try to avoid being eaten while regaining control over the ship and come to terms with the mission.",/review/rw2132983/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2010,Quinoa1984,7," derivative, but on its own terms it's got some chills and cool things, and acting
","Watching Pandorum, it made me think back to other science fiction and as well horror movies ('horror' isn't listed as one of the genres of the film on IMDb though it should), but this is not entirely a negative for the movie itself. It has the same dark tunnels and claustrophobic lighting of the Descent and Alien (and the creatures of the Descent), it has the surreal nature of Event Horizon (as many have noted), and it has a take on humanity that is grim and cynical that has been seen in countless sci-fi. But the film also carries with it some genuinely good actors like Ben Foster, this instance playing a more heroic character instead of his usual villain, and Dennis Quaid as Peyton who is caught in the conflict of trying to help guide Foster's Bower and another man who has come out of one the tubes that has kept the astronauts in hyper- sleep.",/review/rw2132983/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2009,DICK STEEL,8," A Nutshell Review: Pandorum
","I've not been too impressed with that many science-fiction thriller/horror films set in outer space since, well, probably Alien and Aliens, but Pandorum turned out to be something of a different ball game altogether. It's been too long since I last enjoyed a film of this genre, and who would have thought this was something originally planned for a direct to video release. It looks gorgeously dark, and pretty much entertaining from start to finish, keeping you guessing until the mid-way mark, while letting the gloomy, pessimistic atmosphere envelope you.",/review/rw2132983/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2009,jediknight-19,10," Pandorum is an Amazingly Original and Mesmerizing.
","Pandorum is an amazingly original and crafty sci-fi/horror film. The premise is well thought out and the script delivers bang on from the opening scene to the end. This movie grabs you like a vice right from the start, and never releases until the final credits. The mise-en-scene is beautifully dark and realistic, against the juxtaposition of human beings waking up in a ship without memories of who they are or their mission. The audience explores with the two crew members unraveling the mystery. There are many twists in this film and it's hard to find words without spoilingÂso just go see itÂyou won't be disappointed.",/review/rw2132983/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2009,debuneezmom,9," Nice mix of adventure, surprises and psychological fun
","I thought this movie did an excellent job of tapping into a number of deep-rooted fears that seem to be universal - claustrophobia, loneliness, loss of memory, large semi-dark areas with things that go bump, not to mention suddenly waking up and not knowing what the heck is going on all around you.

5 February 2010,Scarecrow-88,7," Pandorum
","Earth is coming apart at the seams and a ship is commissioned, the Elysium, on the direct coordinates to newly discovered planet, Tanis which can support human life. Ben Foster has a big part as Corporal Bower, an engineer who awakens disoriented from prolonged cryo-sleep. He opens the cryo-pod of who he believes to be his boss, Lieutenant Payton(Dennis Quaid), both of a flight crew whose other members seem to be nowhere in sight. The Elysium is in bad working order and the reactor seems to be malfunctioning. For some reason, both Payton and Bower can remember their training and job capabilities fully, but have a hard time recollecting memories other than what their able to do as officers in their specific fields. The bridge's door is closed and Bower knows he must find the reactor and restore it to bring back the power and lights for the Elysium to function properly. So he will brave a darkened and particularly threatening ship with ominous signs of danger. He finds cryo-chambers empty, rotted corpses, and, even worse than he could possibly imagine, mutated cannibalistic human lifeforms with a voracious appetite. Lucky for Bower he comes in contact with survivors who have braved the elements and will assist him in finding the reactor which is located far, far away. Along with Nadia(Antie Traue), a German, and Manh(Cung Le), a Vietnamese, both equipped with impressive fighting skills(..in order to survive in a ship crawling with an army of monstrous fiends, one must defend him/herself appropriately or else wind up lunch), Bower will follow their lead and hopefully heal the ship.",/review/rw2132983/?ref_=tt_urv

And then main power of the ship gets cut off. While trying to get to the reactor you find out that the ship has been overtaken by carnivorous monsters who got a taste for human flesh.",/review/rw2132983/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2015,deloudelouvain,7," Nice sci/fi horror
","This is exactly what I search for when I want to watch a sci/fi horror movie. Dark scenes, creepy monsters/aliens, a good script and good actors. Maybe the movie itself was a bit with too many dark shots but then again they were in space in a defaulting spaceship, so not many light available. The monsters were creepy enough to make it interesting to watch. Plus I thought the storyline was well written and easy to follow. It's for sure better then a lot of other sci/fi horror movies. The actors came all out very believable in their respective roles. And there was definitely the perfect amount of suspense to keep you intrigued in what's going to happen next. Glad I saw it, and will for sure watch it again in the future.",/review/rw2132983/?ref_=tt_urv
