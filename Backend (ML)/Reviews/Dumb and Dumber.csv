28 July 2019,masonsaul,9," Incredible 4th installment
","Lethal Weapon 4 is an incredible 4th installment and imporves over it's predecessor. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are incredible once again with perfect chemistry. The humour is extremely funny and Chris Rock is definitely a welcome addition. Jet Li is a great villain. Richard Donner's direction is great as usual, resulting in some of the biggest and most enjoyable action sequences in the franchise yet. As with the previous installments, the music by Michael Kamen, Eric Clapton and David Sandborn is really good. It even has a surprisingly strong emotional ending. However, it does follow the formula of previous installments, giving it some predictable moments.",/review/rw2806070/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2002,MovieAddict2016,8," One Of the Rare Franchises That Never Gets Too Overbearing and Dull...
","Lethal Weapon 4 starts out with a boring and ridiculous beginning. I remember watching it the first time and thinking, ""oh no, another bad sequel.""",/review/rw2806070/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2005,MinorityReporter,8," An excellent movie
","Who said all movie series become worse with every installment? Lethal Weapon 4 is probably the best fourth movie in a series ever. I find it incredible that the magic is still there. The main characters still feed of each other and their friendship (both on set and off set) is clearly felt in every scene they have together. Mel Gibson has finally laid the ghost of his wife to rest and is as chipper as ever. He does this without seeming truly obnoxious (even though that is a part of his character). In fact he seems more likable in this film than he did in all the previous films. Danny Glover reprises his role from the previous movies and that is not a bad thing because the Murtaugh role is the best of his career. Rene Ruso returns in her part and although it has been cut down considerably its still a decent role. Joe Pesci is also back and this time around he gets to add some depth to the character (something that was missing in the previous film). Chris Rock is decent. He isn't much of an actor but he is pretty funny and fresh. His part also adds a little something to the all-round comedy of the film, but if you want to know what it is you will have to watch the movie yourself. Jet Li is the villain in this movie and while he is the weakest villain in the series acting wise, he is definitely the most menacing.",/review/rw2806070/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2017,TheLittleSongbird,7," The 'Lethal Weapon' series doesn't end with a bang but it hardly ends on a whimper either
","Talking about the other films for a minute, while not perfect, the first film is very good and one of the best buddy-cop films there is (important to the development of them too). 'Lethal Weapon 2' was almost as good, and while 'Lethal Weapon 3' was a little disappointing it was still fun.",/review/rw2806070/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2006,ebiros2,7," In Hong Kong, you'll be dead .... but in America.......
","This is one of my most favorite Lethal Weapon series movie. Like many people, I liked Wah Sing Ku played by Jet Li as the villain. The comical part that's the staple of this series where Detective Murtaugh always gets his property devastated is played out in this movie as well. I still can't get over the part where Mel Gibson walks into the restaurant that's the front for the Chinese gang and brakes the large glass on the wall for no reason at all. Jet Li says ""In Hong Kong, you'll be dead !"", but in America I think you'll end up in jail by law suit brought against police brutality. Riggs will no doubt lose his job, and police chief will be making public apologies. Okay, the rest is typical action Lethal Weapon style, and Glover and Gibson really brought their goods to this movie. One question I have is why does this series have so many action scenes on, by or in the water ? The final encounter between Gibson and Jet was one of the best show downs of this series.",/review/rw2806070/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2002,Big Movie Fan,," The Magic Was Still There
",It is extremely rare for the fourth film in a series to be just as good as it's three predecessors. Lethal Weapon 4 was awesome.,/review/rw2806070/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2001,Anonymous_Maxine,7," The fourth installment in the now huge Lethal Weapon series has no shortage of action, but it just doesn't have the high quality of the last three.
","By this point in the series, it seems that they just aren't trying as hard with these films, which is kind of a shame. The Lethal Weapon series is really a good group of action films, but part 4 doesn't really seem to take itself seriously. It clearly had the biggest budget and probably some of the most elaborate stunts and action scenes (as well as some of the most exciting, such as that thrilling freeway chase scene), but many of the other elements of the film have deteriorated badly.

9 August 2009,Beta_Gallinger,7," Not a bad conclusion to the quadrilogy
","After what was by far the longest gap between ""Lethal Weapon"" movies, the fourth installment in the quadrilogy finally came into theatres, six years after the third one. I was only about six months old when the original was first released, and by the time this fourth one came out, I was nearing adolescence, but was still too young to watch R-rated movies. I've seen all four LW films for the first time this year. Watching this 1998 action comedy's three predecessors, it seemed to me that each one showed a slight drop in quality from the last, so I had fairly low expectations for this fourth one, but still planned to finish watching the series. Many may disagree, but I think this one actually showed a slight improvement after ""Lethal Weapon 3"".",/review/rw2806070/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2005,mjw2305,7," A Decent Finale
","All the usual suspects are here, but finally Riggs is getting too old for this s**t. Funnier than the rest of the series, this is still a good movie, although it wouldn't rank highly if it stood on its own.",/review/rw2806070/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2006,ccthemovieman-1,8," Best Of LW Sequels & A Good DVD 'Demo'
","I read somewhere when the DVD of this film came out that it would be a good ""demo"" model for dealers trying to sell DVD players and surround-sound equipment. Well, they were right; it's awesome, or at least it was back in '99 when the disc came out, back when not everyone had a DVD player. It's still top-of-line for picture and sound. When bullets are flying around, you hear them from all five speakers. It here it almost seven years later and we still find many films without this kind of excellent surround- speaker participation.",/review/rw2806070/?ref_=tt_urv

27 November 2001,kenandraf,8," Above average Hollywood action
","Above average Hollywood formula action movie that is also the worst of the LETHAL WEAPON series but still is a cut above the typical Hollywood action fare.Why?Star chemistry is the key as with the rest of the other LETHAL WEAPON efforts.This one was too watered down for more mainstream appeal (quick cash) and had a much more comedy atomsphere,thus in effect,lampooning themselves.Average script and below average screenplay.Action packed but cartoonish in style.The acting was passe as well.Star power and charm simply carried this energetic movie.Only for big police action movie fans.........",/review/rw2806070/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2019,acedj,9," The end of an era
","This movie draws an end to my favorite cop franchise. Having Jet Lee as the villain was a master stroke. That coupled with the fact that he had to slow down his movements so the cameras could actually capture them makes for action, action, action. The ending to this film always makes a tear come to my eyes.
On a fishing trip Riggs, Murtaugh, and Leo are almost plowed into by a freighter. Upon investigation they find out the ship in bringing slaves from China. Murtaugh ends up taking a family of slaves home with him, unbeknownst to Riggs and Leo. They uncover a plot to counterfeit Chinese money to buy the freedom of three leaders from the Chinese triad. By the end of this movie, all the character arcs come to a conclusion, for better or worse.",/review/rw2806070/?ref_=tt_urv

","out of all four movies in the series,this is probably the loudest and most chaotic,but that doesn't mean it was a bad movie.i think the storyline was a bit thin and not really all that original,but just like in part three,the action,and the chemistry of the stars makes up for that.and this movie also has more laughs than the previous installments,many courtesy of both Joe Pesci and Chris Rock.Rene Russo is back,along with Mel and Danny.Jet Li joins the proceedings in this one,and brings some spectacular fight scenes courtesy of his martial arts skill.i don't know if this is the best of the series,but i thought it was as good as number three,which i really liked.for me,Lethal Weapon 4 is a 7/10",/review/rw2806070/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2020,Calicodreamin,7," Worthy successor
","Lethal weapon 4 is a worthy successor in the franchise, bringing the whole cast together and delivering on action and humor. The action scenes were outrageous and the acting well done. The fourth movie does a good job building on the jokes/themes present in the first three films. The storyline is a bit all over the place and there's a lot of pieces that could have been done with out. Overall a pretty good action movie.",/review/rw2806070/?ref_=tt_urv

15 December 2019,nicholls905-280-546911,7," Still strong
","The series has obviously struggled with the last 2 films, but as a long running franchise, it continues to deliver. The characters are the key here and save a one dimensional storyline. Glover and Gibson are having fun, and further additions continue to balloon the series. The villains don't have that same interesting storyline like the first 3 films and it stops this film from becoming anything like the best films of the series. Rumours of a 5th film has been in the wind recently, and a passing of the baton wouldn't be a bad thing.",/review/rw2806070/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2008,GOWBTW,9," It's a family thing!
","The fourth and final sequel to the Lethal Weapon series is here! All the gang are here. Martin Riggs(Mel Gibson), Roger Murtaugh(Danny Glover), Leo Getz(Joe Pecsi), and Lorna Cole(Rene Russo). Now comes the funny part, here walks in Det. Lee Butters(Chris Rock) who ends up being Murtaugh's son-in-law, and he doesn't know about it. This time the crew go up against a smuggling/ counterfeiting ring led by Wah Sing Ku(Jet Li in his American debut). He is quick and lethal! Killing everyone in his path, whether they're Chinese or police. The Triads to be exact. Now for the family part; Lorna Cole is expecting, and Murtaugh's daughter is as well. Everyone needs someone. Leo is annoying, yet he realized that the two cops were his friends and they felt that were rotten to him. He shrugs off that, and confesses his feelings towards Riggs. For Riggs, he lost his wife to homicide, and when Lorna was about to give birth, Leo was made best man. He was quick and top-notched when she was going into labor. This movie still has the action, still have the comedy, and it still have heart. Don't feel left out, feel at home with this movie! 4 out of 5 stars!",/review/rw2806070/?ref_=tt_urv

17 January 2005,gaccrev,8," A Solid Sequel
","OK... so the language is gratuitous. Just having Chris Rock on set put it over the top. But his acting aside, I thought this was a worthy addition to one of the best cop/buddy series around. It was enjoyable to see the characters we love deal with the inevitabilities of aging and the fierce loyalty of friendship. Some of the mystery is gone and it feels like a pair of comfortable shoes. But aren't those shoes your favorite ones? It was interesting to see the development of Lorna and Riggs' relationship, as well as the growing up of the Murtaugh kids. It makes you feel like you're catching up with old friends at a reunion! Plenty of action and the incredible work of Jet Li make this movie a favorite at my house. Overall, a great wrap-up to the series and a lot of fun for long time fans. Worth seeing! If the language is a real issue, watch for it on TNT and enjoy the edited version.",/review/rw2806070/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2014,view_and_review,4," One Movie Too Many
",Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) are at it for a fourth time. That means more nuttiness from Riggs and more complaining and hoarse groaning from Murtaugh; although its clear that Murtaugh has become more of a clown himself having worked with Riggs all these years.,/review/rw2806070/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2007,lastliberal,7," Action & Laughs - what more do you want?
","OK, it may have been stretching it to go for a fourth Lethal Weapon film. I mean, do you remember Rocky 4 or Death Wish 4? But, this film was a departure from the rest and, as such, deserves some credit for what it tried to do. You can't argue with a film that includes Mary Ellen Trainor, Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Joe Pesci, Rene Russo, Chris Rock and Jet Li. There is going to be action, there is going to be comedy, and there is going to be some schmaltzy romance.",/review/rw2806070/?ref_=tt_urv
