13 December 2022,jasonpauljones-64690,5," The final 20 is the best, forget the rest
","Maybe I shouldn't be too unkind as my title suggests, because Bed Rest does have some good moments it's just that there's a lot of empty parts in between. The story sets itself up amiably with the old spooky house and young couple soon to be parents, moving in. We know straight away there's going to be problems for them, she being heavily pregnant and forcibly bed ridden, doctor's orders, and he being a meek geek who couldn't fight off a cockroach. But once the honeymoon openings are over, this movie limps along slower than a North American winter. But thankfully Melissa Barrera, unlike the rest, at least looks as though she wants to be a part of this and her enthusiasm and somewhat noticeable talents are appreciated and vital in holding the viewer's interest during the movie's lengthy down time. And if you can make it through to the last 20 minutes, a reward of sorts can be obtained from there to the end. Hope you can get there.",/review/rw8843631/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2022,BandSAboutMovies,5," Not bad
","Directed and written by Lori Evans Taylor (she produced 216 episodes of Lucky Dog, a Saturday morning show that I have watched and cried through many times and she's the writer for the upcoming Final Destination 6), Bed Rest skipped theaters and went right to Tubi, where we discover that Julie (Melissa Barrera, Scream) and Guy Rivers (Guy Burnet) have moved into a new home just a few months before she's due to have their first child. She has some issues with her pregnancy and is moved to mandatory bed rest -- the title does not lie -- but then there are ghosts troubling her from bedside. Or, as my wife said as she walked in to this, ""Is this another one of those dumb Amityville movies you're obsessed with?""",/review/rw8843631/?ref_=tt_urv

","Generic storyline in the first half, really takes of in the second. Its a ghastly hereditic ghost story of dimensions and a kind that i havent seen for a while, its what you would call'' a whimps roller coaster'' for the nitwit watching tv movies, while at bed rest chewing popcorn to nutrition the forthcoming one, a variant of ghost horror that will scare the heck out of the novise, and at its best scare the wits outta the seasoned one too...",/review/rw8843631/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2023,gab-67599,9," Enjoyable
","Definitely not as much horror as I was expecting. But still a good story that was not predictable. Now a days you can always see what is coming next, but in this movie that was NOT the case at all. The only screw up was how she gave birth to the bby, then just handed it to her husband like what about the umbilical cord? Who cut it? As for Tubi originals this was one of the best ones so far that I have seen. As a mother this was a great movie. More of a drama than a horror, there was a little horror in it towards the end. Nothing that would make you jump out of your seat or anything, but still a good watch. As always, be your own judge and see it. I recommend it, and would not mind watching it again.",/review/rw8843631/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2023,christophersrayburn,9," Suspenseful Thriller!
","I tend to watch a lot of horror, movies, and decided to check out this suspenseful thriller. I was pleasantly surprised with the jumps and plot from beginning to end. The uniqueness is what made the movie for me. Although parts of the plot have been done before, the way it was put in place made me that much more interested. Granted it does not have a lot of the unnecessary referrals that you see in today's movies, the movie establishes that suspenseful, thriller movies are still alive and kicking. It's rare that I see a good movie anymore especially in today's age but, when I watch one, I feel it does Asseri to share with others. You won't be disappointed.",/review/rw8843631/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2023,damjanmurkovic,8," Non tipical couple moves into old house story
","It's a classic horror genre, somebody moves into an old house and there is something creepy happening. The movie kept me guessing all the way till the reveal, even thought I did feel like I was a couple steps ahead of the main protagonist which in this case is a pregnant woman.",/review/rw8843631/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2023,kannibalcorpsegrinder,8," A wholly effective and enjoyable genre effort
","Trying to get their house renovated, a couple expecting their new child find themselves forced to keep her on bed rest after an accident gives them a pre-natal scare, yet the longer she remains comes to believe the house is haunted and tries to protect her baby from the supernatural threat.",/review/rw8843631/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2022,imperatorm,8," The film definitely deserves attention
","The film is quite with a deep meaning that you do not need to keep the past, otherwise you can very easily lose your real happiness, which is right under your nose. After all, the bulk of real people live like this: they always live in the past, think about the future, but at the same time never be in the present, and therefore people very often lose their true happiness. The film is very difficult emotionally and psychologically, under the oppressive atmosphere of horror. It cannot be viewed/evaluated superficially. Of course, I'm not trying to say that the film is unique or perfect. It's pretty average, maybe a little higher. However, the idea embedded in it is good.",/review/rw8843631/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2023,mukyammar,6," A mix of Suspense and Disappointment
","Bed Rest"" is a horror movie that had its moments of suspense and thrills, but it also had its fair share of slow and uneventful parts. The acting of Melissa Barrera was a standout for me, and her performance helped to keep me engaged in the story. The themes explored in the movie, such as pregnancy, lost pregnancy and lost children trauma, trust issues and mental health issues, made it more adult oriented and added depth to the story. However, the movie's reliance on cheap jump scares and strange whispering voices and sounds felt overused and detracted from the overall experience. The ending was not as satisfying as I hoped it would be, leaving me feeling a bit underwhelmed. Overall, while ""Bed Rest"" has its merits, it is not a movie that I would highly recommend.",/review/rw8843631/?ref_=tt_urv

","Started watching this movie with lot of expectations - Good horror, and captivating storyline.",/review/rw8843631/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2023,AvidNumo,9," Surprising Good
","I wasn't expecting much from this movie, it was free on Tubi, but wow was I shocked. The story is great and Melissa's acting is top notch here. I highly recommend this, if your a fan of horror movies. This movie doesn't seem like it was made with blockbuster finances, but it has a lot of heart. It looks like it was made by a Director and cast who loved the story and wanted to bring it to life. The setting and the lil effects that are in this movie are well balanced and doesn't take anything from the story. The cast all do a great job and like I previously stated Melissa Barrera is great in this.",/review/rw8843631/?ref_=tt_urv
