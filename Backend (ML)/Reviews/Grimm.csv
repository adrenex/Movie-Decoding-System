",I watched this series with pleasure. It was not too intense but also never shallow. Nice series for relaxed evenings.,/review/rw3792414/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2020,kosmasp,7," Grimm and not so grim
","Do you like fables? Fantasy stories and creatures in general? You will have quite the feast here - if you accept certain flaws that is. While the characters are nicely written, this falls mostly under the monster of the week category. There is some building up and characters developing to a certain extent. But it also lets them do things and then lets them get away without or little consequences.",/review/rw3792414/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2016,Bored_Dragon,8," A crossbreed of ""CSI"" and ""Once Upon a Time""
","In the beginning, I wasn't sure if I will watch it or give up on it, but after a few episodes I was completely addicted. The show follows the usual pattern of crime dramas, but its focus is on cases that involve beings from fairy-tales. None of those aspects is new or original, but till now shows were focused either on one or another, while the way this show combines them is new and interesting, made to attract both fans of crime dramas like ""CSI"" and fans of fantasy like ""Supernatural"" or ""Once Upon a Time"". Warm recommendation to everyone, regardless of what genre you prefer.",/review/rw3792414/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2020,dleeliberty,10," Loved this show, wish it never ended!!
","This show is by far one of my favorites of all time. Every episode is a new adventure, and there are quite a few very intense moments that will have you begging to watch the next episode.",/review/rw3792414/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2017,SnoopyStyle,8," great group chemistry
","Portland police detective Nick Burkhardt (David Giuntoli) lives a normal life. He is planning to propose to girlfriend Juliette Silverton (Elizabeth Tulloch). He and his partner Hank Griffin (Russell Hornsby) are investigating an unusual case when he starts having strange visions of people turning animalistic. He is visited by aunt Marie who is dying of cancer. She passes on a family history and her trailer. They are Grimms and able to see Wesens or mythical creatures hiding as normal human beings. He takes in Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell), a Blutbad, as a suspect at first and then his best friend in the fight against Wesen crimes. He is attacked by Adalind Schade (Claire Coffee) who is in league with his Captain Sean Renard (Sasha Roiz). Wu (Reggie Lee) is a patrol cop. Rosalee Calvert (Bree Turner) runs her family's apothecary shop. Trubel (Jacqueline Toboni), a distant cousin, is also Grimm as well as Nick's mother (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio).",/review/rw3792414/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2019,xkristitx,10," It's 2019 & I'm just now finding out about this show, how?
","Wow. I'm only on season 5, but I am beyond blown away with this show. I'm surprised a NBC show was so beautifully written. It hooked me instantly on the first episode. Each episode you dig deeper and deeper and you get more and more sucked in. My only negative comments revolve around the acting, Claire Coffee who plays Adalind Schade is by far the most annoying character. I think her character could've been played by a much better actress. On top of that it took me awhile to get into a Juliet's character she was very annoying in the beginning but then you grow to love her. I am sad I didn't watch this when it aired on tv, but I am glad I found it now. Can't wait to finish it, but it is definitely worth watching. I recommend it highly. Hopefully it doesn't let me down when it ends.",/review/rw3792414/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2013,Eternalkid,9," Not grim at all, but delightful
",Rarely does a series move me to review it. But this one is quite special. The premise is almost like Monsters Inc where the little girl scares the monsters under the bed - just made for adults. And what a lot of monsters there are here! The possibilities are almost endless...,/review/rw3792414/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2012,jdslider12,10," Plesantly surprising, and engaging show!
","This show has appeal and intrigue, which is why I really like it. In many ways, it is believable, or makes a solid attempt to be (although elements of fantasy might not be a match for some peoples limited reality). It awakens your imagination and pushes it a little further. It is exciting and the action is constant in its delivery, which keeps your interest. You don't always know what to expect, while at other times, you may try to solve the mystery and prove yourself right, or wrong.",/review/rw3792414/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2021,Johnny_West,9," Entertaining & fun for the first couple of seasons
","Grimm was entertaining and fun for the first couple of seasons, when it focused on the simple monster-of-the-week stories. Unfortunately too many story-lines about the powerful royal family of vessen, the reapers, the vessen-grimm politics, and the vessen-killing military cult got introduced. The show got ridiculous and annoying.",/review/rw3792414/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2018,ManjeetG,10," A different taste of Grimm
","I am halfway through Season1 of Grimm, and I would just like to say I think the bad reviewers have got it wrong. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, for sure, but there seems to be a lot of nit-picking and sarcastic commenting. This is a very watchable, unique show, especially because of its likeable male lead - David Guintoli as Nick Burkhardt (aka Grimm). Nick's wolf friend, Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell), who helps him with the cases, is fun to watch, and the rapport between the two guys brings extra humour to the show. The stories start with a quote from the standard telling of a fairy tale we know and love, which is then given a thrilling re-telling / woven into the fabric of the episode story, set in present day. This show has all the elements you need - intrigue, suspense, action, drama and humour with a solid cast, plus a beautiful location - Portland, Oregon. Since episode 1 of the show, I find the stories getting grittier - grimmer, if you will (hehe). I like it!",/review/rw3792414/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2011,Nysa11,8," A fun new twist on crime drama
","Grimm largely follows the line of most crime dramas, but with the fun twist that the bad guys are characters from fairy tales and folk-stories. The main character is reasonably interesting, his partners (one his human police partner & a new friend that is basically a big bad wolf) are mildly amusing, and the crimes are intriguing. Only time will tell if it can stay interesting, but for now I am extremely optimistic. It is a show that can appeal to fantasy fans (like me) and crime drama fans (like my husband).",/review/rw3792414/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2014,Mike-DD,8," Less single-episode creatures, more creature/story development
","This show started really well for me - almost a 10/10 in the beginning. It has a good main plot - a detective with special skills unmasking the various criminal Wesen in his hometown, who is also the target of several factions with their own agenda.",/review/rw3792414/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2012,dwust,9," Good show
","Grimm is a really good show where you basically learn that Grimm's fairy tales was not really fairy tales after all. Nick, the main character, is coming to terms with this whole new world and the fact that he is a Grimm. I like that this is the type of show that you can watch with friends, kids, and even your grandmother because it's good for all audiences. I love supernatural type shows and this is a really good one. The only real complaint that I have about the show is the acting, mostly, Juliette's acting. She is just not a real character that you learn to grow and love like most shows typically do. When things happen to her it's pretty much just like whatever, he's better off because her acting or lack there of can get pretty annoying. Anyway, really good show and do recommend.",/review/rw3792414/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2020,draftdubya,7," Good if you can stand Juliette and Trubel
","I would've gave this a ten if they killed them off after season 3. Trubel story is just stupid and cilched . All the cops in Portland saw the picture of her in a stolen truck, but non of them can recognize her when Nick and Hank brings her to a live crime scene. For some reason she has to eat with her hands. Then you have Juliette, the wooden plank of the show. The show slows to a crawl every single time she on the screen. They should've paired Nick with Angelina(Jamie Ray Newman) she is 10 times a better actor than Juliette, but the idiots had to kill her off.",/review/rw3792414/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2012,JohnSmithNot1882,9," Great show with a well written characters and story.
","Grimm is one of a few shows with realistic characters who are neither perfectly benevolent nor malicious. The lead character is a detective who is sent on a mission by his dying aunt to rid Portland, Oregon of evil people who are actually not completely human. The protagonist is not perfect as he frequently looks out for many of his own needs taking advantage of other people in the process. He is mostly good, but not perfect which is exactly what the show needs. Furthermore, I enjoy role of the protagonist's girlfriend. She is aware he has a secret and she wants to help, but he knows telling her about who he is will place her life in danger. The protagonist has an official and unofficial partner which is a great twist in the show because it divides the show into two halves. Part of the show is dedicated to solving the official crime and the other part of the show is dedicated to catching the evil partial people. The unofficial partner is possibly the best character in the show because he believes he should assist the protagonist to make up for his troubled past. The reason I am not giving this show a 10 is because I am getting tired of the show taking place entirely in Portland, Oregon. How does the protagonist find so many of these partial human creatures, which are supposed to be fairly rare, just in the city of Portland alone? It is starting to get a little silly when the ""rare"" creatures account for about 1/10 of the population. However, this is the only major flaw of the show and it is easy to overlook. In a scale of 1-10 in which 1 is the worst, 10 is the best and 5 is average. This show is a 9/10 Great and highly recommended.",/review/rw3792414/?ref_=tt_urv

16 February 2015,deloudelouvain,7," Fairy tales for grown-ups
","I am divided in two for this series. It's not exceptionally good neither really bad. The first season was a little bland and then I kind of enjoyed it a bit more. But there are still things that bugs me in this show like is half of the city of Portland a Wesen or what? Every time there is a killing it's a Wesen, and every time it's a different one, and if you have to believe Monroe every time this one is the most dangerous one. It's kind of repetitive and after a while it starts bugging you. But the worst part for me is Juliette, Nicks wife, played by Bitsie Tulloch. Is it just me or is she a really bad actress? I can't stand her, every episode I hope she dies. The rest of the actors are okay but nothing more. I just continue watching it because I like the transformations and the storyline is okay. It got a little better the last seasons apart of Bitsie Tulloch then... And again, this is not horror but fantasy. Don't get it why they categorize it in the horror section...",/review/rw3792414/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2011,nandi1023,10," Grimm
","This is a GREAT show!...Cleverly written and the actors are wonderful! Our Family LOVES this show! The way the writers mix the Grimm's Fairy tales into present day plots are very interesting. Seeing Portland,Oregon in all it's beauty and lushness is quite breathtaking. We especially liked the refrigerator repair man on ""Danse Macabre"". Of course Monroe is always fun. Kate Burton was a wonderful surprise on the pilot episode. David Giuntoli and Danny Bruno are AWESOME!!!!!!! The special effects are amazing. We like the autopsy scenes too even though pretty gruesome! It's way cool! I hope that NBC does the smart thing and keeps this one going... It's certainly a HIT in our house. Sincerely, Nancy Di Leo and Family.",/review/rw3792414/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2013,A_Different_Drummer,9," Great Fun, Awesome Production Values, Casting, Pedigree
","Not a well-known fact, but although the inimitable Joss Whedon is generally given all the credit for the Buffy/Angel phenom, in fact Joss had a partner who, while given proper billing in the opening marquee, did not often step into the limelight. That would be none other than Mr. David Greenwalt, who was kind enough to use the many skills he picked up therefrom to bring us this wonderful riff on the Grimm fairy tales. It's clever, and other reviewers here have spent a lot of time on the plot, so there is no need to go there. But as Buffy/Angel alumni know, the trick to these things is not merely story but top actors, highly developed relationships between the characters, and sharp dialogue. This show delivers. Almost from the first episode, viewers could not help but admire the oddball ""Lone Ranger/Tonto"" relationship between David Giuntoli and Silas Weir Mitchell. Bitsie Tulloch is a major find, she can not only sell her part but her eyes should be insured by Lloyds and trademarked. The supporting cast is universally good. The cliffhanger plots tend to invite a little peckishness on the part of reviewers, but, to be fair, all the new action shows are doing this, so to poke at one is to poke at them all. Greenwalt has learnt well, and knows the importance of keeping the viewer on his or her toes -- as for example in the episode when Giuntoli's character wrestles a very dangerous stranger to the ground only to find out .... it's his mother. These are the sort of treats we have come to expect from this series and if the writers don't hoist themselves on their own petards (over-write the plot arcs to death) it should remain good fun for some time.",/review/rw3792414/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2014,kuashie,1," Juliette ruined it for me.
","Where should I even begin, Juliettes character was so annoying that I quit watching it mid season 2. She adds nothing to plot and is only in movie to serve as a love interests. She is stubborn, acts like a know it all but knows nothing. She asks for explanation and when an effort is made to provide her with one, she starts acting all knowing. I mean what does she expect. The one playing her role even makes it worse with her bad acting and bad voice. Oh God if that is her character in real life, I would stay away from her, because she is boring and annoying.",/review/rw3792414/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2011,kolatspy-683-220014,," Will this fairy tale have a happy ending?
","After viewing the pilot of this show, I think it has a lot of potential. Yes it follows the tried and true formula of expose modern individual to some sort of secret war/history/duty/etc, but there is a lot they can do with it from there. It did its job as a pilot: introduce characters, introduce conflict, and give you the general idea how the episodes will go. I think it is about time we had a new show that runs the good old man vs. monster bit, especially one that isn't prone to becoming some touchy-feely WB-esque teen drama. While its too early to judge the show as a whole, it promises good things. I hope it delivers.",/review/rw3792414/?ref_=tt_urv
