13 May 2020,questl-18592,9," Captain Deadpool 2
","Sequels are tough. When I first saw this, I didn't think it quite lived up to the first but on rewatch that's flipped a bit. It's still a flawless Reynolds performance but now he has a solid supporting cast around him, a story that has some meat on it and, surprisingly some growth for the Merc with the Mouth. Still flawed, but so much fun.",/review/rw4173508/?ref_=tt_urv

","Not as good as the first one, however it still has a large amount of good moments. A fun over the top superhero movie that's filled with pop culture references and self-referential humor. Very enjoyable especially the end credits scenes",/review/rw4173508/?ref_=tt_urv

24 August 2018,deloudelouvain,8," The humor is what makes Deadpool better than all the other superheroes.
","I'm not a huge fan of comic character movies even though I watch them all but Deadpool is definitely my favorite Marvel character. I guess it's because he's just a bit kinkier with his sometimes vulgar sense of humor. That's something you will never see in the other Marvel or DC Comics movies. Deadpool doesn't fit in that family package as his constant humor is just above the edge. I'm normally not a huge fan of Ryan Reynolds either but I have to admit that his Deadpool character fits him as a glove. About the story it's a typical superhero against evil like all other superhero movies but that little humorous touch makes all the difference. And for a sequel it's a good one, just waiting for a third one now.",/review/rw4173508/?ref_=tt_urv

15 May 2019,Tweekums,9," Deadpool is back; as hilarious as ever
","As this sequel begins the unkillable superhero is trying to kill himself. A short flashback sequence shows the tragic events that led up to this. Inevitably he doesn't die; Colossus recovers his body parts and puts him back together. He is encouraged to become a trainee X-man but his first mission goes wrong; he realises the out of control young mutant, Russell, he is meant to stop is actually being abused at a Mutant Re-education Centre and kills one of the abusers. Deadpool and Russell are taken to a high security facility where control collars supress their mutant powers. While there Cable, a super-soldier from the future, turns up determined to kill Russell for crimes he has yet to commit. During the fight Deadpool gets out of the facility but Russell is left behind; convinced he has been abandoned. Deadpool determines to rescue him; to do that he assembles his own team of superheroes: The X-Force. Not surprisingly things do not go according to plan.",/review/rw4173508/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2021,BrnzReviews,9," He's Back! Crazier Than Ever!
","Wow, This was very entertaining to watch, deadpool is a character from Marvel that never fails to make me laugh and keep me on the edge of my seat at the same time, truly epic. What I loved about this film is the story is that entertaining that it doesn't have a slowing effect at all and the story is very different to the first which is good, no disrespect to the original but I thought this was very good.",/review/rw4173508/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2018,kosmasp,9," So many walls ... torn down
","When a movie acknowledges that it is a movie being watched by people, that is called breaking the fourth wall (the one between the movie and the viewer) - that's my short definition of what you have to expect. Then again, I do hope you've seen the first one. Therefor you should already know about this. It's not necessary to have seen it, but it doesn't hurt either. You'll also be able to tell if you are into it.",/review/rw4173508/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2018,CANpatbuck3664,9," Delivers the Hilarity, Vulgarity and Action-Packed Fun That I Wanted
","I was able to see Deadpool 2 at an advance screening. Deadpool shook things up and delivered offbeat fun when diehard fans were looking for something new from the genre. I thought it was a surprisingly well-rounded movie that perfectly encapsulated its hero and lovingly poked fun at both itself and other genre tropes. It was among my favourite movies of 2016. When it comes to bringing the laughs, I think Deadpool 2 is just as funny as the original entry. There's even more meta jokes, the same gleefully dirty spirit carries over and some unexpected payoffs left me cackling. They build upon some of the previous memorable bits (I admire Ryan for being so willing to relentlessly skewer his filmography) without it going stale. Luckily, they didn't ruin the movie by putting all the funny bits in the trailer and there's plenty to enjoy. They weren't afraid to push the envelope with the humour and stick around past the finale for a truly epic bit that rolls during the credits.",/review/rw4173508/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2021,WooderIce64,7," Solid Sequel
","Deadpool is different from other superhero movies in which it seems as much a parody of superhero movies than it does like an MCU or DC movie. It's notable for its brutal violence, excessive profanity, and sexual themes and out-of-universe references. This theme is continued here, with much of those things felt again. Here, though, there's a lot more references to other movies, which includes other superhero movies, and just other movies in general. Here, Deadpool teams up with Cable to prevent Firestarter from becoming a murderer. Many of the characters from the first movie, including Colossus, Negasonic Teenage Warhead, Weasel, and Blind Al return for this movie. He also creates the X-Force, a new group of superheroes. Spoiler alert: they die. Everyone except Deadpool and Domino dies within ten minutes of being introduced. The whole ""assembling a team"" aspect, which was heavily featured in the trailers, was all a really elaborate joke. Also, Negasonic Teenage Warhead and Yukio didn't get as much screen time as the trailer would suggest. But that's okay because the movie already has way more characters than it needs, and that's the type of joke that only Deadpool could pull off. The movie's humor is great. The Deadpool movies put emphasis on humor, so it's important that they get it right. There are a lot of references to other movies, from Flashdance to Passion of the Christ of all things, to superhero movies like Batman V Superman and Infinity War, which it's only 3 weeks newer than. It also has an extensive X-Men related sequence that was very well done. There are some great cameos with the X-Force, including Terry Crews, the guy from IT, and a really great one by Brad Pitt. It's a solid movie, and a clear recommendation for fans of the first, or for those who like that style of humor only Deadpool can bring.",/review/rw4173508/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2018,tavm,8," Deadpool 2 was just as good as its predecessor
","So me and my movie theatre-working friend watched this today and like the previous Deadpool, we both highly enjoyed this one as well! There's a tragedy at the beginning but things pick considerably after that. As before, the leading character breaks the fourth wall in his narration and onscreen and other stuff referring to other superhero movies make this quite funny most of the time. Also, we once again see some of the X-Men characters from the previous one appearing to help Deadpool whether he wants it or not as well as some new ones who also are welcome additions. So that's a high recommendation of Deadpool 2 from both of us!",/review/rw4173508/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2018,paul_haakonsen,8," Every bit as enjoyable as the first movie...
","Granted, I am not one that is particularly keen on superhero movies, and usually tend to only sit down to watch them with someone else who is interested in watching such movies. However, I did like the first ""Deadpool"" movie, so of course I also wanted to watch the sequel.",/review/rw4173508/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2018,ironhorse_iv,8," Grab some chimichanga and give 'Deadpool 2', a watch! It's worth seeing, despite some flaws!
","Like the 2016 original of the same name, 20th Century Pictures' 'Deadpool 2' is also, an R-Rated pop-culture spitting, raunchy fourth-wall breaking, violent comic book movie that is clearly targeted specifically at older audiences. Expect tons of extremely graphic violence, harsh-language, heavy drug-use and sexual nudity to go around. Based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, and directed by Davie Leitch, the film tells the story of Wade Wilson AKA Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), trying to cope after the loss of a love one, by protecting a teen mutant, Russell Collins/Firefist (Julian Dennison), from a time-traveling cybernetic soldier, named Cable (Josh Brolin), whom sworn to eradicate him, before the boy can kill his family in the future. Without spoiling the sequel, too much, if this story sounds like familiar. Then, you're right. The three screenwriters: Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick and Ryan Reynolds basically borrowing most of 'Deadpool 2' story elements from far more superior rival action films like 1991's 'Terminator 2' & 2012's ""Looper'. However, they didn't use all the familiar clichés & tropes, correctly; leaving many mistakes, plot-holes & misdirection. Things like the 'Rule of Empathy' moral message felt like confusing regurgitation half-digested rehash. The movie could had work it better, if the writers took the concept more solemn. You know, show more of the emotional negative burden & pain, Wilson has to go through, when killing people, in order to show Russell that life as a contract killer isn't worth it, rather than showing Wade's selfish doing it to get some tail from his girlfriend, Vanessa Carlysle (Morena Baccarin). That might work. Even better, make Russell seem like he had some likeable innocent that could be lose. For the most part, Dennison's character was highly annoying and nasty. Nothing really worth redeemable. Since the movie didn't do that, the moral ground seem a bit muddle. So, it hurts the overall, emotional sentiment redemptive message about family & sacrifice, very much. For that reason, I found the movie's story to be jarring. After all, the movie makes killing look like a lot of fun & rewarding for the most part. There is even, another scene play off for laughs, where a minor supporting character from the first film, craves for a kill, like a sick psychopath. It's a bit disturbing to see this movie champion his wish; seeing how many vehicle mass-murders, happen in recent years. The moral message in the film seem a bit hypocritical. Another thing that hurts this film is not so serious climax. The mid-credit scenes including the ending felt like a cheesy cop out; a cheap happy go-lucky end that ruin the strong savage, inhumane nihilism ending, it should had. And above else, it doesn't make any sense; as why could Cable turn baby face and use his time machine to save Wade in the first place? It goes against everything that Wade wanted to do, in order to meet up with his wife. Wouldn't Cable rather use that time to revisit his family, instead? It's seem a bit off & odd. However, it could had been much worse, if Leitch kept the Hitler baby-killing post-credit scene. That was indeed too squeamish. Anyways, the ending for this film, didn't have the strength that previous 20th Century comic book movies, like 2014's 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' & 2017's ""Logan', had. It was highly disappointing. Also, those films, told the fatherhood & destiny concept way better than this film could ever do, as well. Honestly if you cut it away, all the fan service & jokes, the movie's plot is pretty damn simpleton & generic, rather than unique & original. This movie could had been a little more complex than surface deep. Sadly, the writers couldn't go to the next level. No wonder, why Deadpool in universe, lampshade the story elements as lazy. Despite that, the comedy side of the script bulges with rapid-fire one-liners and pop culture references to just about everything kinda works for the most part, regardless if it feels a bit forced. It's mostly hilarious. Jokes like the unfortunate demise of X-Force were funny. However, some of them, like the shot of Deadpool's vestigial regenerating penis is highly cringe-worthy. It's borderline child pornography. Others jokes like might feel dated, as the years goes on, such as the jabs to other present day comic book movies. Regardless, Reynolds as Deadpool dominates every scene, steamrollering everyone around him. Even returning supporting performers are all firmly pushed to the sidelines. Some of them like T.J Miller get little screen time. Thank goodness, because he is not funny. Plus, the sexual misconduct allegations against him, makes me, hate him, ever more. Glad, he wasn't in the film, much. Nevertheless, it's the new characters that really get to shine. Brolin gave a cold grizzled mysterious presence as Cable, which help the film a bit, since the writers didn't give enough space to establish much of his character's background. Zazie Beetz is also good. She was made Domino, into an interesting character with her demeanor, during her limited presence. Even the surprise cameos were fun to see. I enjoyed every last of them, including the Vanisher cameo & the gigantic CGI villain character voiced by Ryan Reynolds. Another thing that work, was the visual effects. It was improved since the last movie. While, the movie is less gory and crass; the quality of action is also a lot better. It was amazing throughout the film, with the train scene being a highlight. It was particularly witty and well-executed. The music by singer, Celion Dion was also great. ""Ashes' was a beautiful song. Overall: I have to say 'Deadpool 2' was a watchable superhero movie. It's a lot better than the first film, big time. So check it out with maximum effect.",/review/rw4173508/?ref_=tt_urv

23 June 2020,JoeytheBrit,," Deadpool 2 review
","Ryan Reynolds returns to deliver more wry wisecracks as the mutant superhero with a knowing, self-reflexive sense of humour. Breezily acknowledging the laziness of the writing, the screenplay succeeds in its aim of delivering crowd-pleasing action and laughs, but the breakneck pace is so relentless that it's something of a relief when it's over.",/review/rw4173508/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2018,statuskuo,3," Throw Things At A Wall
","SPOILERS!!!
There are a lot of things to like about this sequel, however politics aren't one of them. For one thing, referring to a weasely looking guy as Jared Kushner before shooting him in the head and excusing it as an act of revenge for a boy who had been tortured by anti-mutant hospital..defeats the purpose of showing the boy that killing is wrong to fix your life. Since in the future we see the boy grows up to destroy a LOT of life (Hitler anyone?). The point is Deadpool wants his cake and eat it too.
Sorry, the ultra-violent diffused with dark humor is the problem with desensitizing our young society into committing violent crimes. Regardless of studies, because frankly...overstimulation of this level of violence doesn't compute with the simple minded which is what we don't address. It's too touchy to say, SOME Americans are too dumb to differentiate fact from fiction. I grew up with violence on screen, but this takes it to a level where there isn't the consequences.
That said, the comedy also wears thin. Unless you grew up in a specific pop culture bubble, very little of Deadpool humor will land. You also get the sense that he thinks he is already three steps ahead of you before you can accuse him of anything. That smug attitude doesn't work in long form. Being this arrogant and then depending on the audience to root for you to get back to your love interest?...nope.
You just wish his likability didn't feel like a child who is yelling out loud for an adult to pay attention. Yes, it gets tiresome.",/review/rw4173508/?ref_=tt_urv

","What's up suckas! It's your friendly Deadpool again with a bona fide sequel ready for your pleasure. You all probably remember the Oscar winning Deadpool (Fine! There were no nominations, but I should have won ""Best Actress""). It was a movie we'd tried to make for a while, but Fox wouldn't agree with the direction and the R rating that's the only way to do me justice. After much arguing and bedfellow time, Deadpool was finally made and was a big hit. That wasn't it for me. We then had shirts, cereal, a Christmas rap album, elementary school textbooks...you know, the stuff that appears everywhere!",/review/rw4173508/?ref_=tt_urv
