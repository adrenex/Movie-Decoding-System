9 June 2009,TheLittleSongbird,7," Visually a feast to the eyes, but sometimes the story is unengaging.
","I thought this a very well done film indeed. I will say the film looks just splendid, especially the scenes in Narnia, with beautiful snowy sets (some looked as though it had come from the LOTR trilogy). However, some of the scenes looked as though they had been computerised, such as the scene with the children and beavers running across the ice. There were also some attempts to put some humour into the story like the professor's line ""ah yes, the weeping one"" in reference to Lucy and the beavers especially, but because the director had taken liberties to make the story darker, the humour didn't quite work. However there are a number of positives, like the spirited performances of the children, Georgie Henley especially, better than Sophie Wilcox's rather goofy portrayal in the 1988 series. James McAvoy is charming as Mr. Tumnus, and Liam Neeson was majestic as Aslan. But the acting honours go to Tilda Swinton as the White Witch, even with her calmness she dominates the screen, in a sometimes chilling portrayal as the character. The film was fairly faithful to the book, but the added scenes and dialogue failed to engage as much. All, a flawed but enjoyable film. 7/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw8516557/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2007,ma-cortes,7," Amazing fantasy, breathtaking adventures and overwhelming battles
","This enjoyable story produced by Walt Disney Pictures is based on C.S Lewis books. It begins during German air raids over London in WWII. The Pevensie four children(Henley,Keynes,Moseley and Poppewell) are sent to live at the country house of eccentric teacher Kike(Jim Broadvent). Meantime they're playing hide and seek, Lucy encounters a strange wardrobe that lead the snowy land of Narnia . There, she finds a sympathetic but coward faun(James McAvoy). Later she returns at home and the others don't believe her at first, but soon are convinced. Then, all of them go throughout the fantastic world with fauns and centaurs and where animals speaking, a beaver( voice by Ray Winstone), fox(voice by Rupert Everett) and furthermore the Father Christmas(James Cosmo). This magic land with perpetual winter is ruled by the nasty White Witch(Tilda Swinton). But the children are the chosen ones, according an ancient prophecy, and they team up with Aslem, the mighty Lion and real king of Narnia , fighting to defeat the evil witch in an epic finale battle.",/review/rw8516557/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2005,lavatch,9," Splendid!
","With an appeal to both adults and children, the British author C. S. Lewis wrote seven books in his Chronicles of Narnia series. The stories are rich in mythology and religious symbolism, drawing upon archetypes from the Norse, Greco-Roman, Persian, medieval chivalric, and Judeo-Christian traditions.",/review/rw8516557/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2005,arabianardour,10," A Classic for all Time
","The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe should go down in the history books right up there with the likes of Lord of the Rings. I went to see it expecting a very good movie. I came out stunned by the magnitude of the picture. Everything about it is so well done, the casting, the scenery, the score. Lord of the Rings is the only thing I can think of to compare it to. I experienced the same overwhelming sense of awe watching both of these phenomenal pictures. The CG images are very good, though not quite as startlingly realistic as those in LOTR. I cannot find fault with the casting in any way.",/review/rw8516557/?ref_=tt_urv

","After the massive success of LORD OF THE RINGS it would be only fitting to continue the exploration of other dimensions as created by equally talented authors, so when it was announced that C. S. Lewis' THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDBROBE would be given the film treatment I was more than anxious to see what would come of it. Early screenings gave it great reviews, and when I viewed I wasn't disappointed despite the Christ references.",/review/rw8516557/?ref_=tt_urv

","A wonderful movie. The characters are beautifully made from a well chosen characters. The CGI and special effects are top notch. The centaurs, beavers, trees, tigers, bears, fox, all are taking. Oh! yeah, they are talking. The creators have done an excellent job in bringing out the emotions, the lip sync, and the body language of various animal, very well. The White Witch was scary as hell. The final battle sequence was spectacular. I was amazed with the battle sequence.",/review/rw8516557/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2009,long-ford,," excellent filmization of CS Lewis's novel
","The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is an extremely enjoyable filmization of CS Lewis's magical childhood epic. The story expertly weaves in childhood themes with a modern day Christian plot line (including a slightly grisly 'crucifiction' scene) to create an enchanting motion picture. Tilda Swinton is superb as the sinister White Witch. The children are average though young Georgie Henly stands out. The Special effects are more than adequate, with a specially impressive rendering of Aslan. The film moves slowly initially and its epic nature become apparent only towards the end with a vicious (but bloodless) final battle. All told, a pleasant surprise indeed!

10 December 2005,missmissa,9," A truly beautiful film
","When Peter Jackson made The Lord of the Rings into an epic trilogy, I knew that someday soon my favorite story as a child would come to life. This film is everything I could have hoped for. The special effects were amazing. When the various creatures spoke, it didn't seem like a puppet was speaking, it seemed like the animal was actually speaking. And I don't think anyone has ever managed to make CG fur look this realistic. I am also very impressed with the centaurs. They blended a real person on what was probably CG horse. These centaurs were about 100 times better than the last centaur I saw, which was in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. This is also a wonderful film about forgiveness and how families will always stand by one another, even in the darkest of times. This aspect of the film is well acted by all four children in the leading roles. No film is perfect, however. There is at least one shot where the children are very obviously against a backdrop, though I do think there is at least one shot like this in every effects laden film. And while the centaurs are quite impressive, what I think are supposed to be Minotaurs are not impressive at all, they just look like guys in big fury suits, which is probably what they are. There has also been a lot of controversy about how this is some sort of Christian propaganda story, which it's not. It's a fantasy just like Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, or Star Wars. I'm really surprised more controversy hasn't been raised over the fact that you basically have children leading others into battle. This idea is kind of a risky notion in today's political climate. This idea will probably go over most children's' heads, but it is definitely something to think about as an adult. I saw this film in an auditorium full of children, parents, grandparents, and teenagers and the end was met with thunderous applause. This is a truly beautiful film that appeals to the young and the old in all of us.",/review/rw8516557/?ref_=tt_urv

","...is the only word I can use to describe this picture. It's glorious to see how well Lewis' creation is brought to the screen. Everything is believable, from the recreation of the Blitz, to the children themselves, to the Wardrobe (which looks exactly as I imagined it when I read the books so long ago!) and every facet of the recreation of Narnia, the landscape, the creatures, the White Witch, the Lion, the faun, and the Beavers!",/review/rw8516557/?ref_=tt_urv

","There is one scene in Andrew Adamson's new film THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE, that for me walking into the theater that needed to be perfect. If not the whole movie and (the continued franchise of sequels) would fall flat on its face. If the film did not capture this scene I believe the heart and soul of C.S.

","I thoroughly enjoyed this thought-provoking & well-made movie. It successfully beckoned this adult viewer on a journey into the imagination & a world of fantasy. It has a great amount of relevance to the modern issues of child & adult alike. It was dramatic & absorbing in its unfolding story. Thereby appealing to young viewers, but too, held more complex messages for older viewers of any age. It works well on multiple levels, appealing to different kinds of viewers & their personal lives & concerns.",/review/rw8516557/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2014,JamesHitchcock,8," Always Winter But Never Christmas
","As a child, I was never a great lover of C. S. Lewis's ""The Chronicles of Narnia"". The books were always too preachy in tone for my liking, and if there was one thing that was guaranteed to kill a book stone dead for me it was the suspicion that the adult world were using it to put forward some morally improving message. My suspicions were confirmed when a classmate of mine, a boy whose great ambition, even at the age of ten, was to be Archbishop of Canterbury when he grew up, explained to me that the whole series was essentially one long extended Christian allegory. (And yes, he probably did use the word ""allegory"" even at that tender age). ",/review/rw8516557/?ref_=tt_urv

29 December 2005,Chris Knipp,8," No disappointments here
","C.S. Lewis encouraged his friend Tolkien with his imaginative writing, but the favor was not returned. As his elaborate system in Lord of the Rings shows, Tolkien obviously liked to create a world that was an internally closed system. He didn't like the way Lewis worked in whatever familiar customs or myths fell to hand. Narnia most notably incorporates central aspects of Christianity; it's also a world where the children the stories are for enter the story, just as Lewis Carroll's pet child Alice Liddell enters his fantasy world in Through the Looking-Glass  in Narnia's case, obviously, through a wardrobe. Lewis's and Carroll's books also have in common talking animals, though the Narnia ones aren't as droll and crazy as the mathematician's. But Narnia is a wonderful story for children, because it has children who are real, but who become heroes.",/review/rw8516557/?ref_=tt_urv

","The Chrinicles of Narnia, the lion the witch and the wardrobe, is now my favorite movie! this movie was FANTASTIC! the actors are amazing and the movie is just so exactly like the book. If you read the book and are going to see the movie, you will not be disappointed. The movie was better than i expected actually. It's such an amazing and imaginative movie it's just enchanting. I wouldn't normally give any movie 10 stars, but i gave this one 10 stars out of 10. When i was watching the movie, and seeing all the sets and the props, i felt like i had already seen them before. Like they had taken them right out of my imagination when i was reading the book. I know not everyone will have this feeling, but i did, and it was magical.

28 December 2021,koltonbrett,10," Had Me Climbing Into Wardrobes
","One word comes to mind when I think of this movie; magical. I'll never forget the first time I traveled through the wardrobe into Narnia with Lucy. I was completely enchanted by this new world. The snowy woods and the lamppost will always be one of my favorite images/scenes from a movie. I wonder how many children have wondered through wardrobes hoping to find such a magical place as Narnia. C. S. Lewis created a magical world of fantasy and Disney took one of his stories and created a masterpiece. These characters and places stick with you. It's hard to see a lamppost or snow falling in the woods and not think of Narnia. The scene where Lucy stumbles upon Narnia is done so well, we are filled with wonder right along with her. The characters are so likable and we get fantastic performances from a cast we don't get to see a whole lot of in other projects. Every line is delivered with such sincerity. I couldn't help but be moved at times by it. The battle sequences are epic and exciting and even emotional. The soundtrack compliments every scene and captures the beauty and emotion of each moment. Anytime I listen to the music from this film, it takes me back to this magical land, just as any fantasy movie soundtrack should do. As you can probably tell, a piece of my heart has been left in Narnia.",/review/rw8516557/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2022,BabelAlexandria,8," Most Importantly, Do Not Disturb the Professor!
","So says Mrs. Macready to the children, but thankfully they do not listen in the book, or in the movie, which is perhaps most notable for clinging so closely to the original. My kiddos and I have been enjoying the Narnia books over the past several months, and they are big fans of them; so they were naturally drawn to the movie too, which I hadn't seen before. Lucy steals the show in both media, and all of us thought she was the best acted; as the youngest, of course, she guides the others with her imagination, which is validated by ""the Professor"" before all four siblings take the plunge into the closet. Probably the most striking scene is not Aslan's death, but Lucy's initial encounter with the faun, Tumnus, in which not only the wonder between the two but also the tension and potential menace is given its space. In fact, the Christianizing elements which are often pointed out by Lewis's critics and supporters take a clear back seat in the movie, which instead chooses to go even further than the book in ""classicizing"" Narnia with figures from Greek mythology, from centaurs, griffons, and satyrs fighting for Peter to the minotaur general and cyclops fighting for the Ice Queen. Both my son and daughter pointed out that virtually the only added scenes were London being bombed, at the very beginning, and the parallel vision of griffons ""bombing"" the Queen's army with rocks before battle was engaged.",/review/rw8516557/?ref_=tt_urv
