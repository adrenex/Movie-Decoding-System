28 December 2020,sumtim3s00n,4," The annoying kid ruins it
","I actually really liked the premise and that it had potential. But it all gets muddled between somewhat silly actions of the father trying to help his son but much much more than that, the absolutely id1otic son, who acts like he is living in a Disney fairyland where he talks to bambi and every morning skips through dew covered meadows with unicorns. On top of that he is dumb as a doorknob and annoying/goes against his father just for the sake of being annoying and stup1d.
I understand the shock, the guilt and things like that but they overwrote this kid's innocense beyond belief. ,
All in all, quality idea, couldve been a good show but its not above average, often drops far below that, mostly due to the kid Adam.",/review/rw6595637/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2020,farshidkarimi,6," Really?
","The boy goes to a location, places a photo and some flowers next to it. In a blink of an eye, many black guys become detached from every corner and swarm around him. BUT, he runs over the motorcyclist, the loud thud, the shriek of brakes, some houses around, he spends nearly 10 minutes struggling to his inhaler and checking the breathing of the victim and ... but no one appears !!!!!! and no one sees anything from the houses !!!! So, he can run away UNSEEN !!!!",/review/rw6595637/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2021,Ottodane,6," Has its moments... but believe what you read about the dumb kid
","This show has a whopper of a first episode. Suspenseful, well acted, if a little implausible. Actually, that is a good description of the entire show so far. But that I god... damn... kid.",/review/rw6595637/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2020,mrc303,7," Decent show, but the kid is ruining the show
","I don't blame the actor playing Adam (the kid), but man is this kid an annoying, unstable, reckless, overly-emotional, scrambled piece of horrible writing. I am 4 episodes in, and I hate this kid as much as any character I have ever seen, but not because he is evil, but because he is the most annoying, icky, poorly written character I have endured for a while. I am still giving the show a 6 at this point, but to be honest, every time this kid comes on screen I start to dislike the show.",/review/rw6595637/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2021,tvdefrancesco,7," The Kid Adam Completely Ruins The Show
","I literally hate this kid. The Judge should have put his asthma riddled self out of his misery years ago. First off he gets in an accident where he leaves a kid battered and dying on the side of the road like a piece of garbage and then leaves him there to die definitively. When he's crawling around having an asthma attack I wanted to kick him in the teeth. I'm not making fun of anyone with a condition but come on this kid is laughable. Then he starts dating the sister of the kid he murdered and by this point he literally has no remorse for what he did or not a care in the world. He also knows someone took the fall for him and died, and an entire family was killed for what he did but he doesn't care at all. Between all this he's a whiny self absorbed kid who never listens to anyone, admits to people what he's done and doesn't appreciate what his father is doing for him. In fact he gives the father a hard time. I texted my buddy in week 3 and said the kid absolutely ruins this show. And after week 7 it's only gotten worse. I really hope the mob kills him. After reading the reviews I'm glad to know I'm not alone.",/review/rw6595637/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2020,btoews,3," Absurd
",Just ridiculous-I am done with episode 3 and this thing just gets more absurb by the minute. Some scenes-like the Mob guy with his parrot/budgie almost seem like a black comedy. How the judge/perfect dad has put up with this kid all these years is beyond reason-as is the idiot sleeping with the bombshell HS teacher who looks 16 years old. Rich mom goes to a convenience store in one of the most dangerous hoods in the USA and surprisingly ends up dead. Who wrote this thing?,/review/rw6595637/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2021,oscar-montanez,2," Terrible writing with an absolute senseless story
","The show had a good idea but the development of it is just nonsense. There are so many stupid acts committed by people in order to give the story some sense, which are beyond stupid and ridiculous and makes the whole show ludicrous. Rich judge's wife going shopping in the worst part of town and getting killed while at it, hyper rich gang boss' son riding a bike in same area, judge asking some dirty lawyer to steal his own car for him, house burnt with all people inside, hyper rich gang boss' other son in prison goes and kill innocent black man just because he is so mean and bad, lawyer working for best attorney firm in city who was very poor and now is very rich throws away her life and job for defending some gang member while uncovering corrupt police men and prison guards, guy with a camera in his car decides to blackmail a judge with a video of his kid filling his car and no one explains how he made the connection between a kid with a dirty shirt and an accident a few miles away... etc, etc, etc.
Whoever wrote this won't have a writing job anymore I guess...",/review/rw6595637/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2021,strattonsmith18,5," Would be pretty good...if the kid wasn't such an absolute MORON.
","This show is single-handedly ruined by the main kid, Cranston's ""son"". Literally making one horrible decision after another. Trying my best not to blame the actor for terrible writing, but even his acting is lacking. I know that's harsh, but...damn. Really let down 5 episodes into the first Season. Will update rating higher if anything happens to change my mind...but the show is no greater than a 5 right now. And that's being relatively generous.",/review/rw6595637/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2021,zorroaca,6," I Mean Slow
","After a while I started thinking ...""who cares"". And the basket case son is so annoying. So much dead time... and then you have Season 2... WTF! And what type of character is Bryan Cranston playing. He's all over the place. They should have made it a clean 8 part series and cut out all of the filler BS.",/review/rw6595637/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2021,bruce350,1," The empty streets of New Orleans
","Ok, is it possible to be involved in a deadly car/motorcycle crash and nobody is around and curious enough mill about to look at the scene? Even after 5-10 minutes of a kid bleeding to death in broad daylight in as dense urban neighborhood in N.O.L.A? Nobody drives by? Nobody emerges from a house? A Kid crawling in the middle of the street...no cops, no pedestrians...nobody? That's how the whole thing is written, like a rank beginner who has never read a crime novel or watched a crime show wrote the story. It's slow. Poorly acted. Not believable. Even the wonderful Bryan Cranston seems out of it. How did this get produced? I stopped watching it because it's too insipid.",/review/rw6595637/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2020,dogonlion,1," Can be hard to believe
","Ok I know people are excited to see Bryan Cranston on TV again, I am too. There's so much garbage TV on all those streaming services that this decent show is a little overrated. While watching the first episode I cannot help but noticing so many holes and inconsistencies in the story that make it hard to get immersed into it. You really have to suspend your intelligence most of the time. Examples:
Why would the only teenage son of a reputable judge in modern day America drive such old lemon of a car? Would a teenager who can hardly breathe while having an asthma attack really attempt mouth to mouth resuscitation on the bloody mouth of the person he just hit? When the judge goes into the police precinct to deliver his son at night, he gets in there at the exact same time as the parents of the victim are leaving said precinct for an accident that happened in the morning. Really? That same night when the parents visit the scene of the crime they find the inhaler of the perpetrator in plain sight on the floor. A scene like that would have had forensic experts and an army of law enforcement putting the place through a fine tooth comb and that inhaler would have been exhibit #1.
The judge who seems to be an intelligent man tries to clean his sons car quickly with a simple rag, in the days of DNA evidence. Really? Him of all people should know better. Then when he pretends to urinate on the bridge, the cop should have seen flashlight in hand that there was no urine at that spot. Anyway, the acting is good and the story keeps you engaged so I'll push on through but this is definitely not a 10 star show as far as I'm concerned. This is not Breaking Bad level. To keep it in context BB was over the top but that was the style of the show. This one is meant to be a more somber drama but in that context it leaks all over the place.",/review/rw6595637/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2020,StefAwnss,4," Riducoulsly Implausible. Do They Think We're Idiots?
","A plot which heavily relies on the total ineptitude of a police investigation. This story is just completely absurd, as if the police would not collect the inhaler as evidence, as if the cops wouldn't question the legitimacy of a car being reported stolen immediately after a hit and run and as if the kid they pinned it on wouldn't say ""I got told to get rid of the car"" when he was being tortured. This series is absolutely not worth the current 8.7 star rating. The plot is full of holes that are just patched over with complete tripe. Are they trying to offend the audiences' intelligence? Pathetic.",/review/rw6595637/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2021,mt-93638,7," Great suspense but rushed/lazy and overly convenient ending
","Really enjoyed series but it would have been stronger and more plausible without the Adam's romance's. The teacher/student story was a little off but then the romance with Baxter's daughter made it downrught preposterous. Additionally, the death of the mother was never fully explored. There could be conclusions drawn (the judge murdered her, etc) but that was never explained. That was another useless side story. I felt the ending was a bit lazy and overly convenient. It did male for some excellent binge watching.",/review/rw6595637/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2021,POIguy,9," Why is Adam so dumb?
","Your Honor is a dark, gritty tale that asks what would you do to protect your child? What if your child killed the son of a powerful crime family. Would you lie to protect them? Your Honor attempts to answer this question, and I think it does a great job of exploring the ethics of our justice system. All of the actors and actresses do an amazing job. Michael Stuhlbarg steals the show with a chilling performance as Jimmy Baxter. The tone and mood is perfect for the subject matter, and the pacing was excellent. I thought the ending with Eugene accidentally shooting Adam worked - it's a bitter taste of revenge for Michael that really packs a punch.",/review/rw6595637/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2021,davemanson,2," Plot holes and convenient coincidences
","If you're at all sensitive to lazy writing, huge plot holes and coincidences that exist for no other reason then to conveniently move the plot along stay away from this show. It's maddening.
Cranston's talents are wasted on this B movie level script.",/review/rw6595637/?ref_=tt_urv

17 December 2020,corkidecat,2," Disappointed
","Yes, the acting is awesome. But any True Crime fan will be laughing at the Judge's actions to cover up the crime. Like frantically cleaning out the car in front of the neighbors at night, with a flashlight! Like throwing evidence away on a bridge that most likely has cameras. Plus, that walk into the police station should come back to haunt him.",/review/rw6595637/?ref_=tt_urv

18 January 2021,shannonmykayla,9," Love the show hate the kid!
","Cannot at all stand Adam. He's a complete and totally brainless idiot who I swear doesn't know how to A: speak in a full coherent and clear sentence, and B: does not get the very elementary basics of creating an alabi, keeping his mouth shut, or listening to his Dad. He is a total screw up whom acts incapable of normal functioning. Because of him, and only because of him, there is a good chunk of the show that is painfully boring, painful annoying and plain infuriating. Otherwise great show and Brian Cranston again delivers!! The kid who played Kofi was phenomenal. There is some very solid acting here which makes it worth watching even if there is torture here and there in every scene Adam is in!!",/review/rw6595637/?ref_=tt_urv

5 January 2021,livstanglund,3," Makes my skin crawl
","Strange that a tv series caracter can get on everybody's nerves like that. He gets on mine as well, the infamous Adam. So why have I watched 4 episodes? I am the idiot. Who rummage around on the floor of their car on a road with no traffic? No one. You stop the car. Who draws out a bloody piece of cloth connected to a crime with people watching? No one. You leave it there. I guess they are both stupid. There is not one person to like. There must be someone. Or, the only one is actually the mafia boss. That says it all. Goodbye show. Hope I never see this Adam actor again, hope he never gets a part in an otherwise great show. I hope directors read reviews. People cannot stand this actor. He gets on everybody's nerves.",/review/rw6595637/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2021,gallagherkellie,3," Laughable
","Poor Bryan Cranston, he's such a good actor but is let down but the embarrassing script and other bad actors.
There are so many moments that made me laugh. Like how can the son just walk into the courtroom when no one is allowed in to watch the trial? Why would a teacher (who looks 16) be sleeping with a moron of a student with zero personality? Why would the son actively date the sister of the boy he killed. Who also happens to be the daughter of a crime lord.
What did finding out his dead wife cheated have anything to do with the show and where did those hotel photos even come from? There seems to be scenes cut from the show that we never got to see.
Why doesn't the judge at least punish his kid in some way instead of letting him do whatever the heck he wants including taking a 'gap year'?
Why is the lady detective so comical throughout the show. Is her character written by a child?
Why why why did this show even get made and no one after seeing it went ""actually we need to re write this, it's ridiculous""?",/review/rw6595637/?ref_=tt_urv
