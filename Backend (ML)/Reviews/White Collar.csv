12 September 2018,bhester0806,10," One of the special ones
","What to say. White collar is one of the special ones. It's funny, heart warming, action packed (at times). Worth watching for all ages the the two leads play off each other better than any other tv duo I can recall in recent history. ",/review/rw8016980/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2009,Songmaker23,10," White Collar is Clever, Crisp, and Hugely Entertaining
","Think of White Collar as a little bit ""48 Hours"" (the Eddie Murphy, Nick Nolte classic) and a little bit ""Catch Me If You Can"" (the DiCaprio & Hanks rollick). ""Law & Order"" this ain't. Call it ""fun TV"".",/review/rw8016980/?ref_=tt_urv

25 August 2016,canuckteach,9," Fabulous Series - endless series of twists n turns..
","Funny thing about this show - we stumbled onto it on Netflix, and assumed it was a spin-off from 'Suits', since the setup was so similar (that one also involves a con man working with a lawyer), and the lead actors resemble each other somewhat. Then we realized the shows ran concurrently - so, we were pleasantly surprised.",/review/rw8016980/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2010,brainwerx,9," great show, but by no means original

18 June 2019,davidjkobb,7," Charming Show Just Don't Binge
","There is a lot to like about White Collar: charming cast, good acting and writing, funny enough. Where it fails is in the modern phenomena of binge watching. The weaknesses of the show that you don't really pick up when watching episodes once or twice a week come more into focus when watching episode after episode. For example, there is a repeition of criminal betrays FBI Agent's trust, and then wins back that trust -- again and again and again. When watching the show periodically you don't think about it so much, but when watching seasons 1-6 in one month, you can't stop wondering, ""How many times would I forgive someone?""",/review/rw8016980/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2010,j062007,9," USA Ushers in a Great New Series
","USA has been a great provider of action-comedy-drama shows for quite a while; series like Monk and Psych have greatly entertained me. White Collar is not short of the quality work USA can offer by any means. The story is fresh and new, although it did sort of steal the idea from the ending of the movie Catch Me If You Can. I won't divulge into the story at all, mainly because whenever I do that i usually give away too much, but I can definitely tell you that is it great, and every episode so far in some way has a very interesting twist. The characters have very unique personalities and you will easily take a liking to them - Matt Bomer really was the picture perfect choice for the main character, Neil Caffrey - charming looks and pitch perfect acting delivered the perfect character. The music is okay, there's nothing too amazing about it, but visually the show does some good things; how they position the cameras in some scenes were good choices, although sometimes a wee bit awkward. It might not be as good though if you don't start at the pilot episode, but it's not fully required since for most of the newer episodes they have a summary of what went on in the first few episodes. Overall though, this is a great series that is definitely worth your time to watch.",/review/rw8016980/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2010,kiddo-sg,10," Captivating series
","I must say that I was one of those who watched the pilot and was not taken in at all. I thought that the theme for the series was too banal and overused. However, after I read the plaudits for the series, I decided to watch the 2nd and 3rd episodes and I must say I am really glad that I watched them. ",/review/rw8016980/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2020,Calicodreamin,8," Great show!
","I enjoy a show where the cop and the ""bad guy"" are evenly matched and white collar a great example of this. DeKay and Bomer have such great chemistry as detective and con-artist, their personalities and their wit make this show such fun to watch. Like most series, some of the plot lines were good and some not so good. But the characters were just so well cast and acted that it made the show!",/review/rw8016980/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2009,myriamkayleigh,10," Great Show
","I am glad that this show is on the USA network, or else I might never have heard of it. I am so happy that I got into it before the pilot even showed on TV. The first time I saw a commercial promoting White Collar, I was overwhelmed by how awesome and semi- original it appeared. It's not the most original show of its genre, but the way that it is composed and delivered is profoundly different than other shows. The actors (ALL of the actors) are superb at their jobs. This is a must- see for everyone, no matter who you are. You will almost certainly love it and become hopelessly devoted. Oh and I am happy that Matthew Bomer is finally a lead in a show that is practically guaranteed to last a while. Thank you.",/review/rw8016980/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2009,Meeshka_Meows,," Best new show
","Very clever and has your rooting for both the good guys (FBI) and the bad guy (Neal in this case). The pairing of the FBI couple is just right and of course Matt as the con reminds me so much of Pierce Brosnan in the movie ""After the Sunset"" in which he played a perfect con man and there grew to be a grudging respect between the con and the FBI guy (Woody).",/review/rw8016980/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2009,Danny_was_here,10," finally...good TV
","well written, actually funny shows with believable characters are almost impossible to find. Thankfully, USA has provided all those qualities and more in this new show. The pilot starts out humorous and interesting and only gets better. Each character that is introduced is three dimensional, unlike the cardboard cutouts most shows are packed with. And viewers will find themselves rooting for both the conman and the FBI. The dialog is both funny and smart. And the pace of the show is perfect. Fast paced, but not impossible to follow. I don't watch much TV, as I consider most shows nothing more than a way to waste an hour of my life. But if this show continues on the trend the pilot set, I'll be back every week to check in on these fascinating characters. White Collar is highly recommended for anyone who appreciates intelligent and witty TV.",/review/rw8016980/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2009,reyvel12,10," White Collar
","I disagree with this comments, Im a fan of House, Dexter, CSI Miami, etc. and I believe that White Collar has the same potential to be a TV series than any of my favorites. Today is the first time I watch the show (by the way a USA marathon) and I love it, was looking to by the first season but I see this is the first one, can't wait till comes out in stores to buy it, keep the good work USA, criticism is good, positive or negative, but listen to the people and not to just one critic. The combination of good guy bad guy has always worked, and with such good actors and actresses White Collar has everything that is needed to become a hit, keep bringing good stories to the series, congratulations to the writer and all the team for bringing me, personally, another good TV series to talk about. Thanks, Rey",/review/rw8016980/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2011,reneweddan,10," Amongst the shows airing, White Collar is a breath of fresh air

2 February 2013,PartialMovieViewer,10," Well Worth the Time
","Well I started watching this show because it filled a time-slot. I had very little interest in it, but was pleasantly surprised as the story progressed. Tim DeKay and Matt Boomer worked well together from the inception of the series, but I think the best addition has to be Mozzie (Fozzie – or whoever). Willie Garson's secretive and 'off-the-grid' verbal snipes are always worth the wait. Gotta love paranoid criminals. Mozzie is the glue that binds the whole show – I do not know if I would watch without him. I also noticed (and this is a good thing) that other FBI characters are forming amiable personalities. I can never watch shows where all the performers are either trying to, 'out-bad-ass one another', or the police are all just plain dumb, or a politically correct group embraces their flavor of racism or sexism in order to make their point. Now stepping off my soapbox – this is an enjoyable show that is well written and directed. The team of Burke and Neal is a clever idea and, 'White Collar' is well worth the time to watch it.",/review/rw8016980/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2016,yepstein,10," Everything You Want and Need From a Show.
","I did it. Finally, I did it. I watched White Collar from the first episode to the last one. A few years ago, I had a TV at home, and I remember coming into the room, with my parents watching it. It wasn't even close to the beginning of the show, but I was immediately hooked. But I was much younger, and couldn't understand the beauty of this show.",/review/rw8016980/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2022,mosquitocyn,10," Entertaining, witty and funny
","Loved the entire series. Very captivating, stylish and well casted. Good plots and fast moving. The character development and camaraderie between the criminal and the FBI agent is really worth watching. Both are smart, cunning and well matched and often times have to go against each other. Loved watching the charming Matt Bomer as Neal Caffrey. It's one of the very few series I can rewatch without feeling bored.",/review/rw8016980/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2018,seanbowdensb,10," Must watch!
","White Collar is the best show ever made. It has absolutely everything and more. I have watched many TV series and shows but I can honestly say 110% this is the best I have ever seen. All the characters are incredible in there own way but what gets me is how invested you become with them, you find yourself taking different sides in different episodes, you never have just one favourite. I have watched this show from start to finish 6 times and I simply cannot get enough. The bond that forms between the to 2 separate world's is nothing short of a master piece. So sad it had to end, this is the one show out there I wish went on and on because I cannot stress this enough, White collar is the best show ever made. Thank you.",/review/rw8016980/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2019,feyipuk,7," A straight buddy series, with paint by numbers crimes to back it up.
","Having watched Matt Bomer as a spy in Chuck, it's not a far walk to see him as a charming, sparkle in the eye, confidence man Neal Caffrey. Starting in prison, he escapes, only to be tracked down by the same FBI agent - Tim DeKay as Peter Burke - who put him there in the first place, who knows more about Neal than he does about his wife. Found holding a bottle of wine - which rather than being a goof, is a device created to drive a future plot line - he's carted back to prison, but after coming up with a vital lead in a case the FBI are working on.
And this is basically the three plot lines for the rest of the series; each episode has a crime that can only be solved with Neals confidence tricks.
Neal is trying to track down a lost love, through carefully created clues that are pertinent to their lives.
Neal helps Peter with his personal life, while Peter helps Neal using his FBI connections.
You know they'll get the bad guys, but then what series doesn't that happen? It's how they do it and following the ""treasure hunt"" that keeps the show interesting.",/review/rw8016980/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2009,poncy-in-pixels,7," A bit of alright.
","This isn't discovery channel. It's about as believable as thinking that CSIs interrogate witnesses. If you want thought out dialogue and plot, watch HBO's Rome or BSG. There isn't much that's meaningful here, but who in hell would look for it anyway? I'm rather surprised to see the vehemence with which people are denying the quality of this show. What did you expect, NOVA? This is a buddy cop drama. Sure, it has some laughably contrived moments (serendipity seems to follow Matt Bomer around like an overly affectionate puppy), but it's all in good fun. Mostly, I think the writers are simply attempting to show what a charmed life Bomer lives in comparison to his working stiff Fed partner-- perhaps to a fault. These moments faded quickly after the basis was set-up (but aren't many pilots like that?).",/review/rw8016980/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2022,annette-87536,9," Such a good show!
