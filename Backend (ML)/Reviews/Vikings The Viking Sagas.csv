14 October 2021,jamesmoule,9," Calm before the storm
","After three episodes, I think that I am getting the message from Tony Ayres. Other reviews seem to miss the point. Very few people predicted what the fires were going to be like. We have always had bush fires in Australia. The RFS has fought them with a fair degree of success. What those fire fighters faced in 2019-20 was, to use the word of the year, ""unprecedented"".",/review/rw7497524/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2021,glenn-54867,10," Off to a good start
","I thought the acting, direction, effects and story we're all really captivating. I really like these types of shows that focus a lot of energy on the character development and dialogue. Realistically probably an 8 so far but thought it needed a bump up.",/review/rw7497524/?ref_=tt_urv

","While some plot twists may seem a little overused or predictable, I found the second episode, in particular, to be quite emotional. It captures the essence of searing grief with a brilliant performance from Miranda Otto. The pace of the series itself might seem a bit slow, but I'd argue it allows for an authentic narrative to be conveyed, staying true to the slow and horrifically inevitable nature of these fires. Looking forward to the rest of the series.",/review/rw7497524/?ref_=tt_urv

30 October 2021,CakeOD36,7," Hang In There With This One
",I started the watch because it seemed like an interesting concept. Will admit that it took a couple of passes to get through the first episode. Familiar with several shows like this I stuck through it.,/review/rw7497524/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2021,rayclister,5," First episode was a slow burn
","I was in two minds as to whether I really wanted to spend too much time on a disaster movie while we are still in the middle of a pandemic
The first act of the kids on the beach showed how life was normal before disaster strikes. A not uncommon treatment used on movies like these
However the situation that followed was not successful in portraying the obvious horror that ensured.",/review/rw7497524/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2021,boydpeters,2," One of the low points of Australian Television
","I'm guessing the writers of this contrived drivel, have never seen a fire. Never been to the country, never spoken to a fire crew. Maybe they've held a sparkler or two on New Years Eve in Newtown",/review/rw7497524/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2021,ozjosh03,4," Fizzer
","The catastrophic bushfires of 2019/2020 have already acquired mythic status in Australia, with almost unbelievable stories of monster conflagrations, epic devastation and awe-inspiring heroism. So there was every reason to expect the ABC's Fires to be an appropriately epic and inspiring dramatic interpretation of those events. Unfortunately, the first episode doesn't rise much above Home and Away-level soap. The first fifteen minutes is nothing but mundane teen romance. The two lead characters are somewhat dull star-crossed teens, and hardly the best representation of Australia's brave and fearless volunteer firefighters. And nothing of any great interest happens until about 35 minutes into the 45minute running time. Maybe future episodes will do a better job of conveying the terrifying scale of those fires and the hardship and heroism that came with them. But this opening episode doesn't come close to doing justice to the real life events still seared in the nation's collective memory.",/review/rw7497524/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2021,janetteso,8," So far good
","I really like this series. I thought there were scenes in the first few episodes that were riveting and true, particularly scenes depicting people stuck or seemingly lost in the Australian Bush on back roads at night with fires blazing all around.",/review/rw7497524/?ref_=tt_urv

",As a former firefighter I was very curious in the portrayal of the 2019-20 'black summer' in this ABC mini series. I will state my bias at the beginning in that I love to support Australian film and I am not a fancy critic. I can however offer some insight on the firefighting side.,/review/rw7497524/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2021,robbierowlands,1," Home and away in a bush fire
",I was so disappointed in this show so far. Very weak writing and felt like an episode of home and away. Such a shame.,/review/rw7497524/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2021,rosebx-60362,3," Takes melodramatic to a new
","A cast of some of Australia's finest actors can't save this production. The reality of the fear and horror of the Black Summer bushfires simply cannot be portrayed by stoney faced, melodramatic facial expressions.",/review/rw7497524/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2021,Chapesco,10," A lesson for all of us
","A reminder that we need to vote out those who allow this to continue to happen. Powerful story told so well. For those of us in Victoria that experienced this, it is very close to how we all felt.",/review/rw7497524/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2021,stevelamprey-47414,3," Ruined opportunity
","Inspired by real event but fails to get close to the real horror. Instead it preaches and inserts characters to to fulfil a diversity quotas, totally dishonouring the truth of what really happened lives lost and heroic deeds. Im sure the well know actors loved the wokeness of the writing but the public is getting sick of it being forced down out throats. A missed opportunity.",/review/rw7497524/?ref_=tt_urv

19 October 2021,lighthorse-78031,8," Not a bad show
","The show is quite good and the producers and writers have done a good job at capturing the chaos and drama around what happened in the fires so far. The only gripe I do have is that they got aspects of which service was involved and car regos right for Queensland, but when it came to anything about NSW they didn't do their research. The car regos were wrong and the service responsible for Bushfires is the NSWRFS. Other than that it is good.",/review/rw7497524/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2021,grflcarter,2," Painful
",We lived through this and not once when the threat of fires came could we see blue sky. Smoke was so thick and the wind so strong and watching this was not as realistic as to what happened. There was no internet or phones and communication was non existent at the crisis moments. There could have been more actual footage to get the story across. I found that it was hard to watch and I tried to sit through all episodes hoping it would get better. There was the occasional moment when you could almost imagine being there but they very few and far between.,/review/rw7497524/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2021,bac-64544,3," Worse than the actual fires!
",This was terrible. Think Joel in episode 3 (the methadone guy) might have approved this for the ABC drama unit. Not sure how or why people were raving over this.,/review/rw7497524/?ref_=tt_urv
