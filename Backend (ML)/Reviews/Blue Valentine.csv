9 June 2021,jaredpahl,8," An Original Work of Mad, Wacky Brilliance. Gods Yes!
","There's simply no justice in this world. This world where safe, sanitary entertainment is king. This world where audacity is roundly mocked and true vision garners sneers of contempt. Alex Proyas has made something ridiculous with his ancient Egyptian VFX extravaganza, Gods of Egypt. He's also made a visionary piece of summer blockbustasia. Weighed against the sterile ephemera slipping into and out of theaters today, Gods of Egypt proves its worth.",/review/rw3474618/?ref_=tt_urv

19 June 2016,claudio_carvalho,8," Underrated Adventure
","In the ancient Egypt, the god Ra (Geoffrey Rush) has split Egypt in two: the fertile part with the Nile would be ruled by his son Osiris (Bryan Brown) and the desert by his son Set (Gerard Butler). During the coronation of Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) by his father Osiris, Set betrays his brother and kills him. Then he withdraws the eyes of Horus that are his source of power and exiles him in the desert. The mortal thief Bek (Brenton Thwaites) and his beloved wife Zaya (Courtney Eaton) that worships Horus become slaves of Set. Zaya, who is working for Set's architect Urshu (Rufus Sewell), convinces Bek to steal the eyes of Horus from a well-protected pyramid designed by Urshu to give them back to Horus, the only one capable to defeat Set. Bek succeeds but retrieves only one of the eyes; however Urshu discovers the theft and Bek and Zaya need to flee. Urshu kills Zaya with an arrow and when Bek reaches Horus' shelter, he proposes to help the god to retrieve his other eye. In return, he demands that Horus bring his beloved Zaya back from the world of the dead. They team up and soon Horus' lover Hathor (Elodie Yung), the goddess of love, leaves Set and joins them in their quest to defeat the evil Set.",/review/rw3474618/?ref_=tt_urv

","One of those (perhaps too frequent) oddball Hollywood epics where, the first time you see it, you go ""what were they thinking?"" But it deserves a second glance. This film is in the grand tradition of the famous 1940s fantasy films like THIEF OF BAGDAD 1940 (recommended!).",/review/rw3474618/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2022,brosseauphilippe,7," Gods of Egypt
","I saw this film without expecting anything in particular, the trailer full of action scenes piqued my curiosity in addition to the director's name : Alex Proyas whom I discovered thanks to the very good I, Robot with Will Smith. I must admit that I did not go there without worry in view of the (very) negative reviews, from the press as well as spectators, but I came out of the screening more than satisfied. For once I don't understand why this film is being taken down on all fronts...",/review/rw3474618/?ref_=tt_urv

2 March 2016,bbbl67,8," Very entertaining, don't know why critics didn't like it
","It's a mythological movie, always liked mythological movies, and this one was no exception. I went into the movie not having read any of the critics reviews, and when I came home afterwards, I was surprised to see so many critics have bashed the movie. The only problem that they can cite is that this movie had too many white actors in it! This was never a problem in the past, The Clash of the Titans and the Immortals were similar mythological movies from just a few years ago, also with a mainly white cast and it was never even mentioned for them. Since this movie came out so soon after the 2016 Oscar awards ceremony, which was criticized heavily for not having any black actors or black-based films nominated, maybe this movie got unfairly caught up in the fad of the times?

29 February 2016,zardoz-13,7," Better Than Average Sword and Sorcery Saga
","Hollywood has always suffered from a jaundiced perception of reality that creates discontent about its films, and ""Dark City"" director Alexis Proyas' superficial sword & sorcery saga ""Gods of Egypt"" is the latest casualty. Anybody who followed the pre-release controversy surrounding this $140 million spectacle about Egyptian mythology knows that the pillars of political correctitude have criticized it savagely it for its largely all-white cast. Comparably, ""Alien"" director Ridley Scott contended with the same criticism of his Biblical epic ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" for its essentially Caucasian cast. Scott claimed he couldn't find bankable actors of color or ethnicity to portray his characters so his film could recoup its multi-million dollar budget. ""Gods of Egypt"" director Alexis Proyas and Summit Entertainment, the studio that released this 127 minute movie, apologized about their whitewashed cast before the film's release. Nevertheless, this isn't the first time Hollywood has clashed with the politically correct about casting the appropriate actor and actress. Most recently, the botched fairy-tale fantasy ""Pan"" cast Mara Rooney as a Native American character when she was anything but Native American. Films better and worse than ""Gods of Egypt"" have drawn flak from the Politically Correct fraction. ""Birth of a Nation,"" ""Cleopatra,"" ""Prince of Persia,"" ""Argo,"" and ""A Beautiful Mind"" exemplify Hollywood films that violated the tenets of political correctness. Casting celebrity actors rather than unknown native counterparts to attract audiences is the main reason. Clark Gable was far from British when he starred in ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" back in 1935. Of course, a British actor would have been more credible, but Hollywood wanted a genuine star instead of an authentic Englishman. Hollywood concerns itself about making money more than abiding by political correctness. Occasionally, however, a Hollywood producer appeared, like Mel Gibson, who defied traditional casting protocol. In his adventure epic ""Apocalypto"" (2006), Gibson hired Native American actor Rudy Youngblood to play a Mayan warrior. Happily, Youngblood was conversant enough with speaking in Mayan to make the difference work. In ""Gods of Egypt,"" Gerard Butler could have eliminated his Scottish accent, but the political incorrectness of his casting prompted neither Proyas nor Summit to recast another actor. Indeed, miscast as he is, Butler remains a highly sought-after actor and his bankability as a star enhanced the box office potential for this mythological melodrama.",/review/rw3474618/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2016,dvc5159,5," Gods Gone Wild
","Alex Proyas' ""Gods of Egypt"" is a film that is boldly and unabashedly silly and preposterous. Few other words can describe it. It has the pratfalls that beset typical Hollywood fare. It is already the subject of controversy due to its preeminently Caucasian cast. It has both critics and audiences sharpening their knives, a film supposedly destined for failure.",/review/rw3474618/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Overused CGI and terrible performances.
","Not as bad as i thought it was going to be, but the casting was a major issue. Why didn't the gods of EGYPT look EGYPTIAN? The earth's place in the cosmos and the lore was neat and interesting. But the overuse of CG took away from it and the ending was cheesy. The giant snakes were pretty cool though.",/review/rw3474618/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2016,westplainsmom,10," I just liked it...
","Seeing some of the reviews online, I wonder if people just watch a movie while relaxing anymore. I thought this movie had great effects, a pretty good story line, and very likable characters. I even liked the bad guys. I see many people commented that the cast was too 'white'. Do they bitch about Star Wars people being too 'human'? Come on people, this is fantasy. It is OK to have 13 foot tall 'gods' walking around as long as they are ethnically correct??? Do you think Egypt really looked like that in those days? This is a fairy tale. Not real life. Just like the tales of the bible. Sit down and enjoy a movie once in a while. Don't try to nit-pick through the whole movie!

","The visual effects alone are way worth the cost of admission. They blew me away. I went to the 3d version and I HIGHLY recommend you do the same, it is fantastic. The girls were knockouts too, Helen of Troy would turn green with envy if she had to stand next to Zaya...whoa!!! What can I say, forget about Lenin's useful morons and their thought police whining about the cast.

","I didn't mind this film, it's the type of thing you can put on one Saturday afternoon and it doesn't matter if someone drops by or if you have to go to the loo, you can just leave it running, because it's a fairly simple storyline with a very obvious ending, which lets face it we've all see before in one film or another.

22 June 2016,Figgy66-915-598470,10," Love love loved this film
","22 June 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight. - Gods of Egypt. What an awesome film. This is one of the good ones. It's a story of Gods fighting Gods, the role of mortals in the grand scheme of the Lands of Egypt and ultimately a love story. The screenplay is gargantuan in its delivery, the soundtrack is almost overwhelming, This is the tale of a family of Gods, Set (Gerard Butler) kills his brother and steals the eyes of Horus forcing him to live in the desert sightless and without power. Set plans to become King and rule the lands with misplaced power and fear. However we are introduced to Bek, a mortal who does not take no for an answer and will go to the ends of this world and into the next to save the girl he loves. In the days before CGI this film would still be awesome, right up there with Ben Hur, Spartacus and all those other biblical epics told over the years with a cast of thousands and stars aplenty. However we can now go further, bigger, badder, louder, and much more grand and the cast of thousands is created with a screen and a mouse. It does not lessen the impact of this film in any way and I enjoyed the delivery from start to finish. It gives the viewer a glimpse into the opulence of ancient Egypt and the costume designer must have been given a complete free rein with absolutely stunning results. A feast for the eyes and the ears. If you like an adventure you'll love this film.",/review/rw3474618/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2016,DJ_Reticuli,8," Increasingly entertaining and surprisingly moving
","I think there is an unfair ethnocentrism being exhibited by critics of this film's casting. I never heard people complaining that movies about Christian mythology, Greek mythology, or Roman mythology lacked the ethnic casting of their respective regions. Did Wrath of the Titans get demeaned because there weren't enough Greeks cast as Greek gods or demigods? Or how about not enough Italians cast in the Thor movies? There are actually a substantial number of Arab and African actors cast in Gods of Egypt, not to mention the scores of extras about. The two young actors playing mortal characters ran away together, from where we know not. And of course the gods are from wherever and are not even as homogeneous as the critics are claiming. The principal leads are either from Europe or Australia, because the director is English-speaking and is from Australia. Me thinks perhaps some of the protests are feigned outrage over this film's diversity so as to prevent people from watching it and having anything to do with their region's pagan past. After all, there has been one particular religion's more literal followers' 1400 years of ethnic cleansing and attempts to erase it. This is humanity's myths and you do not own them. Get over yourselves.",/review/rw3474618/?ref_=tt_urv

","In this spectacular action-adventure inspired by the classic mythology of Egypt, the survival of mankind hangs in the balance as an unexpected mortal hero Bek (Brenton Thwaites) undertakes a thrilling journey to save the world and rescue his true love. In order to succeed, he must enlist the help of the powerful god Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) in an unlikely alliance against Set (Gerard Butler), the merciless god of darkness, who has usurped Egypt's throne, plunging the once peaceful and prosperous empire into chaos and conflict. As their breathtaking battle against Set and his henchmen takes them into the afterlife and across the heavens, both god and mortal must pass tests of courage and sacrifice if they hope to prevail in the epic final confrontation.",/review/rw3474618/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2016,DukeEman,6," One for the Gamers and lovers of spectacular action scenes.
","For some strange reason I was wishing for a big budget over the top version of Land of the Pharaohs (1955), with a bit of Cleopatra (1963) and Jason and the Argonauts (1963) thrown in. And true to form, it came pretty close to the campiness of those films! Apart from the storyline, this spectacular action adventure sure delivers in the CGI department and creative sound design. It's one for the big screen and thumping speakers, insulting your senses in a most pleasurable masochist way.",/review/rw3474618/?ref_=tt_urv

","This was a actually a pretty epic movie. Probably more like an 8 or 9 out of 10, but i have to level out some of the reviews that really dogged this movie. You have to go into this knowing it is a fantasy movie. And it's pretty darn good. Great story, and satisfying ending.
