28 January 2016,niutta-enrico,10," Hyena Road: a new Black Hawk Down.
","This film is catching, engaging. Characters are nice and well played: a sharp sniper unit, a beautiful lady captain, bad and good Afghans, a smart intelligence officer in the end I felt a little bit Canadian (at least in the heart) myself.",/review/rw7924090/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2020,MadamWarden,7," NO, HYENAS AREN'T FUNNY
","This is a pretty well made little movie about the complexities of trying to understand cultural norms of a country thousands of years older than the conquering force. I liked that there was no judgement, just a simple, if somewhat disturbing, portrayal of this difficult circumstance.",/review/rw7924090/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2017,lhunt-9,," A war tale told in a balanced way, from a uniquely Canadian perspective
","This is an outstanding war film. As others have commented, it examines the Afghanistan conflict in a particularly Canadian way --- which means that each character has a distinct point of view and a unique place in the world. The film makes clear not only that each understands his/her situation differently, but also that each viewpoint merits the full weight of our attention and consideration. Both the nobility of sacrifice and the utter senselessness of war are captured. There have been many well-made recent films about our current conflict with the Islamic world. This is certainly one of the best of them.",/review/rw7924090/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2015,gkpearson41,10," Excellent Film. See it.
","This is excellent film about modern warfare with convincing battle scenes, ramped up tension and incredible locations. Who are the good guys? Who are the bad guys? Very hard to tell in Afghanistan as Canadian soldiers do their duty, to little effect. In my view it is a superior film to the much hyped American Sniper. The performances were all very convincing and Paul Gross's direction was swift and to the point. The atmosphere of working in a very foreign land for the Canadian soldiers is very apparent. I found I cared about what they were doing, as I was frankly trying to figure out their mission. If you enjoyed films like Zero Dark Thirty or The Hurt Locker, you should see this film.",/review/rw7924090/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2020,Muhammad_Rafeeq,8," interesting 2 see war from a Canadian standpoint ( C+Movie ) My Ratings 8/10
","It explores the depth of the decision making in a never ending war. It shows how the ""right call"" may not be the right one in the long run and how its not black and white as people like to see it. Paul Gross creates the amazing story from great research. The love story is a bit hard to watch and Sutherland's acting leaves a lot to be desired, but it tells a story that needed to be told, with built in drama, twists and great comedic relief.",/review/rw7924090/?ref_=tt_urv

","Well done to Paul Gross and the cast of Hyena Road for creating an authentic Canadian war movie. Being a Canadian Army officer, I had to go see this one in the theater. It was an opportune time as I was able to go with my son, a 2nd year economics student home on his Fall break. ",/review/rw7924090/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2016,nickcw-1,10," Excellent movie about Canada's involvement in Afghanistan
","Paul Gross took a few risks in making this movie about Canada's military campaign in Afghanistan's Kandahar province--""the birthplace of the Taliban"" and pretty much a hornet's nest for the tiny Canadian NATO force that tried to secure the region for five long years.",/review/rw7924090/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2015,SusanShop,10," An outstanding portrayal about the war in Afghanistan
","Paul Gross has written an amazing story, using Canada's involvement in the Afghanistan wars, as the vehicle. As a Canadian I couldn't help but be drawn into the events that occurred in the film. I have no doubt that, while the story and characters are fictional, the feelings and actions are real. Gross' ability to intertwine the politics of the Afghanistan people, the requirements of our military contingent, and the costs of war were exceedingly well done. I want to acknowledge the military presence of all the European countries and the United States who were there as well, and I can imagine that similar situations occurred. Paul Gross is Canadian and this film is definitely a Canadian perspective. You have to see this film.",/review/rw7924090/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2015,uncle_booga,7," Big-Screen worthy
","I found the film to be somewhat adrift as far as the theme and the storyline. There didn't seem to be much of a resolution, rather a way to end the film. If it's supposed to be an analogy of the current situation in Afghanistan, well we get that ""It's not one war, it's a lot of little wars"" message earlier on. It would make a superb pilot for a series centered around the Intel guy (Paul Gross). I found the scenes within the CP interesting: radio procedure has changed dramatically in the 40 years since I was in the infantry. But the only scene I found totally authentic was the ""dance in the desert"" scene. This sort of thing does happen spontaneously within a tight knit group. And the patrol procedure and snipercraft were off in my opinion. The ""Ghost"" character was my favorite. I liked the fact that no subtitles were used and that, like the soldiers, we had to listen to the interpreter. I would liked to have seen his character developed. The artillery scenes were authentic and dramatic, but it was the only time I've seen the gunners get a target round on the first shot. The small arms combat sequences were excellent. Total confusion like always. All in all, I enjoyed it, and I recommend it.",/review/rw7924090/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2016,zardoz-13,7," Atmospheric Arghanistan Combat Thriller.
","""Passchendaele"" actor & director Paul Gross' Canuck military actioneer set in Afghanistan ""Hyena Road"" is an above-average combat movie with sturdy performances, solid production values, but its standard-issue message that 'war is hell' is its only drawback. Donald Sutherland's son Rossif Sutherland plays Ryan Sanders, an officer in charge of a team of snipers while Paul Gross casts himself intelligence officer Pete Mitchell. Sanders believes that one shot can make the difference, but Mitchell has a more cynical attitude to warfare. Everything revolves around a high ranking officer's decision to build a road through the Kandahar Province. The first scene, where Sanders and his team drill a Taliban fighter who is trying to booby-trap a road, is riveting stuff. After they perforate the Taliban fighter, the poor slobs slumps down into a kneeling, prayer-like position. As our guys withdraw, they notice some curious looking spots on part of the paved highway running through the barren desert setting. Sanders orders a sniper to shoot at the spots, but nothing happens. When the sniper fires an incendiary round, the entire terrain vanishes in a huge explosion. Sanders and his team scramble out of the area and soon find themselves pursued hotly by several Taliban fighters wielding AK-47 assault rifles. Our heroes make it to the refuge of a house after a Taliban with an RPG accidentally blasts a hole into a doorway in the wall surrounding the house. According to Sanders' description of the man in the room with them where they hole up, the individual sounds like a legendary freedom fighter known as 'the Ghost.' Meanwhile, back at headquarters, Mitchell listens intently to Sanders as he describes their benefactor, and Mitchell is convinced that this is the same native who help oust the Soviets from Afghanistan. Mitchell wants to recruit the Afghanistan man to the cause. At the same time, few know Sanders has been having a secret romance with a headquarters communications officer Jennifer (Christine Horne of ""Survival Code"") who fears that the brass will learn about their romance and cashier her. Jennifer and Ryan agree to keep their affair off the grid. The conflict intensifies not only when Jennifer discovers that she is pregnant with Sanders' child, but also when Sanders plunges back into the desert to kill more enemy.

4 February 2016,jdeureka,7," ""Hyena Road"": Canada isn't just for limp maple leaves
","One thing that makes ""Hyena Road"" excellent is that the film continues a cinematic and literary tradition of the Canadian ability to fight back, of intelligent opposition. In popular literature this goes back as far as Robert Service. In film it goes back to the (serious) Royal Mounties movies and to such Hollywood blockbusters as ""The Wild North"" (1952) and Stewart Grangers' character of Jules Vincent. Because Canada has become such an appendage to the USA in modern times we forget how outstanding the fighting ability of these people and their institutions can be. I do Not write this as a Canadian, mind you. But as an objective, non-Canadian who was very impressed by the combative intelligence and cross-cultural savvy of ""Hyena Road"". This is a sleeper. This is a keeper.",/review/rw7924090/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2015,anaconda-40658,9," A Road Worth Taking.
","Hyena Road (2015): Dir: Paul Gross / Cast: Paul Gross, Rossif Sutherland, Allan Hawco, Christine Horne, Clark Johnson: Canadian soldiers are finally praised and highlighted in this well produced war film set in Afghanistan. The soldiers are struggling to make a road and losing civilians constantly. The atmosphere is hostile but director Paul Gross does a fine job at not only showcasing Canadian military in action but also the state of people living in the area. One interesting character who surfaces is a guy called ""the Ghost"" who seems to pull high ranking despite living in a hut dressed in robes. The enemy fears him and luckily the Canadian military commander, played also by Gross, is able to gain access and form a communication as to their next move. There is a love story featured between one of the soldiers, an excellent sniper, and a female back on base whom he ends up getting pregnant. This is the film's one weakness for it is easy to predict that death will separate this union. Gross previously teamed with fellow Canadian Leslie Nielsen to make Men With Brooms, then he made another war film called Passchendaele. Here he amps it higher with explosive action that never goes too over the top. Gross leads the troop and he is improving greatly as an actor. As the commander he seeks best possible measures that are sometimes intersected with hostility. While American war films have dominated the box office for years, it is great to see a film celebrate those of the Maple Leaf who have risked their lives to pave a smoother road between us and those whose environment warrants little peace. Score: 9 / 10",/review/rw7924090/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2015,mother-8,10," the first and last canuck war epic
","Paul Gross made an OK war film with his first feature Paschendale - but with Hyenna Road he has take a great leap forward. The story revolves around a sniper company in Afghanastan -- they're good at what they do and think they understand the moral complexities of war. To them it's a black and white, right or wrong endeavor - little do they know how wrong their assessment is -- Gross forgoes the normal tropes of war films and introduces us to the new, complex and nuanced realities of the fight - and boy what a fight it is -- The action sequences are a genre junkies wet dream but they come suffused with moral complexity and nuanced performances from a wonderful cast of largely unknown actors. For the nationalist there is of course Paul Gross as his usual Captain Canada and there are wonderful cameos from Alan Hawco (Republic of Doye) and the great unsung Clarke Johnson (Homicide) though it is (stage actress) Christine Horne who steal our hearts and makes this a five hankie film.",/review/rw7924090/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2016,HrSookoll,10," In top of all afgan/iraqi war movies
","Its a very well built movie with a cool pace. Enjoyed every minute of it. I liked it most, because of its much complex and deeper plot than usually in war movies. Ending was really sad, like last time i think when i saw Bambi lost its mother i guess...OK not that sad, but dramatical at its best (for a war movie anyway) Im placing Hyena Road in top 5 of all iraq/afgan war movies. So if you like Zero Dark Thirty, Hurt Locker, Charlie Wilsons War and Green Zone im sure you'll love that one too. So thanks Canada, this is how you do a war movie, and this is how most of them should be done! PS, when i read all those previous reviews written by canadians, it got me even more emotional. So many many thanks for all the emotions :)",/review/rw7924090/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2016,sam-102,6," Watchable, but only just, as a movie; more suitable as a TV special.
","Can tell a lot of effort went into production, and a sincere effort was made at authenticity...but still comes off as a movie that doesn't take itself very seriously, played by actors who take themselves perhaps too seriously. At times I wasn't entirely sure this wasn't a deliberately tongue-in-cheek drama with the aim of a little awkward comic relief; however, neither one works well as it is neither here nor there. Perhaps soap-opera-ish would be a good descriptor in terms of overall production value, not content per se'.",/review/rw7924090/?ref_=tt_urv

","I am still shaking. I found certain parts of these movie truly intense. At one point, I was sitting close to the screen. when a bomb exploded as I was reaching for my drink. For a second I thought the front of the theatre had exploded. For those who think it was boring it is probably because of your age. Not everything in life happens in 30 second sound bites. Sometimes it is necessary to actually pay attention and listen to what is happening in a film to understand it. I am very proud of our troops who are dealing with this situation and at the end I actually had tears in my eyes. I haven't had that reaction to a movie since I saw Dumbo as a kid. If you want to see a true picture of what is happening over there go see this movie. I guarantee it will stay with you for a long long time.",/review/rw7924090/?ref_=tt_urv

He's also in love with his colleague, Jennifer (Christine Horne) who together try to lessen the constant danger that comes with their jobs. When Ryan and his team Travis, Hickie, and Tank (Allan Hawco, David Richmond-Peck, and Karl Campbell) are surrounded by the enemy, they take refuge in a small village. In this village, they meet a legendary former mujahid known as the Ghost (Neamat Arghandabi), who saves their lives.

","Ask most movie goers about war movies and you'll find that they think the only people involved have been Americans and those they are fighting against. They forget that other countries have been involved in all major wars. HYENA ROAD takes a look at the war on terrorism in Afghanistan and looks at it through the eyes of another fighting force, that of Canada. Jokes have been made at Canada's expense but the fact of the matter is that they've been involved in most major wars as much as any other country (another example was THE DEVIL'S BRIGADE which showed how the US special forces were trained and combined with the Canadian team in WWII).",/review/rw7924090/?ref_=tt_urv
