",Thunivu- Well crafted heist thriller with a rooted plot that shakes the public and provides deep insights into what exactly the bank does for common society.,/review/rw8796370/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2023,EvanoOruvan,7," A decent heist with a social message
",Watched FDFS at 2:30 am... Had very high hopes and the first half completely lived up to the expectations... AK is very stylish and charming... The whole heist has a mystery surrounding it in the first half and that's the major plus for the movie.. First half is Cold and Dark...,/review/rw8796370/?ref_=tt_urv

","The movie has a racy first half provided by content oriented at the second half and Ajith scenes are the core of the movie makes it a decent entertainer at the box office! Go for it u ll experience the rage of Thala and H Vinoth! Gibran's Bgm paves the way for the movie at important scenes, Chilla Chilla Song has that mass Ajith moments of scene, The bank detailing in the movie has some good work done behind the scenes by director H Vinoth, Manju Warrior has acted so well coping with her character and the portions were bucks and other's make the scenes comic with their screen presence, Overall a Paisa Vasool movie for Thala Ajith, Don't miss to watch in theatres.",/review/rw8796370/?ref_=tt_urv

","Back bone of the movie was well written story and racy screenplay . First half was totally intriguing right from the movie started . H. Vinoth delivered a good social message in sensible way Gibran songs and bgm were good , well contributed to the movie . Ajith Kumar presence and his character great . Opening action sequence and post interval action sequence were well choreographed .",/review/rw8796370/?ref_=tt_urv

",The screenplay was very fast which is satisfying for the present Tamil audiance.thala presence was interesting and the twist was mostly unpredictable. Vinoth is not just another filmmaker he is a man who really has a concern on the people for who he makes films without just telling a fictional / non fictional story he tries to bring in a thing which each and everyone watching his film will have it in or around thier life and he tries to give us a microscopic view of the things we pass on and sends us out where we can never see the thing same as we saw before. Here he takes the banking/financial sector and slaps on the face without hidden layers or indirect attack he just points everysingle flaw of the sector with accuracte details. I am sure every bigshots will have thier roots shaken after the films impact.,/review/rw8796370/?ref_=tt_urv

11 January 2023,crravikiran,7," Decent Entertainer
","If you don't go with much expectations, you will be reasonably satisfied as an ajith fan. This film was far better than vivegam and valimai . The movie which started as a typical bank loot has a deep story into it. I personally liked the 2nd half . Loved the twists here and there. Other than some action and mass scenes of ajith in the first half, there was nothing more to it. Manju warrier reminded me of Tokyo in money heist. Cinematography and bgm could have been better. The bank shown in the movie is a big bank that looks like RBI head office. I have never seen such a big nationalised or private bank. So director should have chose a decent sized bank. I will give 7/10 for this film.",/review/rw8796370/?ref_=tt_urv

16 January 2023,siddarthdinesh,9," Noway to predict the next scene wins the fans over!
","AK's energy and style in the movie captures the audience by storm! The story itself is brilliantly scripted. I've watched a hundred bank robbery based movies/series and yet I couldn't predict what the next scene in the movie could be which is a real winner! Casting was amazing with Manju Warrier's character going above and beyond. The second half hits home with the social message and puts meaning to the script. Overall, I don't even understand how people are comparing the other releases around the same date with this blockbuster. Thunivu - A Clear Winner! The only place where I can point a finger at was the way climax was shot. That's the 10% which could've been better but the other 90% of the movie easily makes up for this.",/review/rw8796370/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2023,manishcaganesh,10," Decent Heist with Racy Screenplay carried by AK's swagger and charm
","Just go and enjoy this fun entertainer. Thunivu is not the best film for H Vinoth but it's much better than his previous film. AK's moonwalk imitating Michael Jackaon and much more swag moments in the first half. So much fun and racy high octane action sequences in the first half. Second half has lot of director's work that has social messages. Climax sequences felt hurried and rush. Samuthrakani and Manju Warrior shines. Screen space between AK and Manju Warrior was very minimal. Flashback was not impressive too. Over all, just watch this for AK, racy screenplay and powe packed action sequences, social messages!",/review/rw8796370/?ref_=tt_urv

",Bullet pace first half with mind-blowing action layers (best in recent years) and meticulously conceived second half with brilliant dialogues.
