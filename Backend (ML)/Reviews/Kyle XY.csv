19 August 2016,moviexclusive,8," Not your typical blockbuster - 'Shin Godzilla' taps into the fear and frustration of the Japanese post-3/11 for sharp political allegory and chilling real-world horror
","'Shin Godzilla' isn't Toho's vainglorious attempt at re-capturing the success of recent Hollywood adaptations of its iconic Japanese monster. Quite the contrary, co-directors Hideaki Anno and Shinji Higuchi know better than try to outdo their Western counterparts in terms of spectacle, and instead have made the astute decision to make a distinctly Japanese 'Godzilla' that will most certainly resonate with their home audience, even at the expense of alienating some non-Japanese viewers without the same cultural or historical context. In fact, we dare say that their film has the unique distinction of being both political allegory as well as real-world horror, and is surprisingly effective on either count.",/review/rw5422010/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2016,cteavin-1,10," What would happen if Godzilla appeared in 2016 Japan? This is the answer.

30 July 2020,TuesdayThe17th,10," A massive film. Possibly the best depiction of the beast yet.
","This movie explodes with awesomeness, realism, and entertainment. It is a spectacle from start to finish and makes for a great midnight movie. There are lots of conversations and dialogue in this movie but to me it wasn't too much. Some of the best movies are dialogue driven with little happening elsewhere. This movie gives us the best of both worlds with great characters and convos as well as epic action and monster sequences. There are many characters and honestly there are too many but it's okay because we don't have to really get to know these characters. They aren't there for us to be connected deeply or emotionally with. They're simply there to act as the ""ants"" frantically planning and plotting in their finely put together civilization while a ""human"" comes stomping through their world. Its a great comparison to see the humans going against Godzilla. More so than any newer Godzilla film and maybe any of them all together.",/review/rw5422010/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2017,xamtaro,8," Giant Monster and Biting Political Satire
","Japan is back in the game with their very own new Godzilla movie SHIN GOJIRA. Where Hollywood revived Godzilla as a tribute to his more heroic role in the late-showa era ""versus"" movies and the Heisei era, Toho Japan has gone back to the roots of the 1954 original Gojira and crafted a modern thriller about the horrors of mankind's misdeeds, the inaction of a government embroiled in bureaucracy and the impotence of a military in the face of this fiercer, meaner, force of nature Godzilla. .",/review/rw5422010/?ref_=tt_urv

","2014 marked the Return Of The King (Of The Monsters) - Godzilla, at least for American audiences, in Gareth Edwards's ""Godzilla.""

17 October 2016,rollins-19092,7," The Smartest Giant Monster Movie I've seen
","The movie was a great satire on the Japanese Government during the time of the earthquake and subsequent tsunami. The reactions by the Prime Minister, defense minister, etc etc during Godzilla's initial appearance perfectly recreate the indecision that lead to more people being killed in that country than necessary during the real life disaster. In short, this movie uses Godzilla to satirize the Japanese government. A new, more decisive body of government forms in the aftermath and one end of it wants to evacuate Tokyo to Nuke him and the other wants to make a more experimental approach by analyzing Godzilla's body chemistry (the science is actually pretty good and leads to a surprisingly tense climax that involves construction cranes pumping hoses down Godzillas throat). The scenes with the humans are also shot in a very dynamic and fast paced way. Characterization suffers (Japanese films do this thing where they just add an odd quirk to a characters personality and call it a day) but its all for the purpose on finding out how to take care of the giant monster rampaging through the city while minimizing human casualties. Believably too, like how the government would actually react would it have happened.",/review/rw5422010/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is a movie for the Japanese, by the Japanese, of the Japanese. And Godzilla is originally a Japanese franchise, a mass entertainment movie but made in defiant protest to nuclear weapons, or generally technologies which mankind cannot control. The new Shin Godzilla, or Godzilla Resurgence, is a movie which follows the original spirit, but with events taking place in contemporary Japan after the 3.11 Great Eastern Japan Earthquake and subsequent Fukushima Daiichi NPP incident. Live broadcasting of natural and nuclear disaster, smartphones and social media, extensive bureaucracy incompetent to handle extreme situations, discourse about the adaptability of law and constitutional order to external threats, military alliances with US and US's assertiveness towards Japan, all play part in this film.

","No wait, that's not true. Actually this is as political as it gets.

","I'm clearly missing something here. I watched this feckless waste of time in a crowded theater amid rabid fans and uproarious applause. I stayed composed as the stiff clumsiness of the titular monster mimicked the same directionless ambling of the script and editing. I twiddled my thumbs as audience member after audience member laid down a periodic blaze of pompous commentary.

","(No Spoiler) Godzilla movies including Hollywood's 2014 Godzilla have been not able to surpass the original Godzilla. But finally, I think they did. Godzilla is back. Japanese title is Shin-Godzilla, Shin could mean true, new, God, shaking, and so on, and everything is right. This is not like heroic Godzilla we used to know, it is the new creature. But his terror, message, hopeless feeling, resemble the original Godzilla. Finally, Japan created the real Godzilla. CGIs are really great in this movie, not like ones you saw in previous movies. I'm serious. The destruction scene is amazing. You'll be stunned and get excited. But you can deeply feel the respect for the original Godzilla movie. They really did such a great job. This movie will blow your mind away. Finally, Godzilla is back. He's back!",/review/rw5422010/?ref_=tt_urv

10 September 2018,TheMovieDiorama,7," Shin Godzilla is the harmonious blend of classic Toho and contemporaneous optimism.
","Another reboot in the long-running Japanese franchise that has contained actors in giant rubber costumes decimating cities and brawling with each other amidst chaotic infernos. All of those aspects have been incinerated in Anno's instalment, who substitutes typical kaiju destruction with bureaucracy and satirical politics. The result is a sublime resurgence of the titular ""God incarnate"". A colossal beast rises from the sea and starts destroying Japanese cities where the government must form a plan to prevent further destruction. The complexity of Japan's bureaucratic system is fully explored, with several organisations and administrations not taking ownership of the situation. The satirical nature of the narrative acts as a metaphor for recent disasters such as Fukushima and Tõhoku whilst also reflecting on Nagasaki and Hiroshima. The creature itself acts as galavanting nuclear reactor, leaving radiation in its wake. The interjectory catastrophes within the politically charged perspective surprisingly makes for a captivating watch. Suddenly the entire situation feels real, with economic struggles and urban evacuation rapidly taking place. Yet, patriotic optimism is nested deep within the story, with Japanese officials wanting the best for their country. This means relying on other nations for assistance, where any past relationships have been put aside for the greater good. Godzilla itself comes alive through a somewhat archaic animation style, accompanied by classic sound effects. With a violently visceral second act attack of Tokyo that will have you on the edge of your seat. Regrettably, the entire final act felt deflated. The excitement of the atomic rays ultimately left nothing else enthralling, with the political debates wearing thin. The lack of character attachment exhumed a slight clinical aesthetic that prevented an emotional investment towards the story and its white-collared individuals. Fear not however, as Godzilla is back and more formidable than ever.",/review/rw5422010/?ref_=tt_urv
