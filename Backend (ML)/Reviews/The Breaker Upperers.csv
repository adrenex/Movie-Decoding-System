",I can't believe it. I watched the movie and liked it. Then came the plot twist and I totally lost it. It doesn't make sense for one second and she really killed this guy with a baseball bat and hit him on the head with full force a million times and he turned out to be fine with just a bandaid on his head.

19 January 2020,irishjenna,1," Ignore the 10 star ratings...
","This movie is so bad! Crystal Fox used to star on In the Heat of the Night. Take the worst episode of that show extended into 2 hours and it would still be Oscar worthy compared to this. Bad acting, terrible lighting (why is everything dark blue?), horrible background music, awful directing.",/review/rw7622666/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2020,wisemanfromtowne,1," One of the worst unrealistic films ever!
","Tyler Perry wrote and directed one of the worst unrealistic films ever. Such bad a story and bad acting except on the parts of Crystal, Phylicia and Mechab. This was a low budget play disguised as a film. The story was just assinine, nonsensical and so damn unrealistic. You mean to tell me in 2020 your spouse can just access all you bank credentials, steal the money out the bank and take out a 2nd loan on a house all in a matter of days and no one questions anything, among other unrealistic things?..smh. Best part of the film was the film credits .....lol",/review/rw7622666/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2021,nathanmanson,7," What's everyone's deal???
","Why does everyone hate this film so much, I'm seriously confused. I've started watching films without checking the IMDb rating first and I comfortably gave this a 7. I was shocked when I saw all the reviews and ratings. The film was powerful and it was really enjoyable to watch, with a happy ending what more are you asking for. It even made me tear up and one point and I would say that doesn't happen often but it happens more times then it should and it's concerning.",/review/rw7622666/?ref_=tt_urv

24 February 2020,kimbpaul,1," Foreclosure...after 42 days.
","A mortgage gets taken out, 1st payment is 30 days past due only 42 days after ""closing"" on said morgage, and banker says make a payment now to avoid foreclosure??? What stupid fresh he!! kind of foolishness is this? It took 14 months for my house to be foreclosed after making late payments for 6 months (waiting to get refinancing approval after the 2008 crash when my employer went bankrupt) Obviously, Mr. Perry hasn't had a mortgage. Don't know why I'm still watching this dreck. I had to pause the movie and walk outside for a smoke. Good God almighty. I'm determined to see the crazy ending people are talking about. I need a good laugh. I'm gonna need to watch The Waterboy after this mess just to recover a few brain cells.",/review/rw7622666/?ref_=tt_urv

18 January 2020,tmatthew-16064,2," Make it make sense
","First of all, why does it look like Madea fluffed up her old wigs to put on these people heads? We have a lot of holes in this movie. The worst was the cop husband. He legit went to the house and watched a women jump off a roof there. Later in the movie he was driving his wife to the address and not for one second said hey a woman jumped off the roof of that place. Also he would have to question the owner of the house during the time, but he acted like he didn't know her during the whole trial. To top that one, he ran the guys name and said he came up clean. The guy had stolen the dead women's name, so there's no way he could have came up at all. Also the cop should know the name of the woman who committed suicide right in front of him. Did he not have to write a report? And finally the biggest discrepancy, how are they having trial over a man that is using an alias? He shouldn't even exist in the books to say that he's missing. When they pulled up his name they should have noticed something was wrong. If I called myself Ronald McDonald and then went missing, before a trial even happened they would have to figure out who I really was. The bodies in the basement was cheesy, no Black women with millions of dollars is keeping all these bodies in the basement in a regular neighborhood. Not one person would take these women for millions of dollars just to live in a regular house with a bunch of victims in the basement and drive a basic van. Please make it make sense. What did she need or use the money for? Both her hair and her son's hair looked jacked, so it couldn't be that.",/review/rw7622666/?ref_=tt_urv

2 February 2020,deloudelouvain,6," Just watch the movie instead of reading those bashing reviews.
","I only read the first page of reviews, which all portray this movie as really bad, and to be honest those people need to get a life. I won't say it's the greatest movie ever, I wouldn't go to the theater to watch it, but it would be good enough for a tv-movie. The story is entertaining, there are some intriguing questions that keep a certain level of suspense, the acting isn't bad (some actors are just slightly better than others), but overal it's a watchable movie. I would have put the twist at the end a little bit earlier in the movie and developped that better, just to make it more thrilling and attractive, that's all. The story might have been a bit predictable but it's really not as bad as some reviews made it look like. Just give it a try.",/review/rw7622666/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2020,electricrat66,1," You're kidding, right?
","This movie is awful, period. Everything about it reeks of amateurism. The dialog, the patchwork all-over-the-place storyline, a clichéd courtroom scene obviously constructed by someone who has never been in a courtroom, and a ""plot twist"" that is so out of left field and unbelievable that it almost seems like a desperately failed attempt by the people involved to make what they knew was a terrible film more ""interesting"" or to ""save it"". Of course, by the time you get to that part, you really couldn't care less what happens to anyone.",/review/rw7622666/?ref_=tt_urv

","Well those 1,2,3,4 reviews are really so childish. I don't know why majority gives so less to this movie. I felt this it was pretty good about 60-80minutes. The ending was kind of stupid and ruint the whole movie. Still it's really enjoyable to watch and as 2020 it's one of the best movies so far. People with 20% of brain cells, please, don't write reviews if you can't say anything smart.",/review/rw7622666/?ref_=tt_urv

","I read the negative reviews, but I wanted to watch this anyway. It held my interest for a while and I thought it wasn't so bad. Then when it came to the courtroom line ""the defense rests"", I knew there would be no saving this film. Every scene that followed was worst than the previous. It became a train wreck that I watched til the very end (for that exact reason). The bad parts were so unbelievably bad, that it still couldn't bring this rating higher than one star.",/review/rw7622666/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2020,andredejongh,3," A Hot Mess - Many flaws in script, dialogues and story development.
","Right. Where to begin. On Rotten Tomatoes you can read that Carla Renata from 'The Curvy Film Critic' writes that Tyler Perry knows how to tap into, engage and entertain a black audience. Well Carla Renata is cutting the black audience short. She is not taking 'the black audience' very seriously here. Or she means that a black audience is easily satisfied even by some B-movie imperfection? I don't think so. I assume a black audience is looking for some quality cinematic entertainment and not for some badly written script and just some Afro-American protagonists. I mean, come on. First of all Tyler Perry just should have done a very short cameo: he now had too many badly written lines. A short cameo like Alfred Hitchcock used to do would have been classy and interesting. Or like Sydney Pollack did at times, with just a few sentences. The dialogue Tyler Perry gave to his character: cringe worthy. The positive things about this film were the female actors: Crystal Fox, Phylicia Rashad and Bresha Webb. And as the only male actor, Matthew Law gave a believable performance. But uff, that script. Some of those lines. I read somewhere they just filmed this film in 5 days? Well if that's the case they worked wonders. Technically that is. And that alone is something to admire. But a good film? No. The premise could be like something for 'Alfred Hitchcock' presents,' which aired between 1955 and 1965 or 'The Alfred Hitchcock Hour' (1962-1965), but without the high production values script wise. Much more focus should have been on the young female lawyer's life and youth: who is she, why is she who she is and what is her motivation to do what she's doing. To mix this in with the main female protagonist's drama. And where was the script doctor during this whole process? Everything Tyler Perry's character said was like giving me as an audience member feelings of embarrassment. And to let a young female lawyer say she has difficulties defending thieves and murderers and that she wants to quit her job? Come on, this is a well educated professional woman who went through a decent Law School. She graduated, got a job at a law firm. Any lawyer knows that criminals need a good defense for a good juridical system to function well and fair. That she asked herself these questions during the first months of her law studies I'd believe, but not as a grown up graduated law professional. Big flaw. And there are many of these flaws in the script and dialogues. It is a pity. With a good dramaturge they could have made a great script out of this. Even with this wild story of all these old ladies in a cellar. So, four good actors (Crystal Fox, Phylicia Rashad, Bresha Webb and Matthew Law) but unfortunately a ridiculous script going all over the place with really bad writing. Then some other B-performances acting wise. It is a pity. With some real focus the script could have been excellent, even when it wants to be on the quirky weird side of story telling. But now it was weird and quirky in a bad lazy way. I could have written a better script if I would have had the chance. And it feels like there really was more possible here, so it makes me also a little bit sad to see that this is it. That this is all they could have done with it.",/review/rw7622666/?ref_=tt_urv

20 January 2020,deidrekirk,1," Horribly Produced Film
","A Fall from Grace was exactly what this movie was. I guess Tyler did not get expert advice on producing this film. Why did he invite such talent to be in this movie then poorly produce it? The man wigs alone were start of a bad movie. I can't stop just there. The diner seen where the guy was drinking from an empty cup, chewing with no food in his mouth, he looked in the camera as if he was ready for the screen to be over, the leather coat under his left armpit as if he was ready to leave while sitting at the booth. The extras in a movie should not get more fan fare than the main cast of the shoot.
The shaky camera during the car, and drama screens. The baseball bat to the head was worth more than a bandage over the head an black eyes. I understand he remembers and respects the black actors that came before him. However, a check should not be more than dignify. Isn't that what most older people preach. Someone should have enough courage to say to him this will be produced better. Our audience deserves it. It makes a difference in what we have to critique. I haven't touched on the undiverse movies that he always make. This movie just wasn't produced well and is an insult to his audience.",/review/rw7622666/?ref_=tt_urv

21 January 2020,msand10564,1," Laughably horrible
","There's so much wrong here. What was Tyler Perry smoking and who at Netflix signed off on this??? The stock should drop and heads should roll. Why are there no white people in the public defender's office? Why is the Tyler Perry character so anxious to railroad Grace into a life sentence? The judge, ridiculous. The dialogue? Written by a 10 year old - when she continues to stand there in court and say she is calling Sarah to the stand because ""I should have questioned her yesterday""🤣🤣🤣 embarrassing. The cop husband? Don't get me started. He was even dumber than Jasmine and that is quite a feat. And what is the fascination with Kid and Play haircuts?? This is possibly the worst movie ever produced.",/review/rw7622666/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2020,Borntobeactive,1," Simply a waste of time
","Tyler Perry needs to do some research or at least talk to producers who make realistic movies so he can get a hint how to do that in his films, especially this one. There are so many flaws in this movie. I lost interest because the more I watched the movie the more unrealistic it became. I work in law and a lot of this is unrealistic - I don't care what state you're in. The acting is inconsistent and boring.
