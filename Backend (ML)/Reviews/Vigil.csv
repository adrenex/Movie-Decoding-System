3 July 2002,angelynx-2,9," an extended jam on an established theme, with improvisations
","I'll try to avoid echoing other comments here and cut straight to the chase: This is not perfect, but MAN it's so close. I had some trouble with the pacing, which seemed a bit slow to me--as if they weren't quite sure how to work with a feature-length timeframe; I'm still a bit hazy on just how the villain's threat was resolved, which I'm usually not after a CB episode; and gosh, *why* isn't ""Tank!"" on the soundtrack?  Songs with words just don't cut it in a CB score. --But honestly, those seem like such small problems next to everything that's wonderful about this movie. It has all the stuff you love about Bebop the series: the brilliant, flashing action and fight sequences, the character interaction, Spike's nicotine jones =), the gorgeous cinematic visuals, and the dreamlike melancholy that underlies even the funniest moments.  The villain, his grip on the fantasy/reality divide completely erased after a genetic experiment on Titan, makes a neat counterpoint to Spike, forever haunted by his dreams of the perfect future he once believed in. Jet's protective concern for his reckless teammates was never better painted than in a scene where he blusters about how much happier he was without any of them and couldn't care less where they are, only to pounce on the phone's first ring like a worried mom on date night. There's just a *little* more of Faye's skin for the fanboys (but only a very little bit more, honest! we're not talking topless here! x my heart!), Ed has a trick-or-treat encounter that would never make it to American TV,  and even the Big Shot duo put in an appearance (despite having absolutely nothing to say).

7 July 2003,SSJAniFan,9," BEBOP RULES!!!!!
","I've been one of the lucky people able to see Cowboy Bebop:  Knockin' On Heaven's Door at the box office.  It kicks so much ### on so many levels. Featuring just about the entire main TV series cast at one point or another(with the exception of TV villain Vicious), it is one of the best movies I've seen in 2003.",/review/rw2075547/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2005,siderite,8," A good anime movie, breaking a lot of the patterns in the genre

13 January 2008,refresh_daemon,8," A fun romp with some old friends.
","Watching Cowboy Bebop: The Movie is kind of like reconnecting with an old friend. He's got the same sense of humor, the same style and you recognize him, but at the same time, he's matured. Perhaps he's grown sleeker, taken advantage of improved technologies, or perhaps gotten a little wide around the belly.",/review/rw2075547/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2004,Alan_Gabriel,10," More than worthy of being associated with the series
","This movie is just as good, if not better, than most of the episodes in the series. If Bebop fans learn to accept the story for what it is--an extended version of a typical(albeit superior) episode, this movie will live up to the exceptional quality of the series. And if someone with no knowledge of the series watches this movie, they will have very little to catch up on. The great thing about the film is its accessibility to all audiences with its stand alone storyline(although Bebop fans can still get new things out of it).",/review/rw2075547/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2002,mattwakeman,7," in the shadow of the (much) better series
",i suspect that one of the reasons that this film has such a high score is because it contains two very important words to many anime fans: 'cowboy bebop'. and thus it gets a lot of 10's. but it is because of its title that i cant give it that high a score.,/review/rw2075547/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2003,mrplaid2001,9," Sure to at least please fans of anime or good movies in general.
","I'll start off by saying that I'm a huge fan of Cowboy Bebop. No other anime has characters that are as real and deep, yet fantastic and archetypical as this series. Every episode in the series manages to be visually stunning and/or humorous and uplifting while at the ame time being beautiful and poetic all in a twenty-minute timeframe. So its hard not to judge Coboy Bebop: Knockin' On Heaven's Door under the same light or along the same lines as the series. That said, the movie is very cool and very enjoyable, and from the fansub that I watched, I know I'll be snagging this as soon as (or if ever) it is released on DVD.",/review/rw2075547/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2013,TheLittleSongbird,10," Compliments the show brilliantly
","The show is one of the finest examples of anime there is, so when I heard that there was a movie I thought to myself that this could go either way. Thankfully Cowboy Bebop: The Movie went the way I hoped it would, which was that being a movie that complimented the show well and succeeded on its own merits, both of which Cowboy Bebop: The Movie does brilliantly. The animation is both ethereal and haunting, with the character designs and faces expressive. The music is emotionally complex and fits the mood of the film perfectly, when there's action it's rousing, when there is an emotional moment it is poignant and when there is an intensely dark moment it is haunting. The dialogue is very thought-provoking with some nice humour, true to the style of the show actually, while the story has a lot of layers and my attention never wavered. The characters are still the characters we know and love and written just as well. Of course the show had more time to develop its stories and characters, but the movie does more than credibly in both these areas. The voice work is similarly impressive. Overall, I recommend it without hesitation. 10/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2075547/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2013,vikramganasen,8," Way Ahead of its time
","As a new Anime enthusiast and watching it for the 1st time in 2013, Cowboy Bebop has surpassed its era by simply detailing it more maturely with less kiddish characters. Even though the story line is pretty predictable, you'll be wondering that an Anime made some 12 years ago isn't out of shape or features. It will not disappoint you. To add some information about it, I have not watched any episodes of the series itself, I'm merely commending on the movie itself. If you're a new Anime fan like me, it would definitely help you achieve familiarity and conclusion of you're own grasp of genre. With that Cowboy Bebop have to be on your watch list. Its a lot better Anime than some of the current Anime movies.",/review/rw2075547/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2004,sunsetrider,7," compromise between appeal to both ""cowboy"" faithful and neophyte
","""Cowboy Bebop: Knocking on Heaven's Door"" is an animated feature based on a tv anime series (released on DVD) that has gained quite a following on both sides of the Pacific. It is interesting to note how Mr. Watanabe manages to pull off a balancing act required to satisfy both the loyal following of the tv series, to whom the introduction of principal characters and setting would be redundant, and to those who are relatively new to the ""Cowboy Bebop"" universe, of which I am the latter.",/review/rw2075547/?ref_=tt_urv

19 May 2017,ericstevenson,9," Good to see everybody here
","It's hard for me to address ""Cowboy Bebop"" seeing as how it's the highest ranked anime of all time here. Well, actually ""One Punch Man"" has since gotten a higher rating, but you get the idea. I just love being introduced to all these beloved characters. I've seen about one or two episodes of the actual show and what I saw was definitely good. Possibly the most enjoyable character is the lead Spike. I especially love this guy's voice. Even though he's gone through so much crap, he still remains calm and laid back through all of his struggles and is a damn good fighter too.",/review/rw2075547/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2020,alansabljakovic-39044,8," Let's jam
","Great addition to the tv show, I really loved how they added depth to our lead characters, maybe even more than the show did. The villain in this is the best villain in the whole series (well maybe after Pierrot Le Fou one) and I really loved how flawless he seemed, like he was unkillable and our characters stood no chance against him. Also, this is a perfect Halloween movie and also a perfect covid-19 movie!",/review/rw2075547/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2011,Tweekums,8," Fun action film with some good laughs
","I'd heard of 'Cowboy Bebop' long before I started watching anime but never got around to watching any version of it until I saw this movie. Not having seen the series I thought I might be confused as to who was who but the characters were introduced in a way that lets the first time viewer know who they are without wasting time in a way that could put off people who are familiar with the characters. The film follows a group of bounty hunters led by one Spike Spiegel who must find a disgruntled ex-soldier before he can release a deadly pathogen that could wipe out all life on MarsÂ… Yes Mars, until it was mentioned that they were in fact on Mars I'd assumed they were on Earth, in a city like New York! As they look for there man they must also evade various authorities who are determined to make sure nobody learns about the pathogen as they are responsible for its development.",/review/rw2075547/?ref_=tt_urv

25 May 2006,Kurt_Cocaine,10," Anime for the action lover/psychology major...
","Cowboy Bebop: Tengoku no tobira(Japan, animated, color, 2001) A.K.A. Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' On Heaven's Door or Cowboy Bebop: The Movie thanks to Bob Dylan's lawyers and the lackwits at Columbia TriStar Films Cast(French dub): Bruno Muellenaerts(Spike Spiegel) Arnaud Leonard(Vincent Volaju) Stephane Flamand(Edward) Shinichiro Watanabe's 1998 series Cowboy Bebop is considered by many to be a classic of animation on television, oozing style, violence and a great jazz-based score from every pore of it's existence. After a somewhat lengthy absence(long enough for Cartoon Network to release an English dub), the Bebop crew return in this fabulous film(released in North America in 2002 to some quite positive reviews from art house critics) that takes an interesting story and expands it in a way the series couldn't, there's some SERIOUS philosophical depth here, not as much as, say, End Of Evangelion, but enough for your average action flick.",/review/rw2075547/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2009,Quinoa1984,9," as a relative newcomer, it hit the spot very well
","Cowboy Bebop is a series I'll have to watch now from start to finish. I've caught it a few times on TV, and while never less than amazed by the animation and the vivacity and energy present in every frame with the music and action and warped characters, it's not something that can be always completely clear in terms of its chronology. According to IMDb the movie is supposed to take place between episodes 22 and 23, but the good news for those who aren't even casual fans of the series as a whole it can stand on its own feet. The movie is a triumph of super-cool action-bravura and wit, of some bits of real humor (that little girl and the dog, maybe the two most intelligent beings in this universe, are the great comic relief) coupled with bad-asses, truly vicious villain and a few people just going through the motions or covering things up. It doesn't matter, in short, to be a fan of the series - it jets you into the front seat and lets you off into this 21st century trip of Mars where the world could end tomorrow while put to some of the hippest music you could ever find.",/review/rw2075547/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2004,Nigel St. Buggering,6," Rather on the slow side for the Cowboy

19 June 2002,lleshf,10," The Greatest Anime Movie Ever for the Greatest Anime Series Ever.
","This movie was so perfect that it was almost too good to be true. If you are a fan of the Anime, you will LOVE this series. The Anime is without a doubt, the greatest animated series of all time. Everything else is far inferior compared to the greatness that is Cowboy BeBop. So I remember seeing this movie months ago and I set my expectations low because I didn't want to be that disappointed. Boy was I amazed at what I saw! I loved every bit, every aspect of this film. Once again, the Great Watanabe ,Nobumoto and co. have amazed the world of Otaku lovers with this work of sheer brilliance. Amazing production, amazing quality and I just love these people! Oh and I love Bandai, Sotsu, Sunrise. The music in this was astounding, as expected from the super-talented Yoko Kanno. She is in her own domain of musical excellence. The tracks were amazing, and contrary to what a previous reviewer has stated, the opener to this movie is so hip, funky and jazzy that you will want a copy of it and all the other amazing tracks featured in this film. The entire crew did an amazing job! The main characters that we all love, were treated with grace, dignity and were all handled beautifully. We were even treated to new characters that revealed themselves to be very deep and realistic.  The script was amazing, so humane and real and yet often at times gush of sheer 'poetry'. The action sequences were a treat and are unforgettable. The animation in this is far superior to that of the series and are so groundbreaking that I feel that no hand-to-hand combat scenes or arial fight scenes have EVER been animated with this sort of amazing quality and sheer realism. They are sight to behold. Again, the crew responsible in this did an amazing job! I can't praise the creators of this enough! As far as the plot, everything seems to flow together smoothly and just as the series, at times, is almost 'artsy' in terms of momentum shifts and 'high and low periods' where everything just seems to fit in perfectly and make perfect sense. Folks, this film is a product that far surpasses anything Hollywood has given us in terms of this genre (non-animated even) for the passed 20 years. This far exceeds anything in terms of entertainment for that time period, IMHO. Granted, the characters and source material was so good that nobody could have ultimately 'messed up' a Cowboy BeBop movie. But still, this movie far exceeded mine and others expectations. When you read all these reviews you must realize that they are not all completely wrong. This movie is very very good, at the very least. Now, I see that some of the later reviewers were more critical of this then they were praising of it. Now, that is just silly, IMHO. I think these reviewers were so overanalyzed this thing to death, that they were only looking for what may be the slightest 'wrong thing' in this movie and decided to expound on them in their reviews. Don't take the very critical critics in here too seriously. These people probably have seen this thing 5 times straight and then after the 6th viewing decided one morning that this movie was not as good as they originally thought it was. This movie is so close to perfect that it would take the most anal of critics or the most yuppy of coffee drinking critics to find something even slightly wrong with this work of art. So, in other words, the critical ones on here are reading too into this and think that this is some sort of arthouse project that must contain some sort of hidden message that reveals the 'secret of life' or something.",/review/rw2075547/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2009,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,10," Loved it
","I have not watched a second of the show, so I came into this with no prior knowledge about it, and can not draw any comparisons. With that said, I had no trouble following this. I can imagine that I might have appreciated it even more if I had seen the episodes, but this is such solid and capable story-telling that I could jump right in for the two hours of this and not feel like anything went completely over my head. The atmosphere is excellently built up, and the futuristic city is a fascinating world(not to mention a stunning sight to behold). All of the design work is marvelous, and the style is impeccable. Whether establishing mood or delivering awesome, unforgettable epic action(in the form of bad-ass gun-play and intense, high-speed chases), this hits the nail on the head. I saw the English dub version, so that is the only one I can comment on: The voice acting is masterful, no performances felt off. Music is cool, with a lot of jazz, and in general, the sound-side of this is magnificent. The plot is engaging, and the pacing is spot-on, never losing the audience's attention. Editing and cinematography are amazing, and this has tons of incredible visuals. The humor varies a tad, with a couple of really funny jokes and gags. Language is moderate/strong. There is sensuality and hints towards sexuality, though no nudity in this. Also, the violence can get bloody, and there is disturbing content in this. I recommend this to any fan of AnimÃ©. 10/10",/review/rw2075547/?ref_=tt_urv

3 June 2009,moviesleuth2,8," Impressive sci-fi thriller
","It's kind of a shame that, for the most part, animation has been monopolized by family movies. There are possibilities for adult fare that only animation can provide (""adult"" meaning not just for the Disney crowd. The MPAA slapped this movie with an R rating, which is completely absurd. This is clearly PG-13 material). ""Cowboy Bebop: The Movie"" is an example. While the film doesn't do anything that couldn't be accomplished live-action (with the help of CGI), presenting it as an animated film gives it a unique feel.",/review/rw2075547/?ref_=tt_urv
