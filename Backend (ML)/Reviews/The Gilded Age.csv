18 February 2016,phd_travel,10," Just put politics aside and watch it
",As polarizing as this movie is just put your politics aside and watch it. The attack is a part of history that deserves to be put on screen in as grand and well produced manner as can be. And in that sense it succeeds. The filming in Morocco and Malta captures a really on location feel. ,/review/rw7240503/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2016,cosmo_tiger,8," The movie is not political at all and mainly focus on the soldiers decisions. I liked it more than I expected to.
","""Things change fast here in Benghazi."" Jack Silva (Krasinski) has just been reassigned as a guard for the US diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. What starts off as a routine assignment changes on September 11, 2012. When a group of insurgents breach the Embassy and attempt to kill the US Ambassador, Jack and his group of 6 have to make a decision. Follow orders and stay away, or disobey their commander and go help their fellow soldiers. I was looking forward to watching this, but I was also a little worried at the same time. The story is interesting and somewhat controversial and is a perfect idea for a movie, but it was directed by Michael Bay. For that reason I was expecting a lot of special effects and explosions and didn't think he was the director that should be in charge of this story. I'm not ashamed to admit that I was wrong. This is a realistic war movie that doesn't embellish the drama or actions, mainly because the story didn't need it. The movie is not political at all and mainly focus on the soldiers decisions. I liked it more than I expected to. Overall, not just a surprisingly good Michael Bay movie, a good movie period. I give this a high B+.",/review/rw7240503/?ref_=tt_urv

","For the movie I gave it an 8. That's based on 32 years of military service, 7 combat tours (3 in Iraq) and working with the likes of the characters in the movie. Sorry for those who's lives were so well protected that they've never been exposed to the likes of us but, that's how we talk and act. It's a type-A environment and we use it to protect ourselves and motivate our brothers in arms.",/review/rw7240503/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2020,masonsaul,10," Incredibly intense war movie
","13 Hours is an incredibly intense war movie that's thrilling, tense and emotional whilst easily being one of Michael Bay's best films. James Badge Dale and John Krasinski both give incredible performances and Pablo Schreiber, Max Martini, David Denman and Dominic Fumusa are all great and together they have fantastic chemistry. Michael Bay's direction is excellent and more restrained in places than usual. It's extremely well filmed with visceral action sequences and it's also extremely well paced. The music by Lorne Balfe is amazing.",/review/rw7240503/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2019,JayPatton88,8," As a former PMC
","This movie hit home. Every PMC who signs every contract knows they have no US military support. A PMC or grouping of PMC's is on their own. Only a President can order US military action on a foreign nation without the Senate and House Approval. Had President Obama sent in a military for for support or even ordered air support for those PMC's would have made a single handed de-facto declaration of war against Libya, which at the time out armed forces were engaged in military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Adding a third conflict with another Arab state would have over extended US armed forces resources to one region, complicating a difficult situation already happening. I am glad most of those PMC's made it home alive to their families and did exactly what their contract states, solved the situation by themselves. Great movie ,but brought up horrible memories for me. With the facts I presented keep those facts in mind when sitting down to watch this movie or watch it again. ( Once was enough for me. ) Great directing and acting, pretty close to factual. Watch it or rewatch it with the facts I presented in mind and the movie will make a whole lot more sense to the viewer.",/review/rw7240503/?ref_=tt_urv

","Jack Silva (John Krasinski) leaves his young family to join his friend Tyrone Woods (James Badge Dale) to work as security contractors for the CIA Annex in Benghazi, Libya. Both are veterans of clandestine security and former SEAL instructors. It's the wild west awashed in weapons. CIA station chief Bob is dismissive and derisive of their security concerns. Ambassador Chris Stevens arrives to work out of a lightly defended compound. On Sept 11, 2012, tension is high. When the compound is attacked, Stevens and his men retreat to a safe room.

","You won't find anything here about emails and it won't really elaborate on the guilt question. It is almost like a documentary, showing what happened on the ground, showing the desperation that existed. This does take a while to set up the situation many may be familiar with from the news and have heard and/or read about. But when it starts it's almost impossible to take a breath.",/review/rw7240503/?ref_=tt_urv

13 January 2016,SaritaLW,10," 13 Hour: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi
","I had to give the movie 13 Hours a solid 10. I am a huge fan of true stories and movies that are based off books, especially when the story is filmed true to the real. This thrill riveting masterpiece not only captivated the lives of these six soldiers and the people trapped between this battle between the Libyan rebels, but Michael Bay did an excellent job with his use of guns and sound system that he always does so well. You can't help but stay on the edge of your seats as you hope these brave men all make it to the end of the movie. This movie has non stop violence while these heroic soldiers attempt to rescue the ambassador as well as help the American residents escape. This movie will have you racing against time as we relive this Sept 11, 2012 event also called the ""Battle of Benghazi.""",/review/rw7240503/?ref_=tt_urv

13 January 2016,GulforDie,9," Riviting Authenticity
","Riveting Authenticity is the first feeling I had when the movie ended. After watching these events unfold. If you don't feel for these real life men, soldiers, heroes, Americans.... You may want to consider a frontal lobotomy. Or just stop reading and/or watching anything political. This work is best viewed after removing the talking points/ talking heads. Only recount the actual time line of events from the Bengasi hearings on c-span. This work gives a mega phone to those who's voices where dismissed and a heart to those who can never speak again. Michael Bay clearly did the right thing by taking direction from those who where actually there. That is evident throughout the movie and really gives a heightened authenticity. One of the best historical war movies ever. Several emotions smack you hard throughout this movie. The acting was very well done by pretty much everyone. John Krasinski probably impressed me the most. I have not enjoyed much of anything he has done since the office. This is a rare film in that I will want to see again. I hope this work can help heal a country that was stabbed in the gut by the attempt to muddle the facts from that day.",/review/rw7240503/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2020,nagsaptarshi,9," When Bay becomes a sea- superb
","Finally a Michael Bay movie without his typical style.13 hours is an honest depiction of a heroic struggle of a number of individuals stranded in a confusing situation at Benghazi, Libya.The plot takes care to develop the characters. In fact half of the first half is meticulously used to develop the characters and the tempo. But once everything is in place, BOOOM. Once the movie started taking gear, you cannot practically even blink. The director does not make any effort to make any political commentary. He simply shows the events through the eyes of those who were there. Unfortunately, this was the lowest grossing film of Bay's career. Maybe this will become a cult movie in the coming years. Strongly recommended.",/review/rw7240503/?ref_=tt_urv

13 January 2016,dlevans-52743,9," Intense movie, that raises almost as many questions as the answers that it provides.
","I found this movie to be very intense and riveting. The audience seemed to have a need to make an unusual number of trips to the snack bar and rest room and I found myself becoming frustrated by the number of interruptions. The movie is not for the faint of heart, as there are a number of scenes with graphic depiction of injuries. Regardless of your political affiliation, if you have any thoughts about what happened at Benghazi, you need to see this movie. Michael Bay does a great job of portraying what happened. Additionally, with the exception of one individual who s portrayed as not wanting to take action, he does not take the obvious opportunity to lay blame at any single individual in the US government. He clearly portrays a small group of men as heroes. Without their courage and willingness to fight against what appears to be an overwhelming force many more lives would have been lost. I do not often see movies twice, but this movie is likely to be an exception... In closing, if Michael Bay is 90% accurate in his depiction of what happened, our government (the US government), owes a huge debt of gratitude and an apology for their lack of action to 6 very brave men.",/review/rw7240503/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2018,Leofwine_draca,9," Best military thriller to come out of Hollywood in a long time
","13 HOURS is an exemplary true story war thriller set in Benghazi in 2012, where a number of US contractors working for the CIA found themselves under siege by an army of Libyan militants determined to destroy outside influence in their country in the aftermath of Colonel Gaddafi's demise. The film follows a siege scenario as various tough, trained figures attempt to defend two separate compounds from the murderous militants, and despite a lengthy running time this is never less than edge-of-the-seat great. The real surprise is that it was directed by Michael Bay and is far and away his best movie, head and shoulders above his usual bombastic flag-waving silliness. This goes for taught realism throughout and has some wonderful action set-pieces which utilise amazing sets, effects, and camerawork to put the viewer into the heart of pitched gun battles and the like. Intensity is the keyword here and as such the running time absolutely flies past. I can't recommend this enough; it's the best action-based modern-day military thriller I've seen since BLACK HAWK DOWN and is of a similar quality.",/review/rw7240503/?ref_=tt_urv

","13 Hours was absolutely riveting, no question. And it raises serious questions about the Benghazi attack, questions which have yet to be answered. But it's clear why critics are dissing it--it shows Americans as veritable superheroes in a country gone berserk. Also, the movie makes no bones of the fact that the whole ""protest over an anti-Islamic video"" explanation was totally bogus, and our country, protected by true blue men and women willing to give their lives, is run by a bunch of jackasses. I hope Hillary goes down for this. But three years later, no one has even been fired. ",/review/rw7240503/?ref_=tt_urv
