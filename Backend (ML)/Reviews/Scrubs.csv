17 April 2017,DavidYZ,7," Series 1-7 were very good; series 8 is dreadful
","For the first seven series, this was a very funny sitcom about a landlady and her lodger - as well as several other characters. These strong characters and their interactions brought a lot of laughs.",/review/rw2541347/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2006,bs3dc,," Finally, a BBC comedy with some laughs in it!
","""Not Going Out"" has a very simple set-up. Kate, a successful American lives with her friend Lee, a hopeless, almost unemployable layabout Northerner. Also on the scene is her ex-boyfriend Tim, a Southerner who cheated on her with a younger woman. Cynically the inclusion of an American sounds like a way of introducing it to the overseas market, but it works quite well as a large amount of the humour comes from the chalk and cheese relationship of the characters, especially between Lee and Kate. Most of the laughs come from fast-paced joke telling, no surprise to anyone who has seen Tim Vine on stage as he holds the Guiness World Record for the most jokes told in an hour. All the leads are very good at the delivery, with Megan Dodds managing to keep up well with the two stand-up comedians.",/review/rw2541347/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2006,holly1979,10," Unashamedly stupid and fantastically funny!
","When I saw the write-up for 'Not Going Out', I was dubious - Friday evening on BBC1 isn't usually fertile ground for good comedy. I actually watched it almost by accident, but it turned out to be a happy accident, because 'Not Going Out' is an underrated gem.",/review/rw2541347/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2022,prylands-389-567480,4," Long Time since this was funny
","Ah - this used to be genuinely funny and very clever - but alas, no longer.",/review/rw2541347/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2016,Sleepin_Dragon,9," A comedy corker, Mack and co truly keep coming up with the goods.
","Not going out is proof that British sitcoms can still be funny. There was a definite (and still is) baron period in Britcoms, Not going out proved a welcome show to our screens. Series one feels a little at odds to the rest of the show, Series one focused mainly on the cultural differences between Lee and Kate. Enter Lucy in Series two and the whole dynamic of the show changed. I love the entire cast, I am missing Tim Vine very much, but I just love Katy Wix, her scatty character is just too funny. I'm a huge fan of Lee Mack, I genuinely get and love his brand of humour.",/review/rw2541347/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2021,gilleliath,3," long since time it was put to bed
","On Would I Lie To You, Lee Mack consistently shows himself to be one of the quickest and wittiest people on TV; and his stand-up is okay too. But there is no surer sign of the current weakness of British sitcom than the fact that this show has continued for15(!) years and, not only that, is still being given Xmas specials (albeit at 10pm two days before Christmas).",/review/rw2541347/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2006,amjpedersen,10," Comedy drought over!
","Having seen Lee Mack live earlier this year, i had been looking forward to seeing Not Going Out for quite some time. I've found Friday nights to be a little dry on decent comedy for quite a while now and hoped Lee would bring a little ray of sunshine to my favourite night of the week. I'm thrilled to say I wasn't disappointed and Not Going Out delivered the goods like a 10 ton truck! The leads were all great in their roles delivering funny performances with plenty of laughs. Lee, you've done a grand job and I hope that the BBC have the good sense to recommission you for a second series! Folks, don't fear the TV come Friday night, decent comedy has returned! I look forward to buying your live DVD next month.",/review/rw2541347/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2018,joereporterrsa,8," Gem of a comedy (more than a sitcom) but time to end off.
","Yes, it's 2018 and I've just discovered this show. Thanks to technology and binge watching it didn't take years to realize that the show is getting lost without the excellent supporting actors/actresses. I still think that Lee Mack does/did a sterling job. Not sure if there'll be a season 10 in 2019 but wouldn't be sad if there wasn't. The show seemed to fall flat with the departure of Tim and Barbara. The show still has it laughs but I feel the early episodes were laugh a minute and Lee & Tim were really good foils for each other. Tim was always so serious but always looked like he was ready to burst into laughter. I don't want to drop stars because it seemed to weaken, most shows do. I'm not from Great Britain but my mom and her family are so I've been exposed to British humour from birth and absolutely love it.",/review/rw2541347/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2006,stephenclayton,10," Definitely ""not going out"" when this is on the box
",A refreshing comedy full of wit and one liners that could only be delivered by Lee Mack and Tim Vine (both ex-the sketch show).,/review/rw2541347/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2006,Voetsek,10," Very Funny
","Few and far between in the last decade; a British comedy that is funny. Lee Mack on top form, Tim Vine, less frenetic compared to his stand up but excellent nonetheless and Megan Dodds playing the role of the straight man(woman) perfectly. Anyone who has seen or heard Lee Mack will know that when he plays restrained in this he could be about to explode with even funnier lines. Ditto for Tim Vine but in terms of the speed of delivery of his jokes. Any complaints about the US style scene links - nice shots of London by day and night - are just carping. If you don't like this then go to the other end of the spectrum and watch My Family. Robert Lindsay and all those responsible for that turd of a ""sitcom"" should watch Not Going Out, realise that My Family is a crime against humanity and kill themselves. Lee Mack for PM!",/review/rw2541347/?ref_=tt_urv

21 October 2006,esmecrowfoot,9," Very Very Funny!
","I didn't expect much from this programme when it first aired and it was only on as I hadn't turned over from the previous programme. Now I'm glad I didn't! Not often is there a programme on that makes me literally laugh out loud - normally I'm just a smile-on-my-face kind of girl, but this was so so funny I couldn't help it! The jokes come thick and fast as one liners, with very clever word play which I think is reminiscent of the Two Ronnies. It sometimes borders on the very rude, but doesn't go too far into this territory as to spoil it.",/review/rw2541347/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2021,jjparish,10," Where have the kids gone?
","LOL dont get me wrong. I dont miss them in the slightest. The not going out kids were truly, truly awful actors and i hope whoever casted them is currently out of work and on the dole. But they have disppeared from the current series and there is no explanation why. Are they that toxic now that they cant even be mentioned?",/review/rw2541347/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2006,martin-1345,8," A witty sitcom! Most refreshing!
","The following remarks applied to the episode that went out on 13th October. I'm sorry to say the next week's episode was less funny, and just to confirm the trend, last night's episode hardly coaxed a smile out of me! Either I'm rapidly losing my sense of humour or the format and jokes have slipped into a rut in record-breaking time. A shame - we need something out-of-the-ordinary on a Friday - or any night, for that matter!",/review/rw2541347/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2021,miaalike,8," Consistent comedy, classical style
","Start with the first series. They are filled to the brim with Lee Mack's signature humour, there is also Miranda, and Tim Vine and later on the Daisy character. It is simply consistent. Good bread at the table of entertainment. Not too heavy, not superficial, because it manages to stay witty and clever most of the time. Then Tim leaves. The show goes a bit low, a bit more, but, hey, it is Lee Mack that carries it and so he does further. Enter new characters. Later on, the series makes a huge jump, in terms of premise and it feels somehow stuck for quite a few seasons. But hey, since it did not gave up, and because it became our friend, we can keep watching. Then it hits here and there a few better episodes. Too much bickering... a much waited Christmas special... a clever plot... a few stale episodes. Overall it is great that is goes on. Good news, the most recent series seems to have hit the jackpot with fresh jokes and fresh situational comedy. This sets up good expectations for the next one (series 12).",/review/rw2541347/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2012,foffster,6," Why would Lee want Lucy?
","As a Norwegian, I can really appreciate much of the humor coming form the UK. The best of it is unmatchable, with smarts, characters you believe in and very very funny, I would say. Not Going Out is not that kind of series, with its dumb approach and rather flat two leading roles.",/review/rw2541347/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2006,enigmawarrior,9," Not Going Out - Friday night comedy is back!
","On the first showing, I thought, 'well, that could have been better'. The second episode came on and I decided to give it another try. I laughed myself silly. This proves that comedy on Friday nights is finally making a comeback. Only into the fourth episode and I'm looking forward to the next episode. Lee Mack is brilliant and his timing is perfect. Tim Vine comes out with some great one liners. As for Megan Dodds, wow. Not only is she gorgeous, she can act. She may be just the reason I returned for a second helping and I'm glad I did. There maybe a few cheap laughs here and there, but they just warm you up for the smattering of funny gags, slapstick falls and superb lines. Worth staying in for. I just hope we see a second series and a DVD box-set.",/review/rw2541347/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2014,theguests-southport,4," Time for Total Confinement
","The first few series were amusing and contained some above-average episodes demonstrating wit and humour – above-average for a sitcom, that is! ",/review/rw2541347/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2015,Irishchatter,9," Definitely will make you laugh out loud!
","You really just have to laugh at Lee Mack, he is just so droll at telling his slack off jokes that you really think is just so hilarious! I liked the way that he was playing more of himself then any other character. I wouldn't think he wouldn't be a good actor of other people because he can play himself so well!",/review/rw2541347/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2014,rumour-mill,5," This really should have been axed a long time ago
","Not Going Out started promisingly. It was clearly a vehicle for Lee Mack and Tim Vine's one-liner stand-up comedy, but it still managed to be passable.",/review/rw2541347/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2022,bosporan,5," Was fun - now past its use-by date
","Initially this was enjoyable - now it grates with American style canned laughter, wooden delivery and risible puerile humour. Should be put out of its misery.",/review/rw2541347/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2021,hicster-29076,8," Can still be funny
","I realize they had to update the show with kids, but the show is at its best with the adults. or maybe its the writers. bring back Daisy :)",/review/rw2541347/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2013,Elliotb-butler18,10," Comedy Genius..... Another British Comedy Gold
","Not Going Out is a brilliant BBC comedy show that centres around Lee (Lee Mack), a slacker who lives in a London apartment with his lodger Lucy ( Sally Bretton) who is also his best friend Tim's (Tim Vine) sister. This will be a comedy classic years into the future as it is one of BBC many hilarious comedies. As soon as i watched repeats on Dave i bought the box set as i thought it was hilarious. Tim Vine And Lee Mack play hilarious characters, although since Tim Vine has left it has been less funny but still 100% enjoyable. Katy Wix and Miranda Hart also play hilarious characters as the cleaner and Tim's dimwitted girlfriend. Not Going Out is another brilliant comedy from the BBC and i hope there are more to come.",/review/rw2541347/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2006,pinkISH,10," excellent show!!!
","In the last few years, very few comedy shows have caught my attention. If I have to name any, I would say Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm. This is up there with those classics! It has an American air to it, combined with British cinematography. The jokes are great and they combine noir-ish British humor with the American style. The show has a lot of potential and I think it'll catch on overseas, as well. Other British shows that I enjoy (Ideal, Respectable) might disappoint American viewers because of the raw British humor, but Not Going Out really hits that laughing spot!",/review/rw2541347/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2011,Gong5,," Brilliant Comedy
",I m so glad this series continues on the bbc! It's so often that you discover a series and then you find out it's been canceled. TV is a strange medium that not always rewards the better efforts. ,/review/rw2541347/?ref_=tt_urv
