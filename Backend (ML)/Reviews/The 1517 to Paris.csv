29 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," You'll want to binge it as quick as possible!
","Orange is the New Black was one of Netflixs first breakout shows. It really is every bit as good as everyone says and is definitely worth watching. It's about the lives of inmates and the guards of a women prison. It starts with a woman who is sent to prison for transporting drug money to her ex-girlfriend. She's a good person who doesn't deserve to be in jail but still ends up there. I was entertained throughout the entire series. It covers issues that are relevant today and shines a light on even more problems that people should know about. Having said that, I think Wentworth is the better show about a women's prison. This is a show that is best watched binge watching it. If you haven't seen this yet do yourself a favor and go check it out!",/review/rw3259431/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2022,Supermanfan-13,8," Definitely Worth Watching!
","Orange is the New Black is every bit as good as everyone says and is definitely worth watching. I was entertained throughout the entire series. This series won a ton of awards throughout its run and for very good reason. Having said that, I think Wentworth is the better show about a women's prison.

4 April 2020,POIguy,9," One of Netflix's first great shows
","Orange is the New Black was one of the first Netflix original shows. Luckily, it was really great with great storylines. When the show first came out, it was groundbreaking. It had a very diverse cast, all of which had great character arcs. Even the guards had good stories. I loved the flashbacks, which gave context to different stories. The first 6 seasons were just amazing. Season 7 I think leaned a little too heavy on the social issues which detracted from the overall story. I also really disliked Piper and Alex in the last few seasons. Overall great show and one of Netflix's first great shows.",/review/rw3259431/?ref_=tt_urv

13 October 2022,this2willp4ss,10," 10/10 for first 3 seasons & the last.
","If you ask me about my favorite series, OITNB will always be at the top of my favorite list. I've watched it before and here i am rewatching it with my sister!!",/review/rw3259431/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2019,kdupes-1,7," Not as funny as it used to be
","Season 7 is going a tad bit overboard trying to hit all the political hot button issues.
I'm all for trying to get the message out but every storyline deals with an unfortunate issue and it's kinda depressing.
> You've got female genital mutilation, unlawful deportation, poor treatment by ice agents to immigrants being held, the ""me too"" movement both the cause and the effect and the validity on both sides of the story. The illegal immigrant mother getting her children taken away, etc.
> I still like the show but it has completely changed it doesn't seem like a work of fiction anymore. Its heavy and feels more like a platform for political awareness.",/review/rw3259431/?ref_=tt_urv

12 August 2022,srigging,9," 7 seasons /91 episodes of Genius Storytelling
","From the very beginning of episode 1, the series captures the viewer & continues through 7 seasons / 91 episodes of storytelling reality of characters experiences as inmates and employees within a women's correctional facility. Flaws et al. Geniusly written, produced, directed & characters brought to life by amazing actors. Binge worthy. Bravo!",/review/rw3259431/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2022,tindfoting,8," Very good, but NOT flawless
","Based on Piper Kerman's own biography on her experience being in womens prison, OITNB took viewers on a helluva ride for 7 seasons. The structure is kindly borrowed from big bro Oz, with getting-to-know backstories on each inmate who matters. Let me make clear that I didn't like Piper herself. I found her irritating and selfish. Specially regarding her very one-sided stance on relationships. But there's a lot more to take in than Piper. It's sweet, funny, sad, will make you angry. It got just about anything. BUT season 4.... I have dutied in Afghanistan, like the new prison guards coming in. I found it insulting to watch this drivel. I can guarantee that not one with the attitude these guys and girl shows would be in a contest to get hired as guards. BUT there's an evil corporation behind.... Amazon or Google, maybe? This is what I call provocative writing just to make some tention and new bad guys. And I'm not sure if we really needed a 7th season, which feels more like a ""cushion filler"".",/review/rw3259431/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2017,kindersurprise1000,5," From groundbreaking to a complete mess
","Season 5 is the perfect example of when the show needs to be over. First 2 seasons were amazing, then we saw a gradual decline in good storytelling. And season 5 has no common thread, all the old characters are not even given a chance to shine. The show seems very disconnected, too many ideas never form into anything interesting. Please let it be the last season because it's borderline embarrassing. Pass the word to American Horror Story, and the new Twin Peaks.",/review/rw3259431/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2022,manipool-10375,10," It was interesting all the way through for me
","I recall I started to watch OITNB probably right after it had just ended, however I wasn't able to finish it at that time. However, I promised myself I would eventually watch it again after hearing so many good things about it. What happened when I did? Well, I laughed, I cried, I frowned, I rolled my eyes. Honestly the show ran me through a great gamut of emotions. Were some of the storylines outrageous and ridiculous? Yes. But nothing I viewed was so horrible that I didn't want to see what finally happened to the prisoners, CO's and administrators on Orange is the New Black. It was a good show.",/review/rw3259431/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2022,avilesthais,10," heartbreakingðŸ’”
","By far one of the best shows I've ever seen, changed my whole perspective on inmates and made me both laugh and cry for days. I am a Piper Chapman hater for life.",/review/rw3259431/?ref_=tt_urv

24 November 2013,brent_or,5," To Start Out With Anyway, Very Overrated
","I am chiming in about this show because I am surprised at how positive the reviews are trending for it. After reading positive buzz over the past several months, I have finally had the opportunity to watch Orange is the New Black. And I am very, very unimpressed.",/review/rw3259431/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2014,jonnithomas,4," This has rave reviews and I'm really not sure why.
",is it because of the occasional lesbian sex shown in a very coy way ? or is it the odd flashing of a stray breast ?,/review/rw3259431/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2022,ITALUKE,8," Good.
","It has a weird sense of humour, and I like it. I don't like some storylines, for example the one for the hidden cellphone in the bathroom, because it doesn't make sense. Like, wouldn't the battery be dead since she can't charge it? Btw I love the lead character.",/review/rw3259431/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2019,mhorg2018,5," Show went down in flames after season 3
","Another show that was dragged out for too long. Really the first two season were interesting and fun, and then it steamrolled itself to a terrible ending. By the time it ended, the only character I still cared about was Tasty, who got totally screwed by her friend, who should have told the truth. Piper and Alex, those whiny punks, could have both gotten killed (as characters) and I wouldn't have cared. Just another show that didn't know when to quit.",/review/rw3259431/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2022,max_playle,7," Pretty decent
","First couple of seasons were entertaining and the stories were intriguing but towards the end, mainly after season 3-4, it became somewhat of a chore. Some characters were just becoming Mediocre and just felt strung along, taystees story of getting justice for Washington was getting boring, red just became receptive and the Amish girl and her friend (forgot their names) were just simply getting on my nerves. However it is an easy watch and has its good and funny moments now and again, I think it's worth a watch at least in my opinion.",/review/rw3259431/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2013,femvamp-694-160770,9," It's like the first few seasons of Weeds
","It brings back memories of Weeds. You know in its glory days. The first few seasons before it went off the rails. That's what ""Orange Is the New Black"" is like. Equal parts funny and sad. A mix of true pathos and yet true honesty and beauty coming from the strangest places. Be warned however there is plenty of lesbian sex and if the ""F"" word makes your ears bleed it is probably a good idea to turn back now...This isn't OZ but this also isn't Disney. This is a true winner from Netflix and tells an interesting story not only from the main character's perspective but from the other inmates as well. It would have been boring to see things from just her point of view. Like Nancy Botwin on Weeds, sometime Piper Chapman is portrayed in not so good a light because she can be the villain in someone else's story.",/review/rw3259431/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2015,FullBush,6," No more than daily soap
","Well the concept of women prison is something new and I started watching it with blank mind. Start is all in all mildly interesting but as the story progresses there is not much to expect. The leading character, Taylor faces multiple dilemmas, most interesting of which is about her sexual orientation. She used to be gay in past but she has a boyfriend now..and then she bumps into her old girlfriend in prison.so that is the most exciting part. But wait there is mild comedy too..she comes across a stalker whose weird acting is to be appreciated the most. The entire season is full of small time accidents and fuss that Taylor comes across. Orange is the new black is not a thriller as a prison based series should be but its close to chick flick. It covers every theme partly so, it is no more than a regular time pass daily soap.",/review/rw3259431/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2013,mariamakesmusic,1," Shock factors should never be deliberate
","The one star is for some of the characters in this, it is no doubt full of talented actors and actresses but I find a lot of the sex, nudity in this series is put in there deliberately for shock factor and it overtakes from any substantial story line. Unlike Breaking Bad, this is not a dark comedy that is effective in combining profound serious issues with humour. It fails at this remarkably in my opinion. I have watched other incredible films that revolve or have a central focal point around homosexuality - like Brokeback Mountain and Monster - these films do not come across as trying too hard to be eclectic because there's a holistic component to the entire story and its depth. They simply just tell the story and the story stands for itself. I guess what I mean is that it is pretty obvious to a viewer when nudity and sex scenes (be they same sex or not) are trying too hard to be shocking or eclectic to increase viewer ship and it gets in the way of the story. It's just trying to be too funny, too different and too deliberate with trying to appeal to men's girl on girl fantasies that the story loses substance.",/review/rw3259431/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2022,roxydzey,9," hate the 7th (last season)
","Hate the last season because it felt forced, everything going on too fast (especially in the very last episode!), so many characters forgotten or who ended up in situations that i would not prefer for them to end up in. But the worst thing is it left so many unanswered questions that i would call this tv show ""unfinished"" or ""without a proper end""",/review/rw3259431/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2019,FilmBuff0409,4," First season was great, it keeps getting worse now
","The first season of this show was really good! The second season was okay, the third season was just watchable. Season 4 I had to force myself through the pain of watching until the end and after that I completely gave up, no interest left to watch the new seasons. This could have been a good two to three season show, now they're just trying to drag it out for profits but I'd be surprised if this show has even half the following it did back when it started. My advice is watch the first season and stop there. Trust me, it doesn't get any better.",/review/rw3259431/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2015,Siddhartha14,," Season 3 is really boring
","This series has lost its way. It's way too focused on the relationship between Alex and Piper (a real snooze fest) and not focused enough on what makes these characters interesting. There is no spark here anymore. What made seasons 1 and 2 interesting just isn't there anymore. This story is played out. Time for it to go! And Pennsatucky! Really? Do new teeth completely transform a person? I think not. By far the most interesting character on the show, Red, has been reduced to a total stereotype - of the aging tough woman with a heart of gold. She was so interesting before and now she is just as boring as all of the other characters. Most boring of all is Alex. She was edgy in seasons 1 and 2 and now she is just annoying - not interesting at all. Did they change writers or producers or did they just have one good idea and they are stringing it out as long as possible? I will say that Crazy Eyes continues to be the most fun character to watch - played to perfection!",/review/rw3259431/?ref_=tt_urv
