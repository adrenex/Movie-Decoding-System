11 May 2008,Smells_Like_Cheese,5," Typical, but still funny
","When I first saw the trailer to What Happens in Vegas..., I thought it did look so predictable, but it had some really funny moments in the trailer, so I still wanted to see it. The only sad part, we have Cameron Diaz(who looks like a really good looking aging woman) and Ashton Kutcher(who still looks and acts like he's 12 years old), so we have two obnoxious actors that could have made a very disastrous film. But I saw What Happens in Vegas... yesterday and even though it was very predictable and stupid, it still had some very funny moments. I mean, Cameron and Ashton play two of the most unlikeable characters in movie history, who just bicker back and forth. The characters who win you over in the film are Rob Corddry and Lake Bell, who's fighting is actually very funny. But Aston and Cameron had some really good moments too.",/review/rw3139675/?ref_=tt_urv
11 June 2011,georgia_cushion,8," Fun.
",I got given this film by a friend for a birthday present and she said it was really good so I had quite high expectations for it. I thought that Diaz and Kutcher's performances were funny and witty. It had a good story-line and it was very well thought out. I thought the fact that you got to see the wedding later on in the credits was a clever idea. Some of the scenes made me laugh out loud but other parts of the film were a little cheesy and very predictable. It was funny how similar reasons brought them to the same place. Overall I would say What Happens In Vegas is a funny feel-good film. I would give it a 7/10 and say that it is suitable for anyone 10+.,/review/rw3139675/?ref_=tt_urv

31 August 2008,AnnaShade,," Diaz and Kutcher are Entertaining and Cute Together
","Despite the surly comments of others, this movie is not a waste of time. When I first saw the preview, I was completely doubtful as to the quality of this movie. I mean, accidental marriage in Vegas? Ashton Kutcher AND Cameron Diaz? Like, together? It was a bit scary.",/review/rw3139675/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2008,Dragoneyed363,7," Just a fun time
","Alright, before you watch this movie, you know it is not going to be some deep, poetic Best Picture nominee. I was not all that excited about seeing it in the first place myself if I am going to be honest, but I only got it because there was nothing better to get I guess, and in the end, I had a fun time with it. Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz have good chemistry on set, not exactly Gone with the Wind type of romance, but enough to make it feel somewhat believable and make these characters interact well with the plot.",/review/rw3139675/?ref_=tt_urv

22 August 2008,claudio_carvalho,8," Delightful Silliness
","The clumsy and reckless Jack Fuller (Ashton Kutcher) is fired by his boss and father (Treat Williams) and together with his friend and unsuccessful lawyer Hater (Rob Corddry), they decide to go to Las Vegas to have a good time. Meanwhile the fiancé of the workaholic stock broker Joy McNally (Cameron Diaz) breaks up their engagement because of her lack of attitude. Her friend and bartender Tipper (Lake Bell) convinces Joy to spend a couple of days also in Las Vegas.

During the night, they get completely wasted and on the next morning, Jack and Joy find that they got married. While discussing to briefly end their wedding, Jack borrows a coin from Joy to gamble in the jackpot machine and wins three million dollars. They question in court the ownership of the money and the conservative Judge R. D. Whopper (Dennis Miller) freezes the money and sentence them to live together with Joy moving to Jack's house for six months and attending regular counseling sessions. Each one decides to make the life of the other hell on Earth to force to get out of the marriage.",/review/rw3139675/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2008,quirke_j,6," Enjoyable comedy without the usual Hollywood overkill
",I was in fear of going to see this movie.The reviews were appalling. At the last minute I relented and went expecting the worst. I was pleasantly surprised after 10 minutes my fears were dispelled and I actually started to enjoy the film. The basis of the film was predictable but the way the 2 central characters draw you in surprised me. They worked very well together and played off each other very well. Yes there are 1 or 2 silly scenes but it was still funny.,/review/rw3139675/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2008,Chris Knipp,7," You have to care and not care
","A lazy young man who's just been fired by his own father and an uptight financial sector striver just dumped by her boyfriend go to Las Vegas with pals to forget and, meeting, get married in a night of drunken carousing and diminished rationality. Then he wins $3 million on a slot machine with her quarter and they wind up in court fighting over an annulment and the right to the three million. The judge dislikes them both equally and sentences them to remain married and cohabit for six months and prove they're working to get along. A series of domestic plots and battles follows as each tries to outsmart the other to win in court and get all the money. They end up liking each other. ",/review/rw3139675/?ref_=tt_urv

",This film is just your typical Rom Com. An easy watch with a couple of punchlines to get you laughing. There's no effort to this film but one to chuck on when you don't feel like putting much thought into a film.,/review/rw3139675/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2013,lesleyharris30,4," Character's are Unlikeable and Just Not Funny,
","What Happens In Vegas is a below average movie with a very cliché romantic comedy storyline that is made even worse with a cast that don't deliver any heart to their unlikeable characters,made even worse with one bad joke after another,the majority of them being offensive to both genders.I love Cameron Diaz and it is very rare when she lets me down,but this is a very big exception,Ashton Kutcher is alright but his movies are very hit or miss and this is definitely a big miss.While the story may seem like a fun and original set up for a romantic comedy, it really is the exact opposite,I would recommend What Happens in Vegas to absolutely no one.",/review/rw3139675/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2008,mario_c,6," For an average Hollywood comedy, it's not bad
","This romantic comedy starts with a good premise: two strangers meet in Las Vegas and after an evening of wildness and many drinks they get married and win a prize of 3,000,000 dollars on a slot machine. They agree to divorce and split the money, but the Judge doesn't concede it to them, and force them to live together for 6 months, in order to make them try to succeed their marriage. It's the beginning of a living hell to them, because they can't stand each other ",/review/rw3139675/?ref_=tt_urv

7 May 2008,DICK STEEL,6," A Nutshell Review: What Happens In Vegas
","My only trip to the US (not counting the toddler days) where I can remember what the heck I was doing, was back in December 2005 (gee, time flies!) where I spent a total of 7 full days trawling the streets as well as the casinos up and down the Strip and its outskirts, and seriously, it's never as sexy as that portrayed in the movies (or that television series), though you'd truly never really run out of things to do, despite everything being overly expensive at tourist prices. I think I still possess a mental map of everything on the Strip!",/review/rw3139675/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2008,jaredmobarak,3," Oh Lovebiscuit; Yes Tickle-Monkey?What Happens in Vegas
","I went into the screening of What Happens in Vegas thinking I was in store for a train-wreck; I mean the trailer looked horrible. I suffer the pain for all of you readers, though, in the hopes that you won't have to live the same fate. In actuality, the movie ended up being a same-old, same-old rom-com that had some laughs, but overall just plodded along to its inevitable conclusion. Being that this pair of New Yorkers, married after a night of heavy drinking in Vegas, must spend six months as man and wife before a judge decides what to do with the three million dollar jackpot they won, one would think we'd get a lot of their trials and tribulations, probably way too sentimental for anyone to stand. Instead, we get gag after gag as the two attempt to sabotage the union to take the money for themselves. Only about half the film takes place during the six months, however, it feels like six years. I couldn't believe the running time was only an hour and a half, it felt a lot longer. All this said; if someone has their mind set on seeing a film of this kind, my words would not detract yousomething the producers know. I'll say one thing, whomever came up with the marketing plan of selling Las Vegas with the tag used in the title here is going to bed with a smile this weekend, snuggling up with the piles of money overflowing his roomhe couldn't ask for a better affirmation of that simple phrase.",/review/rw3139675/?ref_=tt_urv

29 April 2011,sddavis63,6," Shallow, Silly, Predictable - But Still Not Bad
","It's shallow, it's silly, it's completely predictable - and for all that, it ain't bad. Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher made for a likable enough pair as Joy and Jack. Joy gets dumped, Jack gets fired and both head off the Las Vegas where they meet by coincidence, get drunk together and end up married. Jack wins a $3 million slot machine jackpot and a fight over who should get the money post-annulment ensues, complicated by the fact that the judge insists that they go through six months of marriage counselling and try to make their marriage work.",/review/rw3139675/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2015,anaconda-40658,8," Diaz Happens in Vegas.
","What Happens in Vegas (2008): Dir: Tom Vaughn / Cast: Ashton Kutcher, Cameron Diaz, Rob Corddry, Lake Bell, Dennis Miller: The city of lights becomes the happening for Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz who meet in Vegas and end up married after a drunken evening. Divorce court follows but the issue regards the jackpot he scored on her coin. Starts out fine but becomes predictable. The ending works due to a selfless act. Director Tom Vaughn is backed with great Vegas locations fuelled with the energy reputed with the city. Kutcher plays off the irresponsible nature of someone not easily caring but will learn that selfishness isn't an asset to relationships. Diaz was dumped by her fiancé yet displays total selflessness that render the film worth the trip. Both will bicker and one-up each other in the meantime. Rob Corddry as Kutcher's best friend and lawyer plays above conventions and steals scenes with his crass beliefs and hilarious advice. Lake Bell as Diaz's best friend is unfortunately flat and never highlighted as Corddry successfully portrays himself. Dennis Miller is also wasted as a judge that lands down the plot problem. Fans of romantic comedies will no doubt indulge in this venture to Vegas thanks to the two leads. It presents marriage is a team ordeal where love and sacrifice go beyond anything that happens in Vegas. Score: 8 ½ / 10",/review/rw3139675/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2008,richard-702,7," Something enjoyable to watch with the missus
","When I think of the RomCom genre I see 2 people meeting by accident, not getting along, circling around each other for 1 hour and then in the end, by magic, finally seeing the beauty in each other and living happily ever after. Im not saying that this movie is all that better or even different from that, but its one of the few in the genre that actually made me laugh out loud a couple of times.",/review/rw3139675/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2015,mistoppi,3," Same as 90% of all romantic comedies.
