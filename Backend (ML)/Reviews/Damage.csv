26 July 2014,planktonrules,7," It's one of the most unique films I've ever seen.
","At nearly three hours long AND with a strange and difficult to comprehend plot, I can see exactly why ""Cloud Atlas"" lost a ton of money. In the States, it only brought in about $27,000,000---yet cost $100,000,000 to make. Much of the high cost is undoubtedly due to the cast--as the film boasts some famous and high-paid actors (including Tom Hanks and Halle Berry). It's a shame really, as the film does have some nice thing to offer...though overall, it was a problematic film to watch.",/review/rw2671385/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2014,Hitchcoc,10," One of the Most Interesting Experiences Ever
","This is one of those experiences that defy explanation (similar to the one I had watching ""2001: A Space Odyssey""). I had read the book a year before and if you had asked me to pick a book that could never be made into a movie, I would have easily selected this. How wrong I was. This masterful concoction kept me intrigued for nearly three hours and yet I'm still trying to figure things out. I agree with the late Roger Ebert that even with two or three viewings, I am still trying to put this all together. It doesn't matter. It's like looking at a painting on repeated visits to a museum, maybe the works of Breughel or Bosch. There are some themes that run through the multiple characters' existences, touching on oppression and endurance of the human soul. The performances are wonderful. I would imagine that the likes of Tom Hanks must have been in heaven, extending their acting chops. I need to watch the film again, but for now will leave it to those more intellectually astute to look at the implications of the tenets of this film. I would recommend it as an experience everyone should have.",/review/rw2671385/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2018,classicsoncall,10," ""We must all fight and if necessary, die, to teach people the truth.""
","I fully expected all the negative reviews for this film here on IMDb. Yes, it was a complex film but not impossible to comprehend. You had six separate stories utilizing multiple actors in multiple roles spanning across three centuries, with what I saw as a common theme - an unending struggle and quest for freedom, creativity, truth and beauty. There's also the overarching idea that the elites of any society will use what ability and power they have to subjugate those who they deem inferior. Consider George Orwell's ""1984"". What's particularly exceptional is the editing, some of the time switches occur within seconds, bringing the viewer from one time dimension to the next flawlessly. In that regard, I must caution the viewer that paying attention is of the utmost importance, or for those not engaged in the picture, not important at all. Simply said, this movie will not appeal to everyone, however it's fluid style and interesting chronology makes for a compelling story about many stories, with hints of reincarnation and standing on the shoulders of those who have gone before. Prepare for a genuine experience.",/review/rw2671385/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2012,TheHighVoltageMessiah,9," Quite an achievement
","""Cloud Atlas"" is nearly three hours in length, but I wasn't bored for a minute. The film alternates between six very different stories quite seamlessly, creating an exhilarating experience. It's part sci-fi, part historical drama, part love story, part comedy. Any number of things could have gone wrong with the film. All the different genres it brings together might have failed to coherently mesh. But they did, and it's something to see.",/review/rw2671385/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2012,Kubris,9," A soul's odyssey
","Cloud Atlas is unlike its contemporaries at the multiplex. It tells a big story in an engaging, difficult fashion. It has big names and a big budget. But it also is thematically denseÂ… it wants to tell you something through plot, characters, dialogue and symbols. Cloud Atlas is also thankfully a very enjoyable film, much longer and denser than much of what is available today. ""Ambition"" defines this film. ",/review/rw2671385/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2012,ramair350,10," Wow - movie of the year. A must see!
","The last time I felt like this after seeing a movie was when I saw ""Inception"" on opening night. I realized I was seeming something that was different, creative, and classic.",/review/rw2671385/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2012,LetwitJr,8," A powerful adaptation to a beautiful novel
",I was lucky enough to get last-minute tickets for this film at the Toronto International Film Festival. The theatre was packed and we were thrilled to see it although we did not entirely know what to expect. I had read a part of the book but never found time to finish it.,/review/rw2671385/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2013,DragoonKain,6," A Potentially Great Film Ruined By Poor Structure
","I never read the book, but was intrigued by this movie because I had heard the book was very good. I don't have as much time to read as I used to, so I watched it, sort of liked it but found it kind of tedious to get through due to all the jumping around from story to story. Seeing the different actors as different characters was more distracting than anything, and the film was paced too quickly allow the average viewer to pick up all the complexities and themes the author was likely trying to convey.",/review/rw2671385/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2013,kosmasp,8," Reading before watching(?)
","I have to say that I never read the novel. So I had no idea what I would let myself into. Especially the beginning was almost too much too handle. It seems like everything comes down on you. It's tough to keep up, but if you get through those first 10-20 minutes then you will be able to see one great movie (I reckon, like me, even without having read the book) with some phenomenal acting in it.",/review/rw2671385/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2013,phd_travel,1," Like flipping channels for 3 hours.
","A grandiose production and stellar cast doesn't help this overly ambitious mix come together in a coherent movie. The series of different stories isn't set up well in the beginning so it feels confusing for a while. Then when they sort of come together it isn't clever or convincing. Maybe this story was unfilmable. It just felt like a mix of bad movies shredded and mixed up together. It tries to have a common theme about standing up to oppression of some sort or other via corporate corruption, musical composition, the slave trade, science fiction etc but in the end it wasn't worth the effort.",/review/rw2671385/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2012,MediaboyMusings,8," Daring and quite impressive
","""Impressive"". That's the best description I could come up with after being asked by my brother and sister-in-law about my thoughts on Cloud Atlas immediately following the film's second-ever public screening we'd just attended. Not a very incisive assessment, I'll grant you, but my head was still spinning as I tried to make sense of what I'd just witnessed over the film's jam-packed two hour and forty three minute running time. This may be one the most ambitious and epic films I've ever seen, demanding rapt attention from viewers as they're taken on an odyssey that spans the globe over 500 years and hopscotches between numerous interwoven story lines that incorporates just about every film genre available, featuring actors playing several different roles each. Cloud Atlas is based on British author David Mitchell's best-selling 2004 novel and was a huge challenge for the filmmakers to adapt and finance (its estimated budget of over $100 million also makes it the most expensive independent film ever made). The architects of this beautifully twisted madness are directors/writers/producers Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run) and The Matrix's Wachowski siblings, Andy and Lana (Lana was Larry until a gender transition that was completed about five years ago). The Wachowskis, notoriously press shy, were surprisingly on hand (along with Tykwer) to introduce the film's second screening the morning after its star-studded TIFF world premiere on September 8th at the Princess of Wales Theatre.

8 September 2012,torontodog,," The Wachowskis join forces with Tom Tykwer and overhaul the meaning of the word Epic!
","Kudos to all the filmmakers for adapting this famously ""unfilmable"" novel in such an inventive way. There are SIX separate timelines that switch after every scene, but instead of the plot, the narrative continuity follows the theme of the film. Once you clue in to that overall theme, it is no longer confusing when the story jumps from a runaway slave in the 1800s to a post apocalyptic future battle between some of the last humans remaining on earth.",/review/rw2671385/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2012,christianlotzny,10," A genre-breaking classic
","There can be little doubt that Cloud Atlas will become a classic that will be watched over and over again by its devoted followers, just like its predecessors by Stanley Kubrick and Ridley Scott. Despite the many questions I had in my mind when I left the theater and the moments during the film when I felt disappointed or confused, I knew this, and I have not stopped thinking about the movie and longing to be back in front of the screen.",/review/rw2671385/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2013,TxMike,," Our lives are not our own, we are bound to others, past and present.
","I almost watched this movie twice, on DVD. And yes, it really helps to turn on the ""subtitles"" for many scenes, otherwise it is virtually impossible to make out what they are saying. I had watched the first 90 minutes then put it away for a week, started at the beginning and just watched it all the way through.",/review/rw2671385/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2019,jdgan,10," Possibly one of the best movies of all time.
","Cloud Atlas may seem odd upon first glance, having the same actors/actresses play different characters but when I watched the trailer, I was intrigued. And then when it finally came onto Netflix, I ignored the mixed reviews and watched anyways.",/review/rw2671385/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2022,CyricTheCynic,8," An overly-ambitious yet rewatchable movie
","I've seen this movie at least 10 times at this point, and despite that I can absolutely understand where people who dislike this film are coming from. It comes off as pretentious, try-hard, and has some rather unnerving aging effects. Yet despite all that, I really admire this film for trying to tell a narrative spanning thousands of years through 6 different timelines and an array of characters playing different parts in each one. It's not a perfect film, by any means, but it is some of the Wachaoski's best works outside of the matrix in terms of trying to craft something wholely original. Watch it on some streaming service if you can or borrow it from a friend, and if you don't like it, I can't really blame you. But at the very least give this film a shot.",/review/rw2671385/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2016,Tweekums,9," Six stories set in different eras yet somehow linked
","This is a hard film to summarise in a paragraph as it consists of six ostensibly unconnected stories that take place in six different time periods and locations. A lawyer in the south pacific who attempts to help an escaped slave who has stowed away on a ship in the nineteenth century. A young man who has gone to Scotland in the 1930s to help a composer write again and to compose his own work. A reporter in 1970s San Francisco who finds herself in danger when she uncovers a plot by oil companies to stop alternate power sources. A man whose brother has him put in a secure facility in present day Scotland. A cloned slave, known as a fabricant, is taken from where she is kept by a man hoping to overthrow current system and becomes a symbol of that revolution in 2144. Finally in the far future a tribesman Pacific island is haunted by a vision of a demonic character and helps a woman from an advanced civilisation get to the summit of a 'forbidden' mountain. These six stories are told in an overlapping manner; a scene from one then from another; sometimes it is just a moment in one story other times we stay with one story for quite a while.",/review/rw2671385/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2012,virindra,1," Three hours of beautiful crap.
",I have seen the preview of this movie and was disappointed that Halle Berry was in this movie. She is a very boring actress who always plays a confident woman and in this movie she was not different than that. But Tom Hanks and Hugo Weaving made me watch this movie in the cinema. I did not know it would be a three hours hell.,/review/rw2671385/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2012,larry-411,10," Look up ""epic"" in the dictionary and you may see the poster for ""Cloud Atlas"" staring back at you
","Based on the David Mitchell novel, ""Cloud Atlas"" boasts a triumvirate of writers and directors. German Tom Tykwer and the sibling team of Andy and Lana Wachowski served as screenwriters, producers, and directors.

",Individuals actions and decisions throughout the ages are strange things because it always seems to be the littlest things that lead up to something more and turn into something even more as time goes on.

",My wife and I were able to see an advanced showing of Cloud Atlas last night at The Chicago International Film Festival. I will say that I was thrilled to see this movie from the moment I saw the initial trailer release. I am a huge fan of movies that are epic in nature and are rather daring by taking on the task of time lines that may span a millennia.,/review/rw2671385/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2016,Kirpianuscus,," must see it !
","it is the first conclusion. for a lot of motives: to discover an impossible adaptation, to admire high coherence of a mix of different stories who become one, to enjoy by the performance of a great cast . to understand the rules of history, to open a large window to the future, to be impressed by splendid images , to travel across the genres and periods for see again basic truth. short, one of films who represents a wonderful show. and little more. a fresco who gives lines to define the life not only as adventure but as battle to conquer your sense. it is unfair to describe it. and, maybe, impossible. because, after the credits, the beauty of a story who seems be just a firework is the most precious gift of the large team who create this spectacular work. because the beauty, in the case of Cloud Atlas has so many meanings. and nuances.",/review/rw2671385/?ref_=tt_urv
7 December 2012,hdavis-29,1," pretentious, boring and incoherent
","I'm going to buck the trend here and instead of extolling the virtues of this wonderful spiritual journey through time and space, I'm going to call it an undisciplined, self-indulgent, incoherent piece of claptrap. I really feel like this is a case of the Emperor's New Clothes. I'm standing up and saying the old guy is naked and he's ugly to boot. They said this was a book that couldn't be made into a movie. They were right. And it was pointless to try. What you were likely to get was... this! If you've read the book and liked it, then you might like the film too. But just remember, you are bring understanding and structure to what you see. If you haven't read the book and know little about it, this movie is likely to be a frustrating and incoherent mess to you. That was certainly my experience. So don't get suckered into going to see this godawful film ""cold."" Tom Hanks looked like he had a grand time being part of it. You won't.",/review/rw2671385/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2012,dvc5159,8," To and fro, back and forth...
","""Cloud Atlas"" is an epic film that left me breathless, speechless, and wanting more. The films' virtuoso craftmanship beckons, nay, returns to an era long gone where the writers and the directors, not the studios, were given complete creative control over how their movies should look, feel and be. The fact that this film is nearly 3 hours in length shows the film's brilliant refusal to compromise itself for the sake of marketability.",/review/rw2671385/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2012,zapata_36,8," A Powerful Spectacle
