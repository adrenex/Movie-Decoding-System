",I saw this movie on a fluke.I was standing on 42nd street waiting for a bus to go home and a sister started passing out free tickets for a preview of this movie.I gave it a chance not expecting much.The promotional movie posters I've seen on the subway station walls do not give this film justice at all.,/review/rw7226483/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2006,higfilm07,9," Pick of Destiny Is So hilarious, it hurts!
","Just saw it at as closing film of Austin Film Festival. Going in, a had seen a few snippets of their act at Alamo Drafthouse, and thought the trailer was amusing but I wasn't expecting such an epic theme music and the use of tarot cards is genius in the title sequence. Watch out for cameos from Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins, and the dark lord himself (who has a fetish for KG). So much over-the-top fun and the songs are so catchy. The car chase was by far my favorite scene. I know this will earn cult status right away and win over some new Tenacious D fans, just like me. I hope this does well in the theaters.

9 November 2006,hinfinityl,10," Takes The D To The Next Level And Succeeds (It Will Rock Your Socks Off)!!!
","I saw The D's new film tonight at a special advance screening, and I was so blown away by its sheer greatness that I felt I had to come onto IMDb and get the word out. Admittedly, I was already a huge fan of the D's work - I loved the HBO series and listen to their music weekly (there's nothing better to sing along to), but this appreciation actually made me more apprehensive going into to tonight's screening (for we've all been disappointed one time or another by something we love when it attempted to make the jump to the big screen). With Tenacious D's ""The Pick of Destiny,"" this is not the case.",/review/rw7226483/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2006,redsoxmb545-1,10," Tenacious D: In The Greatest Motion Picture of All Time
","Tenacious D: in The Pick of Destiny tells the fictional tale of the formation of the band Tenacious D and their quest to find the Pick of Destiny, a guitar pick with supernatural powers made from the tooth of Satan himself (played by Dave Grohl). JB (Jack Black) and KG (Kyle Gass), joined together by fate, must travel to the Rock N' Roll Museum and steal the Pick of Destiny to become the greatest band on earth. The movie is hilarious and delivers non-stop laughs. Jack Black and Kyle Gass work perfectly together, having been real life friends and co-workers for over 20 years. The film is in part, a musical. All (or most) of the music was written and performed by The D. All of the songs are new material and many of them are classic. The soundtrack is definitely worth checking out. This film will be mostly appreciated by fans of Tenacious D, but if you are not a fan of The D, I still think you will enjoy the movie. If you are a fan of the D, then you must see this movie. The acting isn't as bad as you may think, and the laughs and crudeness never stop coming. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking to get their socks rocked off and laugh as hard as they have laughed in a long time. Look out for cameos by Dave Grohl, Ronnie James Dio, Meatloaf, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler, Tim Robbins, John C. Reilly, and Neil Hamburger. Also, stay tuned for an extra scene after the credits.",/review/rw7226483/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2006,9sam1,10," Greatest movie ever made
","Probably the best comedy in a long time. keeps you laughing nonstop! the acting is good and there are a lot of hilarious cameos such as Ben stiller as the guitar store guy. The plot wasn't as good as i had hoped but the comedy makes up for that. I can only hope for a sequel cause it seems like they can still do so much more. Even though it was 1 hour and 40 minutes long i still wanted more at the end :) also there is a scene after the credits which is actually one of my favorite parts of the movie!! I suggest this to anyone who loves a good comedy and Definitely suggest it to fans of The D or Jack Black. You should buy the album also, the songs are so damn catchy and hilarious, the music on it is Top Notch as well.",/review/rw7226483/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2006,hnofer17,10," so entertaining to watch!!!!

7 November 2006,greatfox-1,10," Tenacious D preview
","I was able to see a preview of this movie through UCLA's pre-screening program, and let me tell you: THIS MOVIE IS UNBELIEVABLY GOOD!!!! I have seen many movies, but few have made me laugh so sincerely or talk about the movie afterward as much as this one. I had a decent respect for Tenacious D before seeing the movie, and now I am MAD about them. I will most definitely buy their album when it is released on the 14th and will see this movie again.",/review/rw7226483/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2006,abraxas365,10," This movie will rock your socks off!
","I managed to see the MTV premiere of this movie last night and I needed to tell everyone that this movie brought the thunder. Obviously this movie will be most enjoyed by fans of the D as it has plenty of in-jokes for those that have seen the HBO series and has more than enough D for newer fans and the mass of soon-to-be converts. The music really shines with the new songs ""Kickapoo"" (which is much better than it sounds), ""Master Exploder"" (possibly the 3rd best song in the world) and ""Dude (I totally miss you)"". There are a load of excellent scenes (the car chase, the rock-off, the meeting) and cameos (including Dave Grohl as Satan!). I really could go on for hours but I don't want to give the movie away. Go see it. You won't be disappointed.",/review/rw7226483/?ref_=tt_urv

18 November 2006,DonFishies,6," Funnier than I imagined, but way too random and ridiculously unbalanced
","I randomly entered a draw for free tickets to see Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny, and after winning, was unsure of what to do. I was sure I was not going to like the movie as I was never a big fan of the band, and am fairly indifferent to the work of Jack Black. But I went anyway, if for any reason, just sheerly for fun. And what I got was a fair mix of bad and good, but I was most definitely surprised at both how the film was so much better than I expected, and just how terribly random it is.",/review/rw7226483/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2008,The_Void,8," A hilarious fun time from start to finish
","The obvious thing to say about this film is that it 'rocks'. And that's an obvious thing to say because it does rock, in fact The Pick of Destiny rocks hard! The style and feel of the film will be familiar to anyone who has seen the TV show or listens to the music; being a big fan of both, this is a bonus for me. Some ideas from the television series are reused for the film, although most of it is new material and the format does translate very well to the big screen. The film is a cross between comedy and musical and the two are combined; Tenacious D made a new album for this film and the songs are very well used. Anyone who knows Tenacious D knows that they're the self-professed greatest band of all time, and the plot focuses on that idea. We watch as JB (Jack Black) travels to Hollywood where he meets KG (Kyle Gass). The two form the band 'Tenacious D' but soon become frustrated at the fact that they're not as awesome as the likes of Dio and AC/DC. The reason for these bands' awesomeness soon becomes apparent, and JB and KG end on the trail of the legendary 'pick of destiny'...",/review/rw7226483/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2014,slightlymad22,6," Didn't quite rock my socks off
","More than any other movie in recent memory 'Tenacious D: The Pick Of Destiny' gets by on the sheer force of the personality of one of its cast members. That personality is Jack Black, and his charisma alone is responsible for dragging this movie from awful to at least watchable. ",/review/rw7226483/?ref_=tt_urv

8 November 2006,happy_skull,10," Rather brief review
","This movie is very silly and very funny. You can't ever criticize it for taking itself seriously. If you've heard their previous album or seen their HBO videos from the album, you can imagine the extremely foul-mouthed, rocking good time that is this movie which tells the fable of how the group Tenacious D came to be formed.",/review/rw7226483/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2013,lesleyharris30,8," I Don't Care What Anyone Else Says,I Really Enjoyed This Movie,
","Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny is a great movie with a really fun storyline and great performances from both Jack Black and Kyle Gass.This movie was a box office bomb when it came out,and I don't see why,I thought this movie was very enjoyable,it was really funny and had unbelievably good music numbers,and I thought Tenacious D would have a big enough fan base for this movie to make some decent money.I'm not a fan of the band,and I thought I wouldn't enjoy it unless I was,but I really did,and I also learned that Jack Black is actually a fantastic singer,and the rock off scene with David Grohl as Satan is something I will never forget.Fans of the band will definitely enjoy this movie and fans of Jack Black comedies will also.",/review/rw7226483/?ref_=tt_urv

","Sure, you can watch a movie. But, this transcends movies.

22 November 2006,DICK STEEL,6," A Nutshell Review: Tenacious D: The Pick of Destiny
","It might be an understatement to say that Jack Black is truly a jack of all trades. Of late his profile has been raised in the various high profile movies he's starring in, ranging from his own comedies like Nacho Libre, which I thought suffered from its own over-hype unfortunately, to blockbusters like King Kong for him to flex some dramatic muscles. I still remember the smaller supporting roles he played in movies like High Fidelity, and now he's probably in the bigger league, having the ability to open a movie with just his name on the marquee.",/review/rw7226483/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2021,aleksanderk-95350,4," Rock homage
","It's alright for what it is. The film has some funny moments, but nothing to make it a good comedy. Most entertaining part of this film, is seeing the different cameos. From Dio to Ben Stiller lots of different appearances. A cameo does not make for a good film though.",/review/rw7226483/?ref_=tt_urv

25 November 2006,berky11,10," Best Movie Ever
","I am a HUGE Tenacious D fan, and I think this is not the funniest movie in the world, but the most entertaining. It's not laugh-a-minute but that's not what the D intended it to be. I went into the movie seeing all the HBO shows, memorized both albums, and that made it even more enjoyable. Plenty of inside jokes from past Tenacious D albums, and HBO shows. Since I knew the new album already, I knew 40 minutes of the movie because it is a musical comedy. I would say it has the best first 5 minutes of any movie and the best last 5 minutes of any movie. Hands Down.",/review/rw7226483/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2021,SkullScreamerReturns,6," Spinal Tap of the 2000s
","In early 2000's everybody was talking about Tenacious D. But I wasn't interested. Somebody played me the band's cd album but I didn't get the comedy rock. I used to take my rock and metal so seriously that joke music was a big no no. I'm still quite picky when it comes to humorous music but have relaxed a bit and don't be as extremist anymore. And now I also finally made myself to watch this movie, just because it's an important piece of pop culture history.",/review/rw7226483/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2007,Smells_Like_Cheese,7," Surprsingly funny!
","When I saw the theatrical trailer to Tenacious D: The Pick of Destiny, it looked like one of the most stupid movies on Earth. Especially since I was so disappointed with Nacho Libre, I was wondering if Jack Black lost his comedic edge. But my friend called me a few nights ago and told me that this movie was so hilarious and that I needed to see it, so I figured to give it a shot, so I rented it. I just watched it and I have to admit that I just had a great time watching it. I am a huge classic rock lover, so I think that's part of the reason why I loved it so much, but the guys made the movie work and had great chemistry.",/review/rw7226483/?ref_=tt_urv

14 August 2021,jfgibson73,6," It's time to blow doors down!
","I was a Tenacious D fan already, so I was hoping this would have the same style of humor I enjoyed them for. It was well worth the watch for me. Not all the jokes land, not all the songs are classics, but there was enough to keep me entertained. The climactic rock off was epic, certainly the highlight of the film.",/review/rw7226483/?ref_=tt_urv
