12 November 2022,mywakinglife01,7," Watched it for Lindsay stayed for the Xmas spirit.
",This was a fun and adorable lighthearted Christmas movie. Yes I mostly put it on to see Lindsay make her great comeback and I'm ready for her to be the new queen of Christmas. It put me into the holiday spirit. It's not a deep plot nor was I expecting it to be. Ignore the low ratings and sourpusses and enjoy the glory that is Lindsay Lohan making her comeback. The imagery is great with the backdrop of a snowy ski resort decked out with boughs of holy. It's not that serious so I'm flabbergasted by the super low reviews. I'm really not sure what those people were expecting but it's still a delightful movie to put you in the Christmas spirit.,/review/rw8690601/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2022,kosmasp,6," Hallmark Netflix
","No pun intended - and I do not mean to make light of Hallmark movies. Unless you find them annoying - but why are you here if that is the case? I think the title is quite the easy giveaway. Lohan plays an adorable and yet quite shallow character ... some may confuse her character with her own personality. I do not know her, but I would assume she is way more than that. Also: acting.",/review/rw8690601/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2022,StuDeb2,8," Feel good movie
","I'm a sucker for Christmas movies. I love a movie where I can relax and know nothing awful is going to happen like in a lot of films. This was a lovely film. It had a few comedy moments. It's really good to see Lindsay Lohan back in great form. Lots of colourful Christmas jumpers and a beautiful Christmassy town. A Santa Clause who really looked the part. I'm putting this with all my other Christmas movies to watch this time of year. Watching it sitting on the sofa with my Baileys, Christmas tree and presents all wrapped. This movie is just great for getting in the seasonal mood. And anyone saying it's cheesy. Cheese is just what we need at Christmas.",/review/rw8690601/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2022,Ekm828511,8," Good to see Lindsay back!
","It's so good to see Lindsay Lohan back! I enjoyed this movie a lot. It was festive and heartwarming and to me, that's what Christmas movies are all about! I like the ""forget who I am"" trope and it worked well in this movie with Chord and Lindsay. They had a good chemistry between them. Olivia Perez was a little shining star as Chord's onscreen daughter-she was so adorable in all of her scenes! I loved seeing Jack Wagner back on my TV again to play a father role in the movie. Definitely recommend watching-Falling for Christmas is a great choice for Christmas movie night for family or date night!",/review/rw8690601/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2022,miklcats,8," People are being too harsh
",I think people are being a bit to harsh on this. Sometimes you have to remember that not all films are set out to be academy award winning powerful blockbusters. Its a campy netflix Christmas film set for people who just want a bit of light hearted entertainment and some Christmas spirit. If you like family fun Christmas movies then you will certainly enjoy this and if you are just a fan of Lindsay Lohan im sure you will enjoy too. Dont get me wrong the plot is pretty generic but as i said before its not a film thats truly meant to be taken with full seriousness so it didnt bother me. It served its purpose to be family friendly fun.,/review/rw8690601/?ref_=tt_urv

11 November 2022,KaraleeCupcake,6," Cheesy, but cute
","The movie is cheesy, but cute. There are a few issues and you have to suspend your belief that Jake would not remember the lady he ran into earlier that day, hospital staff would let Sierra leave with a stranger, and no one would contact Sierra's father even with her missing for four days. Also, the scenes with Ralph and Tad seemed out of place, but I guess they were trying to go for comedy there. The movie is also predictable, but pretty much every romcom movie set around Christmas is. It is nice seeing Lindsay Lohan in a new movie, and she did a fine job playing Sierra. She also had a good connection with Chord Overstreet who played Jake. The movie is nothing new, but it is a fine movie to watch to get you into the Christmas spirit.",/review/rw8690601/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2022,IonicBreezeMachine,," Standard holiday rom-com with an appealing cast
","Set in a luxurious mountaintop ski resort, Sierra Belmont (Lindsay Lohan) is the pampered heir to the prestigious Belmont Hotels and is currently dating influencer Tad Fairchild (George Young) while also being pressured by her father Beauregard (Jack Wagner) to take the position of VP of Atmosphere for Belmont hotels, a position that carries no real responsibility. Meanwhile at the neighboring North Star Lodge, Jake Russell (Chord Overstreet) the widowed owner of the lodge is struggling to keep the resort alive in the face of competition from larger resorts and Airbnbs. When Jake's daughter, Avy (Olivia Perez) makes a Christmas wish, Sierra finds herself knocked unconscious during Ted's proposal with the two of them separated after fall down the cliff. Jake finds the unconscious Sierra during a sleighride and takes her to town for medical assistance, but Sierra has suffered memory loss and has no identification. Jake offers Sierra a room at the lodge until someone finds her or her memory returns and finds difficulty adjusting to the simpler ways of doing things.",/review/rw8690601/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2022,pattyrusciano,6," Script fell down.
","There was a lot of hype about this movie and it could have been very good. Lindsay Lohan was better than most of the actresses in these Christmas romances and the lead actor was also fine but why the ridiculous boyfriend and his odd story line, it did not add anything to the movie and it's absurdity dragged the rest of the movie down, it did not fit with the style the rest of the movie was projecting of a homespun Christmas. I know he was meant to contrast but it just was absurd, not amusing. The little girl gave Lindsay some of her finer scenes. It was not the worst Christmas movie, the production was better than 90% of this type but it was a little overdone too and mainly it lacked something in the script unfortunately. It wasn't that it was predictable, we all know that going in, it just did not entertain or draw you in. So not bad, but not good either, just another average Christmas movie.",/review/rw8690601/?ref_=tt_urv

11 November 2022,zcsosebee,7," Tailored for it's audience
","Take this movie for what it is...it's Christmas romcom a la early 2000s meant to spark that twinge of nostalgia for millennials, add in the queen of the young millennial spirit herself and the kid from glee and you've got a recipe tailored to 30 somethings, entirely alone and nothing else to do. Yes of course, gays of all ages will tune in but only the 80s born will not question the wholly ridiculous premise and goings on of this film...I think everyone involved fully knows this is just an excuse to see Lindsay do something fun and not seriously be aiming for the moon, it took all pressure off, and why not make it a holiday grab at the same time...it's everything you want from a Lohan-Christmas-romcom-millennial-esque even right down to the Ali Lohan cameo.",/review/rw8690601/?ref_=tt_urv

Chord Overstreet charms as Jake Russell, the owner of a struggling ski lodge who finds her slumped unconscious against a tree.

11 November 2022,PrinceCharmingHere,3," It has to be said...
","Bless Lindsay Lohah's heart, but the dear isn't a good actress. She's had moments of goodness in her career, but it's like she's not even trying to develop her craft (whatever craft that is). She hasn't gotten better at acting in the last 20 years. The story of this movie is a been there done that trope. Very low effort stuff. If you enjoy this movie, you have incredibly low standards. The editing of the movie is a hilarious hack job. The people who made this movie simply didn't care, and it shows. Just another sad Netflix offering tied to a well know celebrity. Lindsay deserves more, but it seems she doesn't care to improve or do something worthwhile, just to cash in.",/review/rw8690601/?ref_=tt_urv

14 November 2022,ivantheeditor,6," Call this movie a casserole...
","... because it is as cheesy as they get. This was incredibly predictable from literally the first shot. If you're looking for an original storyline, this is not it. You pretty much know exactly what's going to happen just from the trailer. However, seeing Lindsay Lohan acting again and being happy is a Christmas miracle in and of itself. And Chord Overstreet is looking adorably handsome in this. On top of it, their chemistry is pretty good too. And even though this was brutally cheesy and predicatble it somehow managed to get me to tear up a little.. twice!! So yeah... i probably wont even remember watching this a few days from now it was still a good time. And honestly, I think Lindsey deserves a second chance at her career. I hope it takes off again and she's able to get bigger and better roles in the future. But this was definitely a cute little comeback.",/review/rw8690601/?ref_=tt_urv

21 November 2022,NicholasMCG,1," People are not being too harsh with the bad reviews
","The reason for so many bad reviews is because this movie is shockingly bad from start to finish. I watched the entire thing because it would be unfair to review something otherwise. I appreciate the crew on this because that is always a hard job from the camera Dept to the Art Dept hair and makeup etc. But my god the writing is like a computer generated script with no surprises and nothing new, so bland and boring. The directing, well, pretty sure a robot directed this because it's just so bad. It's like the kind of movie used in a real movie to be joked about if that makes sense. The acting? This is not a comeback for you know who, her 10 year old self would wonder where her acting talent went. It was not here.",/review/rw8690601/?ref_=tt_urv

23 November 2022,sharnelperera,1," So so so bad
","Wow. Just, wow. While I'm happy that Lindsay Lohan is doing well and seems to be making a comeback, this movie was SO BAD. The storyline is predictable, but that's ok, it's a standard Christmas romcom so I wasn't expecting anything groundbreaking. It's the acting that is just shockingly bad. It's laughable at certain points, e.g. The skiing scenes where they very clearly used a green screen and it looks about as real as an 80's monster movie. It seems like Lohan has a very long way to go in getting her acting chops back in shape, and I look forward to that happening for her. So maybe we should expect to see some shockers in her journey towards this. This movie is a prime example. Only worth watching in order to lend Lohan some support. Aside from that, it's just really, really cringeworthy.",/review/rw8690601/?ref_=tt_urv
