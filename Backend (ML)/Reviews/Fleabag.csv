20 March 2019,Clipster12,10," .............and you thought season 1 was funny.
","Phoebe Waller-Bridge, I don't quite know how you do it dear but keep it up. As a 50 year old bloke this should be well off the mark for me but instead I find it by far the funniest, well observed and at times poignant thing on TV at the moment. Season 2 has hit the ground running and I am hanging on for every episode. Do yourselves a favour and binge this. Thanks to all involved with the production of this series.",/review/rw5184833/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2022,grantss,8," Very funny
","After the death of her best friend, an event she is partly responsible for, a woman drowns her sorrows in one-night stands and other hedonistic behaviour. Her family compounds her problems: the uptight, corporate exec sister, the alcoholic, obnoxious brother-in-law, the well-meaning but clueless father, the scheming, domineering father's girlfriend who moved in very quickly once her mother died. From here the only way is up.",/review/rw5184833/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2020,elbandito1250,10," Special sort of humor required!
","I watched the first episode together with my wife and she hated it from the beginning, while I instantly loved it! This special sort of humor is always highly divisive. Either you love it or you hate it. In my experience for shows like Fleabag there's no such ratings like ""quite entertaining and funny at times""! Phoebe Waller-Bridge is incredibly talented in so many ways, I can't tell what's more adorable about her work in Fleabag: the acting, the uncommon storytelling, the firework of weird gags...? Everything is fresh and unique. I really hope there's much more coming from her in the future, both as actress and as writer!",/review/rw5184833/?ref_=tt_urv

5 April 2018,djg32514,9," I am shocked! I really enjoyed it!
","Not my typical cup of tea. Watched an episode with no intent and before I knew it I was smiling. Then laughing. Phoebe has amazing comedic talent. Even an old guy like me can recognize her talent. Quirky, irreverent, intelligent humor. Not something in abundance here in the states.",/review/rw5184833/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2017,cherold,10," Utterly brilliant performance and writing from Phoebe Waller-Bridge
","When I watched the first episode of Fleabag, I thought it was very funny but at the same time thought the main character was a bit off putting. But don't worry, her awfulness is mainly show.",/review/rw5184833/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2019,MovieFan-91319,10," An anarchistic breathe of fresh air.
","I never give 10 stars, since I'm personally dubious of all 10 star reviews.
But lately, American 'comedies' are so full of social justice and religious/political engineering, I almost forgot what it was like to laugh. Finding this show (just started season 2)--it's an anarchistic breathe of fresh air, compared to the group-think slop being shoveled into our troughs here in the US.
It's been so long since I watched something designed to make me laugh, instead of control the way I think, I'm gonna give it the full 10 stars. Very excited to watch the rest of season 2!",/review/rw5184833/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2021,izabelab-08870,10," Quirky and heartbreaking

28 August 2016,Sleepin_Dragon,8," How good is this!!

14 August 2019,ozjosh03,7," Get a grip, people!
","Fleabag is shaping up as the most over-praised, over-rated TV series of the decade - though it's a close race with Killing Eve. Yes, it's irreverent and, yes, it's funny. But 10 out of 10? C'mon! It rarely reaches the sublime heights of outrageousness of Absolutely Fabulous. In fact, it's more like a really dirty version of Miranda. Nothing wrong with that, but it's hardly hugely original. That reviewers are falling over themselves to lavish 10s and lavish praise on the series probably says more about them and their need for messy, chaotic, self-absorbed anti-heroines than at does about the series itself.",/review/rw5184833/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2019,TwittingOnTrender,4," Not My Bag
","A tricky one to review. I hated, hated, hated it, but something made me watch every episode, one a day, till I finished it. There are a couple of laughs - not enough to justify the gushing praise and endless articles in the Guardian, however. I almost stopped watching after the first couple, but stuck with it.
First, the grand conceit - the Peep Show style internal/external monologue and glances at the camera. The latter become incredibly irritating before the end of episode one. Like everything and everyone in this production, it smacks of some one unbearably pleased with themselves - I don't know how many people will relate to the problems suffered by the privileged people depicted here. She OWNS A CAFE - but, poor thing, it's not very successful! I wonder what she should do with that prime London real estate?
The characters are not just one-dimensional, they're paper thin. You know, the stock stiff-upper lip Brit characters - they don't like to show their feelings, you know! The cruel stepmother, constantly smiling and meaning the opposite of what she says, played so many times by the likes of Judi Dench and Maggie Smith, here depicted by flavour of the month Olivia Colman - probably a lovely woman, and very good in some previous stuff she's done, but now part of that untouchable sacred-cow elite. The repressed sister - Friends' Monica turned up to 11. She's cold. She's pushing her feelings deep inside. WE GET IT. She has the honour of reciting the show's worst line (repeated several times in the ""Previously Ons..."") - ""Get your hands off my miscarriage!"" Wow, transgressive! I'm shocked!
Talking about transgression, we come to the ""cool priest"". He swears! he smokes! He...he...does sex! Played by Andrew Scott, whose uncontrolled hammery ruined Sherlock for me, he's a quirkmeister supreme. He's scared of foxes! Oh my! The garden scene (with the fox revelation) reminded me of that excruciating hopping scene in the excruciating Truly, Madly Deeply - that's how bad it is (and TMD is a good reference point).
Yet for all it's naughtiness and boundary pushing, it falls back on some good old traditional plot twists to tie things together. Like most iconoclasts, Phoebe would like nothing better than to present Saturday Night Takeaway.
Why the four stars, as opposed to one, when I hate it so much? Well one star didn't seem right. SOMETHING kept me coming back - to see how things worked out in this chocolate box universe, the occasional chuckle, the London locations...I would never say ""Don't watch this"" - some people I love and respect went gaga for it. You may love it, you may, like me, love to hate it.",/review/rw5184833/?ref_=tt_urv
22 March 2021,yomamazas,10," It's...really effin' good
","It's hard to describe the genius of ""Fleabag."" I don't think it does anything new. The protagonist is a young-ish woman, who's intelligent, charismatic, and self-destructive. It makes for great TV but it's not exactly a novel concept. The dialogue she leads with the audience is charming but Phoebe Waller-Bridge didn't invent it. The dysfunctional family is, unfortunately, all too familiar...for me anyways.",/review/rw5184833/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2019,SnoopyStyle,7," didn't like the character at first
","Fleabag (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) is a struggling thirtysomething Londoner. Her ""guinea pig"" caf√© is struggling after the tragic accidental suicide of her business partner Boo. Her sex life is a struggle with various hookups. She struggles with her uptight perfect older sister Claire (Sian Clifford) married to the inappropriate Martin (Brett Gelman) with inappropriate stepson Jake. She struggles with her evil godmother (Olivia Coleman) who has ensnared her father (Bill Paterson) after her mother's death from breast cancer. Fleabag is often breaking the 4th wall. In the second season, she has an inappropriate relationship with a priest (Andrew Scott). He's the only one who notices her breaking the 4th wall.",/review/rw5184833/?ref_=tt_urv

23 September 2019,qui_j,7," Very British!
","The series is entertaining enough but one needs to understand the ""British"" way of communicating (or not) in order to enjoy it. It captures the frozen smiles, and general hypocrisy when discussing serious matters, and feelings, really well. However, it does run the risk of becoming very formula driven after a few seasons as there's not a lot of room for the character to grow. It's entertaining, silly and serious all in a single package.",/review/rw5184833/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2019,Hughmanity,7," Gets better as it goes along
","I had a tough time with the first few episodes of this show. I almost gave up on it after one episode but it had such a high rating I decided to stick it out and I'm glad I did. What at first seems like a reprehensible, self-indulgent and overly smug main character does finally turn out to have more depth and be working through so issues of her own, though it's a long wait to find out even some of that. Season 2 was better than 1 with more depth of characterization, a male in her life that isn't a superficial idiot, and a great evolving story line around her sister and family. By the end of season 2 I genuinely liked the show and even rewatched some of it. So if you don't like it at first, maybe try to give it some time to find it's footing and depth.",/review/rw5184833/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2019,thebricks,1," TV shows about mentally-ill spoiled brats are entertainment now?
","Bizzywiththefizzy pretty much wrote the definitive review of this show on IMDB so that I and many others wouldn't have to. This is a show written by trashy rich kids whose parents were never around growing up. I spent four horrible years around these sorts of people. If you don't know them, you may like this show, even aspire to be like these people. When you do, you will want nothing to do with them or shows like this.",/review/rw5184833/?ref_=tt_urv

","One of those 'hilarious' talk to camera comedies based on the single woman's life in London. So full of stereotypes, hammed up situations (you know the kind that happens to YOU), and such obvious humour. It's as if they regurgitated every romcom from the last 10 years into 30 min episodes and based it in London just to make it a little different.",/review/rw5184833/?ref_=tt_urv
