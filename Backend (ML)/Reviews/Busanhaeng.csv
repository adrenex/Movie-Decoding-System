25 March 2018,Platypuschow,9," Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2: Exceeds already high expectations
",Despite being a huge comic book nerd I was not familiar with the Guardians before the first movie came out. I did some googling and upon learning about this sci-fi superhero team consisting of a talking raccoon and tree man I was hardly impressed.,/review/rw3748823/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2020,SebMoz,8," Yes. Just yes
","My god, I did not expect this movie to be this good. I am a big fan of the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie, and while I do think it is one of the better MCU movies, this one is just better in practically every way. The plot is well structured, and the pacing is great. The movie also explores its characters way more thoroughly than the previous one. The struggle of finding a place where you belong is a central theme, and every important character has their own struggles related to this. The performances are great as usual, every actor really brings their own flavor to their character. The movie also has great visuals, with all the wacky and fun ideas you might expect from a space movie. The action scenes are great, and the cgi is pretty flawless. The movie is also way funnier than any other MCU movie, with every character being a great source of humor. It's so much comedy being presented it's actually a little too much for me sometimes. Some of the characters feel like they exist only to be comic relief, even though they also have serious struggles that deserve a more serious treatment than they get. That is my only complaint though, as this is a movie with great plot, characters and visuals, as well as a fantastic climax, even though they pulled the whole ""saving the world""-plot point again. This is one of my favorite MCU movies and space movies in general, it's a great time and I highly recommend it.",/review/rw3748823/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2021,andreascaloni,8," GREAT SEQUEL
","The movie is full of heart , well directed and has some great messages as the first one but it is funnier than its predecessor. This can be sometimes an advantage and other times a disadvantage. Not quite as fresh as the original, but it's still a great triumph with one of the most emotionally impactful endings of any Marvel Cinematic Universe story. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 might not be as amazing as the first movie but it's a fun ride with characters we love.",/review/rw3748823/?ref_=tt_urv

","It has its moments where it may crack a joke at the wrong time- but Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is easily one of the best sequels i've ever seen- and without a doubt- an absolute blast. I knew from the minute I saw the trailer for the first film that Guardians of the Galaxy was going to be something special, and the same thing applies to this film. We get the iconic characters back in all their glory, as well as some new ones. The entire cast is great, there is no doubting any of the main 5's performances, as they are simply as great as before. What I do enjoy about this film is how they decided to make Nebula less of a 2D character and really provide the depth they didn't have time for her character in the first film. We also get an excellent performance from Kurt Russell as the God Ego- as well as newcomer Pom Klementieff's hilarious portrayal of Mantis, and of course the brilliant Michael Rooker as Yondu. The soundtrack is great, obviously, and Gunn's direction is so excellently crafted and visually sound that you can't help but feel every aspect of emotion he is going for while making it. It's an incredibly funny film, with some great action scenes, and a deeply emotional turmoil that honestly made me cry once...or twice. The visuals are also fantastic, as well as the makeup, and the look of the film is incredibly well developed- as well as its style and atmosphere. In the end, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is everything you would hope the sequel would be and more. It may not be quite as good as the original, but it certainly is more than a worthy successor.",/review/rw3748823/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2021,benjaminwest-242,8," A great sequel, comparable to the original
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is everything the audience could have hoped for. The same comedic atmosphere is applied, assisting the twists and turns that the plot employs. All the while, the emotional depth of the storyline is perfectly meaningful and helps set out the various messages of the film. The visual effects are yet again stunning and the fight scenes deliver. The movie capitalizes on another amazing soundtrack to accompany its wacky group of characters, whose respective cast members do extremely well giving life to.",/review/rw3748823/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2017,Reno-Rangan,8," Guardians' date with the creator.
","The first film was the most unexpected. That was one of the most colourfull space films I have ever seen. Youthful, energetic, fantastic visuals and so the same followed in this sequel as well. Not the same good, but stood to the expectation of the first film's success. This story does not have a great adventure in the galaxy. A simple quest, but a thrilling action-adventure. Now this accidental space gang is set to meet the creator.",/review/rw3748823/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2021,daveh282001-893-288947,9," Great time!
","3 hour movies are usually too long. (Some movies are too long at any length). This movie seemed too short. The whole film is fun to watch. Most of the pacing, the story and the dialogue are excellent. The humor is actually funny and the characters, which were introduced in the first GG film, continue to be dynamic in this sequel. I actually cared about the characters. I especially liked Michael Rooker's An-du character, and his admission that he loves Quill like a son. Actually, the only ones who don't get a happy ending are the Cree & Ego. Great special effects too. üëçüèªüëçüèª",/review/rw3748823/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2017,claudio_carvalho,8," Magnificent Sequel

Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket and Baby Groot defeat the monster and receive the notorious Nebula (Karen Gillan), who is Gamora estranged sister, as previously agreed to receive the bounty offered for her.

6 May 2017,cruise01,10," Guardians is back and has plenty of visuals and action. A great second chapter in GotG.
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is back and flashy as ever when it comes to its visual style of action, soundtrack, a fun cast, and the laughable humor. Usually sequels can be a let down after its predecessor set the standards high. And the build up momentum for the sequels is easily forgotten. Writer/Director James Gunn manages to continue what worked on the first movie and expand further with the characters he brought together. Yes, it is a ragtag of misfits that try to be a team and argue to each other with their own personal issues. In the end, they see each other not as friends but family.

27 April 2017,MichaelNontonMulu,9," The Sequel to Those Unusual Marvel Superhero in the Galaxy
","This movie was a very fun superhero film. It did not provide us with very heavy storyline, the premise was quite simple and best of it all, it was having lots and lots of funny moments. My wife and I truly enjoyed this movie as we had laughs all over the movie and there were even some emotional moments as well which was very lovely to see at the end (and made my wife very emotional). I love the chemistry among the Guardians, and I loved Baby Groot's very cute and adorable behavior. I also loved the opening scene which I think was very cool.",/review/rw3748823/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2017,Harun_Karali,7," Almost as funny and charming as the first
","As someone who was floored by the first film, I was eager to see how the second installment in Gunn's trilogy(yes, it's a trilogy now) would pan out. To be honest, I was a bit anxious, as we are familiar with Hollywoods track record when it comes to sequels. However there are rare moments when the sequel lives up to it's predecessor. As is the case here, as Gunn delivers the same charm, humor and emotion as the first film. The big difference is the focus on Peter's story, As our heroin meets his long lost father Ego(brilliantly played by Kurt Russell), who shows up at the knick of time, as Rocket pisses off Ayesha(Elizabeth Debicki) who sends a space armada after them. To add the cherry on top of this pie is the soundtrack(Sam Cooke's Bring it on Home to Me), that was meticulously chosen. If you were a fan of the first, don't doubt, Gunn delivers a space opera that lives up to it's hype. I have high hopes for the future of the MCU, it's clear that the studio let Gunn's creativity speak for itself and boy did he have a lot to say.",/review/rw3748823/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2017,aharmas,9," Father and Son Connection
","The first ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" was a welcome surprise, with engaging characters, funny lines, and a great portrayal of friendship in the most unexpected places. Times goes on, and relationships evolve and deepen in most cases. So in the end, there's plenty of action, back stories are connected, and it sort of makes sense.",/review/rw3748823/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2017,kosmasp,9," The sequel we've been looking for
","Of course the first one came completely from out of nowhere. Well not in a sense that no one knew the movie was being made or came out in the cinema. But no one expected anything from it. And it became this larger than life thing. With characters so well written and with just enough swagger and good dialog/one-liners, it's almost crazy that no one expected this would be great.",/review/rw3748823/?ref_=tt_urv

29 April 2017,phanthinga,9," It not surpass the first one but still a fun sequel
",I guess after the incredible successful of the first movie Marvel finally gave James Gunn all the right to create his own superheroes movie and the result is Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 not only a fun movie sequel but also a big pop culture Easter eggs.The movie is fill with enough iconic figures of the late 80s and 90s that guarantee to make you have a nostalgic blast from start to finish.The humor of the movie is still there with many scene that make the audience laugh out loud involving The Guardians especially Rocket and baby Groot but sometime does get a little over head.The chemistry between characters is as strong as ever when this time they not only have to save the galaxy one again but also have to face off with their own problem and learn how to work not as a team but as a family.Because family is the main topic of this movie so you have to expect there a lot of cheesy speech about family that kinda awkward and ridiculous at first but in the end it managed to make me almost cried.One last thing you guys seriously need to check out Awesome mix vol 2 it freaking kick ass,/review/rw3748823/?ref_=tt_urv
