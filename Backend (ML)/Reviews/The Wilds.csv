29 July 2022,pika52160,10," Another great show canceled!
",I am upset as another wonderful series gets the ax. I wish shows that have high ratings and dedicated viewers continue to be dropped.,/review/rw6359381/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2022,gallagherkellie,7," Addictive
","Yes this show has some unbelievable and silly aspects to it, but it's entertaining and every episode kept me wanting more. It's very bingeable!! The acting was quite good, season one is better than the second but I enjoyed both.",/review/rw6359381/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2020,Avalala,7," Geez people are so hard to please
",Why did I like this show? Was it the best show ever? No... But it was good. It was fun to watch and it kept me intrigued. The bad reviews written 24 hours after the show came out... (are you serious?) they probably watched one episode and then stopped to complain. IMDB users are so hard to please these days. A show produced by Amazon is never a 1/10 get your head out of your booty. :),/review/rw6359381/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2020,veinctor,7," I like it, despite the plotholes
","Yes this show is a lot like Lost: a group of people, stranded in an island, with a conspiracy lurking all around them. Flashbcks and Flashforwards are also here. But thankfully there are no supernatural element here, questions do not take whole seasons to be answered and you get to see the bad guys plan unfold.",/review/rw6359381/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2020,lovethesun,6," Please don't listen to the bad reviews
","Considering there were reviews left here almost instantly after this series hit Amazon prime, there is no doubt that those reviewer's did not watch 10 hours/10 episodes before leaving their scathing reviews. If you can't bring yourself to watch an entire movie/series before giving your opinion, maybe you should just not say anything. I personally really enjoyed it. Is it the greatest series I've ever seen? Of course not but I still found it enjoyable and look forward to the next season.",/review/rw6359381/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2022,itmeansflower,9," Why canceled? Plz someone pick it up!!!
","My husband & I really enjoyed this series, & only recently discovered it. So we're upset it's not getting a third season. I wish there were a way us fans could vote for series that are (for whatever reason) being considered for cancellation. - If anyone out there is listening, please SAVE THIS SHOW!!!",/review/rw6359381/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2020,WhateverIWant29,6," It's ok, a decent watch but really not a must watch
","Decent watch, but not great. The concept is a bit different because it focuses on teen girls stuck on an island -it's like a Lord of the Flies meets Lost, but with Teens. You do have to get past the first episode to start enjoying it and it does get a bit better. I was entertained but could have also easily have given it a miss, there was nothing profound or groundbreaking that happened and although there were diverse characters with varying backgrounds, they were hard to relate to.",/review/rw6359381/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2020,djkaine,6," Not terrible...
","But it wasn't good either. Somewhere in between.
The characters are wayyyyy too extra.
No character is more annoying than Leah. Leah can easily replace the girl on the crazy ex gf meme.
If they would have dialed the characters down about 25 percent, it would have been better.
The plot is just a bit silly and kinda pointless, but I think the show is more meant as a character study.
It somehow strangely keeps your interest, so good on them for that.
The girls are all pretty good at acting their parts and were believable in their rolls, even though they were directed to be over the top a lot, and I mean A LOT.",/review/rw6359381/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2022,mmadlam,10," SAVE THE WILDS
","This is such an important show for queer women, Indigenous women, women fighting mental health/eating disorders, and all women! One of my favourite shows absolutely phenomenal.",/review/rw6359381/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2022,cmwag,10," Had me hooked!
","So i'm a late comer to this show, i just started it this summer after seeing a promo for the second season. I watched with my family, and MAN, we were hooked! We scheduled dinners together so we could literally talking theories of what we think will happen! Despite the backlash, i thought the second season was also really good! The boys weren't as entertaining as the girls, but i still had to binge. Each episode had enough suspense leaving me wanting more! I was really looking forward in seeing how the two groups would interact with each other.",/review/rw6359381/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2022,juniperroberts,10," #SaveTheWilds #RenewTheWilds
","This show deserves another season after that cliffhanger we got at the end of Season 2. The cast and characters deserve their closure/ending. Not to mention, The Wilds portrays more than a handful of varying representations across different groups such as the LGBTQ+ community, Indigenous people, the Black community, etc. It's clear as day that this show means a lot to the fans; all you have to do is look at Instagram and Twitter to see the dedication and hard work the fandom puts in to try to get the show renewed/picked up by another streaming service. Amazon Prime Video will forever be my #1 public enemy now. Give The Wilds one more season (one more chance)!",/review/rw6359381/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2020,shane1181,6," People calling this LOST 2.0 must not have watched very far
","This isn't LOST at all since-spoilers-the whole thing is a highly organized and planned social experiment being observed 24/7. It's more like the Stanford Prison Experiment, but without consent of the observed. If LOST involved cameras and scientists watching the whole thing, then I clearly missed the whole point of that show. To illustrate my point, they didn't even really crash a plane! It was staged. The ""survivors"" only think the plane has crashed based on the crap they find washed up on shore and listening to a staged black box flight recorder. After that, they are dependent on ""whatever the ocean delivers,"" but this isn't exactly LOST. It felt more like Naked and Afraid to me (but 8 of the 9 girls don't know that's what it is, nor did they consent to it).",/review/rw6359381/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2022,esfunder,10," Incredible Representation
","This is one of the only coming of age shows that has LGBTQ+ and indigenous representation. Fans are loyal, invested, and want a conclusion to their favorite series. We need a third season!",/review/rw6359381/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2020,aarongnr,9," Another victim of early raters
","The show really picks up after the first couple episodes, and the first 2 really don't do it justice.",/review/rw6359381/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2020,AverySays,," Reviews are no longer reliable here
","The Wilds is neither a breakthrough in television, nor one of the worst series ever made. The 1's and 10's are dishonest, at best, and ignorant at worst. There never used to be so many 1's and 10's given to TV series and movies here. Almost NOTHING deserves a 1 or a 10. I miss the days when I could rely on the ratings here. It's too bad there are so many people who can't actually evaluate something on a scale from 1 to 10.",/review/rw6359381/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2020,kyle-88119,5," Intrigued but wtf writers
","Very cool concept and the acting is pretty good but the writers could have done way better. The drama on the island is ridiculous and i find it extremely far fetched. The stuff they complain about is dumb and their drive to get off the island is so low it's crazy. One girl says she doesn't want to build a shelter because ""she doesnt want to make this place feel like home"". What? One cold night on the beach and those girls would be building a shelter first thing in the morning. I just felt like a little common sense could've gone a long way. I know they want to make it seem like these girls don't know anything survival-wise but damn...",/review/rw6359381/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2022,carolynpickering,9," Cancelled? Why?
","I enjoyed this show's first season and was looking forward to more. But I find it's cancelled so no point watching season 2. What a waste of time for everyone involved and especially us, the audience. Who makes these stupid decisions?",/review/rw6359381/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2021,Just-A-Girl-14,9," MORE PLEASE !!
","I gotta say, I really enjoyed this show! I love survival stories because I find the psychological aspect of it to be very interesting. I also thought the characters were quite interesting. I really enjoyed the journey I had with them. Some I liked right from the start and others I started out liking and ended up hating (and vice versa). Leah for example was a character I really liked at the beginning but ended up disliking. The fact that she was suspicious right from the start was really cool but she took it to some really dark places. Fatin on the other hand was a character I disliked at the beginning but ended up loving. She seemed careless and superficial at first but as time passed by it was easy to see that it was just an act and that she is a much more deep and caring person. The funny thing is that my favorite character right from the start was Nora. I loved her way before I learned her story and even more so after (so she better be alive).",/review/rw6359381/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2022,AndiAgostiStan,10," Justice for The Wilds
","I love this show especially season 1. I see a lot of people talking about plot holes and such but come on the whole show is supposed to be a mystery unraveling as we're watching, I'm sure MANY of the plot holes would have been fixed with a few more seasons.",/review/rw6359381/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2022,justinet-67241,10," One of the best shows right now
","It really is. I mean of course it has its flaws but it's an amazingly entertaining series with both drama and comedy and a great cast of newcomers. Also, representation matters and this show has tons of it, it's so refreshing. Really wish I had had a show like this while being a teenager, it's a real shame it has been canceled, I really hope it will get picked up. Really worth the watch in any case.",/review/rw6359381/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2022,eavesac,10," Save this show I swear to god
",10/10 amazing and incredible. The best queer and poc representation I've ever seen. Such strong and talented actresses especially considering this is almost all of their first roles. It's so unique and interesting. I've gotten ten people to watch and they are all HOOKED.,/review/rw6359381/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2020,ginnypeeples,8," Genuinely liked it and binged in one day
","I genuinely liked the show and binged it in one day. It is a needed distraction! It was a blend of Lost and the 100; both of which I liked. If you don't like YA dystopian/survival shows or books, it may not be for you.",/review/rw6359381/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2020,nikkileighmaz,8," Left me wanting more
","I really liked this show, seems like most of the bad reviews didn't bother watching through to the end. Lots of unexpected twists and a cliff hanger that left me waiting for a season 2. The acting was a bit cheesy, but it's a YA series...what did you expect?",/review/rw6359381/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2020,mcninny,9," Such crap reviews for a good show!
","I'm on episode 7 and I'm really enjoying it.
I like the characters and the flashback storytelling... and found it compelling and entertaining.",/review/rw6359381/?ref_=tt_urv
