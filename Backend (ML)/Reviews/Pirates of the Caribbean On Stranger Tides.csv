","Greetings again from the darkness. It's not unusual for an actor or actress to alter their physical appearance for a movie role. Sometimes those changes become the story: Robert DeNiro in Raging Bull and Christian Bale in The Machinist are two that come to mind. Regardless of the transformation or make-up, what really matters is the performance and the character. Just ask Eddie Murphy (Norbit) or Gwyneth Paltrow (Shallow Hal). In The Dallas Buyers Club, we actually get two incredible transformations that lead to two stunning performances.",/review/rw3062523/?ref_=tt_urv

In fact I jus saw this movie again on hbo, at 2 am. I dint got the time to write the review when I first saw the movie. I m writing this while am watching it on hbo. It's a sad thing that the cbfc here in India plays a spoilsport by censoring all the English movies even if it's aired after 1 am, while ignoring the trash bollywood item songs openly broadcasted in daylight. Fucktards, never cut the violence portrayed in bollywood movies but all action n horror movies are chopped here. Fucktards even went on to delete scenes from the girl with the dragon tattoo that too in theatres. Good Daniel Craig refused to allow that to happen. But ultimately it's people who wants to watch, they are deprived. Coming back to the movie, it was a very good movie with excellent acting and editing.",/review/rw3062523/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2013,PWNYCNY,10," Outstanding movie about important themes.
","This movie is wonderful. It contains all the elements of a great movie. It has a strong script, excellent acting, compelling themes and terrific cinematography. This movie contains what is probably Matthew McConaughey's best performance. He carries the movie. He is in just about every scene. The movie deals with several themes - AIDS, terminal illness, government regulations, response to crisis, change of life issues, homosexuality, promiscuity, personal responsibility, and capitalism. All these themes are treated forthrightly.After watching this movie, one should come away with a better understanding and appreciation of the issues raised. But although the movie touches on themes that have political implications, it is first and foremost a drama. Although the movie takes some literary license, such as frank depictions of sickness and drug abuse, none of it is gratuitous. That is, it adds to the story.",/review/rw3062523/?ref_=tt_urv

","At the beginning of the AIDS epidemic in the early 1980s, patients were advised to wait. In the six years following the first recording of the AIDS outbreak in 1981, more than 40,000 people in the U.S. died while waiting. In response to the clamor for action on the AIDS crisis, then Vice President George H.W. Bush has been quoted as saying ""If you want change, change your behavior."" Roger Ebert recalls, ""Politicians did not want to be associated with the disease. Hospitals resisted admitting victims, and when an AIDS victim died, some health-care workers would place the body in a black garbage bag. Funeral homes refused to accept the corpses.""

24 November 2013,whirrrrl,10," Evokes an Era most will not care to remember
","Much has already been written about Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto's astonishing transformations, and brilliant performances. Solid and true, yes. They both deserve enormous accolades, Golden Globe and AMPAS-worthy, for these transformations and the effort of their craft. But I think the true heroes of this project are the Producers who took a chance on such dicey subject matter. Some reviews hail the project as ""A Crowd Pleaser,"" and yet, you realise, these are TRULY marginal characters, and not entirely likable, as some have already said, in an Era (1970s-1980s early AIDS crisis) that is nearly forgotten in this age of HIV exposure-as-a-managed-care-condition, rather than a death sentence, as it was between 1979-1995. As much as this could be a feel-good film for the discovery and pioneer of protease inhibitor cocktails, it is a compelling character study of a time of crisis that has not been well-captured or documented adequately in quite some time. BRAVO to the Producers of this movie for giving this project the Greenlight, because the sexually-active youth of today would never know the Plague and tragedy that preceded their coming-of-age without a reminder like this.",/review/rw3062523/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2014,bob the moo,," Consistent and engaging story told with a strong lead performance and a refreshing lack of sentimentality
","This film came to the UK with the usual awards hype that seems to accompany any number of bigger films that are released around this time, but I had made an effort to avoid it and didn't know too much about it other than McConaughey being talked up about his performance. Indeed I had ignored it as much as I could and to the point where I really knew the barebones of the plot – which was to say it was a true story of a guy who got HIV and, frustrated by the lack of medical treatment at the time, decided to start running effective drugs unapproved by the FDA across the Mexican border into the US. With this very basic grasp I did worry that the film would be sentimental, making a hero of the main character, playing up the plight of the infected and generally being the sort of film they wheel out for awards at this time of year, ticking all the topics off that gets voters onboard.",/review/rw3062523/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2013,lucasnochez,8," Review: Dallas Buyers Club
","Since before the start of the new millennium until just after 2010,  Matthew McConaughey's body of work was just that, a body that worked  well on the screen for so many of the aimless, brainless onslaught of  romantic/comedy disasters, in which he played the lead. In 1996,  McConaughey played Jake Tyler Brigance in Joel Schumacher's A Time To  Kill. Hailed as the best performance of his career, it seemed like,  critically, that was the closest the actor would get to any praise.  In 2011, McConaughey took the lead in Brad Furman's The Lincoln Lawyer,  a by-the-number crime/mystery, where, McConaughey was able to flex some  of his acting muscles as opposed to abdomen muscles. Since then, in  what has been the most sudden and misunderstood acting turn in recent  memory, McConaughey has reinvented his career and is continuing to be  casted as a serious actor with serious acting skills.  While the Texan acting inspiration has remolded his career in a time  span that puts to shame that of Downey Jr. and Travolta, one of  McConaughey's unflinching signature acting staples is his bold and  proud Texan accent. And while I can't really imagine how a cowboy like  himself was cast in Christopher Nolan's upcoming science fiction  Interstellar, McConaughey and his accent were surely a match made in  heaven for his role as the slowly weathering and dying HIV/AIDS patient  Ron Woodruff.  For Dallas Buyers Club, McConaughey and his accent worked exceptionally  well. Quebecois director Jean-Marc Vallee helms McConaughey as Ron  Woodruff; a rugged, homophobic, ultra- macho, bull-riding, money  throwing, playboy with no accord to anyone. Woodruff, a money hustling,  chance taking electrician juggles his fortune, his luck, his women, and  his job to make ends meet and live a somewhat fulfilling life. It isn't  until an unexpected accident at work that leaves Woodruff hospitalized,  giving him no choice but to make a difference in his life and the lives  of many others.  Upon learning of his recent HIV positive diagnostics and short thirty  day life expectancy time span, Woodruff, reluctant to die, uses his  hustling, smooth-talking, greasing ways to secure him a new, untested  medicine to prolong the spread of HIV, the FDA (Food and Drug  Administration) approved AZT. After consuming an uncontrolled amount of  AZT, the only legal drug that was available at the time in the United  States, all the while, still abusing his substances, Woodruff has a  close encounter with death. Coming to the morbid realization that the  ATZ was depleting his longevity, he enlists the help of a disgraced  doctor (Griffin Dunne) and together bring unapproved anti-viral  treatments to the U.S illegally. What starts off as a simple economic  money tapping market venture, Woodruff, along the way, comes to the  realization that his efforts to help others, are actually working.  Enlisting the help of fellow HID/AIDS victim Rayon (Jared Leto), the  two start the Dallas Buyers Club, an alternative treatment centre for  paying members that pits Woodruff in a gestating face-to-face with the  FDA and other pharmaceutical companies. As the clientele grows thanks  to Rayon's introduction to the biggest HIV/AIDS demographic,  homosexuals, Woodruff has a revelation that not only changes his  opinion of gays but also is a deep and dark look of sexual  discrimination in the south of the U.S in the 1980′s.  Dallas Buyers Club is a film dependent on the skills of its actors  physical and mental performances. Aside from McConaughey's drastic  forty pound weight loss, supporting actor Jared Leto dropped a hefty  amount of weight to play the utterly convincing transsexual Rayon.  Veering far away from Christian Bale comparisons in his eerie and  grotesque turn as Trevor Reznik in Brad Anderson 2004′s indie The  Machinist, the two leads in the Dallas Buyers Club abandon physical  spectacle in exchange for allowing their on-screen presence to give a  candid, historical accuracy of HIV/AIDS patients, and the brutal  struggle they faced against a deadly and unforgiving epidemic in the  United States in the 1980′s.  Dallas Buyers Club is McConaughey's best role yet. Fierce, trashy and  edifying, the actor substitutes humility for profanity, glamour for  wretchedness, and the light-hearted for the heavy and unapologetic.  Finally, McConaughey joins a club of actors that he should be proud to  be a part of.  Although the year's lead actor category is going to be a full one at  this year's Academy Awards, the Supporting Actor category will have a  clear winner. Unrecognizable, subtle and submerged into the role, their  is no deny or ignoring the raw talent Leto brings to the role of Rayon.  His previous efforts as a dedicated method actor, either gaining a  large amount of weight or shedding weight with a wink of an eye, Leto's  dedication to the craft is showcased in Dallas Buyers Club, and will  surely be rewarded.  Dallas Buyers Club is a morally, heavy-hitting drama with lasting  effects. Dramatizing the social discrimination of gays in the South of  the United States and the condition of many low-income, trailer-park  living American residents, the film raises the questions whether or not  AIDS/HIVS and other fatal diseases are fairly treated within government  fine print and whether the main goal of such large and powerful  companies is wealth, or health.  Gritty, raw and compelling, Dallas Buyers Club is a powerfully dramatic  based on a true story. Woodruff was a simple man, whose unfortunate  condition brought forth an incredible man who's zest for life inspires  others. Ron Woodruff definitely rode the bull in life; challenging the  powerful FDA, pharmaceutical companies and notions that were instilled  in his since birth. Thankfully for us, Vallee, McConaughey and Leto  ride the film into a place in our hearts, in an overly sexualized,  passionate display of what it's like to die ""with your boots on"";  dirty, gritty and with a fighting chance.",/review/rw3062523/?ref_=tt_urv

21 February 2016,ironhorse_iv,8," Join the club and buy this movie. It's worth seeing!
","Dallas Buyer Club is a great American biographical drama film! Co-written by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack, and directed by Jean-Marc Vallée. Set in the 1980s, the movie tells the story of a real-life AIDS patient, Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) who smuggled unapproved pharmaceutical drugs into Texas for treating his symptoms and distributed them to fellow people with AIDS. Fighting against the orders of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ron must try to manage his 'Dallas Buyers Club"" while facing the opposition from the government agency that originally sent out to protect him. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, while the movie is based on true events, it's also highly fictional. A good example of this, is the supporting characters of Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner), and Ron's transgender friend, Rayon (Jared Leto). Both were composite roles created from the writer's interviews with transgender AIDS patients, activists, and doctors. While, some critics might see these examples of artistic license as offensive, due those whom resent the reinterpretation of real event historical events; I saw it as a huge colleague improvement. After all, both Jennifer Garner and Jared Leto did very well in their roles. Jared Leto even won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in his accurate depiction of a fictional transwoman with HIV who helps Woodroof. To portray his role, Leto lost 30 pounds, shaved his eyebrows and waxed his entire body to look the part. Nevertheless, it wasn't as extreme, as Matthew McConaughey had to go, through, as Ron Woodroof. McConaughey lost nearly 50 pounds, just to play the role in the film. The severity of the weight loss for these actors is getting way too dangerous. I can see McConaughey having problems, later in his life, because of this. Despite that, he was amazing in this movie. Kinda glad, he won Best Actor for this movie. However, while Woodroof was known for peculiar eccentric behavior, according to those who knew him; both the film and McConaughey made him rougher than he actually was, with all the rampantly homophobic. Due to this, a lot of critics, believe that the portrayal of Woodroof in the beginning of the film, was very inaccurate and somewhat offensive, when many saw him, as a man that didn't harbor anti-gay sentiments and was himself bisexual. While, many of these real-life accounts are indeed mixed. Here is some truth about the guy. The real-life man did do hard drugs, and had a lot of sex, but also he was a family man, unlike the one, we saw in this film. I kinda do, hate the fact, that the movie cut this fact off from the story, because in my opinion, his ex-wives, family members and a daughter could help, push the character study, along, its character development. Despite all that, I do love, how the movie makes the main character transforms from a rotten person to a heroic one. Yes, he starts out as a homophobic, bigoted, promiscuous drug user, but he become very likable, over the course of the story, when he learns to take care of himself, eat healthy, and learns to appreciate and love others regardless of who they are. This is better than most tragic movies, are willing to give us. While, the movie's ending is bittersweet. I love the anti-corporate message demonstrated through drug companies' heartless action. It's true about what Woodroof says about the FDA. A good example of this, is the dangers of AZT when use to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS. While, it's true that high doses of this drug is indeed toxic, it's also true, that AZT has worked for many patients at an appropriate dose. The use of AZT as a way to treat HIV/AIDS is still a highly target controversial, medical debate, even today. Just note that the drug does somewhat work, in small doses. Another good thing about this film is allowing the audience, in rethinking their apparent anti-gay sentiments. It indeed, changed a lot of opinions of straight people had on gay people. It also introduce mainstream audiences, to a realistic portrayal of transgender, outside of Comedy or Indies films. I love, how this movie was filmed. Lots of symbolism with the idea of riding the bull, sequences. Loves all the close up, and bait and switch camera movements as well. However, there were some historic inaccurate with some of the sets and props in this film. It's funny, noticing somethings in the background that clearly wasn't there in the 1980s. Overall: the diagnosis for this rodeo of movie has fine performances which are the highlights of Dallas Buyers Club, but you don't want to go believing too much of its history. The movie takes many shortcuts, compressing and compacting its story that it's hard to tell, which sequences are fiction and which are the truth. In the end, it's best for you to watch it, and judge yourself. I do recommended it.",/review/rw3062523/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2013,robert-259-28954,10," The best movie I've seen in years.
","After watching this film, I've run out of glowing superlatives to describe it. First of all, a word on Matthew McConaughey. I've always thought of him as a relative lightweight in the film world, the sexy leading man best designed for selling tickets and little else. I am happy to report that I was mistaken. Sadly, horribly mistaken. From the very first frame of this amazing movie, I was so amazed at his physical transformation that it took a half an hour just to adjust my eyes to the frail creature I saw before me. But it was real, just as his stellar performance both illuminated the way I look at the entire AIDS epidemic and the toll it takes on humanity, both gay and straight. This film happily avoided all previous clichés and typical treatments of the subject matter, transcending every other film I have seen regarding HIV/AIDS. For so long I have decried the serious lack of great film for ADULTS, with seemingly everything out today designed for pre-pubescent teenaged boys interesting in nothing more than mindless video games and moronic super hero sequels. As with many memorable independent films, this gem was elevated to heroic status with the incredible acting of McConaughey, in concert with the amazing Jaret Leto, providing the perfect foil to his perfect, character-driven role. Every, single reason for going to the movies is present in the glorious truth and humanity of this landmark effort, a ""must-see' for anyone seeking superior acting in profusion. If there's a God in heaven, Matthew and Jaret should both win the Academy Awards for Best Performance by a Leading Man, and Best Supporting Actor. Each actor went far beyond mere ""acting"" in this film, becoming so entirely immersed into character that they stopped acting and just BECAME.
