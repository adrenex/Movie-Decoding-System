27 May 2007,poolandrews,7," I actually really rather like Signs...
","Signs is set in Bucks County, Pennsylvania where Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) lives on a farm with his his two young children Bo (Abigail Breslin) & Morgan (Rory Culkin) plus his younger brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), one morning they discover elaborate crop circles in their corn fields. At first they think it's a hoax but there are newsflashes all over the TV which say these crop circles have appeared all over the world, then things turn really sinister when UFO's start appearing in the sky by these crop circles & when footage of an alien is caught on a camcorder the Hess family have to consider the possibility of an alien invasion...",/review/rw0814770/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2019,classicsoncall,8," ""Is it possible that there are no coincidences?""
","I didn't care for this movie when it first came out, when I saw it on the big screen. I wasn't doing IMDb reviews back then, so I revisit those films prior to fifteen years ago that I might have seen but never commented on. My initial reluctance concerned how the story line veered off from a psychological thriller into a sci-fi flick, without considering the context of 'Father' Graham Ness's (Mel Gibson) insight into his 'two groups of people', who he defined as those who looked at luck or coincidence as confirming either their own hope versus fear. People with hope view coincidence as a sign that someone is watching over them, while those with fear feel that they're out in the world alone and on their own. Graham fell into the second camp, his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) felt comfortable in the first category.",/review/rw0814770/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2005,J_Charles,," underrated film
","I don't think this film deserved the poor reviews that some gave it. I've only seen 3 of Night Shylaman's films (6th Sense, Unbreakable) and this one is the most sophisticated in my mind in terms of the director manipulating the viewers into seeing and believing what he wants you to believe.",/review/rw0814770/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2016,petra_ste,7," Flawed but better than its reputation
","There are few things more or less all moviegoers tend to agree about, one of them being that the career of writer/director M. Night Shyamalan, after an impressive start (The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable), has turned out to be a huge disappointment. Opinions may differ on the moment he completely lost it, although Lady in the Water is generally regarded as the point his hubris got the better of him.",/review/rw0814770/?ref_=tt_urv

5 August 2002,reismark,10," Unspeakably brilliant
","In last week's issue of Newsweek, M. Night Shyamalan is quoted as saying to his accomplices in crime, ""If I did 'Pokemon 5,' would you come? Come on! I could turn it into a metaphor for the human condition!"" The scary thing about that comment is not only that he probably *could* do it if afforded the opportunity, but also that he pulls off a similar trick in ""Signs,"" which from an artistic standpoint is easily the best film he's ever done.",/review/rw0814770/?ref_=tt_urv

12 November 2002,blanche-2,8," not your typical sci-fi thriller
","If you went to this movie expecting a typical sci-fi thriller, you doubtless left disappointed.  If you went to this movie to see an M. Shamalayan Night film, you probably loved it, as I did.",/review/rw0814770/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2002,silverfish-1,10," This means something.
","Most of the people that comment on this movie are going to relate the fact that they were disappointed. And that's okay- your opinion of a movie should always include your pre-showing as well as post-showing emotions. But to those people I just have to say, ""You just don't get it."" Everyone is going into this movie thinking it is some kind of chilling horror, or blood-and-gore slasher flick. Shyamalan doesn't do those tired genres, thankfully. Instead, he gives us a warm, funny, emotionally-charged, and yes, suspenseful thriller which manages to compact an entire list of genres into one whole film.",/review/rw0814770/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2012,StevePulaski,2," Wooden and hollow, sort of like the door the aliens can't pass
","M. Night Shyamalan has become the butt of every person's movie joke with his consistently preposterous films, his unusual casting, and his own name. Like every director, I believe he can make a well made, approachable film, but Signs is one of the biggest patient-testing thrillers I've come to know. It's an overwrought, frivolous exercise and a belligerent kick to the science fiction genre and those who aspire to work in the field.",/review/rw0814770/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2005,gftbiloxi,7," Much To Enjoy, But Somehow Short of the Mark
","In a documentary that accompanies the film on DVD, M. Night Shyamalan admits that SIGNS was greatly influenced by such films as NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and Hitchcock's THE BIRDS--an admission that will come as no surprise to any one who has seen SIGNS in the wake of those films. Although very different, all three have one thing in common: they ultimately focus on a small group of people fighting off an unnatural entity that attempts to invade their very ordinary homes.",/review/rw0814770/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2003,Doylenf,," Works up some eerie suspense but is ultimately unsatisfying...
",Most of the suspense is well geared to keep you wondering how on earth this plot is going to be unraveled--but when the windup comes it's a disappointment in more ways than one. I was with the story until the last fifteen minutes when the whole thing just fell apart--but along the way there are many things to admire.,/review/rw0814770/?ref_=tt_urv

6 August 2002,cbhunter,9," Riveting and clever scarefest reinvents the modern horror film
","I have been a horror film fan for 30 years.  While I remember a few films actually scaring me as a kid (Jaws, Psycho), I have failed to encounter many in my adult life.  I like to be scared, but Hollywood has seen fit to retread every tired formulaic convention in just about everything it throws at the local multiplex. Even the independent filmmakers, free of the ""system"", seem to forget what FEAR is. Mostly I sit solemnly staring in disbelief at the screen, waiting and hoping to get those goosebumps. Then, finally, we were given Signs. Most will say, including the director, that this is not a horror film;  I genuinely disagree.  If this is not a horror flick, then it is time for this film to start a branch of its own and begin a new genre.  I admired every little aspect of this picture, from the use of everyday objects: baby monitor, a blank television screen and a half empty glass of water, to convey and act as a vehicle to extract fear from the ordinary. Most of all, Shyamalan is an expert craftsman and knows how to get the most out of space, actors and sound. It is the lingering shot on a basement staircase when you are desperately hoping he moves his camera to show us more, or the screeching sound in the next room  whose source he won't reveal .  This director knows just how long to hold the shot, to increase the tension and build the suspense, long enough for our mind to begin forming pictures.  And those pictures can be the most frightening of all.  Stay the course Shyamalan.",/review/rw0814770/?ref_=tt_urv

","Graham Hess is a preacher turned farmer since the death of his wife 6 months prior shattered his faith in the idea of God being in control and all things happening for his reasons. When his children awake to find a massive corn circle outside their house, Graham assumes practical jokers. When he sees men running outside his house at night he is sure of it. However when they begin to occur all over the world and are soon followed by global sightings of both crafts and aliens, he begins to realise what is going on, although the reasons behind it are unclear.",/review/rw0814770/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2016,Leofwine_draca,7," Religious drama meets alien invasion
","M. Night Shyamalan is one of the most consistently interesting directors working in Hollywood today. He first came to prominence with THE SIXTH SENSE, a top-notch horror flick, and followed it with UNBREAKABLE, a top-notch science fiction flick. Although I haven't seen THE VILLAGE yet, SIGNS makes a slight change of direction for Shyamalan. Although on the face of it, this combines both horror and science fiction elements, the actual alien invasion in the film takes a firm second place to the main thrust of the story, charting Mel Gibson's lack of faith coming from the horrific death of his wife.",/review/rw0814770/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2003,Spleen,," The idea, the story, and the script, are all excellent - in principle.
","Shyamalan likes the kind of surprise that makes us reinterpret what we've just seen, but he does so in a different way here: he makes us re-evaluate what the film's fundamentally about.",/review/rw0814770/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2004,dbdumonteil,," the happening (the Pixies)...
","Since ""the Sixth Sense"" (1999), M Night Shyamalan has become a respectable filmmaker who continues his exploration of the supernatural. Each new movie is announced like a great event. After ""the Sixth Sense"" (1999) and ""Unbreakable"" (2000), ""Signs"" was released in 2002 and as it was expected the movie was a worldwide blockbuster. A success widely deserved because the less we can say is that M Night Shyamalan's movie abounds in qualities, showing that he is able to go off Hollywood's beaten tracks to develop his peculiar style.",/review/rw0814770/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2021,kevin_robbins,10," This is an iconic American film that is way underrated and over slandered.
","Signs (2002) is currently available on Tubi. The storyline follows a family in a small town that lives on a farm and one day wakes up to crop circles. The family is made up of two brothers raising the older brothers little boy and girl after their mother passed away. As the storyline behind the crop circles unfolds so does the backstory of the family. This movie is directed by and stars M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense) and the cast also includes Mel Gibson (Lethal Weapon), Joaquin Phoenix (Gladiator), Rory Culkin (Scream 4) and Abigail Breslin (Little Miss Sunshine). This is an iconic American film that is way underrated and over slandered. The writing in this is Oscar worthy and so are the performances. Gibson was perfect portraying a man battling his inner demons after the passing of his wife. This may be his all time best performance. Joaquin Phoenix is a super star. Period. When Culkin looks at him and says ""I wish you were my father,"" and Phoenix ripped that line, ""Don't you ever say that again."" Masterpiece. The chemistry between the cast top to bottom was so good. The pace of the alien invasion is well done and allowed time for the passing of the mother storyline, which was so good. The final concluding scene wrapped up the movie perfect. 10/10.",/review/rw0814770/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2002,l_a_t_e_r_a_l_u_s,9," One of the best movies of 2002 so far
","A scary-looking monster is not needed in this movie. Just simply the fear of the unknown is enough. But just in case that's not enough for YOU, you will also get creepy sounds & very frightening situations. I don't want to give too much away, but I will say that some of the stuff that is on the news on the TV in the movie is some of the scariest material in the movie. While all the things on the news in this movie are pretty freaky, there is one news clip in particular that I think really scared mostly everyone (maybe everyone) in the audience. So basically, don't go to this movie expecting to see a bunch of man-killing freaky-looking aliens. If you want something like that, rent ""Alien"".",/review/rw0814770/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2003,Derek237,9," ""Is it possible there are no coincidences?""
","There are plenty of movies that use the idea of aliens invading and attacking earth. Some are good, some are incredibly bad. Signs uses that concept but follows through on it in a way I've never seen before. Instead of showing a bunch of stories like what the president is doing about this, the army fighting the aliens, and showing hundreds of people running and screaming, this movie shows how most people would probably be experiencing this: at home, anxiously watching the news for information. There are plenty of suspenseful scenes that are scary not because of what you see, but because of what you don't see, and what you are afraid to see.",/review/rw0814770/?ref_=tt_urv
