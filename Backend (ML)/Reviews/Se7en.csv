28 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," So underrated!
","Eastbound & Down is easily one of the most underrated comedies of all-time. It is absolutely hilarious! It follows an ex baseball player named Kenny Powers (Danny McBride) who is a substance abuser and self destructive a-hole. He's now a physical education teacher in his hometown of North Carolina and gets another chance a the big leagues. He has to go to Mexico where he gets his major league abilities back. He comes back a changed man, or not. It's one of the funnier shows you'll ever see and will literally make you laugh out loud. Danny McBride is so underrated as a comedian and he is perfect in this! The executive producers in this are Will Ferrell and Adam McKay so if you like that kind of comedy then give this a try because you'll love it.",/review/rw5621574/?ref_=tt_urv

","One of the funniest shows ever produced by HBO. Danny Mcbride at his best. You have to be a fan of his comedy to like the show as it's all about him. Any fans of Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill etc will enjoy it. It's hilarious, weird and sometimes messed up but it's funny as hell and you should love it.",/review/rw5621574/?ref_=tt_urv

",When people are genuinely bad you don't like them. But when Danny McBride creates a bad person and makes it hilarious and gets creative you can't go wrong. The last season is the best so it's worth watching all of it.,/review/rw5621574/?ref_=tt_urv

",No holds barred laughs all around. A must see HBO series!,/review/rw5621574/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2022,Always_green86,10," One of my favorite shows!!!!
",If your a Danny McBride fan you'll love this... a classic comedic show from 1st to last season. Each character has they're own footing in the show which helps Kenny's ego. But the show revolves around Kenny powers (Danny McBride) who gives you. Laugh almost every scene.,/review/rw5621574/?ref_=tt_urv

",Vice Principals better! The first place I ever saw McBride was in VP I'm super picky about comedy and loved it. Him and Goggins have great chemistry I wish that had gone at least a few more seasons( the spring break episode's my fave)! Well enough of that. McBride isn't quite as witty/funny in this( same with Righteous gemstones). I started watching this a few years back after I watched VP and gave up because the site I used played episodes and seasons out of order so I was scrolling HBO max and saw it and am now on season 4 I think? I really like Steve( great actor) but him and Danny don't quite have the vibe /chemistry he and Goggins had and I agree now after seeing McBride in more things that he plays the exact same character type ( well it's his acting style) in everything. Tho to me VP was his best. He seemed to have more range? Tho with all the junk out there this is gold compared so I will finish and try ( or hope) to find something good ( of quality) out there.,/review/rw5621574/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2022,justinbrizendine,10," Super dope
","This program has an 8.2 rating, and the only reason it isn't a 10 is because it's got purest version of sociopathic humor one can ever see. It'll make you laugh your ass off. Then it can make you cry because it's sooo sad or messed up. That being said, one of the best shows you'll ever watch.",/review/rw5621574/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2009,Greatornot,9," HBO has another winner
","Excellent new show . Great acting by McBride. Great job for Will Ferrel.. And I am not even a big Will Ferrel fan. He certainly shines as the architect of this series. This is a fun show and obviously based loosely on fallen Atlanta Braves pitcher John Rocker. A has been , egotistical, arrogant ,horny, foul mouthed clod winds up as a P.E. teacher in a middle school while still yearning the spotlight. Living with his straight laced older brothers family with 3 children. There are so many comedic situations that can arise from this situation. It is just unbelievable how HBO turns in so many top notch, entertaining projects. This show is well acted by all . Watch this and you shall be impressed.",/review/rw5621574/?ref_=tt_urv

","You've spent your life searching for something. You've tried drugs, sex with strangers...You've made and lost millions but...That quest just never ends; UNTIL NOW! This series will change your life. It is like blending all religions, history, drama, and baseball together and forming the perfect thing. You're welcome; Signed Danny McBride...:)",/review/rw5621574/?ref_=tt_urv

","I don't know how I will feel about this show a year from now, but after having watched all six episodes several times over, I consider it to be one of my favorite series of all time. This was just exactly my sense of humor. In the vein of Bad Santa and its anti-hero Willie, Kenny Powers is an uncompromising mess of a character that seems to say and do the most amusing thing possible in every situation. Not since Owen Wilson broke out with ""Bottle Rocket"" has there been a performer who can make me laugh by doing so little--it's more about his delivery than the actual material. I am deliberately not discussing any details of the show in case someone wants to discover it for themselves, but if you enjoy either of the two movies I mentioned, or other profanity-laced HBO offerings, such as Entourage (with the equally foul-mouthed Ari Gold), then try some. I think it's worth noting that both Kenny Powers and Ari Gold are both the most quotable TV characters of the decade, and certainly my two favorites.",/review/rw5621574/?ref_=tt_urv

14 May 2021,moneypennycharley,10," This show is my jam
","Honestly, I don't care who you are, what your sense of humor is, this show is down right hilarious. It's so well written and the subtle jokes to the outright blatant ones always seem to fit what is going on naturally. Kenny is the biggest a-hole in existence but it makes you love him still somehow lol, and his inner struggles with his own ego and his family sets it aside from yet another strictly comedy program.",/review/rw5621574/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2009,zetes,," Hilarious!
","The collaborators behind The Foot Fist Way and Observe & Report made this television miniseries for HBO earlier this year. It's very much like their two films, but it's definitely their most satisfying work. That's mostly because it's consistently funny. The films are frequently hilarious, but get bogged down in some heavily dramatic moments. And they also have a lot of jokes that fail. The six episode show plays like a 2 1/2 hour movie, although the individual episodes are very much structured like television. Danny McBride stars as a John Rocker-like former baseball star named Kenny Powers. He came to fame during a World Series final game and was enormously popular. But between his bad behavior and diminishing results, and passing through about ten MLB teams, he's been kicked out and now he's broke. He returns to his North Carolina hometown and shacks up with his brother, who is married with three children. The only job he can get is as a substitute gym teacher at a local middle school (the teacher for whom he is substituting ends up dying at the end of the first episode, allowing him to become a real part of the faculty). Having tasted so much fame, Kenny is not at all happy at where he is landed. In his mind, some light training will get him back into the big leagues. Meanwhile, he can treat everyone around him like crap and pursue his now engaged high school sweetheart, who teaches art at the school. Like the two films, Eastbound and Down mines a very painful existence. It's mean and misanthropic. I learned to see Kenny Powers as a human being, but he sure as Hell is a repugnant one. It's hard to believe that anyone would give this guy the time of day. You'd think the former girlfriend would tell his to screw off, his boss would fire him and even his brother would disown him. Oh well, it's fiction, after all. Not everything has to be believable (unlike Observe & Report, there're no hints that any of the story is taking place within the character's mind). I wish I could come up with some lines from the show to prove how funny it can be, but IMDb is pretty useless so far. I probably wouldn't be able to post them here, anyway. The show is ridiculously profane. Fans generally refer to the protagonist as Kenny ""F'ing"" Powers (as Kenny Powers often does himself). Will Ferrel appears in a couple of episodes, but his over-the-top style clashes a bit with the more naturalistic style of the show. Craig Robinson also appears, and works a lot better. Besides Jody Hill, art-house (and Pineapple Express) director David Gordon Green directs. I hope Green sticks with comedy at least in half his career. I've never been a fan of his art-house hits (or non-hits; I don't think any of them have been commercially successful), but his comic style works brilliantly.",/review/rw5621574/?ref_=tt_urv

",I don't think I've ever seen a more obnoxious main character in a show that I actually liked. I used to think Danny McBride was a moron but I really enjoyed Eastbound & Down and I love Vice Principals. The only thing that would've made the show better would've been if Walton Goggins had made an appearance but I know his schedule wouldn't allow it. Craig Robinson (Reg) and Will Ferrell (Ashley) are only in a couple episodes but they both steal the show.,/review/rw5621574/?ref_=tt_urv

","This show is one of my absolute ALL TIME FAVORITES. There's nothing out there like it. Danny and Steve are so hilarious as it is then to get them together, magic. I get why they ended it. So they didn't it drag it out. But I wish it would come back. Or come out with something else with these two in it. We need them on tv together!",/review/rw5621574/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is one of the greatest comedies ever. It didn't get the love it deserves when it was released. It's still brilliant 10 years later. The first two seasons are absolutely phenomenal, it loses its way for season three but then recovers. A classic overall",/review/rw5621574/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2016,wilkinsonalan-19160,9," Slow burner that becomes phenomenal
","Maybe it was the first two episodes - but, I wasn't really hooked by them. I came back to the series - and it turned into one of the funniest series I have ever seen. There are some cameo performances by the likes of Don Johnson, Matthew MaConaughey and Sacha Baron-Cohen. It is ironic that SBC was in this series - as he appeared to do something similar with Brothers Grimsby in a British context, but fell so short, sadly, of the standards achieved in E&D.",/review/rw5621574/?ref_=tt_urv

","This show wAs fantastic loved every episode and season. Kenny does a phenomenal job carrying this show with all the crazy scenarios he gets himself in, and always managing a way to mess it up once he gets whatever he is searching for. Highly recommend this show, so many great major and minor characters throughout this show.",/review/rw5621574/?ref_=tt_urv
