21 November 2021,sravansunkara,10," To me, it's a masterpiece
","It was the time I was really depressed. I was scrolling through Netflix recommendations and I accidentally found this anime. Before this, I watched death note and one punch man but I didn't get connected that much to both of them. I just wanted to watch just one episode to know how it would look like and after episode one, I ended up watching the whole anime. Now I'm a big fan of this anime. This cured my depression and gave me the motivation to move forward. The main character Izuku Midoriya hit me very hard. Whenever I feel depressed or feel like I couldn't make it, I remember Izuku Midoriya then some kind of energy rushes through my body - I connected to that character that much. Thank you so much for giving us this anime. Thank you Midoriya ðŸ’š

10 January 2022,kevin_robbins,10," Great blend of coming of age elements, humor and action
","My Hero Academia (2016) is a series my daughter and I watch together on Hulu (we are through 4 seasons so far). The storyline follows a world full of people who are blessed with ""quirks."" Not everyone has them, but once you discover you have them you can apply to schools who help you hone them in and use them for good. One boy who was born without a quirk one day is a hero and saves a friend and is determined by a hero he should have powers. It's his lucky day that this hero has to will his quirk to someone else as part of his power and he wills it to the boy. The boy applies to the most prestigious hero academy and gets in. This series follows his journey in the school.",/review/rw4504591/?ref_=tt_urv

29 December 2016,aesluvsread,9," plus ultra!!
","I came upon my hero academia on a whim. I had seen user ratings that said it was the bomb but he story seemed very generic and unrealistic, In truth it is the opposite. This show is defiantly in my top ten anime and even show list. You don't have to like anime to watch this show at all. From the first five minutes you can tell this show has a buzz about it that makes you want to binge until you drop. The main character Izuku Midoriya is an 8th grader and then freshmen in high school. This show picks apart a generic genre of superhero TV and makes it an emotional roller-coaster that shows that everyone is fighting to be a hero in their own way but not all people have the opportunity... sometimes you have to make it. I fell in love with every single character and the villain was so intriguing I had to read the manga (Japanese comic style story.) Plus usually I worry about the appropriateness of the shows I watch and I am proud to say the violence wasn't over the top for the situation and it was perfect for anyone else over 12 so you don't have to worry about gross profanity or stuff like that. This show is fantastic in so many ways and I urge you to watch it and keep in mind season two comes out April 2017. (I apologize for the super biased review!)",/review/rw4504591/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2016,mercfma,10," This is what every shounen show should stride to be!!!
","Before this aired everyone was talking about how great it was going to be, myself just looking at the key artwork & character designs I thought this was going to be so stupid. It looks 100% childish trash, I could not comprehend what people were seeing in it. The ONLY reason I decided to watch episode 1 was because of the massive hype, I'm SOOO happy I did. The first episode starts slow, there's no question but thats because this show knows pacing perfectly. Its not rushing into it at all, its setting itself up right because its quality in every aspect. This is going to be the next ""Naruto"" but unlike ""Naruto"" as of right now they're doing it 100% right, they're not cutting corners with animation or reusing the same things just constantly. The story is perfection, not to slow nor to fast, every episode feels like only 5minutes have gone by, it'll have you holding your breath in suspense & your heart beating in excitement. The animation is amazing, it puts Naruto & Bleach to shame in nearly every way. The artwork is beautiful, the character designs although my first impression was how childish it appeared it's actually quite older audience aimed. The music is amazing, the op & ed match the show perfectly and all the music during the show is right on. If your a shounen fan or a fan of ""Naruto"", ""Bleach"", or ""Hunter x Hunter"" you NEED to watch this. Its going to be better than Naruto & Bleach by a long shot.",/review/rw4504591/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2016,Alan_H4,," Two words: enjoyment & amazing!
",I won't go in to detail explaining why this anime is incredible. After seeing 'one punch man' i wanted to find a new fresh anime to watch. I was very skeptical on finding one that has the same quality as One Punch man... BUT damn was i wrong.. After watching episode 12 of Boku no hero academia i was Mind Blown... Seriously i even watched it a second time just to experience that final moment!,/review/rw4504591/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2016,shamushkhufu,10," my hero academy is a masterpiece.
","Well what can I say! This is one of the best anime series I have seen in many years. It is an absolute Masterpiece. The story is so simple and straight forward. It does take a time to build up the pace but saying that, this little beauty of an anime keeps you glued til the last episode and what a finale it is! I've watched this series at least 5 times more and I am eagerly waiting for season 2. Everyone was going crazy over ""one punch man"" but this anime blows it away easily. I've spoken to many anime fans and they have all said how excellent this show is. Believe me after you've watched it you will realize just what I'm taking about. I think the biggest tool this show has going for it is the soundtrack. How they the creators have used the music together with the story is sheer genius at work. This needs to be a long on going anime just like dragon ball z. 11/10 for sheer brilliance. My hero academy has the potential to be one of the greatest anime series ever.",/review/rw4504591/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2020,treystarz,10," MY HERO ACADEMIA
",ITS SO GOOD. My favourite anime right now. The story is amazing but I find the fights just levels above it. Watching the fights is like watching a movie. It feels so dynamic and real. I can't express with words how amazing watching Deku All might and Endeavour fighting really is. PLUS ULTRAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!,/review/rw4504591/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2020,Rectangular_businessman,8," I think it's a fun series
","I have to disagree with the people who calls this fun anime series an ""X-men rip-off"": Outside a somewhat similar premise, everything else (Characters, themes, plot development, visual style and the overall message from both works) are completely different: While X-men is more an allegory against intolerance, My Hero Academia is more about perseverance and improving oneself despite hardship.",/review/rw4504591/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2018,g-luismiguel14,8," The definition of Shonen.
","My Hero Academia is the type of anime that excels in all the things a typical shonen should be. The characters are entertaining and have their own personalities, the action is amazing, it's funny and the powers are super interesting. That being said, it also suffers from your typical fan service, which is unfortunate and ultimately one of it's worse flaws.",/review/rw4504591/?ref_=tt_urv

24 March 2022,supermonye,10," My favourite Anime of all time.
","Say what you want about this anime's AWFUL community ,but lets not shy away from possibly one of the best anime of all time because of that. The animation is good, the fight scenes are good, the characters are creative, interesting, funny and all have their own well written backstories, so well written that I sometimes find it hard to know who I'm rooting for in Good vs Evil fights. This will always be my favorite anime, of all time.",/review/rw4504591/?ref_=tt_urv

10 July 2020,A_Llama_Drama,2," Basic Anime
","This show is cute for kids but it's a far cry from any of the best fighting based anime.
Deku, the main, is like a weeabo's wet dream come to life. Devoid of any personality or talent besides an off-putting desire to be the best hero in the world, he screams and whines his way through confrontation after confrontation. We're a far cry from Gon's naive hunt for his father, or even young Naruto coming to grips with a demon inside him. I'd rather watch obnoxious Natsu rant about dragons than listen to Deku chastise his classmates once more for not being line toeing goody-two-shoes.",/review/rw4504591/?ref_=tt_urv

","I only started to watch this anime because of good reviews i saw on the net, and being naruto fan i never thought this anime could get any better than naruto,the initial intention was to only watch 2 episodes and before you know it i was already finishing episode 8!! The anime starts with a good phase and a solid background story of the character, after that it takes off and every end of an episode will make you want to watch the next right away. Good story with a nice blend of action & comedy involving the character. ",/review/rw4504591/?ref_=tt_urv

",The beginning of season 5 had me feeling like this wasnt gonna be my favorite season. But the last few episodes of the season were legit my favorite. I really liked that they went in depth with Shigaraki cause I didnt expect it at all. My heros villains have always been kinda one note but with this latest arc theyre now the thing that makes me excited af for next season.,/review/rw4504591/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2018,AzaanSherani,10," Blown !!
","I was looking for a decent anime one with a few episodes and one day on trending list I saw this. Fortunately, I started watching it and soon I was hooked. This show has it all; a brilliant storyline; awesome soundtrack and a pretty cool bunch of characters. When I first read about I didn't think it'll be that good as the storyline appeared to be a little childish but I was wrong. This show is nothing like what I thought it'd be. Some of the moments were pretty amazing the likes of which I only saw in some popular animes like Naruto, AOT.
So I'll suggest that you should just give it a try you won't regret it.",/review/rw4504591/?ref_=tt_urv

","I only followed the first two seasons and they were good. The fighting scenes were wonderful, especially Midoriya Vs Todoroki fighting. It was a great fight. I did not like the design of most of the anime characters and most of the supernatural abilities are very bad. The story was very simple. The best character in the anime for me is Bakugou , a fun anime that I recommend watching",/review/rw4504591/?ref_=tt_urv

7 April 2020,coasterdude44,8," Seems to be an anime seiries about shining light on people on the spectrum, but that's just my opinion/interpretation of it
","I have not been aware of this show's existence until only 2 months ago where I saw it being showcased at my local Supanova in Australia which is a general game/comic book/ pop culture fandom convention. I saw a couple of people there cosplaying as Izuku Midoria with his iconic green hair. I was intrigued about this strange new anime show that I did hear some famous YouTubers talking about, so I bought a couple of the manga books and started watching the anime.",/review/rw4504591/?ref_=tt_urv

10 December 2018,jqw-03736,7," One of the best super hero Stories ever made
","When I first watched this in late 2016, I thought It was okay and I didn't think it was going to be that special, but like 10 episodes in I couldn't stop watching. I had a hard time waiting for season 2 and when it dropped I was nervous to see if it could hold up to the masterpiece that was the first season. And when I watched I was so happy. The second season was as good, if not better than the first one. And the third season kept surprising me too. It was so cool to see everything from Dekus perspective, that he had no super powers but everyone else did. And then all might helped him. It was so good. So to all of you anime fans that loves shounen classics such as Naruto, Dragon ball and one piece, please do yourself a favor and watch this masterpiece. Cause I really think that this is up there with Death note and Full metal alchemist brotherhood as one of the best anime of all time.",/review/rw4504591/?ref_=tt_urv
