22 July 2017,teamscuba,10," One of the best cartoons out there!!
",Puppy dog Pals has some amazing characters and who doesn't love puppy dogs and kittens. This is a an adventure show and makes kids want to get outside and start their own adventure. I'm truly grateful for this cartoon and the high quality animation. Looking forward to season 2. P.S get to the Disney store fast!! These puppy dog pals are selling out quick. Had to wait a week for a new shipment.,/review/rw5236043/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2018,chels-luck-straubing,10," Adorable!
","Puppy Dog Pals is such a cute show. Even though I put it on for my 1 1/2 year old, everyone in the family (including my 2 teenagers, 16 & 15) end up watching it. We can't wait for the 2nd season! I hope they continue with this series for years to come.",/review/rw5236043/?ref_=tt_urv

15 January 2018,thebestqwertyuiop,10," I have yet to see a better children's show than this.
","Puppy Dog Pals is a fantastic show with, charming, lovable characters. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for something fun to watch! The animation is high-quality and the storylines will keep you on the edge of your seat. Best of all, there are many spectacular songs scattered throughout the episodes that you will undoubtedly find yourself sing along with. You MUST watch Puppy Dog Pals!",/review/rw5236043/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2019,michael-d-mccray,10," Love season 1...cannot stand Keia in season 2
",Adding Keia seems unnecessary from a show standpoint. Probably just added so they can sell more merchandise.,/review/rw5236043/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2019,tigerladyu-61409,9," Fun for all ages!
","My 2 year old grandson loves this show and I get a kick out of watching it with him.
The Puppies go on fun adventures and teach kids about geography, animals, and friendship, among other things. Even though the fact that they travel great distances in a short amount of time is unrealistic, I think it's part of the charm.
Bob is an eccentric genius (who is also a magician!)... he can't untangle leashes or string up Christmas lights but he created a robot dog that understands humans and speaks to animals, and he created the collars that amazingly hold everything the Puppies need on their adventures.
I also love the little references to old school pop culture that they throw in some of the episodes (like the Blues Brothers, Titanic, etc.) that even my daughters often don't get (but Grammy does!).
Overall this show is adorable and fun for all ages!",/review/rw5236043/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2019,trafalgardeathsurgeonoflaw,10," Cute show
","The show is cute and teaches kids a lot of things from friendship to problem solving. The only real issue I have is perhaps a possible negative message that Bob is sending to the kids who watch the show. He gets overly upset if something doesn't go his way. I know that is the meaning behind why this show is this show, he is upset and his puppies helps him feel better. But I just see some of Bob's attitudes having a negative impact like teaching kids it is ok to be upset over things not going their way. Other than that the show is cute and sends kids more positive messages than possible negative ones.",/review/rw5236043/?ref_=tt_urv

5 November 2018,crystalsimpson-37940,10," Perfect show for children
","My son loves this show. The puppies go on adventures and they teach simple lessons along the way. This is a show for children although I also enjoy it. I read two reviews where I think they forgot it's a show for kids and not for them. Cute puppies, fun adventures, what's not to love.",/review/rw5236043/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2018,ncnofanwm,10," Just love this show
",My son has loved this show since it started last year. It is such a cute show. My husband and me watch it even after our son goes to bed and sing along to the shows since we watch it so much. Please have a second season,/review/rw5236043/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2022,pattie_cakes,7," ""Be quiet kid, I'm watching Puppy Dog Pals""
","This show is very tolerable for a parent and I often find myself watching it and wondering how it's going to end LOL Not often are the same scenarios repeated. Good writers, and kudos to Harland Williams for the great creation!",/review/rw5236043/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2020,paperposts,10," Best Show Ever
","I do not even have kids. I put the Disney Channel on all day to keep my pets entertained by the music/voices particularly if I'm not around. So its ALWAYS on and Puppy Dog Pals is seriously soooo entertaining and cute. I've probably watched every episode (except for a few of the most recent) at least 5x a piece. People are saying that it's not educational, and maybe it's not in the classroom sense, but it does teach values which is just as important. It teaches about loyalty, love, and the importance of friendship, neighbors and family. It teaches children to tell the truth, teaches them to share, it teaches them to be kind, even when someone is not always kind to you (Cupcake) and that it's also okay to make a mistake. Other people are complaining about Bob. Yes, Bob is goofy and eccentric. The whole point of Bob having a particular issue in certain episodes is so that Bingo and Rolly can go on a mission to help SOLVE the problem. Bob character is MEANT to be the way he is for the plot of the show to work. But I like him, he's a goofy, charming genius who loves his pups, and they love him. The scenery is great, kids get to learn a little bit about other countries, and other states. They get to learn about other animals and what makes them unique (such as, the Cheetah is the fastest animal on land...or how Beavers cut sticks for dams). They learn about where things come from (such as, maple syrup comes from trees). So yes, it is educational because it teaches kids about the world and how different places, people and animals are unique. And while doing all of this it is extremely humorous, cute and fully entertaining. I like it as much as any really good adult show and never tire of it. I hope it remains on tv for a long long time",/review/rw5236043/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2019,mkrezanski,10," Fun show
",My son loves this show and always turns his head to the tv when the theme song comes on. I like that it encourages getting out and creating fun and adventures. I'm hoping that we can use lessons from this show to encourage our son to come camping and hiking with us!,/review/rw5236043/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2018,kyl-93982,10," Great!
",We love Bingo and Rolly! I daughter just turned two and this has always been one of the only shows she pays attention to. She can be anywhere in the house and here the theme song. She runs to the tv and dances.,/review/rw5236043/?ref_=tt_urv

27 February 2021,akobertein,5," The new Rolly
","We love Puppy Dog Pals...in fact my 2yr old is watching an episode from season 1 as I write this. The new Rolly in season 4 changed the dynamic between Bingo and Rolly. No longer is Rolly the adorable little brother who always had unknowingly great ideas. Rolly's new character appears now as clueless. His voice sounds like his nose is plugged up, high pitched at times, whiny and he drawls out Bingo's name. Bingo's name is the only word he drawls out which sticks out throughout the S4 episodes; it is increasingly becoming difficult to watchðŸ˜¢",/review/rw5236043/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2020,tanyasolan,1," Rollies voice
",I'm so disappointed in Rollies voice change. It makes him sound completely different in a bad way. The change for bingo was at least a similar voice inflection but Rollie now sounds terrible and too babyish. It's just very disappointing. When my 2 and 7 year old do not like it because the change is too drastic that's sad. He has loved the show for so long and now crys when rollie speaks saying no not rollie no... it breaks my heart you guys ruined the show.,/review/rw5236043/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2018,toniquadrado,10," Puppy Dog Pals is a lot of fun with fantastic stories; the best show of Disney Junior.
","Even though it is not educational, Puppy Dog Pals is a show that will make you addicted to time: the stories are VERY FUN. They teach teamwork and cooperation, while others revolve around the Bingo and Rolly cubs solving their own pranks. Speaking of which, the characters do not fail to wish: they are all cheerful, educated, while the Bingo and Rolly pups are determined and do everything to help Bob (his owner) be happy and not sad; however, everything they do to the throughout the show is simply impossible to compare with real life, as well as having no control over their actions. For example, both go to a place far from their home, and return home in the blink of an eye; Really something quite peculiar. But remember that all this is irony, this is just a preschool show to entertain kids instead of educating or to be content with reality. Is the show good? No, it's not good... is GREAT!!",/review/rw5236043/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2020,mks363,1," Most ignorant and patronizing view of human problem solving...
",Even for a children's show this is mind numbing... Their owner is an idiot and is somehow incapable of dealing with simple everyday obstacles. So his puppies have to solve all his problems for him. Therefore no real human growth is ever developed. They make human experiences seem trivial so long as someone does the work for you and you're none the wiser. Ignorance is not bliss it's dangerous.,/review/rw5236043/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2019,caldwellmargaret,10," My son loves this show!
","When we first started watching Disney Jr, my son didn't really react to any of the shows - except Puppy Dog Pals. He's transfixed. It's been a great motivator to get him to do things, as a reward for putting toys away, he gets to watch Puppies.",/review/rw5236043/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2019,dexterguth-69643,5," not enough frank
","The show has many twists and turns leading to an over well fun experience for the whole family, but I was left with one problem.The best character in the show Frank exposition barely gets any screen time,I don't care about the dog things,I only want to see Frank.The first line of dialogue ""I like pretzels"" this could mean a number of things,like the Cuban missile crisis to sexual harassment in the workplace Frank is a man of wisdom. #more Frank",/review/rw5236043/?ref_=tt_urv
