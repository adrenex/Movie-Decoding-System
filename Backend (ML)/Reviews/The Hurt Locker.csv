29 May 2012,bayou_hannibal,9," Fresh, funny, and also a bit depressing
","I went into the first episode of Girls with pretty low expectations. I figured that it would maybe be another Sex in the City, with some pointless softcore porn here and there, but I decided to try it out. It is now, along with Game of Thrones, one of my favorite shows on television. In fact, when we get a fresh set of shows on the DVR, Girls is always the first show that I want to watch. It is fresh, funny, and also a bit depressing at times. This is definitely not Sex and the City. That show was glamour and lightheartedness. This show, on the other hand, is about that bad experience that lots of people have coming out of college called ""the quarter life crisis"".",/review/rw2805738/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2022,jlwarmington,9," I loved Girls
","I might be in the minority but I loved the show from start to finish, albeit better in first couple of seasons. I always felt like people took it too seriously. There are some great comedic moments and yes most of the best moments were Adam Driver scenes or Andrew Rannells. Don't really understand why people would be so bothered about characters being naked, especially when a lot of them involved Adam ðŸ˜‰ had it been a show about a bunch of stereotypical ""hot"" guys I bet no one would be complaining about the naked characters.",/review/rw2805738/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2013,angie_l,4," Commits the sins of being boring and unfunny.
","I have seen many complaints about Girls only being relatable to a small sliver of the audience. I have also read someone defending it saying that we can't relate to the characters on Dowtown Abbey but still love it. I like Downtown Abbey. I think of Mary Crawley as a bit spoiled, high-minded, even snooty but still good natured and I like her with her faults and I am far from a British aristocrat. The maids, footmen, valets, and cook - I can't relate to their situation either... Secret is we do relate to them through their experiences, like Daisy learning to stand up for herself in a respectful way. Enough about Downtown Abbey...",/review/rw2805738/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2012,CharWoman,7," Mixed feelings
","I hadn't been following the show yet but decided to get caught up since all the episodes were available on demand, and since they are nice and short it didn't take much time. ",/review/rw2805738/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2013,shark-43,1," GIRLS - Overrated
","I admired Lena Dunham when she had her success with TINY FURNITURE - I didn't like the movie, but I was impressed she wrote,directed and starred in her little indie and got such amazing press for it. Good for her - but now with GIRLS - again, huge success but everything that left me cold in her film does the same with her HBO series. First off, I don't think Dunham is that good of an actress - she has this sing song manner that I find irritating and as a writer - I find that she is kind of lazy - it seems like when she gets stuck in writing a scene and doesn't know what to do - she'll just write in an awkward, humiliating sex scene and boom - wow - it's like life man! Yes, I know things like this happen in life and there are girls and boys like this in life, but that doesn't make it entertainment. There's also child rape and animal cruelty but that doesn't mean it should be a series - hey wait a minute!!! But seriously, Dunham seems to think she can just write something shocking or vulgar and pass it off as insight. The show is incredibly overrated to me - I find the emperor has no clothes! Literally!",/review/rw2805738/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2019,augustian,3," Like Friends but really depressing
","Perhaps a male of mature years is not the target audience of Girls but maybe this allows a different perspective on Girls after watching the first four series. Lena Dunham, the writer, refers to Sex and the City (SATC) but I feel that Girls is more akin to Friends. The four women in SATC are mature, established professionals, whereas in Girls they are drifting twenty-somethings, much like those in Friends. The characters share similarities too.",/review/rw2805738/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2012,asc85,6," Not sure what to make of this show anymore
","The first four or five episodes were hilarious...it was one of my favorite new shows on TV, and I totally understood why it was so well-received by critics. Then, inexplicably, it changed from ""a comedy with some dramatic parts"" to ""a drama with some comedic parts."" The characters became extremely unlikable...especially Hannah. The episode with Adam flipping out multiple times was one that I despised, and I would have stopped watching the show at that point, but there was only like 2-3 more episodes to go, so I thought I should hang in there. The last 2-3 episodes got a little bit better, but the wedding in the final episode was so ridiculous, which I guess might have been the point.",/review/rw2805738/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2014,orangeisthenewawesome,1," Started out interesting, then sucked balls
",I started watching the first season after reading how horrible this show was on other websites; I guess you could call it a morbid curiosity. I was pleasantly surprised and watched the entire first season. The show was quirky and I liked how Lena Dunham dared the audience to deal with her nude body that didn't fit conventional Hollywood norms.,/review/rw2805738/?ref_=tt_urv

17 April 2017,leftbanker-1,1," Story Reads Like Text Messages Sent from the Mall
","First of all, this show is the dictionary definition of nepotism as most of the people involved are the offspring of the rich and connected. Go look it up. I guess the story pulls all the right strings about women and lesbians or whatever the hell else is fashionable because, man, has this project ever been pampered by the press who just can't get enough of it. I had enough after about ten minutes of the first episode when the protagonist is shell-shocked because her wealthy parents are cutting her off a few years after graduationÂ…from college! What horrible people! But I'm just an intern! Interns are all kids rich enough to not get paid, something I could never swing.",/review/rw2805738/?ref_=tt_urv

18 February 2019,plargreg,1," One of the worst shows ever made
","Terrible writing, acting, directing, unlikable characters, unlikable actresses playing unlikable characters. Terrible writing (by a overrated, pompous, misinformed lena dunham) this show should be erased off the face of the all the planets channels, hbo should take it off their websites and channels to make up for wasting our time",/review/rw2805738/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2014,kikkapi20,1," Girls! Go home!
","For people saying they love this show and that it funny i just don't get it..... this has got to be the worse show i have ever watched there is no just to the story apart for 20 somethings sleeping about and being weird..... i cant believe show like this got renewed for season 2 when they canceled season 2 of secret circle and season 3 o alphas these programs were million times better than this. I have seen a lot of bad TV shows, but Girls may in fact be the worst one of all time! The cast on this show has some of the worst acting I have ever seen on a TV.",/review/rw2805738/?ref_=tt_urv

18 April 2012,lavatch,1," A Disgrace to the Name of HBO
","I took a chance on the pilot program of HBO's ""Girls,"" due to the stellar review from USA Today. Unfortunately, the program did not live up to its billing as an edgy, humorous, and true-to-life portrait of a quartet of young female New Yorkers. The main problem was the lack of honesty in the scripting of this pseudo-reality style series. Here are three examples of how the situations were completely lacking in credibility: ",/review/rw2805738/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2015,deloudelouvain,6," It's going downhill in a fast pace
",I am reviewing this show while I'm watching the third season. I have to say that in the beginning I was enjoying this series a lot more then right now. I just think it's going downhill in a fast way now and I don't think it will get better again. I give it a 6 star rating now as an average for all the seasons but the third season should get way lesser then that. It's not funny anymore and the constant whining of Lena Dunham is getting highly irritable. Also if I have to hear Allison Williams sing that stupid song one more time I might smash my TV screen. I try to remember what I liked about this show in the beginning because I did like it at first but that seems so long ago that the negatives from this last season erased any positive thing I had to say about Girls. I think I'm just going to finish this season and then just stop watching it because there are way better series then this one.,/review/rw2805738/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2015,rooprect,2," Ally McBeal but without the creative writing or humor and with butt ugly sex scenes

23 January 2018,lenkaa,4," 4 stars, but only because of Adam Driver
","Seriously, Adam Driver is the only good thing about this show. He is a great actor, but even he could not save this utterly silly display. And yes, one gets tired of seeing the main character naked all the time.",/review/rw2805738/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2021,OGmacadamia39,7," It's a Car Crash
","Here's the thing about HBOs once huge hit 'Girls'; The central character is an insufferable person the first three seasons. It is actually painful to watch this person behave as she does. Hanna (Lena Dunham) is not a likable person. And the constant display / confrontation of highlighting her own body so vagrantly and to an unnecessary degree. Shoving her point in our face like, almost violently. It's in your face agenda anunviodable in its also rubber-necking story telling and cast.",/review/rw2805738/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2019,andrea-brianna91,2," WTF
",I watched the first season and liked it and thought I bet the second season will be good too. No. The second season just gets weirder and weirder. So I thought well I'll just finish the second season and decide to keep going or not but now I'm not even sure I want to. The show is way more vulgar than it should be. Lena Dunham is ALWAYS naked. It's like really?! And the way most of the characters talk just gets annoying after a while.,/review/rw2805738/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2016,dragonbate,6," Time to end this show
","I actually liked Season 1 but it went downhill from there. Now I'm watching Season 5 and am appalled by how bad it is but at the same time very interested to understand why Lena Dunham feels she must have her character show her vagina to her supervisor, steal a poor guy's bike, hike a mountain in her bikini and generally show off her naked body in random moments even though the plot doesn't require it. The answer is simple. ",/review/rw2805738/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2014,nstobor55,2," Trying to be smart but not
","I admire Lena Durham for all that she did with this program and her attempt to make something different, but it doesn't mean she deserves and HBO show about it. This is a copy of Sex and the City, but with more younger, annoying people. Durham's writing also reeks of Juno and after one time seeing that movie, that was enough. How many Hollywood movies are going to continue have this sort of writing? Self deprecation, gratuitous sex and a bad premise make this show a waste. There is nothing appealing about any of Durham's characters at all. They are annoying and ridiculous. The actors are annoying as well. HBO, please make something original and appealing!",/review/rw2805738/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2013,the_brain888,6," Great Season 1, Head-Scratching Season 2
","I watched Season 1 in one sitting. It felt representative of my generation, the quarter-lifers. It felt real, very unSex and the City like. The posters of which pop up in the background reminding us how different this is from SatC. It was a novel and authentic take on the this generation, the angst, the uncertainty, the aimless wandering that we feel. ",/review/rw2805738/?ref_=tt_urv
