8 December 2002,DruGarton,10," Damian Lewis made this mini-series for me!
","I truly enjoyed this mini-series.  I felt that Damian Lewis' portrayal of Soames was truly award-winning.  After seeing him in other roles (most notably Band of Brothers), I am even more impressed with his range.  I also don't agree with those who felt that the Irene' should have been played by a ""prettier"" actress.  I felt that Gina McKee's true beauty was exposed once you looked at the person inside, exactly as Irene's was.  I would recommend this to anyone!",/review/rw0760165/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2005,mitfordgirl,10," Fabulous version of Galsworthy's novel
","I had never heard of The Forsyte Saga before seeing the mini-series but I enjoyed it so much that I bought the novel, and isn't that really what these adaptations of novels are all about- trying to interest people enough to read the book the movie was based on? I'm glad this version wasn't completely true to the novel considering that so many of the characters in the novel are either underdeveloped or so enigmatic that it's hard to have any kind of feelings about them.It was a stroke of genius to develop Dartie and George into the two jokers of the family, who provide light entertainment when the plot gets a little dark. In defense of Gina McKee, I think the choice to cast her as Irene was a wise one. I can't think of any other actress today who has such an elegant, classy beauty without being ""showy"" about it and I thought her characterization of Irene was true to how she is portrayed in the book, considering that Galsworthy deliberately made Irene a very shadowy, unreachable figure. Ioan Gruffudd, who, with his dark good looks just seems to be made for these lavish period pieces, was his usual dashing and charming self playing ""The Buccaneer"" and the rest of the cast put in a fine performance. While I admit these costume drama mini-series aren't to everyone's taste, you can not doubt the painstaking hard work put in by all involved that makes them a cut above the rest.",/review/rw0760165/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2003,jennyDarlin,10," Damian Lewis shines as Soames
","I have not seen the original film or read the book, so I have a fresh perspective on this version of The Forsyte Saga.  It is a brilliantly acted, emotionally stirring film.  Damian Lewis is outstanding.  He brings such intense emotions to the character of Soames.  I don't know if it's the character but I like to think it's his acting that makes you almost feel sorry for this man.  How can you feel sorry for someone who, on the surface can be so cruel?  Well, that is the genius of Damian Lewis!  He brings such passion to the complex character of Soames that you can't stop watching it! He expresses so realistically the repressed emotions of the character.  I feel that is what makes this film so moving, it's so human.  The film displays w/such heartache(thanks to the acting) the struggles and human complexities of individuals forced to stay within the expectations of their repressed society. The actors effectively display how the characters desperately need & want love and acceptance, but don't have a clue how to obtain it, although some do find love eventually. I definitely recommend this film to anyone who likes period type/costume dramas which showcases brilliant acting.  And if you don't know Damian Lewis, this is an excellent introduction to his work!",/review/rw0760165/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2007,hjmsia49,2," A Pale Imitation of the Original Classic Version
","I couldn't agree more with previous reviewers overseer 3 and housemouse. It is obvious that almost all the reviewers who raved about this production never saw the original 1967 classic. I urge them to watch the original (available at most libraries) and compare. Almost every member of the cast gave a far superior and convincing performance in the original. While Damien Lewis was excellent in ""Band of Brothers,"" his rendition of Soames was awful when compared to the brilliant Soames of Eric Porter in the original version. Lewis' slicked down red hair was very distracting, did you notice any other Forsyte with red hair? He had a constant smirk on his face that was very annoying. Gina McKee as Irene projected none of the beauty, radiance and talent of Nyree Dawn Porter who was unforgettable and created an Irene that will never be bettered. While Rupert Graves was the best of the current cast, I still felt Kenneth More was more believable. The actors who portrayed old Jolyon, Winefred, Helene, Frances, Holly and June were also more convincing in the original 1967 version. Finally, the costumes worn by the ladies in the original, over 3,000, were stunning and truly representative of all the decades covered by the saga. I was surprised how abbreviated the second season of this series was compared to the original. It ended with the marriage of Fleur and Michael Mott. The original series dealt with their marriage at some length and also the marriage of Jon to an American girl. What I found unbelievable was Damien Lewis' pathetic smirks, tears and sulking depression when Irene left him. I don't think Eric Porter shed a single tear or showed any weakness in his lengthy portrayal of a more resolute Soames in the original. While Gillian Kearney gave a good performance of June, her excessive affection for Irene at the end, considering their history really strains credulity. I also found the costumes worn by Irene to be very unflatering and drab compared to those worn by Nyree Dawn Porter in the original. I would be remiss if I did not mention the aspects of this sequel that I thought were superior to the original. The color and music, sorely missed in the original, was a big plus. I also preferred Ioan Grufford's portrayal of Philip Bossiney and especially Beatrix Batarda's performance as Soame's second wife Annette. She was present for Fleur's wedding unlike Annette in the original version. Finally, I would urge all those who enjoyed this version to obtain a copy of the original 1967 version, now on DVD, at any library. It is far longer and more detailed and ends with the death of Soames. Sadly, Nyree Dawn Porter, the luminescent Irene of the original, was scheduled to play one of the elder three Forsyte sisters in this sequel but she suddenly died before filming began.",/review/rw0760165/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2003,ids,10," A brilliant follow-up to the 1st series
","This second installment lives up to the expectations created by the first series and by the novel itself - To Let. We meet again, with much pleasure, the magnificent cast of the first series (D. Lewis as Soames stands out) and discover the choices that have been made to cast the 4 new main characters : Fleur and Jon Forsyte, Prosper Profound, and Michael Mont. I found the 4 of them to be nearly-ideally suited to their part. May be the actor playing Jon lacked a little bit of brilliance, but he showed a lot of sensibility and looked a lot like his ""mother"", Irene. The story unfolds with relentlessness but there are also many moving, or funny moments. The films is really faithful to the tone of Galdsworthy and is, all in all, a magnificent achievement. it is as good as the first series, and may be even better. At the end of the 4th episode, we are really sorry to have to wait for the next episodes of the saga, and the lives of Fleur and Michael Mont. Highly recommended to fans of British top quality literary drama.",/review/rw0760165/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2006,zengirl41,7," Damian Lewis is Fantastic! Gina McKee was terribly miscast
","What makes this whole series so compelling is the power of Damian Lewis. When he is on the screen, which luckily is most of the time, you just want to watch. Even when he is sneering and abominable, you can't take your eyes off him. Rupert Graves (young Jolyon) is more handsome and his character is much more likable. But it is Damian Lewis's performance that makes this miniseries worth watching. It is too bad they horribly miscast the part of Irene with Gina McKee. Do casting directors ever bother to even glimpse at the books they are making into movies? In the novel, Irene is blonde with dark eyes. She is delicate and enchanting. While McKee is certainly not unattractive, nothing about her is delicate. She is simply too formidable a personality to portray a lovely young thing at the mercy of, first her stepmother, then Soames, then saved from poverty by Old Jolyon, then from loneliness by young Jolyon. She is supposed to be a young teenager in the opening. It is way too difficult to ""un-age"" a middle-aged actress. Sorry, the whole Gina McKee thing ruined it for me. Damian Lewis revived it fortunately. I am still trying to dissect how he played Soames so sympathetically. I found myself wishing that Irene would just see how much he does love her, even though I knew he was a creepy stalker! Lewis is an amazing actor! Check him out in ""Band of Brothers"" -- you'd think he was American! (On a side note: That whole series (BofB) is an amazing tribute to the real men of Easy company who fought in WWII, don't miss it.) As for ""The Forsyte Saga"", although this one is good, I highly recommend the original BBC miniseries from the 1960's. It is very long, in black & white, and not as elaborately produced, but every minute is worth it! Meanwhile, I will be looking for Damian Lewis in future projects.",/review/rw0760165/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2006,roghache,8," Engrossing continuation of the scandal ridden Forsyte tale
","This is the sequel to the previous year's mini series, The Forsyte Saga, based on John Galsworthy's novel. It continues on with the dramatic lives of the younger generation of Forsytes, namely the forbidden romance between Fleur and Jon. Fleur is the daughter of Soames Forsyte, and Jon the son of Soames's former wife, Irene. Once again scandal, secrets, and deception dominate the tale. Like its predecessor, this saga has beautiful English scenery, finely furnished country manors, and lovely period costumes. ",/review/rw0760165/?ref_=tt_urv

19 September 2003,ducklessreeds,10," A gripping follow-up to the first series
","The first series was so well wrought that I rushed out to buy the books, a set of three trilogies! As did the first, this second series brings the characters and story lines to life as though Galsworthy himself crafted the script. Once again, we trace the intertwined lives of Soames, Irene, Jolyon and their families as they mature and branch out. Damien Lewis builds upon his masterful portrayal of Soames, an emotionally repressed man bound by Victorian conventions, whilst others around him, including the irrepressible Freddie, enjoy the heady excitement of the decidedly unstuffy post-war era. I found most characters ""aged"" convincingly, although time, if not her fashionable appearance, seems to have stood still for June who now looks about the same age as her much younger sister, Holly. Overall, the continuity between the first and second series has been handled well. Much of the action in the books has been condensed whilst still remaining true to the plot (the same things happen, just not as drawn out). I am really enjoying the new characters who have been introduced: Jon, Fleur, Prosper Profond and Michael Mont. The actors are well cast and have done a marvellous job; the audience really cares what happens to them, regardless of whether we like them or not. None is all bad or all good, and we recognise our own human virtues and frailties in reflection.",/review/rw0760165/?ref_=tt_urv

I do appreciate comments made that the cat fight between June & Irene (who stole June's fiancé) are not faithful to the spirit of propriety and self restraint in the novel. Unfortunately I missed an episode or two early in this first series, so had a little difficulty keeping some of the minor characters straight, of course my own fault. ",/review/rw0760165/?ref_=tt_urv

19 May 2006,AerLingus,10," Superb Victorian Drama With Stellar Cast - Powerfully Moving!
","I came across ""The Forsyte Saga"" and its sequel, ""The Forsyte Saga: To Let,"" in my local library. It was the sequel that I had watched first, not realizing there had been a mini-series made prior to this. THE FORSYTE SAGA is an utterly brilliant film, in my opinion, ranging from the exceptional performances of the actors (notably Rupert Graves, Damian Lewis, Gina McKee, Gillian Kearney, & Corin Redgrave), to the screenplay, to the cinematography, to the music (closing theme). The actors executed their portrayals with such realism that I was engrossed in the mindsets of the major players in the film. Such performances are refreshing in the movie industry, as one loses sight of the actors for the ""characters."" The plot was very good and well written; as such, the movie never seemed to drag. For me, this drama evoked powerful emotions ranging from: deep sorrow & loss (Old Jolyon), to empathy & sympathy, and even a few moments of unexpected humour. I kept wanting more. All in all, this miniseries shows us many injustices, and that dignity, integrity, goodness, and compassion can prevail. If you can set aside an afternoon or long evening to relax and watch the miniseries in one sitting, it will be worth savouring. I hope others find THE FORSYTE SAGA to be a pleasure to watch. I certainly plan to add the DVD set in my film library soon.",/review/rw0760165/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2002,overseer-3,1," Dull and lackluster
","This BBC version of The Forsyte Saga is NOT a remake of the superlative 1967 version starring Kenneth More, Nyree Dawn Porter, Eric Porter, and Susan Hampshire. It cannot hold a candle to the older version, which is an all-time classic of television, not to be missed! This 2002 version script is flat and one-dimensional, the pace is rushed, the casting is poor; there is little chemistry between any of the couples involved, the relationships between the families are not explored fully (for instance the strong devotion Soames and Winifred had in the original is totally lacking here), why, even the house at Robin Hill can't compare to the gorgeous home in the 1967 version! Do yourself a favor and check Amazon.com for the DVD box set of the original 1967 version, and pick it up to enjoy some delicious nights feasting on a true British masterpiece, before it goes out of print; you'll be glad you did. Skip this ho-hum version! It's terrible.",/review/rw0760165/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2006,lth25,4," See the first wonderful series instead
","I read all the Forsyte novels and watched the first 1967 miniseries with Eric Porter, Susan Hampshire, Kenneth More, and Nyree Dawn Porter and was looking forward to the remake. I was very disappointed. First of all with the many liberties taken by the scriptwriters which detracted from the story and made the characters totally unrecognizable. For instance, when June Forsyte meets Irene Heron Forsyte at Philip Bosinney's studio, Irene meets June's anger impassively until June hurts her with the line ""You ruined my life now you want to ruin his."" The first series was faithful to this scene. The second badly botched it. Instead of Irene staying in character, she SLAPS June turning it into a Krystle-Alexis type of catfight. Irene was a gentle soul and didn't resort to violence--Galsworthy wrote how people were taken with Irene's ""gentleness and charm."" Is slapping June being gentle or charming? Hardly. In another scene, Irene is pregnant with Jolyon's child--Jolyon and Irene end up wanting to go to of all places, Annette Lamotte's (Soames' fiancée) restaurant. Soames tells Annette not to let them in. Was this written by Galsworthy? Never and it was a wildly inappropriate scene. Gina McKee is a talented actress (watch her remarkable performance in the Lost Prince) but she is not Irene Forsyte. She looks older than her leading men, dresses badly for a supposedly wealthy woman, and makes it difficult for us to see why Philip Bosinney ditched the vivacious young June for Irene. Nyree Dawn Porter's Irene was awesome and she convinced viewers that it was very plausible for Philip to renounce June for her. The Winifred and Soames sibling relationship was not given its due. Margaret Tyzack and Eric Porter showed the devotion and loyalty that Winifred and Soames had over the years. The actress playing Winifred (and the script) often depicted her as being waspish with Soames. Kudos though to Iaon Gruffaud, Corin Redgrave, Damian Lewis, and Rupert Graves for doing their utmost with a script not always faithful to the characters as created by Galsworthy. I think before watching this drama, I would recommend both reading the Forsyte Saga trilogy and getting copies of the 1967 series which was totally brilliant.",/review/rw0760165/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2009,minart-1,5," good but the original series was superlative
","Yes, I enjoyed this version and have recently watched it again, but it is useless to compare it to the original TV series which was far closer to the book. We have both versions and think they both have merit but the first was the best, there is no doubt in my mind, and to anyone who hasn't seen it, I strongly suggest they do if humanly possible. I certainly didn't like the cop-out ending of the second series. The death of Soames is important!I did find it odd that Gina McKee, a brunette, was cast as Irene. Irene is not an easy character to portray admittedly, there is very little to get your teeth into but Gina can be expressionless at times. I did prefer some of the casting of the second series, notably Bossiney and Monty and young Joylon. I think Damien Lewis was fine in the role, but adored Eric Porter (I met him a couple of times in the flesh and though he had splendid stage and film work under his belt it was always difficult not to see him as Soames, even when wearing his habitual blue donkey jacket. It was his part. ) I re-read the book at 2 yearly intervals on average and never tire of it.",/review/rw0760165/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2018,m_white,2," Second series: disappointing
","I'm specifically talking about the second mini-series, which concentrates on the love affair between Jon and Fleur. The script departs in significant ways from the book, I suppose in order to make us sympathize more with the young lovers. To me it just made them more annoying. The aspect I find most problematic throughout: creating sympathy for Soames. I did not like Damian Lewis's portrayal of Soames, but I admit it's a tough part. Soames is outwardly stiff, cold, and rigid, but underneath he's seething with painful, unmet desires. By today's reckoning, he rapes Irene, but he would never have seen it that way. Yes, he would acknowledge that he took her by force that night, but he saw this as his right. If she had done her duty as a wife, it would not have been necessary. So if there was any ugliness to the act, it was her fault. He would have believed this entirely. He may have suffered occasional doubts about it, but Soames was deeply invested in seeing himself as having been wronged and Irene as a bad wife, pure and simple. He believed that til the day he died. The conciliatory scenes where he admits wrongdoing and actually makes some kind of peace with Irene after Jolyon's death -- absolutely claptrap. It's an example of today's scriptwriters re-making a story to fit our modern ideas about how people should behave, instead of remaining faithful to the source material. I object to that strongly.",/review/rw0760165/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2020,Laight,1," When casting goes horribly wrong
","The original tv version was superb. This version is just bad. All bad. Most of the problem lies in the cast. Gina McKee plays Irene as though she were a deaf/mute -- she has almost no lines, her entire character seems to be built around her simply staring at people without any expression, always looking as if she didn't quite hear what was said. Why anyone would fall in love with her is a mystery, but the fact that every man who meets her falls in love with her is preposterous. (In all fairness, perhaps the fact that she has almost no lines to speak is the writers' fault more than hers.) No one else carries off their roles well either. Damian Lewis, an extraordinarily good actor, only broods and growls. Ioan Griffud is wildly handsome but in a very 2000 way; he looks like he just stepped out of prep school. The rest of the cast struggle mightily but all of them seem out of place. Even the always dependable Rupert Graves barely seems capable of delivering his lines well. And poor Amanda Root comes from the School of Overacting. All in all, the worst casting ever.",/review/rw0760165/?ref_=tt_urv

3 June 2005,iliawarlock,1," Beyond contempt. DO NOT watch this.
","There are very few things more tragic than to see a good book spoiled by a poor movie. Occasionally such problems are accidental, or simply unavoidable in an attempt to fit a large story into a small space. In the case of this mini-series, however, the mistakes do not seem accidental--they seem malicious. The impression is created and steadily enforced that the authors of the screenplay (Stephen Mallatratt and Jan McVerry) despised Galsworthy's novel, and made every effort to disfigure it. Some may say that to follow the outlines of the book is old-fashioned and irrelevant. Some may say that the above named authors were forming their own interpretation of Galsworthy's work. I cannot agree. A book, incidentally one of the greatest in the long and glorious history of British literature, has been written. The author created his own world, his own interpretation of the Forsyte clan, their lives, their country, their time, and the overwhelming, dominating instinct of Property which was responsible for so many of the achievements of the Victorian era. If S. Mallatratt and J. McVerry did not agree with his interpretation, if they saw these people and these times differently--eh bien, it was possibly within the scope of their powers to write their own book on the subject. Instead, they preferred to mangle a masterpiece, and to mangle characters loved and respected by generations. Old Jolyon Forsyte (played here by Corin Redgrave) is presented by Galsworthy as a magnificent example of an honorable, and kind man, led through life not merely by the social structure of his class and age but by a particular love, a gentleness and affection for the small and helpless. He is shown as a portrait of supremely decent, wise, and respectable old age. That is why the scene of this Victorian gentleman, ordering Helene Himler (Amanda Ooms) out of his house is manifestly impossible. Many things can be imagined in the context of an old, domineering man's rage and sorrow--but one thing that is truly impossible to imagine, is the Old Jolyon, Galsworthy's Old Jolyon, be rude to a woman. When Irene Forsyte (Gina McKee, a good actress, albeit monstrously, mockingly miscast here) comes to the empty flat of her lover Philip Bossiney (Ioan Gruffudd) after leaving her husband, she meets his fiancée, her husband's niece June Forsyte (Gillian Kearney). Galsworthy gives us the scene in full--from first word to the last. Why, in the name of what mockery or malice did the screenwriters add a vulgar brawl, screaming, physical beating to this picture?! Not only did they maul the outline of the book, they mauled the characters of the women involved, the character of the age and society of which both 19 year-old June and 23 year-old Irene were products. I am perfectly willing to believe that disputes in the style of Jerry Springer are well known to the authors of the screenplay. But they were not known to the Forsytes, to their class or era. To introduce these elements into the scene was a pointless exercise, or perhaps worse; a misguided or malicious attempt to make the book ""closer"" to the viewer? Possibly--but if so, this was a hideous and unpardonable error. The late-Victorian society, for all its faults, was an age of courtesy, of self-restraint (a major theme in the book), of manners and propriety, maintained even under the most difficult circumstances. To disfigure the society Galsworthy knew and wrote about in an attempt to make the film more acceptable to today's less restrained audience is an insult both to the book and to the author, as well as to the era portrayed. The near-divorce of Soames' sister Winifred Dartie (Amanda Root) from her foppish husband Montague (surprisingly well portrayed by Ben Miles) is a secondary, but nonetheless important plot line. The sympathy and mutual support between Soames and Winifred, their affection for each other, their understanding and common core of sense and the Forsytean proprietary instinct is one of the more touching and gentle elements in the book. Why, for what purpose did the screenwriters introduce a similar scene to the one described above? Why does Winifred scream and rail at her brother? Why does she slap him and start throwing dishes hither and yon? I neither know nor care if this is the way the sisters of the screenwriters react to adversity--but this is entirely counter to the sensible, sympathetic, stable, supremely self-controlled (pardon the alliteration) character presented by Galsworthy. Is there a purpose in this vulgarity? It hardly seems so. Then why was it introduced? There are many such examples in this series. The upshot of this rather long review is a simple piece of advice to all who find themselves interested either in the Victorian era, in the story of the Forsyte family, or in a good movie to watch of an evening. The advice is this; Don't see this film. It provides none of the above. And in the process manages to mangle, sickeningly, maliciously, and pointlessly one of the greatest achievements of the British literary tradition.",/review/rw0760165/?ref_=tt_urv

10 December 2009,greenegg,4," An insult to Galsworthy and Donald Wilson
","I looked forward to seeing what modern film makers would do with one of my favorite literary projects, as well as the granddaddy of the mini-series, the impeccable Forsyte Saga. My disappointment as I viewed this insipid, sophomoric mess beggars description. This version feels like a cheap imitation, with dreadful costumes that look as though they came from a jumble sale. To call this garbage an adaptation of Galsworthy's towering literary achievements seems akin to calling a TV dinner an adaptation of a meal served in a five-start restaurant. While the current performers have talent, they are never allowed to show their acting chops, as they struggle to move beyond the horrific script and pathetic production/direction. Annihilating more than half the elder Forsytes, especially the amusingly agoraphobic Timothy, and the middle generation, such as Francie, the composer of those droll little ditties, insults not only the author, but also the audience. Clearly, the writers and producers feel contempt for both, as they imply modern audiences must be too stupid to follow such a large cast. One would think they might at least have included Roger's character, since he is George's father, or Timothy, as Ann, Hester and Juley share his house. Playing with the characters' ages so shamelessly proved equally absurd and irritating. Swithin and James are twins; Swithin dies at 79 during the early 1890s, according to Indian Summer of a Forsyte, but in this TV adaptation, Swithin strangely makes an appearance at James' 90th birthday party, which of course would have been Swithin's 90th, too. Likewise, Galsworthy's Aunt Hester lives until her mid-late 80s, whereas in this production, she seems to outlive the unseen Timothy, the youngest Forsyte, who is last of the elder clan members to die at the ripe old age of 100+ around 1920. One can only call such lapses sloppy, lazy writing/film making. This new version also takes inexcusable liberties with Galsworthy's characterizations. Galsworthy paints his main characters in shades of grey; many are neither good nor evil, but rather simply human, with all the attendant flaws of humanity. This production paints young Jolyon, who is referred to as Jo in the books and original series, and Irene, in a much worse light, in the sense that it unforgivably softens Soames. I haven't read the novels in many years, but when I skimmed some of the early chapters of Man of Property, I found what I expected: Galsworthy offers many hints about the grim, relentlessly possessive Soames, who is described as detesting sunshine. Irene should have known better than to marry him, but the books describe Soames as having finally worn her down on his fifth attempt to propose in the face of some unpleasantness at home. Irene hoped she could handle Soames more easily, but the more she withholds herself, the more desperately he grasps her. He wants what he wants, and the older he grows, the more he wants. Galsworthy describes Jo as a good-hearted person, despite his mistake of leaving his first wife to run off with Helene, whose streak of melancholia/mental illness these writers inexplicably ignore. I never felt Galsworthy censuring Jo, Helene or Irene. The author focuses upon his characters' responsibilities versus their needs, as well as the ravages of time and change upon the entire Forsyte clan, from the second generation to the youngest. Ripping this essential quality from the mini-series sucks the life out of it. Series one and series two become reduced to pure melodrama, without a larger scope. Series Two especially goes overboard by over-softening Soames. It also violates the rules of good story-telling by having Monty live far longer than he did. Monty died in a fall down the stairs after playing baccarat in Paris long before 1920.",/review/rw0760165/?ref_=tt_urv
