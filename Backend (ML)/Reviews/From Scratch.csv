25 November 2019,mhorg2018,7," A great series done in by a lame ending.
","What was Frank Spotnitz thinking? The show was excellent through 3 seasons and 9 episodes. Perhaps if the finale was two hours long it might have been more coherent? The last time I was this disappointed in a finale was The American's. All this build-up and a totally incomprehensible, illogical ending. They should have simply blown up the portal, or an American army should have come through. Even having those on the other side sending a nuclear weapon through would have been better. Very, very disappointing.",/review/rw3365397/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2020,nathanchow-11119,9," I actually thought the ending was fitting and I'll tell you why
","I don't think this show deserves the amount of hate it gets. The last season was definitely flawed and there were things I didn't like about it, but if you see the vision the producers had for the show you'd realize it was quite meaningful what they did. Given the amount of time they had to tell the rest of the story, I thought they did what they had to.",/review/rw3365397/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2019,BruceWayne3,7," I love this show... but hate Juliana crain
","The concept of the show is super interesting - if the us didn't win the war against Nazis what would the world look like today? Have you ever thought of that? Well this show gives you a glimpse of what it could of been like. I'm very fascinated by the plots, the only problem I have is Juliana Crain is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay to dumb. Her bf should of broke up with her mid way through season 1, really bad writing on their part to have her so undecisive and just put her bf and friends in bad situations over and over again, after a while it's like ok, we get, stop letting her make decisions for everyone because she's really bad at it. Other than that I love the show.",/review/rw3365397/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2020,tarekali-19909,8," An immaculate, terrifying alternate history
","An immaculate, terrifying alternate history that is accurate down to the buttons. I love period pieces, and this scary projection of a post WW2 hegemony ruled by the Japanese and German empires certainly fits the bill. Every costume, building, landscape, vehicle, street and interior room is accurate down to the woodwork and spoons - such a delight to watch.
It's interesting in itself to see the crushed American psyche in the face of utter defeat, humiliation and occupation by mortal enemies. This alternate history makes the American century seem a fantasy, certainly it took tremendous courage to make this series.
It's also nerve wracking watching the razor thin tightrope walked by the various protagonists on the winning side, as they try to navigate the internal dangers of their own ruthless regimes.
The suffering of the common Americans reminds me of the brutal oppression we have witnessed around the world by autocratic regimes over the last 100 years - that in itself is a rich irony.
The series is also a study on what it takes to bring down oppressive empires. Each of our dear protagonists - Joe, Juliana and Frank - are guided by their positive moralities on a destiny of greatness. It's particularly interesting to see how the entire arc of history can be rewritten by a single good or bad deed, by a single done or undone action.
The machinations of Obergruppenfuhrer Smith, Trade Minister Togumi and Chief Inspector Kodi-Tai are particularly interesting. Both men stand on mountains of corpses built by their empires, and out of a deep sense of duty and honor, they maneuver to preserve their nations from further bloodshed and destruction, working always in the shadows.
The searing images of enflamed Americans chanting Blood and soil do not seem so distant from our current epoque, nor do they seem alien and impossible. We are indeed witnessing history, with so-called freedom loving Americans flirting with fascism.
It is heartening to see the universe is in balance, with the terrible personal price paid by men of previous principle, who sold their soul for survival at all costs. The arc of history does indeed bend toward justice.
Ultimately this is a series about the Power of ideas to revive a forgotten dream, to restore hope and courage to the absolutely downtrodden and conquered. Symbolism is the most powerful motif, present endlessly across all domains of the various powers. Images and the ideas attached to them move people to action.
It is quite interesting to see the underlying Metaphysics and laws of the universe being respected in this multiverse spanning series. As a fan of Fringe and other SciFi benders, it is nice to see a return to alternate timelines and realities, and how they interplay with each other according to 'rules'.
I appreciate the 4th season in particular as it highlights the tremendous racial atrocities that these regimes are capable of, and the personal horrors of the victims. Oftentimes minorities are under-represented in such shows, and it is welcome to see the producers avoid that mistake. The humanization of minority victims was detailed and appreciated. The 4th season also does a great job of reinforcing the belief that we are who we are, even in the multiverse.
There were some loose ends left that did not completely tie up the threads, especially around the multiverse. I guess I need to watch and read some analysis from smarter folks. It's normal that cerebral series like this leave some ideas for interpretation.
The series finale was amazing, Hollywood level production values, astounding special effects. I am truly impressed by Amazon studios. Their offerings give HBO a run for their money.",/review/rw3365397/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2019,robfollower,8," Man in the High Castle is the sort of smart, well acted show with really adult themes
","I finished Season 1...A+...the production values are incredible...this must have an insanely huge budget...the characters, setting and story are also very well done...I hear people complaining that the series is too slow but I don't see it that way...to me it has a deliberate pace where the big moments have more meaning because it was slowly built up...the sequence with Hitler and Wegener in the S1 finale was a nail biter...the alternate timeline sci-fi aspect is a slow burn but presented in a really interesting way",/review/rw3365397/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2019,riccardoscalet,7," Watch season 1 and 2, then stop before it's too late
","The first two season are great, worthy of 8 or maybe even 9/10! The plot idea is simple but effective, most characters are interesting and acted well (with some exceptions), and the plot twists are very good! Some of the characters's choices are terribly stupid and annoying, but the rest is so good that you can almost forgive them.",/review/rw3365397/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2019,Nathanthomas97,5," One of the quickest falls for a promising series
","First and second seasons are interesting and build intriguing story structures. The third season veers from the main story, and tries it's best to murder its own characters without resolutions but for the most part is still watchable.",/review/rw3365397/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2019,koofasa,1," Don't bother with season 4
","This show has always been slow to get to the screen. Every season is more than a year's wait. This is important because entertainment changed dramatically in 2017. Because this series is so far behind when it comes to production one might think season 4 is new thinking. It's not, Amazon just has no idea how to meet a deadline. That said, season 4 is an entire new world. White people bad, Japanese people bad, black people good. The no-man's land between East and West is only populated by well educated, highly efficient and effective black people who are now in a position to negotiate on equal grounds with the other nations. The plot line about the multi-verse is deployed poorly. The story is not really tied to anything that came before. I got halfway through the season which is much farther than I got with the new Jack Ryan season. Instead of trying to indoctrinate viewers they should focus on entertaining them.",/review/rw3365397/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2019,Ilya_Kuryakin,5," Avoid Season 3 updated after season 4
","The reviews here slamming season 3........believe them. Seriously, I can only assume they changed the writing team. The end result is a show taking a massive dip in quality and watchabilty.
After 2 seasons we have random characters who previously behaved hetero suddenly turning gay in scenes that made me laugh at their stupidity. There I presume to add social messaging like so many other idiotic programmes today.
Plot now appears forced and contrived, lacking direction and cohesion. If season 4 is better I'll pretend this season doesn't exist otherwise it's getting turned off.
UPDATE.
Season 4......really thought at first we were back on track......well yes(ish) and mostly no. Now the writers decided to add race baiting and colour politics into the mix, ugh. Totally unnecessary really.
Ok, so now every single black character is upstanding and righteous without fault, the only white people worthy to fight side by side with them are Jewish. Righto then. Every other white face outside of the main characters is either a nazi, a potential nazi, stupid, thuggish, cowardly or a mix of any of the above. Great, fill the story with this, drag it out over 10 episodes and job done. The ending.......well unrealistic is an understatement. ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜”
8/10 for 1 and 2. 1 for season 3. 3 for season 4.",/review/rw3365397/?ref_=tt_urv

8 October 2018,ed-26811,6," Seasons 1 and 2 were good, 8-star, but season 3 is not good
","The first two seasons were good. Suspenseful, but of course, dystopian. Season 3 so far is not good at all, just mostly a steaming pile. Still dystopian, as expected, but throwing a lot of other junk in there that really doesn't ""belong"" and only serves to make it as stupid as much of the rest of television these days. I'm being intentionally vague because I don't want to have spoilers in here. If they don't get back in stride, then I'll not be watching any more of this junk.",/review/rw3365397/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2020,henrycoles9,10," Rufus Sewell and Joel de la Fuente give the greatest performances
","This was the best historical and science fiction production I've ever seen, and the best thing is, it was maybe 95% drama and only 5% sci-fi since the multiverse ""traveling"" it is based on was kept to a minimum until the final season. In this way the build-up from the first to the final season was excellently orchestrated.",/review/rw3365397/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2020,chnutscher,6," Worth to see, but far from great.
","Saw it in a row. The dystopic story is quite interesting at the start. Season 1 and 2 are a bit stretched, and the ""world travel"" is kept too vague IMO, hard to assess what it is about. Season 3, contrary to other opinions, I found interesting so far as there was introduced some sense about those ""world travels"". Season 4 felt more like an artificial prolongation, and the finale is one unique, conglomerated mess without much, if any?, sense, no doubt. A good part of the story remains obscure and unexplained.",/review/rw3365397/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2016,joachimokeefe,1," Ve Haf Vays of Making You Vatch Netflix
","A dystopian future where mainstream media is in a state of collapse, and decent dead American novelists get their ideas plundered by cash-greedy online corporations. Oh, sorry, that's real life: What I meant is; well you know, the Nazis got the A-bomb first and won WWII. So we get the usual hacked-to-death Nazi Resistance shtick set in the Mad Men universe. Thing was, Mad Men didn't start out a nostalgic soap opera, it was a gripping character study to begin with. But the most interesting characters in TMITHC are the Japanese calligraphy ones all over California. Not to mention the barrel of fun the Art department has had reimagining Nazi graphic design for the Duck and Cover generation.",/review/rw3365397/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2018,The-Ambassador,3," Changed My Rating From 8 to 5 because of Season 3
","I've only watched epi 1 and 2 of season 3 so far but wow what a long drawn out boring 2 hours that just was. Couldn't wait for the new season, because Man in the High Castle really did start off as a stellar piece of serialized fictional entertainment. But then season 2 came along and seemed a bit too slow and drawn out for the small amount of content they covered. Still mildly engaging tho. Better than a lot out there for sure (let's face it, most American TV is mediocre at best). So now this new season 3 is rolled out to much anticipation.... Ugh. The question is If they could not even create a wham bam blow your mind opening episode 1 (think Game of Thrones or WestWorld just as examples...), how the hell are we supposed to expect to feel excited for the rest of this season? Frankly it feels like they took a great sci-fi novel and instead of staying loyal to the goal of creating an incredible work of visual art, stretched and dragged it out way too long for no other reason than to suck as much out of it as they could. Despite how much damage it might do to the work in the bigger picture. TMITHC could have been easily accomplished by a high quality director in a good three hour film, or a one season limited series at most. This is just far too slow and desultory. So what started out and could have been an 8 is now a 5 when all three seasons are considered.",/review/rw3365397/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2015,mmaggiano,2," High production values. Decent premise and pilot. Terrible acting & writing.
","The pilot episode is solid, and the production values are very high. And although this might be enough to hook some people, the first three episodes are riddled with moments of terrible writing, acting or both, that grow more frequent along the way, culminating in episode 3's The Marshall character, which is laughably atrocious melodrama and seems to come from another show entirely. It's as if a generation of superhero movies (good and bad) have primed the audience/filmmakers to a point where a show with this high of a budget would dare try a character this ridiculous, and in a show that wasn't supposed to be 'camp'.",/review/rw3365397/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2018,carolrmag,4," 1st season 10 stars, and then it came crashing
","I truly loved the first season. Exploring a world where that Nazis had won the 2nd World War is scaring and interesting. You get to experience how awful it could have gone. The acting was great and the plot so very compelling. I loved it so much, I enthusiastically saw the second season, which left me with an odd felling of... ""Where are these guys going with this??"". But again, the greatness of season one made me want to watch season 3 even though the second season had gotten a bit lost. I was hoping it got the same interesting action it had on the first season and some way make sense of the 2nd one. Unfortunately this didn't happen. Really sad. IT had so much promise and so much to explore but basically got boring and lost.",/review/rw3365397/?ref_=tt_urv

1 November 2016,dibeyendu,1," Really irritating
","I wish I could just say this series is boring. It definitely is boring, but it's more than that. The Man in the High Castle is an extremely irritating series that had me fast forwarding the last few episodes, after it became evident that the story wasn't going to go anywhere and I was wasting my time watching it when there are so many better serials to watch. Some of the most irritating parts: The lingering close ups of Japanese trade minister Tagomi's face as he contemplates a necklace, flowers, sticks, paintings. The total ineptness of the two villains, Kotomichi from the Japanese side and John Smith from the German side. Who wipes out a man's family by mistake and then frees him with an apology? The clueless Juliana Craine, our heroine. She muddles through the story saying sorry to everyone for the trouble she's causing them. Her boyfriend is no better. They get their friends and relatives killed all through the film and you wish someone would kill them instead. Am I ranting? Well, it's probably because I'm extremely irritated.",/review/rw3365397/?ref_=tt_urv

",Enjoyed it from the first minute to last even the worst episodes were above average in my opinion. Rufus Sewell arguably carries a lot of the series and is a real standout! I would have preferred a more complete ending but honestly I don't think it is anywhere near as bad as people made out the majority of questions are answered the only question really raised by the last 60 seconds which was admittedly unneeded.
