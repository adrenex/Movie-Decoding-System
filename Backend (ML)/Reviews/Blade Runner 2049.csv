30 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,8," Great Sci-fi Series!
","The Orville was so much better than I expected it to be. Like most people I thought it was going to be some spoof of Star Trek but it is so much more than that. It's actually better than anything Star Trek has put out since Next Generation. It takes place 400 years in the future as it follows a exploratory spaceship, The Orville, that is filled with both humans and aliens as they face the dangers of outer space. It's a character driven show that shows the everyday lives of the humans and aliens. The acting and writing is so good that you really come to care what happens to these characters. Seth MacFarlane is such a genius. I don't think I've ever seen him make a bad show or movie. I first starting watching this series strictly because it was created by MacFarlane and have come to really enjoy it. This show was suppose to end after this last season (Season 3) but it's found such a following that the fans are clamoring for more seasons and it looks like they might get it. I hope they renew it for a forth season.",/review/rw3804874/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2021,Supermanfan-13,8," So much better than I expected!
",The Orville is not only a great comedy but it's also a great sci-fi show! It's a character driven show that will suck you in. I originally thought it was going to be Star Trek parody but it's so much more than that. It stands on its own as a great space adventure show! Seth MacFarlane is without a doubt one of the funniest people on the planet!,/review/rw3804874/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2017,DarkVulcan29,9," An enjoyable Star Trek send up
","Although it is a send up of Star Trek, but it never goes overboard with silliness, and surprised by it coming from Seth Macfarlane, the creator of Family Guy and American Dad. When the comedy is there it's funny, there are some dramatic moments but they are few and far between.",/review/rw3804874/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2020,network-561-589522,9," The Orville achieves what Star Trek once stood for: A positive and refeshed vision of the future of mankind
","Seth McFarlane and the team have done a wonderful job of taking the best elements of Star Trek, lighten it up with a little comedy and telling stories that are entertaining and relevant at the same time.",/review/rw3804874/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2017,follis12,7," I hope the audience is big enough
","The Orville is a show with potential. I liked how it didn't try too hard to be funny. In fact, it reminded me more of a Star Trek episode than Family Guy. I suspect there will be many comparisons to Galaxy Quest. ",/review/rw3804874/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2021,IonicBreezeMachine,9," An oddity in prime time TV resulting in the best ""I can't believe it's not Star Trek"" anyone's ever attempted.
","In the 25th century, Ed Mercer (Seth MacFarlane) a once promising officer in the interplanetary peacekeeping/exploratory organization the Planetary Union finds himself in a slump following his divorce from his wife Kelly Grayson (Adrianne Palicki) following her affair with another man. One year after Ed's slump, he is given his long sought after goal of captaining a ship, the titular U. S. S. Orville, staffed by Helmsman and Ed's overly casual and childish best friend Gordon Malloy (Scott Grimes), Chief Medical Officer Claire Finn (Penny Johnson Jerald), Moclan 2nd officer Bortus (Peter Macon), young but very strong Xelayan Chief Security officer Alara Kitan (Halston Sage), Science Officer and artificial being Isaac (Mark Jackson), and the ship's casual and laid back Navigator John LaMarr (J. Lee). Ed is eager to set off on his assignment, but when he finds his first officer to be his ex-wife Kelly, Ed must contend with not only a galaxy of often life threatening challenges, but also personal and interpersonal relationships of himself and his crew throwing a monkey wrench into matters.",/review/rw3804874/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2021,lee_eisenberg,10," Seth MacFarlane goes sci-fi
","Knowing that ""The Orville"" is from the creator of ""Family Guy"", the Ted movies, and ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" should give you an idea of what this show is. Seth MacFarlane plays a 25th-century captain traversing the cosmos with his band of misfits, often landing on planets representing Earth at different stages of human evolution. Other wacky stuff follows.",/review/rw3804874/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2022,actaction,8," Movie Quality F/X & Writing
","Any one of these episodes in season 03 could have been on the big screen as a Orville film & not been out of place. Not unlike the Star Trek films like ""Star Trek: First Contact"", the Orville matches and even exceeds them in amazing & elaborate special effects, superior acting, deep and clever writing exploring sci-fi and the human condition & overall production value. The show also belongs in the league of heavy hitters like Rod Serling's Twilight Zone because of its well crafted handling of sensitive modern present topics likes Trans rights, genocide, peace treaties & human ethics. I've enjoyed the series so much & I hope it continues for quite a while.",/review/rw3804874/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2017,David-Bernhardt,9," The Critics Must Be Crazy: 'The Orville' Is A Great Show
","As many critics have pointed out, this isn't a spoof of Star Trek. It's not exactly an homage either. The best way I can describe it is that MacFarlane wanted to make a Star Trek show that recalls that franchise's earlier days, back before it became an action blockbuster film series and before the TV shows started becoming dark and grim and edgy. MacFarlane is making his own version of the original Star Trek, and he is a new Captain Kirk. All the optimism and sincerity and lightheartedness of that show is here, and in many ways it's kind of wonderful. I'm honestly surprised something like this exists.",/review/rw3804874/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2017,atlasmb,9," Sci-Fi With Humor
","""The Orville"" is Seth MacFarlane thinking outside the box--something he is good at. The show feels like a combination of ""Star Trek"" and ""Firefly"". There are missions or problems to be solved as in ""Star Trek"", but humor is an integral part of the show, as in ""Firefly"".",/review/rw3804874/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2017,kingramze,9," First Episode is a worthy ST TOS successor in spirit
","Somewhere between ST: TOS and TNG, fleet personnel became high-minded, super-moral, flawless beings... a picture of who we should be when we're at our best, but not a true reflection of who we ARE. And then you remember how human TOS people were -- bickering, flawed, sometimes racist or rude.",/review/rw3804874/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2017,Harun_Karali,8," A Welcome Surprise
","I'm a fan of science fiction and I love to laugh and that's why Galaxy Quest is a movie I hold in high regards to this day. When I saw the trailers for this series, I thought; there making Galaxy Quest into a TV show and MacFarlane is producing it? A recipe for disaster... Or so I thought, much to my bewilderment, this series was actually funny and they didn't gloss over the characters. There's actual development. It was refreshing. The show balances drama and humor in a delicate fashion that makes it hard to believe that this is Seth's work. Don't get me wrong, I'm actually a fan of his humor, but his story telling has always lacked a certain facade. The story is about Captain Ed Mercer who gets assigned to a mid-level Intergalactic ship. Where he is appointed his ex-wife as his Executive officer. At it's core the show thrives on it's entertainment value and that is a trait that shouldn't be overlooked. If they can keep the sense of humor and pacing of the series, I believe we are in for a fun ride and at the end of the day that's all we can ask for. If you haven't already, I would recommend seeing Galaxy Quest before/after you see this, there are uncanny similarities and I for one loved it.",/review/rw3804874/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2017,annyard1960,10," When is StarTrek better than StarTrek
","JarJarAbrams officially destroyed StarTrek when he made his disgusting reboot of StarTrek in 2009. That is literally true. He purposely chose a story that literally erased all events that happened in all the years the StarTrek series and movies took place... except perhaps StarTrek Enterprise. Of course he not only erased the timeline, he erased everything good and distinctive about the StarTrek universe and everything that made StarTrek special.",/review/rw3804874/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2017,rocnathan,8," THIS is Star Trek - not that other show
","After having seen six episodes of both Star Trek: Discovery and The Orville, I am truly baffled and very positively surprised. Baffled at how, with a budget of millions, the people who made Discovery could not come up with a single interesting character or plot, but instead basically just made The Expanse with Klingons, taking every single thing that is unique, positive, and enjoyable about Star Trek and tossing it out the window. And positively surprised, because, out of the corner I would least have expected it - the filthy, cobwebbed one with the rancid yogurt, in which Seth MacFarlane used to reside for me - comes this gem of a show that takes everything fun, positive, and enjoyable from Trek and runs with it.",/review/rw3804874/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2020,jaymcr,8," This is more Star Trek style TV than even Star Trek in 2020!
",And i'm not sure why that puzzles me but it seems the actual Star Trek franchise has been taken over by directors and writers who wish to take it to a very dark place.,/review/rw3804874/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2017,Rob_Taylor,9," It's fun, and reminds us what Star Trek used to be about.
","I was, I admit, deeply suspicious of The Orville when I heard about it. Created by Seth McFarlane (he of the endless crass humour) it seemed doomed to be a lame, intelligence-insulting mess. In fact, I wasn't planning on watching it at all. I was literally going to skip it.",/review/rw3804874/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2022,jasnuevo,7," Surprisingly good
","At first I thought it was just another Star Trek clone (which it is nevertheless) but but later I enjoyed this serires very much. Unlike Star Trek it explores the relationships among people with different opinions or beliefs or sexual preferences. Also the relationship between main characters Ed and Kelly has many humorous moments. Unfortunatelly the science part of Science-Fiction series is almost non existent, most sentient alien species have almost human bodies and in some cases they have even mixed species children! How evolution in different planets many light years away can produce such compatible species is beyond my understanding. Considering this, no need to complain even about faster than light travel, artificial gravity, etc.",/review/rw3804874/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2017,writingferret,10," The Orville is exactly what Sci-Fi needs right now. It is more real than Star Trek has ever been.
","Let me preface this by saying that I am a Trekkie from way back, all the shows, all the movies, even Enterprise, even the new movies, even TOS. All of it. I know the ins and outs of all things Trek. I also love Star Wars. I used to be an avid reader of the extended universe until Lucas set it on fire. I even like Babylon 5 and Stargate. I like high Sci-Fi.",/review/rw3804874/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2020,calamari2,9," A great and well-rounded show!
","Somebody who reviewed one of the new and frankly bizarre ""Star Trek"" series that are out there said that they should just hand the entire Star Trek franchise over to Seth MacFarlane as he was most suited and likely to actually do a good job of keeping the essence of Star Trek and its legacy. I could not agree more. What the new Star Trek series fail miserably at achieving MacFarlane does so effortlessly. In just one or two episodes of the Orville we already like and understand who the characters are. We care for them. In the new Star Trek series they cry all the time either when leaving each other or when being reunited, obviously they are incredibly attached to each other, however, the viewer has not partaken in the actual bonding that seems to have occurred between the characters. Must have been happening behind the scenes. Again, MacFarlane makes the interaction between the crew members very successful. For example, by understanding the importance of downtime and using an inviting dining or pub area for people to hang out.
Instead of filling our screens with doomsday scenarios the Orville brings us hope for the future and the message that we can always aspire to better as human beings.
At any time, but especially now, I feel the world could do with more positive messages like this.
However, even though the Orville reminds us of the ""real"" Star Trek, it has its own personality and manages to effectively balance humour, the weird, with the serious, with the current topics of our modern world.
We need the Orville and I sincerely hope we get several more seasons of this well-made, well-rounded, quality show!
Also a plus for the good music and a real intro theme!",/review/rw3804874/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2017,dmega-64163,9," More Star Trek than Discovery
","There have been a few times when I watched this show where I forgot I was watching The Orville. It has the true spirit of Star Trek written all over it. It's a bit more tongue in cheek, yes. But it has heart and portrays in-depth and heart felt stories. I watched the first episode of ST Discovery and still haven't gotten around watching the second, I'm just not that into it. Full of virtue signaling BS and it doesn't ""feel"" like Star Trek. I hang out for every new episode of The Orville, it is THAT good. Do your self a favor and watch this instead of Discovery if you want that real old feeling of Star Trek. A must!",/review/rw3804874/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2017,menezestraducoes-77274,10," A nice place to be
","The only thing I can truly say about this show is that, like all previous Real Star Trek series, I want to be in the Orville. I want to travel with it, I want to live their adventures. It is a nice atmosphere with interesting people to whom I can relate. The show also does me the courtesy of raising topics for me to think with the decency and good- manners of not shoving anything down my throat. Food for thought. Thanks, Seth. I didn't even know I missed Real Star Trek feeling so much.",/review/rw3804874/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2022,nbirthisel,7," Where's the humour?
","Season 1 and 2 were great. The storylines were engaging like Star Trek, but additionally the show was full of laughs in the way Star Trek isn't. But Season 3 seems to be going in a different, more serious direction. The storyline's are still great, but the humour has mostly disappeared and seems forced when it does appear. Please bring back the humour which made the show so great, else The Orville risks becoming just a very good Star Trek clone.",/review/rw3804874/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2019,nadeemrafat,9," Better than Star Trek
","I recently started watching the show from the beginning. It may be a satire of Star Trek, but the stories are the kind which Star Trek should have had, unfortunately never did. There good science fiction and fantasy in every episode. This is what Star Trek should have been.",/review/rw3804874/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,warren-87235,6," 1st and 2nd Season were a Breath of Fresh Air, but the 3rd Season?
","My other half and I were big fans of the first and second seasons. Let's be honest, The Orville is essentially a love-letter to Star Trek (particularly Next Gen). What it adds is a light-hearted touch that makes the characters feel more human, alongside a new universe that has none of the baggage, so you can tell whatever new stories you wish.",/review/rw3804874/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2017,nathanael-ries,10," Don't listen to the ""professional"" critics.
","Once again the ""professional"" critics still think that even in the trying times we're living in, we want everything to be dark and gritty. They are stuck in the 2000-2010 decade where everyone was floored by Christopher Nolan's Batman performance and the Debut of ""Walking Dead which ushered in the pop culture's shift to a darker take on fiction.",/review/rw3804874/?ref_=tt_urv
