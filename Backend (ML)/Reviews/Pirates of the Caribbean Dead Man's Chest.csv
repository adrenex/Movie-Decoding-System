","Ally McBeal was ahead of its time. I found the first three seasons compelling, but after that it was not so much. Ally McBeal and The Practice were the two series I watched. Ally McBeal was first, and then The Practice, and it was my evening viewing in my younger days when I could stay up and watch whatever was on the tube.",/review/rw2763484/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2003,Victor Field,," It's hard to watch something you used to love go downhill.
","David E. Kelley's a talented man, no doubt about it (and since he's married to Michelle Pfeiffer, many would add ""sickeningly lucky"" on top of that); when you have a CV that includes writing for Steven Bochco shows and successfully launching your own Twentieth Century Fox-affiliated company (and let's not forget, ""girls club"" has been his only real flop on the tube - even ""Chicago Hope,"" which is doomed to be the Billie to ""ER""'s Britney Spears, still ran for six years), on top of being the primary writer for your shows, it takes more than mere luck.",/review/rw2763484/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2005,A Jay,," Was a great show that lost it's way
","How can Ally McBeal be easily described? Well it actually can't because it works on a huge variety of levels. The characters are likable and funny, the dialogue is interesting and quirky and the stories vary from downright silly to incredibly moving.",/review/rw2763484/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2007,loza-1,10," ""I like a fresh bowl""
","TV critics are supposed to use their experience and knowledge to map out the salient points of a TV series. Certainly on this side of the Pond, the TV critics seemed to have lost the plot - if they had found the plot in the first place. None of them liked Ally McBeal and they failed to find the essence of the programme.",/review/rw2763484/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2004,Pageharrison,," Better than most
","One of the best shows to ever hit TV. There are some pretty negative comments here, but I know why. Folks are angry that the show changed in the last few seasons and they are disappointed that it ended. The first three seasons you couldn't go to the water cooler if you had not watched the show and had some little tid-bit to say about what you saw. That spells great writing and fabulous performances to me. Calista Flockhart is a wonderful person and a terrific actress. She made the show work. without her, no Ally. There are episodes that are priceless. The dancing baby is unique and entertaining. No one had ever taken that kind of risk on TV. A computerized baby dancing with real people. Of course everyone's doing it now. I believe Ally Mcbeal to be a classic.",/review/rw2763484/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2002,Big Movie Fan,," One Of The Better American Comedies But Outstayed It's Welcome
","Out of all the mediocre American comedy shows we were bombarded with in the 1990's, Ally McBeal was a fine piece of work.",/review/rw2763484/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2007,coz1kan,10," the best....
",I'm in the middle of season four as i write these words. It's been a few years since the last time i watched Ally McBeal but somehow it was time again to visit the old gang at Cage & Fish. ,/review/rw2763484/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2015,adriangr,7," Great show that eventually unravelled
","I've just watched all five seasons of Ally McBeal again and the gloss it had when it was first aired does seem to have worn off. Basically the story of a kooky, single female professional in short skirts, whose life revolves around her ex, her inner world, and her career as a lawyer, does't really progress very far in it's 5 seasons. It also goes downhill quite quickly from the later half of Season 2 onwards, but more on that later. This is a review of the entire series, so there will be SPOILERS.",/review/rw2763484/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2022,anaplus-73569,10," One of the best shows!
","I keep re watching episodes of Ally McBeal and it always makes me laugh. It was a very modern show for its times and so much better than what they call comedy nowadays. The whole singing, the awkward cases and the office issues are just so much fun. Everyone is a hoot!",/review/rw2763484/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2006,rooprect,4," Like a triple stack of IHOP pancakes w/ extra syrup
","Mmm, doesn't a big stack of pancakes sound good? Maple syrup and fruit preserves on top. Take a bite. Mmmmmmm. Take another bite. Another. Another. EAT. EAT it, you!!! Keep shoveling it down your throat until your face turns green with nausea. You have just had the Ally McBeal experience.",/review/rw2763484/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2004,lomelasz,," Ah, those were the days (well the first two seasons anyway)...
","Where did it all go wrong? By the end of season two (which turned out to be the last genuinely great season of Ally ever), the show was getting 18million viewers per ep. As it limped to its series finale by 2002, it was only getting 10. Perhaps it all started to go horribly wrong in its third season. Or maybe its fourth? Or maybe the (sadly) dreadful fifth and final? Well, in my opinion things started to go wrong in its third season when Georgia left the firm (and appears very briefly in others after she leaves or just doesn't appear at all), Renee is absent for 6 episodes in a row, Billy is killed off and new character Mark Albert is brought in a hurry. Plus the rumours of anorexia that dogged Calista Flockhart and Portia de Rossi which couldn't have helped. The show was 'revived' in its fourth season with the addition of Robert Downey Jr but still doesn't improve (well at least until its second half where it gets a little better). Jokes that weren't even funny the first time are milked for all they're worth and main characters are neglected (which is very apparent in the final season). By the fifth season, the show was dismal. Bringing in about a hundred new characters didn't help (most were later dropped) and the constant references to 9/11 didn't help matters either. Come the last-ever episode, you feel more relieved than gutted. Maybe if we had discovered that the second season finale was its last-ever ep, i would have been gutted, but despite a few good eps throughout its third and fourth season (and very very few in its final), the show fell from grace permanently and should have been put out of its misery there and then.",/review/rw2763484/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2022,alaningle7,8," I can't stop this feeling
","Ally McBeal joins a prestigous law firm which is full of wierd
and wonderful characters. The crux of the series is about her searching for romantic love from a females point of view and dealing with her many neuroses. I am reviewing from memory and I am not sure how well it would hold up today, but at the time I om
really enjoyed her quirky antics.",/review/rw2763484/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2000,Calysta,," One of the best shows on T.V
","When ""Ally McBeal"" premiered in Australia in July 1997, I by perchance taped the pilot episode, not even knowing what it was about. It was that sole episode that drew me into ""Ally"" magic, which quickly dominated a dull Monday night, 8:30pm timeslot.",/review/rw2763484/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2002,Deeana,," A once brilliant show that went downhill after 3 seasons.
","I remember back in 1998 when I watched the 2 hour premiere of this show and instantly I loved it.  Ally was a fun character and her imagination was entertaining, especially where you saw Elaines head expand when she talked. An interesting love story also seemed evident as Ally goes to work at the law firm that her high school ex boyfriend also works at.  The fact that he was married to Georgia made this very entertaining and had the audience on the edge of their seats wondering if he would go back to Ally.  The characters were all interesting and different from each other and in time new characters joined like Nelle and Ling.  Both brought something to the show and made it even better.",/review/rw2763484/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2001,Shapster11,," The ""Anti"" L.A.Law
","For David Kelly the creation of this law firm must have come to him as he envisioned what L.A.Law would've been in it's most bizarre form. If you told viewers beforehand some of the quirks and cases the main character, and the firm, would entertain I'm sure the ""test"" audience would have responded with a collective thumbs down. This is why the success and following of the show is all the more astounding.",/review/rw2763484/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2019,schofieldius,7," WHY IS THERE SO MUCH VONDA SHEPARD??
","Like, why? Why is she in every episode? Far too much Vonda",/review/rw2763484/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2017,studioAT,3," I remember that show
","This is a decent enough show, with David E Kelley on staff it was always going to be, but its curious that such a popular show at the time hasn't had much of a life afterwards. It's rarely repeated in the UK, and never really talked about.",/review/rw2763484/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2022,carolleejones,9," Great show!
","I've always loved this show and ALL those wacky characters! From the Biscuit to the dancing twins...it's clever, insightful, and totally entertaining. Lucy Lui was a great new character, and Robert Downey Jr was wonderful!",/review/rw2763484/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2012,bbb515,3," How did this character become a lawyer?!
","This is one of the worst shows I've been bored enough to sit through. I like Boston Legal and I like the idea of a comedy law show. However, this series is more focused on McBeal finding love and feeling sorry for herself. The idea is that she ""needs"" a man or she isn't grounded enough to perform simple tasks. This makes you wonder how the character graduated from law school. This coupled with Calista Flockhart's painfully obvious eating disorder makes for the most anti-feminist female lead I've ever had the displeasure of watching.",/review/rw2763484/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2002,bob the moo,," Enjoyable but Ally herself is irritating and grating
",In a Boston Law firm Ally McBeal seeks happiness in her life and her work as she interacts with her many colleagues and lovers.  In between romantic misunderstanding and crossed wires the group have plenty of time to take unusual law suites to trial.,/review/rw2763484/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2020,m-47826,7," One of my favorites growing up.
","And it still kind of is. Especially the first two seasons. Season 2 is the one I can't stop watching. All the episodes are great. The best the show had to offer. The next two seasons are decent, but the finale one is a revamp fail. It can come off as a bit naive by today's standards. But only from a distance. Things weren't as cut and dry as they are these days. Social commentaries didn't make characters look like raging activists. It's better, and help making them sympathetic, no matter their « beliefs ». It's a saner way of handling important issues. And I'm glad shows like these were those that introduced me to certain topics. It's a more subtle and unbiased view on feminism, and female empowerment, than the one currently thrown at us, as well. It even made way for other great « chick » series like Sex and The City, that premiered the Summer this show's first season ended. The casting was gold. And let's not forget about Vonda Shepard's songs, giving rhythm to the heroine's mood, and other special appearances by Barry White and Tina Turner. The show was clearly of different times, yet it's oddly relevant and even more enjoyable twenty years or so later.",/review/rw2763484/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2009,TheEmulator23,6," 1st couple years Good, Last couple nope
","I enjoyed seasons 1, 2, & 3 quite well. 4 isn't bad but getting weak at the end & season 5 is terrible. It seemed pretty obvious that many of the actors knew what was coming and thought it was getting weak & left for good reason. The addition of Hayden Panettiere was the exclamation point of desperation. No, the way they explained her as being Ally's biological mother was ridiculous. Stick with the 1st three years and leave it at that. Boston Legal was solid for it's entire 5 year run but this was not. This is one of those shows that found a solid lead in Calista Flockhart & it might not have been a success at all with out her. I enjoyed many of the plot lines & it had quite a few excellent guest stars which also helped.",/review/rw2763484/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2003,rbverhoef,7," Law & love
","This is a great TV-series. It is about the law and above all about love. The story is sometimes very funny even ridiculous sometimes, but it doesn't matter. For some reason you just have to like it. The thing you have to like the most is Ally McBeal herself. Calista Flockhart does a great. Greg Germann is very funny as Richard, the one who only thinks about money. Peter MacNicol is great as John Cage, the best friend of Ally. Lucy Liu as Ling and Portia de Rossi as Nelle are both gorgeous. The guest appearances here are also great. Taye Diggs, Anne Heche, Christia Ricci, Matthew Perry, they all had their good things.",/review/rw2763484/?ref_=tt_urv

6 March 2013,Vincentiu,," strange map
","it is a ball of memories. not extraordinaries but not bad. a kind of soup for soul after a gloomy work day. nice, sweet, eccentric, crazy, it is, at first sigh, picture of one character. but this character is more than a person. she can be a mirror for other characters or meetings, for public of show or, only, reflection of a answer to so many questions about everything. because this is the root of series. to discover a world. your world. to understand nuances of sense for small basic things. and to know the deep joy of a clever TV series. it is a kind of childhood air in this film. in each episode. out of limits. out of definitions. and it is OK. because everybody hopes to have a map to look, in secret, old ways of firs questions.",/review/rw2763484/?ref_=tt_urv
