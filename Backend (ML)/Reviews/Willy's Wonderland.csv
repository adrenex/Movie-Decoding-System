23 November 2003,Smells_Like_Cheese,7," Jack definitely takes over Sandler, Anger Management is good for a few laughs
","I saw this movie in the theater with my father and I have to say even though Sandler can annoy me most of the time, this is one of his better comedies. I think he owes that to Jack Nicholson's performance, since Jack can carry a film so well he also makes the jokes into perfect cues and great laughs. Adam does a good job as well, both actors worked very well together and actually have great chemistry. I think everyone would agree that their version of ""I feel pretty"" was just so awesome and beyond hilarious. It was also nice to see that this wasn't a typical Sandler film filled with predictable cameo's of his friends, so it showed that he could carry the film without doing the common predictability.",/review/rw0940643/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2007,winner55,7," Sandler at his most restrained
","This is a pretty good romantic comedy with silly bits tossed in (like the squeaky toy bear). This is the first Sandler performance I've really liked a lot, and while Nicholson is really just tossing it off, let's face it, his throwaways are frequently better than the best from most other actors. Here the match - Sandler at his most restrained, Nicholson getting sloppy - works very well, as each becomes a complement to the other, which is wholly in keeping with the characters and their situation. The supporting cast is also doing very well. And the film is well-made: possibly even too much so, as for instance with the cinematography, which is of a high quality that would suit a heavy dramatic film.",/review/rw0940643/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2010,kosmasp,6," Good Management
","This movie works especially because of Jack Nicholson. The gravitas he brings into his role (especially considering the really crazy things he's doing here) helps a lot improve a not perfect script. And even if some inconsistencies are explained (the airplane ""incident""), it still would not make a lot of sense.",/review/rw0940643/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2008,valadas,6," Amazing end
","After watching nine tenths of this movie I was inclined to give it a very bad mark like a 3 or 4: an idiotic scenario and a succession of dull gags, episodes and scenes which not even the enormous talent of Jack Nicholson could save. But suddenly the manner of the movie changes in the last scenes which are gorgeous and even give a quite original meaning to the whole story. If it's not enough to compensate us for the dullness felt till then at least it brings the movie's mark a few points up in my opinion. The scenes at the baseball stadium and the final ones which follow immediately are indeed extremely good comedy scenes. Therefore if you go to watch this movie, have the patience of waiting for its last tenth because it's worth it.",/review/rw0940643/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2011,TheLittleSongbird,7," Better than I anticipated
","I am not a fan of Adam Sandler, I find he is good in the more dramatic films(Punch Drunk Love and Reign Over Me are his best performances to me) and save a few exceptions(Spanglish, The Wedding Singer and Happy Gilmore) I find him irritating in comedy. However, Anger Management is one of the exceptions, Sandler is quite good here but Jack Nicholson outshines him. The script is funny likewise with most of the gags(the describing-who-he-is scene), the story intriguing, the pace snappy in the first two thirds and the characters fairly likable. What lets Anger Management though are one or two scenes that don't quite work such as the basketball scene and a final third that is not only a little draggy compared to the first two-thirds but rather clichéd and cheesy too. Overall, entertaining and a better film than I anticipated. 7/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw0940643/?ref_=tt_urv

19 June 2012,planktonrules,6," A bit ridiculous...but it has its moments
","""Anger Management"" is a highly uneven film that seems ridiculously improbable. However, despite this, it's enjoyable and worth seeing--mostly due to the strange yet engaging work by Jack Nicholson.",/review/rw0940643/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2005,jofitz27,8," Hilarious, in bizarre way
","Let me just say one thing, before I comment on this film: Jack Nicholson is a star. I've heard bad things about his personality, lifestyle, bla bla bla, but, the fact of the matter is (no matter what kind of selfish bean he may be) he is a remarkably good actor. The way he can put so much life into his character, how he can make you believe this was an actual event, is amazing. He made the terrible ""About Schmidt"" a watchable (barely) film. And in his earlier effort, ""Anger Managemenet"", he plays the most annoying man ever to be put on screen (including that utterly stupid Gilligan) but, this time (thankfully!) to a brain-bustingly hilarious effect.

6 November 2006,kittiwake-1,8," Loved it
","Adam Sandler fan. Yep. That is me. I recommend this one to anyone who has a dark sense of humor. Or anyone who can appreciate the idea of Adam Sandler playing a guy (Dave) who just lets the world trample all over him. All because of one incident when he was a kid. How many of us spend our lives trying to prevent a thing that happened once to us from ever happening again? Dave has spent his life doing just that. Enter Dr. Buddy Rydell. He has quite a way about him that makes you wonder what on earth HE is doing as an anger management specialist. And why does Dave need anger management therapy? He's fully in control of his emotions. It really all was just a misunderstanding. But, somehow, innocent as he is, Dave finds himself railroaded into an anger management course with a man who seems to enjoy being a jerk. Well, Dave will just muddle through it all and wait for it all to end. Oh, boy. It only goes downhill from there. This is not for kids. Anyone with ""homosexual issues"" would not appreciate parts. The absurd humor is great if you like that kind of thing. This one is worth a ton of belly laughs. Look out for cameos. Delightful ones! Casting was great. Plot totally believable in an absurd kind of way. Watch it for the laughs, and share it with a friend!",/review/rw0940643/?ref_=tt_urv

","Adam Sandler (Dave Buznik) is a mild mannered and submissive business man with an apparent knack for getting himself into unfortunate and disastrous situations.

5 March 2017,zkonedog,2," A Complete Mess
","When making a movie, the producers/directors must first and foremost determine what type of project they are creating.

4 May 2014,SnoopyStyle,2," Infuriating
","Dave Buznik (Adam Sandler) is a doormat that everybody steps on. Ever since a childhood trauma, he loathes PDA even now with his girlfriend Linda (Marisa Tomei). On a flight, he is arrested for an outburst that only appears to the characters in the movie. Nobody in their right mind in the real world would see it. He is sentenced to anger management with Dr. Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson) who was actually the jerk sitting next to him on the plane. The anger group is full of crazies like super angry Chuck (John Turturro), Lou (Luis Guzmán), and lesbian porn stars Stacy (Krista Allen) and Gina (January Jones). After a bar fight started by Chuck gone wrong, Dave who was actually trying to stop the fight gets into more trouble. He is sentenced to 30 days of intensive therapy with Dr Rydell or else one year in the state pen. The treatment gets more and more ridiculous angering him more and more. Dr Rydell even starts dating Linda. Is he in an alternate universe? Is he in a Truman show? Is Dr Rydell the devil? ",/review/rw0940643/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2006,lee_eisenberg,8," mad about you
","Mostly silly, with Adam Sandler doing his usual goofy stuff, but Jack Nicholson - looking like Orson Welles - gives the movie exactly what it needs. There are some scenes that we expect in an Adam Sandler movie (e.g., someone eventually exposes something embarrassing about himself), but other parts really hit you. The whole ""I Feel Pretty"" sequence was a real surprise. And of course, there's some great lines, especially the ""phobe"" scene. Also starring Marisa Tomei, Luis Guzman, John Turturro, Woody Harrelson and Rudy Giuliani (yes, THAT Rudy Giuliani).",/review/rw0940643/?ref_=tt_urv

24 August 2017,13Funbags,1," When will I learn???
","A good sign that a movie is going to be bad is if the three stars haven't made a total of three good movies in their lifetimes. This is a perfect example of that theory. Sandler had Airheads and Tomei had My Cousin Vinny but neither were even the star in their lone good movies. I've never seen a Jack Nicholson movie because I value my time. A friend of mine asked me if I had seen this and by the time I figured out that she wasn't talking about the Charlie Sheen show, she had forgotten why she asked in the first place. That's another omen. But being the good friend that I am, I decided to give this thing a shot. That was possibly the worst decision I made in my life. There's no reason to even talk about the supposed plot and acting because the movie ended for me at the one minute mark. That's right. By the time they had wasted one minute of my life they had jumped the shark and raped my brain. Immediately after the words Anger Management leave the screen it says Brooklyn, 1978. Then we see a kid wearing a Dukes Of Hazzard shirt. Even though I'm immediately suspicious, I decide to at least wait to hear some dialogue. Wouldn't you know it, the first line is ""Hey Dave I like your Dukes Of Hazzard shirt"". OK, now they had forced my hand, I had to pause the movie and find out when the show started. I literally only had to type ""duk"" into the search bar here and without clicking anything I can see that the show started in 1979. That's where a smart person would have turned off this trash. If they couldn't even do the slightest amount of research for a movie that cost $75 million to make(with no special effects), how can the rest of the movie not be total trash? It can't and it wasn't. I watch tons of low budget sci-fi movies and they all have better plots, acting and comedy. Never see this garbage.",/review/rw0940643/?ref_=tt_urv
21 March 2006,iKickstand,6," As Sandler comedies go, this is a good one
","I first saw Anger Management on release in 2003, and watched it again recently. I must say it didn't feel as good as I remembered it, but I still found it entertaining on second watch and a cut above most Hollywood comedies of the last few years.",/review/rw0940643/?ref_=tt_urv

","Anger Management: Cash-in comedy brought to you by the same folks who gave you such brainless comedies as 'My Boss's Daughter.' Having not been impressed with Adam Sandler's consistent refusal to play nothing more than the protagonist-who-can-do-no-wrong (where is the fun in that), I was, needless to say, disappointed with this mostly stale, moronic comedy. In a near clone of his Mr. Deeds persona, Sandler stars as an innocent, well-meaning guy who is mistakenly diagnosed as chronically angry. Diagnosis: Anger. Treatment: Counseling.",/review/rw0940643/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is a funny movie. When my husband and I went to see it in the theater we were actually laughing out loud. And it was not just us, it was everybody in the theater. Someone looking for a deep and meaningful plot will not find what they are looking for, however it is one of the best plots of all the Adam Sandler movies. It would also not be for anyone who would easily get offended by off-color jokes. Jack Nicholson is hilarious as the Anger Management therapist. He has some of the funniest parts in the whole movie. Adam Sandler is not to shabby himself as the not angry guy learning to be angry through a series of seemingly unfortunate and random events. ",/review/rw0940643/?ref_=tt_urv

","This film has Adam Sandler weak as a dog on a hot summer weekend while Jack Nicholoson tries to bring back the film's zest. This is the type of film where you have to lock your kids because of Jack nicholson. In this movie, he is all out. This film is about Adam Sandler, weak as a stick who is falsely accused of hurting a flight attendent. The law requires that Adam sees a thearpist(jack nicholson) and all of a sudden, all hell breaks loose.",/review/rw0940643/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2003,WalterFrith,," Typical Adam but full of laughs
","Wait!  If you like Big Macs you don't stop eating them because they're all the same, do you?  If you like Coke, you don't stop drinking it because every serving tastes the same, do you?  Well, with Adam Sandler you sort of get the same thing.  His movies all have a climax that usually deals with resolving silly situations, getting the girl, both or something almost the same with his blue collar and juvenile humour thrown in for honest laughs whether you think it's funny or not.  Sometimes you find yourself laughing at these kinds of jokes even though you probably would not in another movie like it.  Adam plays a man who is wrongly convicted of air rage and is sentenced to pay a huge fine and is forced to serve 20 hours in anger management sessions.  His doctor (Jack Nicholson) is a hostile and irritating boob who increases Sandler's anger.  Sandler violates the court order and is threatened with a year in jail unless he spends his sessions with Nicholson in a very close manner for 30 days.  The ending has the movie making sense more than you thought it would after you've questioned it all the way through and Peter Segal's frat house style of direction is just right for this mix that puts the characters in ridiculous situations that you may find infectious.  Sandler's movies are like the Three Stooges: others are better at what they do but the low brow stuff has a strange kick to it!  Cheers to Jack for trying a film far below his talents, making his character work and having a blast at being second banana!",/review/rw0940643/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2005,policy134,2," Nicholson has done worse but this is a close second
","What could have been a nice little comedy turns out to be a complete bore. Jack Nicholson could not be anymore subdued in his performance here and Sandler, who should have been replaced with an actor like Jim Carrey, does his usual repressed angry man routine that simply falls flat on it's face. Nicholson is supposed to be a weirdo and a man of respectability at the same time but we don't really feel that he is all that credible as an authority and his weirdness is just annoying instead of being funny. He tries to provoke Sandler in some kind of pseudo mental health treatment but how is it that Sandler follows his advice even though he knows pretty early on that he is dealing with a nutball.",/review/rw0940643/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2004,claudio_carvalho,7," Lovely Conclusion of a Silly Plot
","In New York, Dave Buznik (Adam Sandler) is a competent executive, but living with a great trauma from his childhood in Brooklyn that made him a very unsecured man. He is not able to kiss his girl friend Linda (Maria Tomei) in public or fight for a promotion in his job, and is stepped by everybody everywhere. In a business flight, he sits on the corridor chair side-by-side with Dr. Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson) and a minor incident with the flight attendant sends him to the court. Judge Brenda Daniels (Lynne Thigpen in her last movie) sentences him to an intensive anger treatment with Dr. Rydell, and his life turns upside-down. I was watching this movie and telling to myself: 'What a silly storyline!'. However, the lovely conclusion when the situations are explained, made me like this film. Although being thirty nine years old, Marisa Tomei is so lovely and beautiful as in 'My Cousin Vinny'. There is a message to Lynne Thigpen, who died before the conclusion of the movie, in the end of the credits. I am a fan of Adam Sandler, Jack Nicholson, John Turturro, Woody Harrelson and Luiz Guzmán, and all of them have funny performances. A great entertainment indicated for laughing. My vote is seven.",/review/rw0940643/?ref_=tt_urv
