13 October 2019,dakjets,9," Disturbing and fascinating
","This series is really different than anything else I've seen. And totally shocking. The story takes place in a financial environment, where we get to know the four main characters. They are totally devoid of moral scruples, and provide themselves mercilessly with what they want. Other people around them become objects they abuse in every way. I think it's the only TV series I've engaged in, where I can't find any sympathetic traits with the main characters, but still I just want to see more, more more.",/review/rw5238185/?ref_=tt_urv

","Great show!
Watching the first two episodes, really whets the apetite for more psychological mayhem from brilliant writer/director Ã˜ystein Karlsen.
(Also, for showcasing sheer range, check out his other mini-series One Night. A charming, smart emotional rollercoaster ride of an extended 24 hour first date)",/review/rw5238185/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2021,DocHolmberg,10," Just amazing
","The best scandinavian series since the danish hit Borgen.
Dark, very funny and extreme in every way. Great acting and the fact that its based on true events makes it even more outstanding.
This show needs to go on forever.",/review/rw5238185/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2019,arntmoberg,10," Amzing series
",This is one of the best series I have watched. That it's made by NRK is impressive. It's a story about four friends who totally lack of empathy and their life as the elite. It's based on real conversations with insiders. Highly recommended,/review/rw5238185/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2019,Fargoer,10," Loved it
",This series is something I would not have expected from NRK. Well played by basically all the actors and showing a reality most people wouldn't even know existed.,/review/rw5238185/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2021,nickochris,9," You think you have seen it all....
","But you really have not, before watching season 1 and 2 of this norwegian tv serie about the crazy wild life of some rich friends.",/review/rw5238185/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2019,lillevenn27,10," Hollywood next
","This is by far the best Norwegian serie i have seen!! And I've seen many! The casting on this is spot on perfect! It took me a while to accept that one in the main character was a slick dude instead of an rough Viking.
But the roles in this show was so convincing I was dragged into the show and so disappointed when all 8 episodes was over.
This is better then Hollywood series.
And so spot on the finance environment not only in Norway but all over the world.
The beauty spas and gym are filled with lonely housewife's with nothing to do, that recognize this life. And maybe worry after seeing this show ðŸ™ˆ
I was very surprised that ALL the roles was played so well also by the smaller parts. Big cred to that!!
Can not wait to season 2-3-4-5-6-7-8",/review/rw5238185/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2021,boethomas,10," Best Norwegian series I've ever seen
","Not that the statement ""Best Norwegian series I've ever seen"" is a proof of quality but this series is in the same league as Californication, Breaking Bad and Entourage. It most probably will be picked up by Hollywood and we will get a Wallstreet version. This is Wolf of Wallstreet as a series where there are a bunch of wolves (alfa males) that doesn't hold back on anything. This is an insight into the filthy rich lifestyle where millions are spent on sex, drugs, alcohol and parties.",/review/rw5238185/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2019,teigas,9," Good show
","Great show. A little dark perhaps, but when you consider this is/could based on actually events/storyes it makes it even better! Waiting for season 2.",/review/rw5238185/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2020,dionyp1,10," Brilliant
","Dark but very hilarious, much better then the Hollywood stuff. It's been a long time since I laughed so hard. The casting couldn't be better.",/review/rw5238185/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2021,Klaus Silberbauer,10," Best Scandinavian series for at least a decade.
","Brutal, dark - yet funny.... in a gruesome way. American Psycho meets Curb Your Enthusiasm and lots and lots of blow and explicit sex scenes. In Norwegian. The acting is exceptiionally good, and the amount of research that have gone into getting everything just right - from the cars to the coffee machine - is astounding.",/review/rw5238185/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2020,montsegimenez,6," Poor rich boy (or not) ...
","If the objective is that from minute one, I want 95% of the characters to die among atrocious sufferings, I must say that: objective accomplished.",/review/rw5238185/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2021,Movie_Reviews,10," Best TV-series ever!
","And it is Norwegian! Amazing. Of course with some Swedish actors, but still very Norwegian. It is absolutely brilliant and depicts what happens to humans when they either A) Are rich or B) Are not rich but want to be.",/review/rw5238185/?ref_=tt_urv

18 February 2020,nedfox-974-15680,9," Have you ever travelled or lived?
","If you have travelled or lived, had a close circle of friends. Plus have lived a little on the wildlside. Then it's a must watch. With exceptionally strong story lines and with acting deserving of peer nominations it is a stand out series. If you have wasted time with other garbage. Watch this.",/review/rw5238185/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2021,raulcristian-946-65266,7," Awesome first season. Ridiculous season 2.
","A really amazing first season where no character was likable and yet you couldn't stop watching. Everything on the script made sense, even considering the abnormalities of these guys. Great performances, a truly remarkable show. Extremely original. A perfect 10.",/review/rw5238185/?ref_=tt_urv

7 October 2019,caroline_chupaa,1," Just annoying
","Watched the first two episodes. I'm not going to support this show or watch any more episodes. Total garbage. Garbage humans and boring plot. Nothing new or special about this show. Same old douchbags we've Seen a hundred times before, with money and power. If you like seeing people who talk bad about women, their kids and families and think they can do anything and anyone go ahead this show is for you.",/review/rw5238185/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2020,voldenissen,10," You both love them and hate them at the same time
","Really fascinating. The main characters are not likeable, but you can't help but cheer them on anyways. It's got kind of that ""the wolf of wall street"" vibe to it. depressing, but super thrilling nonetheless.",/review/rw5238185/?ref_=tt_urv

9 October 2019,twbakke-909-377864,6," Kinda fun
","Basically The Wolf of Wall Street in Oslo with thefts from a few other well-known movies and series thrown in. Points for some dark fun and entertaining plot twists. Good acting, smooth production. Minus points for stealing a bit too much and way too many boring monologues.",/review/rw5238185/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2019,mikael-82,10," Dark, dysfunctional, scary and hilarious (in a very black way)
",From Norway comes a series depicting the life of a foursome of uberrich men and their decadent lifes. The episodes goes from being crazy and hilarious switching to pitch black scary situations. That parts of the story is based on actual events makes this series even better. If you thought Succession was a great series this is right up the same alley - but even more disturbing.,/review/rw5238185/?ref_=tt_urv
