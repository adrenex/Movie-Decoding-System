","""The Banshees of Inisherin"" is an idiosyncratic blend of funny, sad, and more than anything lonely, acted by one of the best casts of the year.",/review/rw8743373/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2022,goshin34,7," This is a tough one to review...
","I think, perhaps, you have to be in a certain mood to watch and appreciate this film properly. Patient, but alert and attentive to catch the subtleties of the slow-burn plot.",/review/rw8743373/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2022,Xstal,8," Two Tribes...
","You've played together, endured the weather, for many years; but something's changed, you've been estranged, gears now sheared; the reason seems completely mad, you've not done anything that's bad, the situation's quite bizarre and very weird. So you persevere, keep holding out your hand, but all that does, is cause the flames, to be more fanned; out of spite your friend wont linger, raises more than a mid-finger, it's like you've been black balled, suppressed, banished and banned. More belligerence results in loss and pain, while there's nothing to be won, you won't refrain, the lines have now been drawn, only one thing this will spawn, it's as avoidable, as it's stupid and insane.",/review/rw8743373/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2022,neil-476,7," Promises broken
","It is 1923 and the Irish civil war has not reached the small island of Inisherin. 40-something Padraic lives with his sister, eking out an agricultural living, and spending what appears to be quite a lot of spare time at the pub with his best friend for years, olderman and fiddle player Colm. Then, one day, Colm tells him that he doesn't want to be friends any more, without providing any sort of reason (he does later). Padraic is devastated and confused and persists in bothering Colm for understanding in the face of Colm's blunt statement that we wants Padraic to leave him alone.",/review/rw8743373/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2022,varun-25071997,10," Colin Farrell Deserves All The Awards In The World
","5 years after his brilliant dark comedy ""Three Billboards, Outside Ebbing, Missouri"", Martin Mcdonagh directs another brilliant tale about Friendship, Ambition and Loneliness. The Banshees of Inisherin is the best a Mcdonagh movie has ever looked, every scene has a visual landscape setting and color tone is completely balanced.",/review/rw8743373/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2022,clauzy82,8," A thought-provoking story of helplessness
","It is a well told dark comedy that keeps you wanting more, in a time when Ireland was full of despair, not long after the war of Independence and a long-suffering period that brought about a post-colonial inferiority complex (still hasn't been addressed to this day), a struggle for an identity, a repressive church, superstitions, isolation, mass emigration, poverty and to top it all off a brutal civil war. This film does a great job to put you in the psych of the time and to top that off the cinematography, costumes, music and atmosphere are wonderful. The film is itself a bit of a conundrum, on one hand it leaves you thinking nonstop about the story and the premise, while on the other hand you feel cheated by its abruptness.",/review/rw8743373/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2022,beatrice_gangi,10," My sweet Jenny
","Martin McDonagh has made an extraordinary film in so many ways, starting with the brilliant theatrical script and the performances of all the main actors involved: Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, Barry Keoghan, and Kerry Condon. This also applies to all the supporting roles.",/review/rw8743373/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2022,Couchkik20,10," A Shakespearean masterpiece
","It's hard to tell if this is a wonderful dark comedy or a a Shakespearean tragedy. Served by a magistral group of actors and actress, ""Banshees"" takes you to stunning Irish landscapes and numbs you with its comfortable scenery, cute farm animals and lovely violin tunes in the good old pub... Until men display a classic story of pride and stubbornness.",/review/rw8743373/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2022,olon-55702,9," Epic battle between kindness and silence
","Are those who live on islands human beings like everyone else? This film clearly tells us no: the island, an enclosed place where everything is concentrated and which the surrounding sea keeps compressed, deeply affects its inhabitants and permeates them with itself, sickens them with its own disease. The latest film by Englishman Martin McDonagh (in his 4th feature film, with 3 films behind him, all of which are top-notch) is absolutely superb: for storytelling ability, for location (evocative, rocky Irish island), for the brilliance of the screenplay (let's face it: McDonagh writes really well!), for acting (impressive Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, also excellent Barry Keoghan and Kerry Condon). The story is told of Padraic (Farrell), good and kind, who, overnight, loses the consideration of his greatest friend, Colm (Gleeson). Why? Because I don't like you anymore, because you're boring, Colm replies to him, and I don't want to waste my time with you anymore. And Padraic, who is not as sharp and intelligent as he would like to be but is esteemed for his courtesy and good spirits, does not understand this. Colm, who plays the violin and composes music, is obsessed with the passing of time, with the need to indulge his art in order not to be forgotten. His art demands total exclusivity from him, leaving no room for the banality of feelings. But is this the real reason, or is Colm going mad? At this point, what follows is a jeu de massacre between the two ex-friends, surrounded by various minor characters that McDonagh knows how to connote with felicitous psychological notations and a keen sense of humor. And then there are the animals, almost sacred emanations of the island, loved and respected, more than human in their affective reactions. And there is the war, distant but present, of which ominous explosions are heard in the distance. And finally there is the old witch, a representation of Death that rivals even the Bengt Ekerot of ""The Seventh Seal."" In short, a beautiful and poignant film like few we see. Not to be missed!",/review/rw8743373/?ref_=tt_urv

15 December 2022,douglasmcbroom,5," Bloody Hell!
","I gave it five stars: one each for the main actors and one for the location. It was marvelously acted. Brendan Gleeson, Kerry Condon and Colin Farrell were all outstanding, but I thought Barry Keoghan delivered the best performance.",/review/rw8743373/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2022,jeffpsy,6," Ultimately unsatisfying
","The Banshees of Inisherin was an unusual movie, featuring gorgeous vistas, on-point acting and haunting music. However, it was ultimately unsatisfying because it never really rose above a persistent, downbeat nihilism.",/review/rw8743373/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2022,paul-allaer,6," It wasn't my cup of thea
","As ""The Banchees of Inisherin"" (2022 release from Ireland; 114 min) opens, the Colin Farrell character, a guy named Padriac, stops by the Breandon Gleeson character, a guy named Colm who is Padriac's best friend. That is, until that moment. For reasons unknown, Colm wants nothing more to do with Padriac. ""I just don't like you anymore"" Colm offers. The calendar shows ""April 1, 1923"", and Padriac doesn't take this unexplained change of behavior by Colm very well... At this point we are 10 min into the movie.",/review/rw8743373/?ref_=tt_urv

21 December 2022,Sasha_Lauren,4," I thought I was going to see an art house comedy / drama, but to me, this was a horror film
","I was enthralled by the beginning of this film, which to me had all the makings of a symphonic, filmatic masterpiece. Shot on the beautious islands of Inishmore and Achill on the West Coast of Ireland, the scenery and cinematography are second to none. The actors deliver award winning performances. And my god, how I adore the Irish dialect and music, the little donkey, heart tugging turn of relationship, and the few funny lines scattered throughout as well. ""Wow"" I thought, This is fantastic! There should be more films like this,"" but halfway through, my reaction shifted.",/review/rw8743373/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2022,benjaminmann,6," Don't expect this to be as good as the reviews hype.
",Super locations. Great photography. Masterful Production design. The acting is world class. So why didn't I enjoy this film? Because it promises to say something and goes nowhere. I'm obviously in the minority here but I wish my expectations hadn't been raised so high. It's dark but a slow almost empty darkness. I'll forget this film very quickly. Which is a good thing for me but doesn't say much for the quality of the story. It feels like there was much more there somewhere but it didn't make it out. Perhaps watching it on a rainy Monday evening didn't help. Also please don't go thinking this is a comedy or anything at all like 'In Bruges'. It's very far from funny. It's very far from the quality of that film.,/review/rw8743373/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2022,johndavidson-1,5," Starts as farce, ends in tragedy

13 December 2022,brentsbulletinboard,3," What's the Fuss About?
","Writer-director Martin McDonagh's dark comedy-drama is one of those films that leaves me (and probably many other viewers) scratching my head, making me sincerely wonder what all the fuss is about. In this fable-like Irish folk tale about two longtime friends (Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson) whose relationship suddenly reaches an impasse, they struggle to come to terms of where things go from there in the aftermath of this scenario. There's just one problem here: the picture's razor-thin premise with its virtually nonexistent back story doesn't provide enough basis for why the dissolution of this friendship occurs and then escalates to a tale of inexplicable desperation and truly bewildering retributive self-abuse. Indeed, we seem to know more about the setting of the story - a small island off the western Irish seacoast during the waning days of the new republic's 1922-23 civil war - than we do about its characters, their relationship and their motivations. To compound matters, the narrative stretches out far too long, taking a seeming eternity to unfold with no particularly satisfying payoff, punctuated by lame attempts at humor that mostly fail to land. To its credit, this offering features fine performances by its two principals, as well as superb portrayals by Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan in supporting roles, all of whom have garnered Golden Globe Award nominations in the acting categories. There's also much to be said for its gorgeous cinematography and atmospheric Carter Burwell original score. However, it's truly mind-boggling to understand how this film has earned eight total Globe nods and four National Board of Review awards, among numerous other inflated and questionable accolades. This tediously dull, slow-paced effort falls woefully short of the fine work the filmmaker achieved in previous films like ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" (2017) and ""In Bruges"" (2008) (not to mention its lack of the snappy on-screen chemistry that Farrell and Gleeson achieved in that off-beat comedy), accomplishments that make this release come across as a great disappointment by comparison. In fact, at the risk of overstatement, ""Banshees"" could have been edited down to a short, and it still likely would have been a letdown. Catch this one at your peril; at the very least, it's now available for online streaming, so you shouldn't have to venture out if you really want to watch it.",/review/rw8743373/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2022,backofthevan,2," What a dreadful disappointment!
","Two is a rather arbitrary rating, scenery was very pleasant and the acting was good all round. Other than that, what a miserable mess this was! I've eagerly waited months to see Banshees of Inisherin and then couldn't believe my eyes at the cruelty, misery, despair and general awfulness of the film. And it's labelled ""comedy""? The most uncomedic film I've seen in many a year!",/review/rw8743373/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2022,ethanbresnett,9," Exceedingly brilliant!

25 October 2022,masonsaul,10," Terrific black comedy
","The Banshees of Inisherin is terrific, exploring the sudden and unexpected fallout of a friendship with painfully funny black comedy, unbearably tense standoffs and often heartbreaking drama. Reuniting the acting/directing team behind In Bruge to deliver some of their finest work.",/review/rw8743373/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2022,JICNZ,1," One star or ten? Not sure.
","The cinematography, set design, costume design and acting in this movie are all exquisite. It's one of those films where the colour of a coat against the backdrop of a stormy sky is almost too beautiful to be real, where light coming in through the window of a cottage is just perfect.",/review/rw8743373/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2022,classicsoncall,9," ""It was all going fine till he chopped off all his fingers.""
","At a time when uniquely creative movies are virtually impossible to find, here's one that's so original in concept you'll wonder what sort of mind came up with the idea. To call ""The Banshees of Inisherin"" a black comedy would be somewhat of an understatement, but if you pay attention and listen very closely, almost every line of dialog is understatedly hilarious, but set within a context so dire that the effect is muted by the desperation and solemnity of the characters. The film almost becomes depressing at times, as Pádraic Súilleabháin (Colin Farrell) attempts to come to grips with the sudden loss of friendship with drinking buddy Colm Sonny Larry Doherty (Brendan Gleeson). It all boils down to a simple statement by Colm - ""I just don't like you anymore"" - but as the story progresses, we come to a better understanding of the dynamic at work with the older Colm and his devastated friend Pádraic, who's insistence in trying to understand what's happening eventually leads to a disastrous outcome for both parties. Notable supporting performances by Kerry Condon as Pádraic's sister Siobhán, and Barry Keoghan as a well-meaning but dimwitted friend of all, make this an often sad and frustrating exercise for the viewer, and as the story reaches its stunning climax, one is left with a sense of loss and profound inability to reconcile one's feelings about what was just experienced. And yet personally, I was left in awe by the picture and even more so by the mesmerizing performances of Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson.",/review/rw8743373/?ref_=tt_urv
