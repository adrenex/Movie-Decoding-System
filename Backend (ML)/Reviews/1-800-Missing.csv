29 November 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," The early seasons were classic!
","I've been a fan of The Walking Dead ever since the first episode of the first season. Even though the quality has gone down in recent years I still haven't missed an episode. While the last few seasons weren't quite as good they were still worth watching. It did go out on a high note though, the last season was actually pretty good. It had a few slow filler episodes but overall it was solid. Even though it was definitely time for it to end I'm still going to miss it. When something's been apart of your life for so long it's hard to say goodbye. The good news for fans is that there are a few spinoffs coming in 2023. I'm actually interested in the spinoffs considering they all star my favorite characters from the main show. There's three of them so far...one with Rick & Michonne, one with Negan & Maggie and one with Darryl going over to Europe. Again, those all happen to be my favorite characters so I'm looking forward to them and hope they're good!",/review/rw7848089/?ref_=tt_urv

2 December 2022,tommdennehy,9," A great thing, but dragged out too long
",I would put this series my top 5 off all time despite the last few series were a tad disappointing. Maybe COVID affected the script writing but it did tail off.,/review/rw7848089/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2022,afura-78800,9," One of the best character evolution in a tv show
","First thing I have to say is that I am normally not a zombie movie or series fan at all cause I don't like zombies so much, it is just not my thing. But and here comes the but I have a few friends telling me often how good the show is and that I have to watch it, so one day I thought that I will give it a try and I wanted to find out for myself why this show is so popular. What can I say I started loving the show (I still don't like zombies though lol), the character progression and evolution in this show is so damn good which was the thing that kept me watching it until the end. I have watched a lot of series in my life but this one here has a particular good evolution and progression of the characters, whoever was responsible for the characters in this series did a damn good job here. Some characters just grow to your heart and others you just hate them :)",/review/rw7848089/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2021,Supermanfan-13,9," Going to miss it but it's prob time for it to go!
","Everyone know that The Walking Dead isn't as good as it used to be, those early seasons were groundbreaking in so many ways and because of them this show still gets a high rating from me! Those earlier seasons make this show one of the best shows of all-time! Like most long running shows, it's had its ups and downs but even at its worst it was still the #1 show on cable, in fact it has been #1 every season it's been on the air. The last few seasons without Andrew Lincoln (Rick Grimes) haven't been as good but it's at least starting to get back to being a pretty good show this season. Norman Reedus (Daryl) and Jeffery Dean Morgan (Negan) have continued to carry the show after Andrew Lincoln's departure and I think we can actually look forward to it again!",/review/rw7848089/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2017,TheLittleSongbird,8," Very much alive for Seasons 1-5, Season 7 dead
","Had heard nothing but great things about 'The Walking Dead' from friends and IMDb reviewers. It took a while to get round to walking, both from being busy and also not being sure whether it would be my cup of tea.",/review/rw7848089/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2018,skybrick736,10," The Walking Dead: Season 1 (10/10)
","The Walking Dead in its first season could not be touched. When it came down to it, the first season had a collection of complex characters, thought provoking dialogue, captivating storylines, great cinematography, and downright scary looking zombies. Its hard to pin-point one thing that is extraordinary about Season 1 since there are so many aspects to talk about. First off, the scenes in downtown Atlanta were incredibly visual and the scenes that took place in more rural areas were very scenic. The undead in the first season had great makeup and special effects too, the zombies had defined faces that really make them feel they were once human. If I had to pick one thing that was great about the first season, its has to be the cast... Andrew Lincoln and Jon Bernthal make great, bad ass lead actors that also have the ability to project a range of emotions. Laurie Holden is also radiant in this season and the surrounding cast of Jeffrey DeMunn, Steven Yeun, Irone Singleton, and Norman Reedus all showcase a great character that can be easily become a fan-favorite to any. Frank Darabont hit a grand slam with the Walking Dead and its fairly easily to see why the shows popularity boomed right away.",/review/rw7848089/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2021,balder777,8," Amazing if you binge-watch.
","This is a very long running TV-show (10+ years) with many seasons. One common view is that the first seasons are great, then it becomes garbage. I decided to binge-watch in 2021 to make an opinion for myself.",/review/rw7848089/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2011,Sleepin_Dragon,10," Utterly surprised
","I have to be honest i was stunned at just how much i enjoyed this, been a while since i can say i'm impatient for part 2 of anything, the first episode was captivating. i have only seen episode 1 but after that alone i feel this is worthy of a 10/10, it has an originality which in a TV series is quite a nice change. Big big fan of Andrew Lincoln, quite a surprise to hear him with an American accent but i think he pulls it off well enough. True enough there were a few leaky points, like why was he left untouched in an unlocked hospital room but who cares. The scene when he walks out of the hospital past all the dead bodies and empty streets, wow, what a piece of brilliance. The effects were great, wouldn't recommend anyone having a kebab while watching it though :-)",/review/rw7848089/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2022,Jonathanb-97,8," TWD at its best till the end
",The Walking Dead I have been watching since day 1 and was a very slow start but as the seasons progressed you see how each character does and survives over the seasons. The end is almost the perfect ending you see all the characters come to getter to fight the commonwealth and Pamela Milton and try to win the fight. But they do encounter some losses but also some gains. I do wish overall there would have been more deaths overall in the show as I thought there were too many characters in the show and some needed to go and there were too many story lines going on and some need to really go. The ending of the walking dead main show series was perfect with the fact that RICK and MICHONE return which was a nice touch! I am really looking forward to all the spin off shows of new and current characters from the Walking Dead series and see where it goes. I will definitely miss watching the main show every Sunday. Overall 8/10 and definitely a must watch series.,/review/rw7848089/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2022,niriath,5," A real shame
","The first 4 seasons were genuinely great! Mostly interesting characters with depth and good archs. Season 5 was okay but became a bit messy. Following seasons became a who' who of human stockpiles. Way too many characters, descisions that made no sense, blurry storylines and no character development.",/review/rw7848089/?ref_=tt_urv

25 April 2022,strizbiz-99429,3," What really killed the show for me
","I really used to love this show, first 6 seasons were great, then things just slowly started going downhill, and what made things worse is all these mid season finales......only airing half of a season and then waiting months and months for the rest of a season is soooooo tired at this point. By the time we get to the second half of a season my interest is less and less. Now we're waiting for the second half of the series finale and to be honest.... I'm really not that interested, no one's sitting on the edge of their seats waiting for the show to return at this point. It's just really time to pull the plug on this show. All the "" let's take a really long break mid season.....every season "" is what ultimately killed it for me.",/review/rw7848089/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2022,panagiotis1993,9," TWD is One of the Best TV Shows Ever Made (2022 Review)
","The audience is clearly divided when talking about TWD and that's understandable. The show had many ups and downs and that's normal for a show with 11 seasons. Many people say that anything after season 5 is garbage but i strongly disagree. Also many people believe that after 'Rick Grimes'' (the most important character) left the show it fell apart. I got sad too when Rick left but i strongly disagree because there were many other great characters that were able to keep the show fresh and exciting. I would say that seasons 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and seasons 10,11 were amazing. The best seasons have to be seasons 1,2,3. The show has decent development for most of the characters and most of the newer characters that it introduced in later seasons were likeable. The show also has some amazing villains, my favorite are Negan, The Governor and Beta.",/review/rw7848089/?ref_=tt_urv

","The Walking Dead is an incredible show, although it has it's rough patches, like every other show. Especially later seasons like seven and eight. But I love it because of how unforgiving and gritty the show is. Because of how realistic the show typically lives I go into every episode wondering who they're going to kill of next, because this show is know for killing off it's characters. Overall, this is one of my favorite shows AMC has ever produced and there is a reason that it has spawned several sequels and even an entire trilogy of movies.",/review/rw7848089/?ref_=tt_urv

",Well I have thought about Zombies for a very long time. The Walking Dead is an amazing show and I have watched the entire series twice already on not all twice since 11 just came out. I think the reason zombies are so popular is because it does 2 things for us humans and our brains. One it gives us the dream and outlet for violence. As much as you may want to be this peace loving person who would never hurt a fly. Unfortunately we all and I mean all have an underlying need for aggression. We need violence why do you think sports and MMA are so popular? Why do you think during Roman times the colosseum was so popular?,/review/rw7848089/?ref_=tt_urv

",Was the best thing on TV at one point! Couldn't wait for it to be on! Was so engaging and all the character threads were amazing! Now they are all getting on my nerves! Is it wrong to want them all to be turned into zombies? I now watch this on a tablet in the background while watching something else. Want to finish it but not really bothered what happens to them!
