25 February 2003,rosscinema,7," True and important film!
","This is a very powerful film from the wonderful Phillip Noyce (The Quiet American) and its based on the shameful history in Australia where aborigine children were taken by force from their families and tribes to camps and taught to be servants. In the film 3 sisters escape and venture to walk 1,500 miles back to their tribe. The title refers to a fenceline that stretches for thousands of miles and the girls follow it. The wonderful aborigine actor David Gulpilil (Walkabout) plays a scout that is tracking the girls and Kenneth Branaugh plays an officer that is in charge of the whole operation. I guess the main flaw in the film would be the middle where most of the walking takes place and the film really slows down but its not a major complaint. The 1,500 mile trek is expertly paced and the film is by no means dull. Rather, its fascinating! The real footage that we see at the end of the film is so powerful that the whole essence of what you have just watched becomes even more devastating. This is more than just an important film, its a documentation of an ugly and shameful part of Australian history. A must see!",/review/rw0745020/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2001,DukeEman,9," What a pleasure it was to see Philip Noyce use his visual storytelling skills on a humane story.
","This powerful film follows the journey of three young aboriginal girls who are taken from their family and forced to assimilate into an empty culture by the white settlers of Australia. This is known as the ""STOLEN GENERATION"", a dark period in Australian history which the current prime minister of Australia refuses to say sorry for the past atrocities. But this is not to say that this film preaches or manipulates emotions for political gain. No! It just tells the story with powerful images that allows the viewer to enter the torment of the stolen generation. Dialogue is minimal as our heroes are taken from their family and driven to the other side of Australia. But their will and instinct to be with their strong culture has the girls escape the camp prison and follow the rabbit-proof fence back home. The rabbit proof fence was built down the centre of Australia to contain the plague of rabbits from entering farm land. It was this white-man built fence that lead the girls back home.",/review/rw0745020/?ref_=tt_urv

","1931 Australia.  The state has passed a law that facilitates the collection of mixed race children to boarding camps where they are trained in their white side of their blood and to be home help as adults.  The eventual aim is to prevent the growth of the aborigines as a race by watering down any mixed blood.  A small group of children, Molly, Gracie and Daisy are taken from their mother and transferred across the country to one such camp.

30 April 2003,=G=,8," So much with so little.
","Few films have garnered so much applause (from critics and public alike) with so little. The plot of ""Rabbit Proof Fence"" can be found elsewhere on this website. Suffice it to say it's about three girls walking and walking and walking and walking and....across some of the most visually austere country on the planet; the Aussie outback. There's little story behind the film, zilch for Hollywood tinsel, and a minimal cast of relative unknowns (except for Branagh's small role). It would be easy to make the case that this film is one long boring flick. However, it would also be easy to make the case it is a beautifully filmed story of courage, determination, and the triumph of the human spirit. I would argue the latter.

3 November 2002,Chris_Docker,7," Statement movie about a bad chapter in Australian history
","Official policy between 1910 and 1970 in Australia allowed half-caste Aborigine children to be forcibly removed from their families and incarcerated for their own' good in training schools where their were educated to become fitting servants for white families. This institutionalised eugenics, still recent enough to be remembered by its victims, is still a controversial issue in Australia where the PM John Howard refuses to give an official apology. The film has been doing very well in Australia. The story follows three such girls who are forcibly re-located but escape, and follow the rabbit-proof fence' on a 1500 mile journey back home. The title itself seems to echo not only the yellow brick road of the Wizard of Oz (another journey to reclaim one's wholeness) but the fence that was erected to contain animals  which is just how the Aborigine children are treated, albeit with the best intentions. The story was adapted from a book by the daughter of the youngest surviving half-cast Aborigine portrayed in the film  the actual child actors had mostly never seen a motion picture before let alone acted in one.",/review/rw0745020/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2003,raymond-15,7," Top marks to the director
","This film has quite a few remarkable features.  First of all is its title which is rather unusual and immediately grabs one's interest.  Next there is the fence itself which runs for thousands of miles to protect what few green plants there are in these desert regions from the voracious appetites of millions of wild rabbits.  This fence plays an important role in this true story.  Then there is the diector who not only scoured the continent to find three suitable aboriginal girls to play theleads but moulded these inexperienced beginners into the believable characters of Molly, Daisy and Gracie.  The director Phillip Noyce has achieved remarkable success in creating three good little performers and should be given full credit for his difficult task.",/review/rw0745020/?ref_=tt_urv

","Based on a true story and set in Australia in the 1930s, Rabbit-Proof Fence is about three ""half-caste"" aboriginal girls, Molly Craig (Everlyn Sampi), Daisy (Tianna Sansbury) and Gracie (Laura Monaghan), who are taken from their mother and shipped 1500 miles across the country to the Moore River Native Settlement where they are to become more integrated into white Australian culture.

29 April 2002,Philby-3,," Phil Noyce gives us film poetry, not propaganda
","MILD SPOILER AHEAD: This is the 200th film I have reviewed for IMDb and one of the most satisfying. Phil Noyce has produced here a piece of cinematic poetry when it could have easily been tendentious agit-prop. The story from the 1930s of three half-cast aboriginal girls walking 2000 km of Western Australia to escape the clutches of white assimilationists is seen through their frame of reference. We see the harsh beauty of the countryside as they do, not an alien landscape but as their back yard. They have all been brought up in the desert and together know how to survive, a point eventually realised by their pursuers, who then lie in wait at their destination.",/review/rw0745020/?ref_=tt_urv

18 January 2003,Bobbygoode,," Superb and Devastating
","Yes we've seen children-on-the-run films, but such glib commentary demeans this true life drama and its implications in real life.  This magnificent and tragic story is yet another must-see in re:the little holocausts that have gone on, even in the most ""civilized"" nations - in this case Australia. What a touching story of three girls, marvelously portrayed by unknown young actresses, who escape from a horrific government policy, initiated by white supremacist Australia pre-Hitler and Nazi Germany.  It is odd to say this is beautifully filmed in the Australian outback... and Kenneth Brannagh, echoing his recent portrayal as Heydrich in ""Conspiracy"", plays white evil incarnate - a prim bureaucrat diligently doing his government job's mandate - to cleanse Australia of ""half breeds"" in a most heinous (if not deadly) fashion.  It is compelling from beginning to end, and the epilogue is most chilling and bittersweet.  Superior and meaningful film making.",/review/rw0745020/?ref_=tt_urv

2 December 2002,george.schmidt,," Heartbreaking triumph of the human spirit.
","RABBIT PROOF FENCE (2002) **** Kenneth Branagh, Everlyn Sampi, Tianna Sansbury, Laura Monaghan, David Gulpilil, Ningali Lawford, Myarn Lawford, Deborah Mailman, Jason Clarke, Natasha Wanganeen, Garry McDonald.   Powerful true-life account of three Australian aboriginal girls who were abducted as part of the country's internment camp treatment of half-caste' children (Aborigines of mixed race with white) who were raised to be lower class citizenry for nearly 100 years .  Set in 1931 the three girls set about their quest to return home to their mother 1,500 miles away with only the titular life-line running across the continent as a guide.  The three girls cast are all non-professionals but that doesn't discourage the emotional impact achieved by their heartbreaking performances (particularly Sampi, whose expressive brown eyes conveys volumes of words in simple glances) and Branagh as the perpetuator and self-professed protector of the natives elevates his blind passionate character from becoming an easy villain to loathe.  Filmmaker Phillip Noyce does a remarkable job in his direction particularly allowing many scenes to commence without sound and let the stillness affectively depict the seemingly impossible feat at hand. Christine Olsen's taut and well-paced screenplay adaptation of Doris Pilkington's autobiography is a work of true artistry. One of the year's best films.",/review/rw0745020/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2006,Hitchcoc,9," We Always Know Best
","This is a film about the arrogant superiority of Western culture. It's about a group of people, minding their own business, that must be saved by a government, immersed in Christian pomposity. The children, the heroes of the film, face amazing obstacles, just to return to their lives in the desolate Australian outback. The British governors and their ilk feel they are doing them a favor, setting them up in menial jobs, taking away their culture and their language. But, in this case, the human will is going to challenge that force and attempt to right things. This sort of stuff has been going on for centuries. Those that have the word can't be satisfied with it; they must take away the basic human rights of others and force their beliefs on them. ",/review/rw0745020/?ref_=tt_urv

","Like a number of films from the Australian ""New Wave"" of the 1970s, such as ""Walkabout"" and ""The Chant of Jimmy Blacksmith"", ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" takes for its subject relationships between the country's white and Aboriginal communities. (David Gulpilil, one of the stars of ""Walkabout"", has an important role here). It is a historical drama, set in 1931, and loosely based on a true story.

","I've seen several movies recently (""Adaptation,"" ""The Hours,"" ""Bowling for Columbine,"" ""City of God,"" etc.), and ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" is the best of the bunch. It's a simple story, but a very moving one. In particular, the performances by the young leads, the beautiful cinematography, and the wise, uncluttered script made this a strong cinematic experience for me. Kenneth Branagh was convincing as the racial purity zealot who manages the whole forced removal scheme. I also really enjoyed the subtle changes we see in the mysterious character of The Tracker (played with wonderfully restrained power by David Gulpilil), as his dogged pursuit of the girls eventually gives way to a dawning admiration. And to cap it all off, the closing real-life footage and text postscript leaves the audience feeling simultaneously devastated and triumphant. Wow.",/review/rw0745020/?ref_=tt_urv

","Fifteen hundred miles in nine weeks, that's about twenty four miles per day. The movie doesn't even come close to portraying the harshness of the terrain and weather conditions the girls would have encountered. The pain and hunger these girls must have endured goes beyond belief and is a testament to the courage one can summon to attain a goal held firmly in belief. I was not aware of the history of the Aborigines Control Act or of the suffering imposed on a race deemed inferior by the colonials. In some small measure, this film helps both educate and inspire, and is one of those pictures that's not easy to let go.
