25 September 2020,TheLittleSongbird,7," ""I am in blood, stepped in so far""
","Was actually really looking forward to seeing this 2015 film version of 'Macbeth'. The play is one of Shakespeare's best, most famous and most quotable and has leant itself to film, with Roman Polanski, Orson Welles and Akira Kurosawa all giving it splendid treatment. The cast is a talented one, having often admired Michael Fassbender, Marion Cottilard and David Thewlis and ever since seeing him in 'The Borgias' Sean Harris struck me as one to watch.",/review/rw3392664/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," Macbeth
","William Shakespeare's famous tragedy is brought to the screen on a large scale. Full of his intricate and unique style of writing, this play focuses on Macbeth.
....
What I did not expect to see is that the landscape of Scotland becomes not just the scenery background but one of the main storytelling streams. One sees too many modern adaptations of Japanese interpretation of Macbeth that one seems to forget where the story came from in the first place. Truly magnificent cinematography in this version of Macbeth and it really lives up to bloodbath on the battlefields as stated in the Bard' s words. One of the best movies in 2015",/review/rw3392664/?ref_=tt_urv

","Being made to study the Scottish play in School, I had always hoped one day it would come in handy, and on this occasion finally it did. I didn't think i'd be going to the Cinema to see Macbeth, but what a pleasant and rewarding surprise.",/review/rw3392664/?ref_=tt_urv

15 December 2015,AliceofX,5," Mumbles And Mumbles
","Well it was certainly very artistic and certain parts were just gorgeous. However there is not much more to recommend Macbeth. The worst part to me was how the dialogue was spoken, or not spoken since it was mostly whispers and mumbles. Just mumbles and mumbles. Shakespeare's prose just begs to be enjoyed but here I couldn't understand what they were saying half the time.",/review/rw3392664/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2018,gcsman,7," Stylish and atmospheric take on a classic
","This version of one of the greatest plays in the English language is worth seeing for the visuals alone. We're placed right into a medieval Scottish countryside with its strikingly beautiful landscapes, lochs, and mountains. That austere and foreboding setting underlies just about every scene. The three Weird Sisters (who look superficially like peasant women but convey a genuinely creepy otherness) stand in fog-shrouded fields as they utter their cryptic warnings and prophecies to Macbeth and lurk in the background off to the side of the battles. Hardscrabble peasants and soldiers dot the landscape, sometimes strangely motionless, sometimes lining the roads, but always enhancing an air of strangeness. Life is brutal, violent death is never far away, and the supernatural world is always just offstage.",/review/rw3392664/?ref_=tt_urv

12 October 2015,BillSims28,8," Five Word Review: Extraordinarily Acted Gritty Shakespearean Drama
","William Shakespeare's most famous (and quotable) tragedy has not had a major big-screen adaptation that has stayed faithful to the play in many a year. Justin Kurzel's film attempts to provide a definitive cinematic version of the iconic play with this gritty, war-based work of drama starring Michael Fassbender (Oscar-nominated for ""12 Years a Slave, 2013) in the eponymous role and Marion Cotillard, who won the award for her role in Edith Piaf biopic ""La Vie en Rose,"" 2007.

",I am not a big lover of Shakespeares plays but Macbeth is a story few haven't heard at one time or another this movie is a great watch for those who enjoy the story and those who are new to it Fassbender gives an amazing performance as Macbeth and speaks the famous words in a way not heard before a modern day retelling of an old story done right.,/review/rw3392664/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2015,CalRhys,," A Stunning And Savage Epic Drama
","Fantastic adaptation of Shakespeare's iconic tragedy, Justin Kurzel's drama is a stunning and well-crafted epic, featuring some unforgettable performances from Marion Cotillard, Paddy Considine, Sean Harris and of course, Michael Fassbender in the role of the savage tyrant, Macbeth. Joining the other great Shakespearean masters such as Olivier and Branagh, Kurzel has created a brutal and ambitious depiction, caught by the awe-inspiring cinematography of Adam Arkapaw. Featuring glorious locations across the bleak and wintery Highlands of Scotland, 'Macbeth' is a film adaptation that even the great playwright himself would be proud of.",/review/rw3392664/?ref_=tt_urv

7 May 2016,GusF,," Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing
","The most recent of the many screen versions of the Scottish Play, this is a truly abysmal adaptation of one of Shakespeare's finest works. Justin Kurzel's direction is appalling. He seems to be more interested in artistic gimmicks such as the pointless and distracting slow motion in the first battle scene and in showing blood and guts than in the raw emotion and psychology of the play. It is an exercise in flash over substance, which comes across as pretentious. It is as if he is trying to convince us that he is a great filmmaker. Well, he succeeded in convincing me of quite the opposite, I'm afraid. Not only that but the film looks cheap. At one point, I was worried that there was something wrong with the DVD as the camera work was so shoddy. Sadly, there wasn't. I could not help comparing the would-be affecting battle scenes to the powerful and gritty ones seen in Kenneth Branagh's version of ""Henry V"" and I could also not help finding them wanting. All I kept thinking was that it would have been considerably better if Branagh, my favourite living director, had been given the job. Rumour has it that he is considering his own version and I really hope that that's true.",/review/rw3392664/?ref_=tt_urv

13 December 2019,skepticskeptical,9," Great Cinematography
","If you´re going to make a film of a Shakespeare play, it better be beautiful. Otherwise, what´s the point? Fortunately, this version of Macbeth provides what no theatrical production ever could: top-notch cinematography. Above all, the viewer is treated with gorgeous images of the barren, forbidding Scottish landscape. I also thought that the acting was quite good, by everyone involved, from the witches to Macbeth to Macduff to Lady Macbeth and everyone in between.",/review/rw3392664/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2020,mehobulls,7," A mad Fassbender, a mesmerising Cotillard, beautiful visuals, great costume design. What's not
","One of many Macbeths, but a special one. It's strange why it didn't get more buzz in the theatres, but the dialect was hard even for me. Needed English subtitles, and this because it's a great film. Great choice of locations and wonderful cinematography. The interpretation of Lady Macbeth and the looniness of Macbeth is wonderful and fully justified. A joker like Fassbender was a wonderful choice - amazing film!",/review/rw3392664/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2015,gsygsy,8," What bloody man is that?
","A visually impressive, intelligently adapted, atmospheric version of a very famous play. Michael Fassbender is stunning in the title role. What an actor he is! Brutal and sensitive, cruel and caressing, he handles the verse effortlessly, the fights viciously, and he radiates a huge wattage of charisma. He and Marion Cottilard make a convincingly sexy couple. She is not obvious casting - usually the role is the province of more steely performers. All the same, she makes a success of it, forceful in the electrically effective banquet scene, and touchingly melancholy as she drifts into the deep depression of her mad scene.",/review/rw3392664/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2015,nsharath009,8," Marion Cotillard and Michael Fassbender excel in Justin Kurzel's thrillingly savage interpretation of the Scottish Play.
","As the shortest, sharpest and most stormily violent of William Shakespeare's tragedies, ""Macbeth"" may be the most readily cinematic: The swirling mists of the Highlands, tough to fabricate in a theater, practically rise off the printed page. So it's odd that, while ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""Hamlet"" get dusted off at least once a generation by filmmakers, the Scottish Play hasn't enjoyed significant bigscreen treatment since Roman Polanski's admirable if tortured 1971 version. The wait for another may be even longer after Justin Kurzel's scarcely improvable new adaptation: Fearsomely visceral and impeccably performed, it's a brisk, bracing update, even as it remains exquisitely in period. Though the Bard's words are handled with care by an ideal ensemble, fronted by Michael Fassbender and a boldly cast Marion Cotillard, it's the Australian helmer's fervid sensory storytelling that makes this a Shakespeare pic for the ages — albeit one surely too savage for the classroom.",/review/rw3392664/?ref_=tt_urv

23 October 2015,JamesHitchcock,4," How to Make a Bad Film out of a Great Play
","Shakespeare's ""The Tragedy of Macbeth"" should be a superbly cinematic play. It is relatively short by Shakespearean standards, has a straightforward and gripping plot, contains some of Shakespeare's greatest dialogue, includes a strong supernatural element which should stimulate any director's visual imagination and provides two magnificent roles, one male and one female. And yet there has never been any really compelling film version to compare with, say, Olivier's ""Henry V"", the James Mason/Marlon Brando ""Julius Caesar"", Zeffirelli's ""Romeo and Juliet"" or Branagh's ""Much Ado about Nothing"" or ""Hamlet"". Most of the numerous feature films based on the play were made during the silent era; about the only previous sound versions I can think of were Orson Welles' from 1948 and Roman Polanski's from 1971. Olivier had plans to make a filmed ""Macbeth"", but these came to nothing.",/review/rw3392664/?ref_=tt_urv

","Studying Macbeth at school, I recall not being convinced when an army camouflaged itself with trees to bring Birnam Wood to Dunsinane thus enabling the witches' prophecy.

18 October 2015,NeonRaptor,9," Phenomenal
","I recently saw Macbeth with Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard and directed by Justin Kurzel and is easily my number 1 film of the year so far. While the Shakespearean dialogue may be hard to follow at times, it doesn't matter as this film is a visual masterpiece and not only i the way of shot types but also in the use of colour (which the end scene uses in a truly jaw dropping sequence). The cinematography in Macbeth is truly something to marvel at and is perfectly accompanied by magnificent performances from the 2 leads and also the rest of the cast. Fassbender was born to play this role and portrays Macbeth in a powerful and emotionally engrossing way and Cotillard is a beautiful and faultless Lady Macbeth (she has a great monologue in one scene which gave me goosebumps). Another element that I loved was the score, wonderfully haunting and powerful and matches the scenery and setting of the film. Overall, Do. Not. Miss. This. It is spectacular and I've probably hyped it up too much now but what ever its great. If I had to fault it I would saw that there are some iconic lines from the original play that aren't used in the film which was disappointing but it probably wouldn't have fit with the tone so maybe it was for the best.",/review/rw3392664/?ref_=tt_urv
