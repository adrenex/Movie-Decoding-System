28 March 2018,kluseba,8," The wilderness shows us who we really are
","I have been familiar with and fascinated by Yossi Ghinsberg's dramatic survival story for many years and have even occasionally given classes about it at school. When I heard that there was a movie about this intriguing journey, it wasn't even a question whether I would purchase the film or not. The blandly titled Jungle fulfils my expectations on many levels. ",/review/rw6296436/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2018,agasi999,10," I genuinely do not understand all the low ratings!
","I just caught this film on Amazon Video and I'm kicking myself for not catching this at the movies. I don't think the movie was marketed well when it was released. I was blown away by all aspects of this film and found it hard to hold back my tears towards the end of the film.To an extent it reminded me of Danny Boyle's 127 Hours, but it's a beautifully made film in its own right. It's a survival story so be prepared to see some not so appetising scenes in parts but the pay off is worth it. Towards the end of the film we get to see the real people behind these characters and those photos will stay with you long after you've seen the film. I'd recommend you to seek this one out on the biggest screen you could find.",/review/rw6296436/?ref_=tt_urv

13 February 2018,AverageJoesDriveInPodcast,8," Daniel Radcliffe turns in a fantastic performance
","I knew nothing about this one, even the synopsis wasn't anything really eye-catching. I don't think I'd even heard anyone talk about this one yet. But, I noticed it was new on Amazon Prime, so I figured what the hell, might be worth checking out.",/review/rw6296436/?ref_=tt_urv

16 February 2022,HotToastyRag,8," Hey, it worked for James Franco
","Poor Daniel Radcliffe. I can imagine him reading the script of Jungle, based on a true story of one man's harrowing trials when he gets lost in the unexplored jungles of Bolivia. He probably said, ""Hey, it worked for James Franco! Maybe I'll get an Oscar nod out of this."" If you liked 127 Hours, you'll probably like this one as well. Many people find survival movies to be extremely entertaining - but if you're not one of those people, don't even think of renting it. This isn't like Robert Redford's A Walk in the Woods; it's quite gory and upsetting.",/review/rw6296436/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2019,Tiffany-sharp83,8," True tale of survival
",I enjoyed this one. I'm a huge fan of survival and adventure movies and while this one wasn't 'amazing' I liked it. I will be reading one of Yhossi's books on this life event,/review/rw6296436/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2018,whollycow,7," Survival movie
","Young guys seeking adventure trek into South American jungle as if it were a tourist destination. They are clueless and have no survival skills. You can fill in the blanks from there. Still, if you like survival movies -- as I do -- this is worth a look. High production values and credible acting. I enjoyed the ride.",/review/rw6296436/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2020,eilseNfx,7," Friendship, Survival, Faith Become a movie
","This is not by far a great movie. But it is great worth watching movie. Based from real event movie. i don't understand why 'based from true event' gets low rate. Like what i want in any of survival movie, this movie makes you appreciate your daily 'goodnight' bed. The characters in this film were great, as if you see your own character in one of the characters. You will be able to experience my title in this movie.",/review/rw6296436/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2018,nadiatownshend,10," The Boy Who Lived
","From the moment Jungle begins it doesn't let you go and even when you've finished it it comes back and haunts you because you can't believe this actually happened. 
It's a very inspiring story about a group of naive young men and the psychological impact of the experience on Radcliffe's character is emotional and scary whilst affecting. 
The scenery is breathtaking, the story - true. Radcliffe's acting talents shine through and he is unrecognizable in this role. 
A brilliant film and story of survival that should not be missed.",/review/rw6296436/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2017,arungeorge13,6," Radcliffe is excellent, and the film a not-bad effort that had the potential to be better! [+57%]
","Greg McLean, who's known for his vacation-gone-awry horror flicks like 'Wolf Creek' (and its sequel), 'Rogue' and 'The Darkness', wields the microphone to narrate the real-life account of a group of backpackers getting lost in the wilderness of the Amazon (in Bolivia). The tale is told from the perspective of Yossi (Daniel Radcliffe), an Israeli explorer hell bent on juicing more out of life than the usual routines. While on a backpacking expedition in South America, he befriends Marcus (Joel Jackson) and his photographer-acquaintance Kevin (Alex Russell), and happens to meet an Austrian gold-digger Karl (Thomas Kretschmann), who suggests a trip deep into the jungles of the Amazon in search of a near-extinct Indian tribe.",/review/rw6296436/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2019,Pipaccc,10," Terribly underrated!
","Im gonna start off with Daniel Radcliffe. He was simply BRILLIANT in this movie. Trully astonishing and thrilling true story was beautifully brought to screen. I loved the cinematography, landscape shots and camera work overall. I can't understand why this movie has rating of 6.7, while movies like justice league, with no story, or with the story that we've seen multiple times already, have ratings 8+.
I would recommend this movie to everyone. Its inspiring, shows us how small we really are before the mighty jungle.",/review/rw6296436/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2017,Zensha,7," Gripping true story
","Not sure if this could be classified as horror, but it certainly got me on the edge of my seat. I've been out in the bush a fair bit and can say that this is all very realistic. Hallucination is very real in the wild, and so is not being able to get quality sleep and your socks getting stuck to your feet due to dried up blisters and foot rot. Ouch.",/review/rw6296436/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2017,eve_dolluk,8," The Horrors of the Jungle

20 August 2019,sddavis63,7," Pretty Good Survival Epic
","Daniel Radcliffe has come a long way since Harry Potter. In ""Jungle"" he stars as Yossi Ghinsberg in a true story about survival in the South American jungle. Yossi - along with two friends and a guide - sets off on an adventure, and along the way gets separated from everyone else and has to fight for survival for three weeks, battling wild animals, fire ants, the weather, quicksand and pretty much anything else the jungle could be expected to throw at him. Radcliffe's performance was very good. There are long portions of this that are essentially a one man show, and if Radcliffe had been less than excellent the movie would have suffered. But he pulled it off, and he pulled it off well.",/review/rw6296436/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2018,kosmasp,9," I'm a survivor ... or am I?
","This is based on a true story ... no wait! Don't run away! It's actually pretty good! And while the movie may be slow paced at times and the motivations our main characters are acting upon may seem wild and far out (no pun intended) for most viewers, they are still believable. And there are things that will keep you at the edge of your seat.",/review/rw6296436/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2020,nathanmanson,7," Hard to find anything wrong with it
",For me I've never read the book so I can't compare it to that. I also don't know how accurate it is because I know nothing about trekking through Jungles. However from what I saw it looked very realistic and I enjoyed it. Also Daniel Radcliffe's acting was incredible a real joy to watch.,/review/rw6296436/?ref_=tt_urv

31 January 2018,jtindahouse,8," A harrowing and fascinating true story
","Watching 'Jungle' was like having my worst nightmare flashing before my eyes and being told it was a true story just made it that much more horrific to watch. To me this is real horror in a way. Sure you can watch people being chased by psychopaths with knives or chainsaws, but at the back your mind is always the thought of how unlikely that is to ever happen to you. The happenings in 'Jungle' however seem more than plausible. In fact they're one of the reasons I doubt I'll ever set foot in South America. But my phobias aside, 'Jungle' was a very good movie.",/review/rw6296436/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2018,tatarzy,10," Refreshing break from the world rotting in Marvel excrements
","I've been lookign for a story.
Tired of all the nonsense of the recent crap, filled with CGi and nothing else. 
Jungle gives you a story. Think about what you see, and this one becomes a masterpiece. 
Don't look for giant apes or crodiles, this one is all about a human soul and friendship against the mother nature. Simple and beautiful",/review/rw6296436/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2021,graham-harvey,8," Great movie
","There is always a degree that films based on real events leave you unsure how accurate it is relative to real events. But having said that, this film gives a great look into how it would have been to be lost in the jungles of South America. Disease, predators, lack of food, rapids and dangerous rivers to navigate. A major test of endurance & a story of survival.",/review/rw6296436/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2022,BrunoRatesTheMovies,6," ""The jungle shows us what we really are""
","Remind me never to go trekking in the Amazonian jungle with nothing but a random guide. True stories always hit harder than fiction. There really are some terrible people in the world and in the same movie, some people with amazing survival skills. I wouldn't have lasted the first night.",/review/rw6296436/?ref_=tt_urv

21 November 2020,deepfrieddodo,8," Radcliffe's Masterpiece
","I felt I was going to be disappointed from the start of this film, it was really slow and a little dull. But slowly, it picks up, and it picks up, and it finishes as a truly brilliant film. Radcliffe is simply perfect throughout and the development of his state the longer he is in the jungle is phenomenal.",/review/rw6296436/?ref_=tt_urv
