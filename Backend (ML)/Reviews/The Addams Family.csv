13 September 2014,rogerdarlington,," Solidarity forever!
","In the summer of 2014, my wife and I went to a north London dinner party where one of the other guests was Mike Jackson, a leading member of Lesbians and Guys Support the Miners ((LGSM), a support group during the bitter industrial dispute of 1984-85 which provided money and assistance to a mining community in South Wales. He told us how he had been acting as a principal adviser to writer Stephen Beresford and director Matthew Warchus who had crafted the forthcoming film ""Pride"" which explored this unlikely pairing of groups fighting the iniquities of Thatcher's Britain and he made clear his delight at how the subject had been treated for the big screen.",/review/rw3080354/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2015,ste-scouse,10," Brilliant moving and accurate I know I was there.
","I have just watched this film and on a personal level it affected me greatly. I was a young gay man in 1984 and I and friends, travelled to both the 84 and 85 Pride marches in London. I remember the Miners support at the 85 and we were greatly touched at the time. The movie got the details exactly right, I and many of my gay friends were on lots of marches including the ones against Clause 28 the evil Tory piece of legislation that outlawed promotion of homosexuality in schools and publicly funded museums and art gallerias (among others).",/review/rw3080354/?ref_=tt_urv

","PRIDE commemorates the hitherto unremarked but nevertheless remarkable alliance between Welsh miners and London lesbians and gay men. It is an enjoyable, well-made, sometimes uplifting, movie set in a bleak period of British history. It is a political film, in the best sense: it's about people joining together to take control of their own destinies, a theme which has a long history in UK cinema, going back at least to the fantasy of PASSPORT TO PIMLICO (1949) to the based-on-fact MADE IN DAGENHAM (2010).

8 September 2014,bob-the-movie-man,9," A film to make you proud of British cinema
",Probably few things have divided the British people more in the last forty years than Margaret Thatcher's time as Conservative leader. The pivot point for that hatred/worship was the protracted dispute with the National Union of Mineworkers in 1984/85. Arthur Scargill led the miners in a fight to the death against pit closures and their way of life; Maggie Thatcher led the government and establishment that could never afford to lose that battle. Britain would have been a very very different place if history's dice had fallen differently.,/review/rw3080354/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2015,Paddy-49,9," ""Pride"" a brilliant paean to tolerance, with lessons for us today
","Whilst it is perhaps to small to be called a ""genre"" there is a body of movies about working-class community action groups triumphing over threats. Think ""Brassed off"", ""Made in Dagenham"", ""The Full Monty"". In ""Pride"" the story is slightly different. A Welsh mining village is trying to cope with the privations caused by the Miners' Strike in 1985. A group of Lesbian/Gay activists in London decide they want to help and offer their services to the village. The community is Macho, proud, inclusive and as prejudiced as you'd expect in this social context and those times. The Only Gay in the Village (beautifully played by Bill Nighy) has never come out and is unlikely to. Some villagers are openly homophobic. Some more tolerant. Some intrigued. Gradually the ""welcome the gays"" group gains sway and an effective, funny, heart-warming and moving arrangement is reached and the village benefits financially and emotionally from the Gay group's efforts.",/review/rw3080354/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2014,TheLurkingFox,10," An absolute must-see
","Just been to the avant-premiere in Paris: The movie is absolutely magical. Not to oversell it, but it's a must-see. It's funny but very moving, with a perfect blend of ""comedy"" and seriousness (because these were dark times, both for the miners and the gay community). The dialogues are really good, well though-out, and delivered convincingly by a stellar cast, who are always believable in their roles.",/review/rw3080354/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2015,InMyHonestOpinion,8," An amazing story that brings two very different worlds together for a great cause.
","Some films when they are in pre-release have so much hype and advertising running behind them that by the time the film is actually released we have seen three or four different trailers that have usually given away all the bets bits of the film leaving a sour and disappointing taste in our mouths and a feeling as though we have just wasted our time once we get around to actually seeing them. Then there are some films that deserve the hype and publicity that only ever get minimal, usually these films belong to a film festival and it's only through word of mouth that they make it to their intended audience. Pride is a film that was first released at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival winning a standing ovation and the Queer Palm award from there it went onto a limited release schedule mostly being involved in Queer Film Festivals around the world. Pride is a true life story based around the British Miner's Strike in 1984, Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister and not very popular, not with miners and especially not with the gay and lesbian community either. Joe, a young naïve closeted gay boy arrives in London to take part in his first gay pride march, soon after arriving Joe is taken in by a local gay and lesbian rights activist group who do their part to raise funds to fight their foe Thatcher and her evil ways. Soon after the group realise that both the Miner's and the gay community have a lot in common they make the decision to start raising funds for the families of the miners in a little Welsh town called Onllwyn. The miners reject the gay and lesbian activists money believing it will do more harm than good for their cause so the group unfazed but a little perplexed decide to take the money personally to the town to hand it over and explain their situation and hopefully form a new alliance against the countries Prime Minister and her party Pride is set in a very bleak and dark time of British history but I feel that it's never actually shown that way, sure things are dark and gray but I wish the director just added more hardship to his final edit for the film, not being a part of it personally but remembering how harsh it was from school study and other films I have seen over time. I don't think the film was shown as brutally honest as it should have been, from what I know of those days; they were horrid, times were rough and extremely hard, I just wish that it was portrayed a little more than what we were given. That is my only concern with the film, which says a lot I feel. None-the-less it is a fantastic well made, well directed and full of amazing actors that really bring the story to life, the story is really well scripted and the actors chosen in their respective roles have done an amazing job. Staring Bill Nighy (Love Actually, Shaun of the Dead) as Cliff, Imelda Staunton (Maleficent, Vera Drake) as Hefina Headon, Dominic West (John Carter, The Awakening) as Jonathan Blake, Paddy Considine (Hot Fuzz, The World's End) as Dai Donovan, George MacKay (How I live Now, Peter Pan) as Joe ""Bromley"" Cooper who is one of the few fictional characters created for the film and a whole heap of others, it is actually a very great cast everyone did their part to make the film work. As I said earlier the cinematography of the film was good I just wish it was darker like the times it is set in. The director and his crew have done a great job with this film written by Stephen Beresford and directed by Matthew Warchus (Simpatico). Pride is a feel good film with a fantastic story that can be shared with all your loved ones, there are a couple of scenes that may be a deemed a little over the top but perhaps you can use that to answer some curious minds if questions are asked. Pride is an amazing story that brings two very different worlds together for one great cause.",/review/rw3080354/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2014,greatbritain1989,7," Incredible effort, but oh does it hit so hard
","I saw this yesterday at a preview and was particularly impressed by the amazing production values shown in this film, as well as the powerful warmth of the ensemble cast within this. Many stand out, to the point where everyone stands out. My personal favourite performances are probably Dominic West's because of his wonderful energy, fantastic delivery and that the fact that he was playing a gay men (and was significantly less creepy than his Fred West performance) and Jessica Gunning's who played her play with such warmth and fire. That said, Staunton, Nighty and Schnetzer et all had some determination as well, it really is that not to want to give individual props to all.",/review/rw3080354/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2014,dixiecheese2003,10," There is nothing not wonderful about this movie.
","If you don't laugh, don't shed a tear, or don't want to get up and cheer at the end, then you weren't paying attention during this movie. Based on a true story, this is a film about how two unlikely groups came together in the troubling times of the early 80s in the U.K., but in addition to that, there are a lot of side stories that occur at the same time. Excellent character development (especially after the first 20 minutes), which is critical for a based-on-true-life film. The acting is superb. Listen carefully for the deadpan humor the British are known for: especially if you're not used to London and Welsh accents. Highly recommend this movie to anyone who needs a lift and a reminder that *people are good.*",/review/rw3080354/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2014,jakob13,8," Working class pride
",British stage director Matthew Warchus' first venture in filmmaking Pride--based on a true story that had slipped through the cracks of history--won the Queer Palm at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival.

11 October 2014,rteiger,10," A must-see true story that nobody has heard about
","This is the best movie of 2014 in my humble opinion. The true story is one that everyone should know about. Now is the time for this amazing story to be told. The ending blew me away. I didn't see it coming, and I don't think anyone else will either. I love that this movie treats straights in a respectful and realistic way, and many of them are even heroic. Just like in real life - and it is a real story. Imelda Staunton and Bill Nighy are perfection in their roles. The entire cast is perfect. Since it is a true story, at the end of the movie they were able to tell us what happened to some of the people after the miners' strike. Several of the real stories of what happened to them later in life blew me away and made me cry - both for joy and for sadness. This really is a story that you need to know. Thank God this story has finally been told. The audience actually cheered at the end in my theater.",/review/rw3080354/?ref_=tt_urv

5 October 2014,aharmas,10," Brilliant, Inspiring, and Moving
","It is always a pleasure to see a good movie, with good acting, and a good screenplay. ""Pride"" gives you the opportunity to rejoice even more because you're seeing a great film, based on a real-life event, and it is able to capture the ups and downs of the people involved. It takes the audience for a ride, showing the ugly and good of the parties involved, as each hesitates to join forces with the other because of past experiences, ignorance, or both. The film doesn't pull back from showing you the warts and everything, but there's an emphasis on giving you hope that eventually determination and the need for improvement and the end of injustice will prevail.",/review/rw3080354/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2014,neil-476,9," First rate
","During the 1984/85 Miners' Strike, a small group of Gays and Lesbians in London see parallels between between their own downtrodden situation and that of the persecuted miners, and become effective fund-raisers. When visiting the small Welsh mining village they are supporting, however, they find homophobia running even more strongly among the mining community than elsewhere.",/review/rw3080354/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2015,planktonrules,7," Daring and yet not daring at the same time.
","In one big way, ""Pride"" isn't exactly a daring film. In the 21st century, doing a movie about homosexuals is very politically correct and very acceptable. Yet, on the other hand, this sort of film, despite the political correctness, is probably NOT destined to be a huge blockbuster--especially since many folks might not say anything against a pro-gay film but they certainly won't pay to go see one. In no way is any of this meant as criticism--just my feelings about the marketability of such a film. ",/review/rw3080354/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2014,sally-w,10," Fabulously Fantastic
","This would have to be my absolutely ideal movie. Tears, laughter, music, fun and engrossing from start to finish. Based on a true story and real events an amazing person figures out that the striking coal miners have a whole lot in common with the gay and lesbian movement. A small group of people start a support system and it grows from there. Events along the way of course and an amazing ending. Gripping from start to finish. The highlight is the gorgeous orange bus - watch for it and Bronski Beat at the concert - amazing (yes I know it isn't the real one but it is still a wow moment - I lived through the 80's)",/review/rw3080354/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2014,Red_Identity,," Fantastic
","It really is a shame that this film didn't get more of a campaign behind it. Someone here mentioned weeks ago how it could've easily been a big awards contender had it had some sort of campaign, and that's absolutely true. It's a pretty accessible, pretty feel-good film that absolutely rides on how well the audience takes to it, and while this is usually not at all the kind of film that I take to very much, I thought it was one of the most pleasant surprises of the year, and one of the most entertaining. It's pretty incredibly written on all fronts, with a large but impressive ensemble. The film manages to really find a great balance between how many characters' stories to show and just how much to show of them, being able to give enough of an insight into an impressively amount of characters as to have a great emotional impact. Truly fantastic film, deserved a lot more recognition.",/review/rw3080354/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2014,robert-downing1-1,10," Brilliant but, sadly so true to the events portrayed
","I lived a few miles from the community shown in the film. It was a hard winter and we had nothing but respect for the people of the area, especially the women who kept up spirits and organised food and clothes for their families. They were a very proud group so to accept handouts took a huge amount of courage. I remember giving as best I could and the furore caused by the established press over the funds from London. This film probably goes as close as it is possible to capture the events of the LGSM & the South Wales miners' communities. Congratulations to the makers for telling a worthwhile story so well; and thank you for remembering the spirit of Paul Robeson. While, in many people's opinion, Thatcher destroyed the mining communities people like those portrayed in 'Pride' built self-esteem, supported those in need, change attitudes and politics. Knowing the events and the people shown, I can honestly say nothing in this film is exaggerated. Brilliant, utterly brilliant.",/review/rw3080354/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2015,t-dooley-69-386916,9," Enjoyable story of Solidarity and gay rights.
","This is the telling of a forgotten part of the story that took place during the Miners Strike of 1984 – 85. Thatcher was out to crush the miners and the National Union of Mineworkers; she encouraged the 'me' generation and painted caring and unions as somehow dirty and evil. I did as much as I could to support the miners and went on more demos than I can remember as well as giving half my wages to the cause – every week, plus what ever else I could raise.",/review/rw3080354/?ref_=tt_urv
2 May 2017,jrarichards,8," Inevitably-one-sided but persuasive telling of a quite amazing true story
","I watched the Matthew Warchus-Stephen Beresford offering ""Pride"" just days after media heralded the first week in centuries in which the UK engaged in no large-scale power generation from coal. I use the word ""heralded"", since - while there were many references to that being ""historic"", it was hard to see much regret. Today, coal is viewed as a dirty source of CO2. The fact that we might someday need some for strategic purposes - just in case - seems wrongly skimmed over, but should we really mourn the passing of coal as main everyday fuel?

30 January 2015,maxdaddytj,10," Best movie of 2014!
","OK, being gay and from that time, perhaps that does color my impressions, but it was still an amazingly great movie! Wish it had done more in the big-time awards, but the BAFTA isn't small beerish. Imelda Staunton may be the biggest name, and as always, she never disappoints. People may say it glosses over and does ""feel good"" but having your parents toss you out into the street, or having explosives thrown into one's store/office isn't really feel good. Nor is that snide, self-righteous television clip of Thatcher saying she can't change her style. Nary a bad performance or heavy-handed move therein. Beautifully photographed. Some of those lads, oh, you just want to take them home (and I mean that in a nice way!) The women of the town - love them, especially Sian! (And fun to red what Sian really did with her life - in real life!) Dominic West's (Jonathan's) ""Shame, Shame, Shame"" scene is worth the price of admission alone. A must see.",/review/rw3080354/?ref_=tt_urv

",A wonderful movie that made me think and laugh. It also made me cry and I am a heterosexual 50-something male who never shows public emotion!
