20 September 2019,Wililjam,6," The best thing about the movie are the interviews....
",".... unfortunately, the movie lacks interviews. The plot of this movie is simple and kind of boring, not going to lie about that. What makes it watchable and funny are the interviews as well as the blooper reel at the end, other than that there's basically nothing funny about the movie.",/review/rw5488619/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2019,mark-23851,6," Credit outtakes almost make up for rest of movie
",It was watchable and had a few humorous moments throughout but I laughed much more during the credit outtakes than during any other part of the film. They probably should have just rolled that for 90 minutes.,/review/rw5488619/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2019,Floated2,6," Enjoyable but not great
",Was thinking that the main premise of the film would have more interviews than a typical plot. Though it's a short film and there are some decent moments but not everything is funny. The interviews with the celebrities were roughly short and possibly the best part of the film. The bloopers at the end were good too.,/review/rw5488619/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2019,rising-down,5," All we wanted was just the interviews
","Meh, the movie was okay-ish, mostly because Zach Galifianakis is hilarious as expected, but the movie itself is sort of rubbish and forced.The interviews - the heart of the whole idea - come way too short. Why Netflix just didn't opt to do a miniseries consisting of 10 interviews, 10 minutes each is beyond me. It would have been a major hit.",/review/rw5488619/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2019,gideonzack,8," Simple and Funny...Zach is good.
",I enjoyed it. Was funny for the most part. They cut short some of the celeb interviews but overall I found it funny. People need to keep in mind that this is the driest humor you'll encounter besides Larry David.,/review/rw5488619/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2019,bestford,5," Okish
",It was ok. Considering it has a lot of star cameos I would have expected more. Some LOL moments but not enough to consider it anymore than mediocre.,/review/rw5488619/?ref_=tt_urv

20 September 2019,Dev1999,," What it needs to be, and a lot of it.
","Between Two Ferns: The Movie.
That's precisely the title, and you clicked on the thing, so what did y'all expect? A transcendental study of body and mind? Jesus, simply have some fun for once with an innocent little flick like this. Just my opinion. Personally, and it's cool if you disagree of course, this was everything I wanted and even a bit more. I did not think I would laugh pretty much all the way through one bit, but I sure did. You can totally see the fun they had on set and that decidedly benefitted the movie. Even Will Ferrell had a few hilarious lines, and I close to never think he's actually funny. Jake Gyllenhaal got a shout-out that worked so well 'cause of a good Between Two Ferns inside joke. Paul Rudd couldn't even fully pretend to be serious because he was having so much fun. Benedict Cumberbatch.
This very solid flick obviously does nothing to reinvent comedy or challenge the arts, but it's so entertaining and does what it needed to do, and I'm sure some jokes will stick with me for a long time. And the bloopers are flawless, by the way.",/review/rw5488619/?ref_=tt_urv

",7 ? Hehehehe. Maybe it's the wine but Hehehehe. No it's all the wine. This review is zero help.,/review/rw5488619/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2019,bubbasumo-294-65311,4," Skip to the end
","The end credits are the funniest part. If you just skip all the ""movie"" parts and watch the 2 minute interviews you'll be better off.",/review/rw5488619/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2019,elliotjeory,5," Lost potential
",The interviews were funny. The rest of the film wasn't. If you fast forward to the interviews it will be a short funny film. Some good cameos.,/review/rw5488619/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2019,farik23,6," Did not live up to the expectations, but still pretty fun.
","Long time fan of the original show online and had high hopes for this after the trailer. The story and some jokes seemed really predictable, but they were still fun nonetheless. The run time of only 75 minutes helps the movie not get boring as it is paced pretty fast. The celebrity interactions are the strongest point imo, but they felt rushed because of the fact that each celebrity was there for like 2 minutes at a time.",/review/rw5488619/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2019,shanayneigh,2," Skip the movie and watch the end credits
","They were probably hoping to churn out a new Borat type movie, but it resembled more a new Action Point (2019). An excuse to drag a skit out to an 80 minute movie. I gave it almost 15 minutes, but then I started skipping the boring connective tissue between the celebrity interviews. It surely didn't help that this was the third (!) miss on Netflix on the same evening for me.",/review/rw5488619/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2019,Rob-O-Cop,3," A hard slog without cracking a smile
","Is this what passes for funny these days?
It's just not nearly as clever as it thinks it is, and it's really mean spirited with no real pay off for that meanness.
I know Zack's supposed to be a comic genius but it's the same joke over and over and if it was ever funny the first time it sure isn't now. He needs to be unemployed of come up with something new. This isn't cutting it at all.",/review/rw5488619/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2019,louis_southwood,3," A complete waste of time
","When it was announced only a couple of weeks ago, I was surprised to say the least that they were adapting a satirical talk show of the internet into a movie. I've always been a huge fan of the web show and always found the writing and humour to be really witty and funny. The same can not be said for the movie, which was just plain not funny and a complete waste of time unfortunately.",/review/rw5488619/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2019,jamesraymondwallace,3," Must be American humour....
",When the bloopers at the end of the movie are funnier than the movie itself you know its bad great actors wasted 3 stars for the bloopers because they actually made me laugh.......,/review/rw5488619/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2019,jtindahouse,5," Terrible cast with no plot makes this a disappointment
","Zach Galifianakis is a bit of an anomaly to me. He can be absolutely hilarious in a movie, or he can be atrociously unfunny. And the key to which isn't usually the writing, it's the supporting cast. In 'The Hangover' for example (and don't get me wrong that movie did have fantastic writing) he was acting with not only brilliant actors, but actors who knew how to work off him. In 'Between Two Ferns: The Movie' the cast he is given to work with on the road trip section of the story is about is as bad as they come.",/review/rw5488619/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2021,doomedmac,7," It's really funny...
",I don't really understand the negative reviews. This movie made me laugh out loud multiple times. It's actually good.,/review/rw5488619/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2019,cardsrock,6," Should've shown more of the interviews
","I don't know why the interviews, the entire reason people care about Between Two Ferns: The Movie, took such a backseat to the story in this film. The story is pretty paper thin and stretched well beyond its limits. The interviews are great as expected, but the comedy in the rest of the movie is pretty hit or miss. I just want to see celebrities making fun of each other, not all this other crap.",/review/rw5488619/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2019,rehmankhilji,4," Below Expectations
","Yes was expecting a lot and a whole lot of comedy, but was not up to the mark. Except for the roasting of celebrities, very ordinary comedy, with really not much of laughs.
Could have been better in many ways.",/review/rw5488619/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2019,bwallarab,2," So very bad
","This is what happens when a company like Netflix makes a greedy money grab. The original ""Between Two Ferns"" productions for Funny Or Die are hilarious and brilliant, allowing Galifanakis to shine as a true come genius. The Netflix movie is simply awful, the only bright moments being when Galifanakis simply recreates the BTF set pieces. The casting, acting, writing,and direction of the connecting material is so far beneath the source material, it is virtually impossible to watch. Stick with the original source material and skip this embarrassing mess.",/review/rw5488619/?ref_=tt_urv

",I thought it was great! Well written and very witty. I especially liked the outtakes during the credits. There needs to more episodes of Between Two Ferns made and released asap please.,/review/rw5488619/?ref_=tt_urv

",The film is filled with the most popular A-list stars and totally meets my expectations since the show debuted over 10 years ago!,/review/rw5488619/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2020,kosmasp,8," Fern-tastic
","Did you like the Funny or Die skits? Well imagine how a movie would look like ... then again, this might not be easy to imagine. It is crazy and it is ""behind the scenes"". And it is supposedly real life - but that is the essence of the original too. So if you are a fan of the show, you'll like this too. As quirky, crazy and out there as it can be.",/review/rw5488619/?ref_=tt_urv
