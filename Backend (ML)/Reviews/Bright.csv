22 January 2019,brentstansfield,7," So far, so Good!
","I've got to give it up to Canadian Television. More and more great shows are coming from our northern neighbors. This show, while I only have watched 3 episodes, leaves me wanting to see whats next. I like that the actor's are relatively unknown, at least to me, and they are all good. No overacting, seamless transitions form scene to scene, like the header says, so far, it's a good show. I always wait until I've seen at least 3 episodes before I write one of these. I wish others would do the same, I've seen reviews, both good and bad, sometimes posted before the air date. Please, if you have had a viewing of the first episode before the rest of us, please don't base your review on one episode. Just my humble opinion.",/review/rw4631054/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2021,rchrdcorteel1,5," Season 3 a big let down
","Seasons 1 and 2 were good. But season 3 is a major step backwards. There are weak story lines: too much time spent on the coroner's messed up psyche. Her personal life was a small, continuous part of seasons 1 and 2, but is now the major component of every episode in season 3. Hard to be very enthusiastic about this series now. Pity.",/review/rw4631054/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2021,pontram,," Very likeable counterpart to....currently everything
","It's more of a quiet show. Not much action, more insightful to peoples' lives and deaths. A bit mysterious, sometimes. But not depressing or sad. Some melancholia. I think we need such shows apart from the big fates and adventorous marvels. It is just wonderful. Season 2 was overdramtized, so many things happened, it was a bit too nail biting (but also bold). Season three is more calm, and some could call it boring, especially since there are covid-masks everywhere, which I appreciate. We shouldn't deny what we live. There is a fine line between calmness and boredom, well balanced through season 1, strongly avoided in Season 2. I still hold Coroner very dear and I am thankful that it got three seasons. Hopefully, someone makes the right decision and gives it a fourth one. The chemistry between Seinda Swan (Jenny) and Roger Cross (Donovan) is very good.",/review/rw4631054/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2020,Tellyvixen,3," Too much drama
","The first problem with this show is that they focus way too much on Jenny Cooper personal life. Every person in her personal life, her father, her son, her dead husband and her new boyfriend are or were self destructing in some way. And her mental health issues they are depicting. I don't actually know how she is able to do the work she needs to as, those psychological problems are debilitating.",/review/rw4631054/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2020,lyndavanleeuwen,5," No normal people!
","Every character has so many psychotic episodes, it is exhausting to watch! I keep wanting to understand when someone would join reality! Such complicated situations really strain my endurance! I can see a plot with the occasional character sorting out their issues, but everyone with psychosis is over the top!",/review/rw4631054/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2019,Nikar4,4," Inconsistent at best
",I loved Roger Cross in Dark Matter so when I heard he was in this I decided to check it out. The trailer implied this would be the quality of Silent Witness unfortunately it doesn't live up to this at all.,/review/rw4631054/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2020,lyndavanleeuwen,5," So many personality issues!!
","We've watched every episode and although we're not giving up on it, so many characters with psychotic thoughts & responses is really unnerving!! Seriously, no one can handle their own lives let alone their job because their minds are unable to cope because of their history! It's like an entire cast of sick people who need medication to cope! I can't see how anything can be resolved, when they all leave in bizarre nether worlds!",/review/rw4631054/?ref_=tt_urv
27 August 2021,sebcaron,5," Not a bad show but...
","First of all, the title is a bit misleading. I was thinking it was going to be something like CSI or Criminal Minds but that's much more of a drama show around character's personnal lives. So don't expect it to be a canadian CSI because it's clearly not!",/review/rw4631054/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2019,ZinQ,4," It's OK.

19 September 2022,Kaleecee,5," Okay, but gosh.... (updated after into S4)
","I started watching this from the beginning after it was into it's 4th season. I liked it in the beginning, but it has gotten to the point that every single character has to deal with severe mental issues. I understand hitting on mental health, but this is a bit extreme. Some plots are so over the top! It would sure seem that if a coroner had this extreme mental issues, they would not be allowed to work and all cases would be under scrutiny.",/review/rw4631054/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2019,tkaine3,5," I expected this series to fly high but it turns out to fall very flat
","""Coroner"" 5/10 ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
I dated a woman who passed away that could've been the doppelganger for Serinda Swan. So the first time I saw her on a episode of ""Chicago Fire"" I immediately became a fan. She's a very talented actress and I have no qualms about the cast for ""Coroner"" but just from judging the pilot I didn't watch anything that would give me the urge to wanna see more episodes. It came across very predictable and kinda boring. I also felt some scenes were kinda awkward like when her son is giving her a shoulder massage, or when she was crying and the detective just starts singing in her passenger seat instead of asking her if she's Ok. Maybe the next episode will pick up some steam but if she's a coroner it seems very odd to watch her also play detective talking to various people who knew or were related to the victim. So for that reason I give it a 5, It could of been worse but it also could've been a lot better.",/review/rw4631054/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2019,Camsteary,8," Enjoyable watch
","For those who thought the show was unrealistic because she was able to finish med school with a young child, episode 7 addresses that. I was disappointed, but not surprised by reviewers who somehow thought that because the lead character has mental health issues she is weak and incapable of doing her job. Mental health issues are not caused by weakness. This is why so many people who are struggling hide their issues which leads to more negative outcomes. This is also why we need more shows like these that show people living their lives, while also dealing with mental health issues. I am an avid fan of mysteries and police procedurals and this did not disappoint, while also displaying characters i found likeable and could identify with",/review/rw4631054/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2019,annmoore,1," Grey and Depressing
","I have rarely, if ever, stopped watching a TV programme half way through without giving it a chance to draw me in but this was so grey and depressing that I couldn't get past thirty minutes. Maybe the premise of exploring the protagonist's personal (car crash) life instead of the stories and investigation around the victims is interesting for some viewers, but not me. This is more like a soap opera than a 'crime and investigation' series despite what the title suggests. Disappointing.",/review/rw4631054/?ref_=tt_urv

23 January 2019,phylicia1,7," I've seen way worse
",I'm glad I don't judge things by other people's opinions. Now IMDb is my Bible and most of user reviews are spot on...but the people giving below 5...come on..it's a solid 6.5. And that's after the first episode everyone said was so awful. If you haven't seen it...give it a chance.,/review/rw4631054/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2019,imdbbaz,8," Not disappointing at all
","This series is turning out to be quite gripping, and I'm already hoping that a second season is in prospect. The CBC can be a little timid about renewing its drama shows (the excellent ""This Life"" was cancelled after just two seasons), but this one deserves better. Contrary to an earlier opinion on this site (I strongly suspect that, when a reviewer starts off a negative comment about gay characters with the phrase ""I'm not homophobic, but..."", he very probably is just that), it's good to see that Jenny Cooper's son is not merely your everyday moody teenager. His being gay is another thing that she has had to accept in her life (quite successfully in this case, it would seem), and I don't see how showing him in a caring relationship can be objectionable. The number of television shows down the years in which non-heterosexual characters were simply non-existent far outweighs the number, at present, in which they are shown to be part of the world. All that said, it does seem up to this point that Jenny spends more time outside of her lab than any other coroner in memory...",/review/rw4631054/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2019,Ed-Shullivan,7," Both awkward and intriguing, a little bit rushed, and a little bit slow
",I always thought coroners worked within the confines of a municipal building and were old and tired civic employees who could not wait for their eight (8) hour shift to end. In the case of this very young and attractive coroner named Dr. Jenny Cooper (played by Serinda Swan) she works both day and night and acts more like an investigator/counsellor than a bored coroner.,/review/rw4631054/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2022,Avidviewer-02847,4," It should be called Jenny Coopers depressing life.
","This is a Canadian series and like a lot of their TV series, it misses the mark. The scripts aren't good, plots bog down and it becomes boring and depressing. I'm really not interested in Jenny the coroner's personal life, but it seems to be the obsession of the writers. I haven't seen every episode, but enough over their 4 seasons and it hasn't improved.",/review/rw4631054/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2020,tabre3,8," Realistic, raw and poignant
","I love this show! People say it's slow- developing great characters takes time, to get to know and care about them, their intricacies. Do we always need fast-talking, high octane, complicated drama to interest us? Are we that shallow? This show focuses more deeply on the characters than the coroner aspect, which is more of a secondary character. I appreciate that. There are plenty of investigative cop dramas if all you want is the violence, and blood & guts. Or the disconnected scientists. This is a coroner with real compassion for the victims and a motivation to find the truth for them. And on a side note, I am amazed in a world where everyone wants to advocate for mental health, senior health, veteran rights, racial equality, etc, that people will complain when a show decides to tackle these issues in a real manner. Who don't want to acknowledge that families are messy and can be dealing with more than one chronic issue at a time. Because the truth is that all of us struggle, we fumble, we try our best to figure it out and love each other in spite of it. I believe this show speaks to that and I am glad I found it. I look forward to it every week and hope it lasts for a long while!",/review/rw4631054/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2021,cdeanroane,5," Another show from the CBC less then great!
",You would think by the name this show would deal more with the her investigating deaths. That is more like a footnote in this show as once again the CBC crammed in as family drama as they could squeeze in. Like most CBC shows this one is again aimed at making someone think that there is no racial bias in Canada and even put a good role in for some First Nation people. To be even more politically correct she has a gay son and the detective she works with is black. All getting along in perfect harmony. If you were hoping for something like Quincy ME or Body of Proof then you will be disappointed in this show.,/review/rw4631054/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2021,davek28,7," Well done in the face of the pandemic
","Just finished episode 1 of the third season and I have to admire their determination to keep going regardless of Covid. Season 2 got a bit crazy with just about everyone losing their minds.

I've watched all 5 available episodes and some parts are just, hm i don't know, a bit much?
But I enjoyed it. But before i did that, i did research on reviews and youtube comments and saw negative comments...
