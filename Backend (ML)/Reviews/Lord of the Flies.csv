20 March 2011,DICK STEEL,8," A Nutshell Review: The Man From Nowhere
","You may want to compare this with, or see shades of the film from the likes of Luc Besson's The Professional, Pierre Morel's Taken and Tony Scott's Man on Fire, with the common running theme of a highly skilled operative taking it upon himself to rescue someone they love from the clutches of devious villains, and executing a brand of vengeance without remorse as he ploughs through and single-handedly demolishes all who stand in his way. The Man From Nowhere is South Korea's answer to this sub-genre, and does so with aplomb both in providing that emotional punch to the highly choreographed set action pieces.",/review/rw2455809/?ref_=tt_urv

22 March 2020,kosmasp,9," Not from nowhere
","But from Korea! A movie haven (and heaven some might argue) for a lot of genre movies. Many of them on the violent side. Which means you should not be easily frightened or squeamish. This has a story and for some it may take a bit too long to get going, but I'd argue it is the right amount of time and it had to take its time to breathe.",/review/rw2455809/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2010,KineticSeoul,8," A better version of ""Man on Fire""
","When I first saw the trailer to this movie, I wanted to go see it but wasn't like super hyped up for it. It basically looked like the Korean version of ""LEON: The Professional"". But this movie is like the Korean version of ""Man on Fire"" with fight sequences that are similar to the ""Bourne"" movies. I heard this film really skyrocketed Won Bin's popularity, especially in Korea and I could tell why. He really is a badass in this movie and his charisma is overflowing in this movie. One of the girl in the audience couldn't help but say ""he is so cool"" in Korean during the scene where Won Bin's character is driving angrily while on the phone with the bad guys while showing some intimidating emotion. The plot isn't super original or anything, basically ""Man on Fire"" with a better flow and more dark and gritty with better action in my opinion. Overall this film was a lot better than I expected and also kept my interest from beginning to end while also being entertained. The style of this movie reminded me of ""A Bittersweet Life"" in a good way which is a plus with saturated colors leaning towards the dark and blue. Some people might get a bit irritated by the constant camera shot to Won Bin's face while he takes a pose like in some magazine or something. But I could tell it's to sell the movie to female viewers as well. Excellent casting, pretty good story with some slick action scenes make this movie really worth seeing, there is something for guys and girls.",/review/rw2455809/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2010,5h4d0w,9," Another fantastic thriller/drama brought to us by South Korea
","Let me start off by saying that I was skeptical whether I should watch this movie because of all the comparisons here to US productions. Because while I did enjoy most of the ones named, not enough to want to see a basically South Korean copycat at the theater.",/review/rw2455809/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2011,jon503,9," Standard story, but superbly executed
","""This Man"" is about as standard plot-wise as action movies get. A lone wolf type takes a little girl under his wing, the kid gets kidnapped, and he ends up having to go through heaps of bad guys in his quest to save the girl. ",/review/rw2455809/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2011,frasif00,9," Another adrenaline rush explosive thriller from the koreans
","Korean thriller makers are making a splendid job now-a-days, they have even succeeded the Hollywood thriller makers in this specific genre..The Man from Nowhere' is a perfect example of this. Anyone might think this is a mix of 'Leon:The Professional' and 'Man on Fire' where a highly trained but troubled person tries to protect a child, but this movie is more than that.There are many short but strong stories nicely fabricated that will keep You watching the total movie in a rush! Now come to the story. A mystery man with no past links suddenly becomes involved in a drug transport because of a child being kidnapped and unfortunately that child was the only link of him to the outerworld .So had to comeout from his own hideout and save the girl and find out the persons behind it. He has to defy the police as they are after it too, at a point the sad past life comes to daylight and it was well understood about his strange behavior of everything. This rouge so renegades the force and takes the action by his own. The stylish BOURNE looking action scenes specially needs to be appreciated.But I m not giving it the highest rating only its lacking of showing the touchy emotions in the best way..it was excess .Silence play a better role than words in some situations, it needed that. But the overall movie was simply sublime.reasonable violence was shown here..it was logical. Some funny characters and parts are nicely putted into, that enhanced the color and variety of the movie. But I am getting addicted to this korean thrillers."" Memories of a murder', ""Joint security Area', Vengeance trilogy( including OLDBOY), Infernal Affairs trilogy, 'The Chaser','Thirst','The Bittersweetness of Life', 'I Saw The Devil'..the serial is getting longer and longer..keep it up !!",/review/rw2455809/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2013,A_Different_Drummer,10," Brilliant .. Hollywood version is a lock... but this is the one to see
","You have to remember that there is a school of thought that suggests that martial arts were invented in Korea. Whether you buy that premise or not, you can be assured they take their action movies seriously. On paper the notion of a mysterious pawnbroker with an unknown past, who just wants to be left alone, who befriends the child of a local party-girl .. well, it does not prepare you for this adventure. In truth, this film has more in common with Matt Damon as Bourne than any other recent American film I can think of. He is polite, he is pleasant, but you push this guy the wrong way and, bang, the bodies just start to pile up. No question some B-level Hollywood shop will go for the fast dollar and do a remake. But this will always be the one to watch. **Updated May 2015 ** In 2013, I said the Hollywood version was a lock. I was right. It was called The Equalizer and starred Denzel Washington. It was a combination of this story and the old TV series of the same name. In the final scene of this US version (which many missed) the writers left the door open for a sequel or even a franchise, which appears to have been greenlighted as I pen these words. And I was right about something else -- this version is still better. See it. ****",/review/rw2455809/?ref_=tt_urv

23 August 2010,bearofspades,9," Violent yet touching.
","This movie threatens to be a run-of-the-mill action movie, but manages to create its own identity. The sameness is how it shows most of its bad guys, and there are plenty, as one dimensionally evil. There are children who are put in harm's way, but not gratuitously--for the most part--providing the hero with a chance to be human.",/review/rw2455809/?ref_=tt_urv

","Essentially an Asian variant on the Liam Neeson hit TAKEN, THE MAN FROM NOWHERE sees a quiet man driven to violence when a child neighbour is kidnapped by a drugs gang. South Korea is gathering a reputation for making some of the toughest and best thrillers of the last decade (I'd previously watched, and loved, THE CHASER, so I had some idea of what to expect here) and this is another triumph.",/review/rw2455809/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,10," It doesn't get much better than this.
","Korean cinema has always impressed me, and rivals even Bollywood films that try their best (that conveniently made a poor knock-off version of this film). There needs to be a Korean Bollywood category for such iconic films; perhaps Koreallywood? It's an action movie with a heartwarming story, and it's a near perfect film. What's even more impressive, is that this was the second-only writing and directing credit for newb Korean filmmaker Jeong-beom Lee. Lee needs to be teaching film schools in Hollywood, because this is how a film should be made. This shames most Hollywood action films by seasoned filmmakers. The pacing is perfect, so the 2 hour runtime flies by. Every scene is perfectly captured with excellent cinematography. There's a perfect balance of the excellent choreographed action scenes, and the narratives that unfold along the way. Even the score and soundtrack were on point. All casting and performances were spot-on, and Lee was phenomenal in directing his cast, even the young ones. This film was recommended to me by another prolific IMDb reviewer in his 100 must-see films of all time. An excellent recommendation that I agree with. Newb filmmaker Lee is a genius, and this gem is a perfect 10/10 from me.",/review/rw2455809/?ref_=tt_urv

","The Man From Nowhere is an unexpected movie that fits well with action sequences and emotional tone. The performances and friendship of both Won Bin and Kim She-ron are perfect. The story is well made, while the finale was so sad that I wouldn't spoil it. Despite this movie has similar connections to other past and future action movies, this particular movie fits the bill. Overall, The Man From Nowhere is a perfect example of an action thriller movie.",/review/rw2455809/?ref_=tt_urv

","In South Korea, Cha Tae-sik (Bin Won) is the lonely and quiet owner of a pawnshop. His only friend is the girl Somee Jung (Sae-ron Kim), who leaves on the floor below with her reckless addicted mother Hyo-jeong (Hyo-seo Kim) that is a dancer in a nightclub. When Hyo steals a load of drug that belongs to the Chinese trafficker lord Mr. Oh Myng Kyu (Young- chang Song), she hides the drug in a camera case and pawns it in Tae- sik's pawnshop. But soon the drug dealers Jong Suk (Seong-oh Kim) and his brother Man Suk (Hee-won Kim) discover that Hyo has stolen the drugs and they abduct Somee and Hyo to force her to tell where the drug is. Then the criminals use them to force Tae-sik to deliver the drug to Mr. Oh, promising to release Somee and Hyo after his assignment is accomplished. However, Jong and Man have called the police and are using Tae-sik to eliminate Mr. Oh, who is their rival. When Tae-sik finds the real intention of the brothers and the body of Hyo without her organs in the trunk of his car, he realizes that Somee is in danger and that Jong and Man Suk are not only drug dealers, but also organ traffickers. But what the criminals do not know is that Tae-sik is skilled and dangerous ex-special agent with a trauma in his past and that he will do anything to save Somee. Will he succeed?

16 July 2012,estebangonzalez10,9," Korean Films on the Rise
","¨ You live only for tomorrow. I only live for today.¨ Korean films have been making a lot of noise in the past decade and many critics believe that they are making the best films at the moment as well. I only had the opportunity to watch The Host and Oldboy before getting around to watching The Man from Nowhere (Ajeossi). Oldboy is considered by many as one of the best all time Korean films, but I wasn't too overwhelmed by it. I thought it was good, but not enough to get me interested in Korean films. The same thing happened with The Host, but now I that I've seen The Man from Nowhere directed by Jeong-beom Lee I want to see more. I really loved this movie and thought it was great. It was a character driven action film with some powerful scenes and a memorable lead performance by Bin Won (who also worked in Mother, another successful Korean film). This film reminded me a lot of a couple of Western films like Man on Fire and Taken, but with the extra ingredient of being from Korea so you would expect better fight scenes and a much darker tone. The film is very dark at times and violent, but it also has interesting characters and a gripping story. The story isn't original, we've seen it before many times, but the mood of the film and the lead performance are what make it so entertaining. This movie had it all. My only complaint was that the melodrama was a bit over the top. There were a couple dramatic scenes that didn't work too well, but the spectacular fighting scenes made up for it. This movie was better than I expected and loved it much more than the other Korean films I had seen. Now I just want to watch more.",/review/rw2455809/?ref_=tt_urv

4 July 2011,BlissQuest,9," Korean Film: Now a force to be reckoned with
","A spectacular performance by the the lead character, supported by a moving performance by an upcoming sweet youngster. My case is not one who saw this film expecting a so-so reward, at best. No. I have seen a few other Korean films in the past and had an idea of what I was getting into, though not specifically. I will simply say I got my money's worth, though I must confess I saw it online (streamed, legally) for close to nothing. But if I had paid full price for it at a theater, my time and money would have been well spent. I wont go into a summary or synopsis, since that'll only lead to spoilers, and besides, I expect the reader would have read the lead summary anyway. All I'll say is the key attribute of this film is its unique ability to elicit emotions across the spectrum, at any given time, and at the turn of a dime. Film buffs/aficionados will acknowledge such a task, on the part of a director, is by no means easy. Watch the film, if you haven't already done so, and recall my point when a Korean speaking actor responds (in English, with one word) to an English speaking actor in the car.",/review/rw2455809/?ref_=tt_urv
