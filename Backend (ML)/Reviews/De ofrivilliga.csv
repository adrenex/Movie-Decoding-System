23 August 1999,didi-5,," There must be an angel ...
","I approached this film after reading the hype and controversy surrounding its making and release, not really expecting very much.  Surprised to find it an intelligent, beautifully-filmed, engrossing and touching thriller. I'd recommend it to anyone who has a fondness for weird gothic mythological stories.  I didn't find the horror aspect overdone - in fact it was believable, and the script was superior to other films of this genre I've seen.  As for Brandon Lee, this really was a superb performance and it is a terrible tragedy that his life ended so abruptly.  This film is a fitting memorial to what could have become a major star.",/review/rw6108651/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2015,BA_Harrison,8," R.I.P. Brandon
","Based on the comic book created by James O'Barr. The Crow stars Brandon Lee as rock star Eric Draven, who, precisely one year after his murder, returns from the grave to take revenge on the vicious criminals responsible for the rape and death of his fiancée and his own untimely demise.",/review/rw6108651/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2005,callanvass,10," One Amazing Film, With A Mezmerizing Performance From Brandon Lee!
","This is one amazing film, with a mesmerizing performance from Brandon Lee!. It's visually appealing, extremely well made, with amazing performances all around!. Loved the score, too, it fit with the film well, and there's plenty of action to go around as well. Michael Wincott is, very menacing as the main villain, and was perfect for the part. The flashbacks were very cool, however i wished, i could see more of Shelley's character. The Directiing is outstanding!. Alex Proyas does an outstanding job here, creating lots of, dark atmosphere, great use of the rain machine,cool visuals, and keeping the pace,action packed, and engrossing all the way!. The film is very violent, but not all of it is bloody. We get several knives in the chest, knife in the hand, lots of gunshot wounds, some bloody, some not, hole through hand, 2 slashings, slit throat,2 bloody impallings, sword in the neck and a crow pecks a girls eyes out. The Acting is WONDERFUL!. Brandon Lee, gives an Oscar worthy performance here, he is completely mesmerizing, creepy,kicks that ass and, just thought he was too cool, his AMAZING AMAZING performance here, will always be remembered, what happened too him was a tragedy, and i for one will never forget him!. Rochelle Davis is awesome here, and is very likable,her and Brandon, had very good chemistry and is one of the best kid actors out there!, especially since she hasn't acted since then!. Ernie Hudson, is terrific as the Sgt., very likable, and very convincing. Michael Wincott, is great as the main villain, i loved his voice, and he was very menacing!. Sofia Shinas, is very good as Shelley, however, she didn't have much screen time, but was great when on screen. Overall a MUST SEE at all costs!. ***** out of 5",/review/rw6108651/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2019,Calicodreamin,8," The crow slays Halloween
",The crow was quite amazing. A man comes back to life to serve vigilante justice on the men who raped and murdered his fiancé (and threw him out a window). Vengeance is served with gruesome takedowns and poetic justice as the crow and his walking corpse tear up the town. The cinematography is actually kind of beautiful its dark and ominous tone. The storyline flows well and the characters well developed. A killer Halloween tale.,/review/rw6108651/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2005,Sean68,10," the best Gothic comic book movie ever made
","This movie is fantastic. plain and simple. Brandon Lee delivers his lines to the point they were instantly memorable after seeing the film only once. The casting of both Michael Wincott and Tony Todd was inspired as these two guys have two of the most instantly recognisable voices in the movie industry. If i could ever be a movie or a lead in a film this would be it. I was initially put off the idea of the movie as i am a big fan of the graphic novel and there was an awful lot of hype around this film on its release. this proved to be my loss as i have only seen the film on the small screen. however i now have the 2 disc special edition DVD and watched it 3 times in succession the day i bought it and must have watched it at least 100 times since. my own personal opinion is that a movie should suspend disbelief, capture the imagination which this does in spades. it is truly a film that you can lose a couple of hours watching and at the end feel like you have spent a worthwhile couple of hours. would recommend this to anybody.",/review/rw6108651/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2016,Leofwine_draca,6," More a romance than revenge movie
","At first glance, THE CROW seems to be just another revenge saga, with an added goth twist to appeal to fans of KISS and Marilyn Manson. Thankfully I was mistaken, because this is an emotional roller-coaster of a movie that is both fun and moving, violent yet sensitive. It certainly strikes the viewer as a film in which opposing values gel together quite brilliantly. And, whatever critics may say, it will always be a strangely unique movie, in which the tragedy of Lee's on-set death runs parallel to the death and rebirth of his screen character. As such the movie has a spooky, almost legendary air to it, a real one-off to a film. But Lee's death – although deeply upsetting – is not a good reason to watch this movie, having nothing to do with the film itself.",/review/rw6108651/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2001,uds3,," ""Suddenly I heard a tapping, as of someone gently rapping...at my chamber door""
","THE CROW, like 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY separates those who see from those who do not! (who CANNOT). Alex Proyas will never achieve anything close to this masterpiece again and if Brandon Lee HAD to die, then there could never have been a better time and place (do not misinterpret my words or meaning here). Personally, I shall for ever be indebted to him for what he has left...a performance in a film that challenges, implores, conjures, paints. A surreal landscape of good and evil in almost equal proportions.",/review/rw6108651/?ref_=tt_urv

",It's said that The Crow of all birds is the one charged with the special mission of bringing souls to heaven once they've departed this mortal coil. But when one soul leaves behind some business that really needs finishing The Crow can bring you back. Such is the premise of the film The Crow where Brandon Lee is brought back to the mortal coil on a vengeance quest.,/review/rw6108651/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2020,Ch4ndler_B1ng,10," One of the greatest comic book movies ever put on the big screen!
","This might be a very controversial thing to say, but I think that The Crow is one of the best films of 1994, it's after Pulp Fiction and Shawshank Redemption. One of the most tragic things about The Crow is that actor Brandon Lee died on set, he got shot in a scene that originally wasn't in the script, but was added last second. It was something that could've been easily prevented and the actor could have survived if the fire arm had been examined by the weapons examiner, except he was absent that day. It ended up having real bullets in the barrel and Lee ended up getting legitimately shot and dying during hospitilization. (Rest in peace.)",/review/rw6108651/?ref_=tt_urv

25 April 2020,BandSAboutMovies,7," Amazing!
","James O'Barr created The Crow as a way to deal with the death of his fiancee at the hands of a drunk driver. Today, we may know it more for the death of its lead actor Brandon Lee. Take it from someone who was 22 when the original film came out and had already been a fan of the comic - it was the perfect movie for its time, a capsule ready made to be looked back on as I am now old and have so many memories around this time.",/review/rw6108651/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2003,Neoromeo,," Melancholically beautiful comic book fantasy
","Comic book movies have always fascinated me. I don't whether it's their visual style, the special effects, the performances of the actors as compared to the comic itself or the interpretation of the graphic novel's storyline by the filmmakers that interests me the most, but I've always been enthralled by a bleak story that places a tragic hero in the midst of a towering city, whose choices and actions determine the fate of himself and those around him. Often a comic book can provide the bare essentials for an excellent story, but more often, the filmmakers or producers scrap the idea of a storyline and aim primarily for the explotation of special effects. In the case of ""The Crow,"" this is not true: this is the only film that has ever captured the true essence of the comic book it's based on, expanded upon its virtues and added its own style to complement the base storyline of the film.",/review/rw6108651/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2001,the_gray_reviewer,," The best comic book to film translation.
","The Crow is an excellent tragic film made even more tragic by the real life tragedies surrounding the film (Brandon Lee's death during filming, and the fact that the story is a result of James O'Barr's personal loss of his fiancée). Based on a very dark comic book, the film has the same dark feel. The movie does deviate from the comic book in some points, but in general is fairly faithful. If you can get it, I would recommend the DVD Collector's set with the 2 DVD version of The Crow (just to see the interview with James O'Barr is worth the price).",/review/rw6108651/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2005,yusandra79,10," The only thing...
","The only thing i can say is that when i left the movie theater then i had no comment to give... This movie got to me deep! I was 14 and now i am 25,and still i remember it so well and i still watch it sometimes.. Brandon Lee did a great job as an actor like everyone else, but the story about his death is totally insane, which made me worship the movie even more. What an irony. I like the movie cause it's dark, but also lighted up with true emotions..there is action, horror, love, even poetry for god sake! I have never seen so many genre's in one movie. Anyway for me it has been one of the best movies i have ever watched. And one more comment, lots of of other movies got ideas from The Crow, meaning the setting, the action, music, whatever it is the crow was their start up. I am not going to name them, Crow fans probably know what i am talking about.. My favorite quote: ""Can't rain all the time"" By the way the soundtrack's are awesome, The Cure's best song ever made is in it! P.S. The Crow II and III sucked, i hated it. They just ruined the conception of the first one.. totally..",/review/rw6108651/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2021,masonsaul,9," Incredible action thriller
","The Crow is an incredible action thriller that's fun, stylish, dark and emotional. Brandon Lee give an incredible lead performance, Ernie Hudson and Rochelle Davis are both great and Michael Wincott is a terrific villiain. Alex Proyas' direction is excellent, it's extremely well filmed and well paced. Despite some brief but poor visual effects, it holds up really well with great production design. The music by Graeme Revell is also great.",/review/rw6108651/?ref_=tt_urv

2 July 2018,classicsoncall,8," ""They're all dead. They just don't know it yet.""
","Fans of Gothic styled revenge dramas will appreciate ""The Crow"", a film achieving something like cult status with the tragic death of it's principal star during filming. Brandon Lee is appropriately cast as the enigmatic Eric Draven, returned from the dead to avenge the murder of his girlfriend as well as his own at the hands of thugs operating under the auspices of a crime lord who keeps an entire neighborhood under his sway. Lee is charismatic in the role, ghostly white face paint notwithstanding, which lends an aura of awe and fascination to his character. Unlike his famous father Bruce Lee, Brandon doesn't indulge in choreographed martial arts to seek his revenge, though he does achieve a level of creativity in the way he dispatches his victims, leaving a unique crow style calling card each time he exacts his retribution. The picture itself is dark and foreboding in keeping with it's theme, with the villains having such descriptive names as Tin Tin, Funboy, T-Bird and Skank. Interestingly, Eric Draven himself is never referred to as The Crow of the title, as that function is performed by a mysterious black bird that heralds Draven's appearances and serves as witness to the retribution that follows. The finale sees Eric dispatch the principal villain (Michael Wincott) by inducing thirty hours of pain with a self styled claw hold. Or was that actually a caw hold?",/review/rw6108651/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2019,Kirpianuscus,," a gem
","I saw it as a religious film . And as one of the best, behind the artistic virtues. The bitter poetry, the love, friendship and revenge, the science to give admirable occasion to Brandon Lee to propose a fascinating, great character. A Gothic story, old myths, the cathedral and the ring. And , sure, the crow. The cultural references and the perfect story. So. more than a good film. Maybe, just a great gem.",/review/rw6108651/?ref_=tt_urv

","Future flavours and concentrates abound for epic movies that would appear a decade or more later in various superhero franchise and still do. It's also riven by Noirish elements of some years precedent and consumes a significant measure of Goth/Punk music culture and stylisation e.g. The Sisters of Mercy, Siouxsie Sue, X-Ray Specs and Gene Loves Jezebel, none of which would have looked out of place on set.
