9 July 2020,G33KEd,9," The adult version of Regular Show. Perfect show!
","The creator of Regular Show, JG Quintel, has done it again with another great adult animated show produced by Cartoon Network Studios and made exclusively for HBO Max, 'Close Enough'!",/review/rw5894076/?ref_=tt_urv

1 July 2020,CartoonMan2020,10," Another Great JG Quintel Show!
","Funny writing, good voice acting, and good animation. JGQ proves that he can make shows for kids and adults alike with this fresh take on modern living. It's relatable, quirky, and super fun to watch.",/review/rw5894076/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2020,owen-watts,7," Millennial Surrealism
",I'm going to be in the minority of reviewers (and viewers) here I think by not having seen Quintel's Regular Show. So it wasn't until Close Enough that I first encountered his blend of magical surralism wrapped in acute observation.,/review/rw5894076/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2020,rjw-21547,8," Its got some potential
",I like J.G. Quitel and his amazing work in the animation industry but.... I'm gonna have to say it feel like it's own take on family guy just in the Regular Show style. I am a huge fan of Regular Show is in my top 3 next to Kipo and the age of wonderbeasts and One Punch man but if you want the full J.G. Quintel experience go watch Regular Show. Still a good show to watch to pass the time. That all being said I still got a few good laughs out of me and doesn't disappoint. So to know what you really think about this show go watch it.,/review/rw5894076/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2020,nasdagoodshepherd,9," It's About Time
","In early 2017, Regular Show finally came to conclusion on Cartoon Network and around the summer of 2017, JG Quintel made a new cartoon...for adults! Close Enough! It was originally planned to air on TBS, but for reasons it has been delayed lots of times, which led the show into production hell. But thanks to HBO Max, we won't have to worry anymore. HBO Max is the new home for Close Enough, I've watched the first episode (from the Annecy International Animated Film Festival on June 15, 2020) and it was pretty good. The humor, the characters, the writing were all good. Close Enough is one of those cartoons that truly fits very well in the box of adult animation, yet the only problem with this show is the 11 minute run, I was expecting it to be at least a 25 minute run, but hey, that's Close Enough. Get it?! I consider this show to be one of my favorites and I will recommend anyone to watch it and I also can't wait for more episodes on HBO Max. I give Close Enough a 9.5/10",/review/rw5894076/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2021,baumhenrik,8," Great show
",After we had so many cartoon shows releasing since the success of Rick & Morty that were more or less... Well how do I say... Meh.,/review/rw5894076/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2021,adampkalb,9," I think this is much more interesting than Regular Show. It is also the adult cartoon Regular Show could be if it wasn't on Cartoon Network.
","Regular Show an entertaining show most of the time with a lot of episodes, but...it was just a regular show. After learning about The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything, I wasn't sure if Regular Show actually promoted slackerist culture or not. Despite all the different animals and things in Regular Show, their world is very regular and the title is generic. Close Enough is...another regular show, probably even more regular than Regular Show because it focuses on humans instead of. A raccoon and a blue jay, but it has a more apt title. Josh and Emily strive to make a good life for Candice, their 5-year old daughter, and they need their divorced friends Alex and Bridgette to help them pay rent for a big apartment that Candice thought was a mansion in Sauceface. In some episodes, Josh makes some video games that we hope will sell one day, especially after the events of Clap Like This. Close Enough is a great spiritual successor to Regular Show, not because it can have more adult situations that Regular Show ever could, but because it has the same enticing formula in which a regular show could get into excitingly surreal situations. Close Enough came at the right time, for young adults who watched Regular Show as kids 10 years ago. Even kids who are two times Candice's age might enjoy Close Enough if they liked Regular Show, even though Close Enough is too old for them. The Singletons are not the best family, but they are close enough. I do not just watch Close Enough for human Mordecai and human Eileen, I also watch Close Enough for Kimiko Glenn because I absolutely adored her performances in DuckTales 2017 and Into the Spider-Verse.",/review/rw5894076/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2021,rubendh,8," Awesome
","Before starting, I must clarify that this is the second series that I observe thanks to a close friend's recommendation. After marathoning it in the last four days, it is clear to me that ""Close Enough"" is one of the best animated adult shows that has been released in the last year and I would dare to say that it can also be considered as one of several potential long-term hits for the newly launched HBO Max streaming service.",/review/rw5894076/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2020,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,8," Nicely done animated series.
",Close Enough has been licensed around the globe on Netflix: to be honest I didn't expect it to come outside the US for a good few years yet because HBO Max is an American exclusive platform as of this year. Thankfully the show's come out and it's what fans of Regular Show were waiting for: it's got the surreal humour alongside 'hard family sitcom' material akin to The Simpsons and Family Guy. JG Quintel is stretching his creative limbs like Adventure Time's Pendleton Ward did with The Midnight Gospel earlier this year. Close Enough is Regular Show's unconventional sequel and this universe is bound to get even bigger the next season.,/review/rw5894076/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2020,thejokerman-06860,8," Has a lot of potential
","Now I haven't seen regular show, but if it's anything like this I need to watch it. Close enough is an amazing show so far. Key word ""so far"" I would give this a nine because well, it's insanely funny, the animation is good and the characters are likeable. But I haven't seen enough of it to really get a good grasp of it.",/review/rw5894076/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2020,aidanratesmovies,9," Such Fun
","An incredibly delightful, fun, and entertaining follow up to one of my personal guilty pleasures- J.G. Quintel's new show Close Enough is a wonderful follow up to Regular Show and is surprisingly refreshing. The show is often absurd, but very humorous in its way of portraying it. For fans of stupid humor with a delightful modern day twist, this show is certainly for you, as the show is packed with tons of wacky and insane situations that seem to never let up. It does feel a little too meta at times, with its modern references sticking out like a sore thumb, but for the most part, the show is pretty consistent and holds itself together rather well. The animation is great as always, with a fun entertaining touch, and no element of the show feels underdeveloped or not used as much as it could have been. In the end, Close Enough isn't perfect, but it's very enjoyable and a very fun little adventure that I would certainly not mind seeing more of in the future.
My Rating: 9.25/10",/review/rw5894076/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2020,alexjaidane,8," Is it Regular Show? No, is it Close Enough... yeah I guess
","The show keeps reminding you that yey, you grew up with regular show, now you have hair in your balls, you can listen to no no words, social comentary and look at explicit sex instead of vague references to Pops PP (yes, I'm still traumatized about that episode) still great and a lot of fun so... yeah give it a try",/review/rw5894076/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2020,cristinasimmer,10," Haven't Seen An Animated Show This Funny Since South Park
","Wasn't a fan of Regular Show, but giving these comedic creators and geniuses the ability to discuss adult topics with adult humor is absolutely amazing and you had me honestly within the first 30 seconds. I knew this show would be a banger from the trailer.",/review/rw5894076/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2020,BoxwoodExpress,9," Great successor to Regular Show
","Growing up, I was a huge fan of Regular Show, and it was one show that me and my dad would watch together often. Sadly, it came to an end in 2017. That same year, JG Quintel's new project for adults was announced, Close Enough. It was going to air on TBS in animation block with other shows, but due to Louis CK's inappropriate behavior (CK created a cartoon for that block), the block was cancelled and Close Enough was delayed.",/review/rw5894076/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2020,mrrockets-98680,10," Please give us more, HBO!
","I dont usually write reviews but this show really deserves a raving review. It takes the magic from regular show and just lets it all loose. Its a great show, great voice acting, great art style, great jokes. I'm so excited for what comes next. Please give them more episodes HBO, this ones gold.",/review/rw5894076/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2020,CartoonReview,10," Need to see season 2
","It was worth the wait. I did not expect much from the show due to the plot, but the plot actually makes this show amazing. It really holds deeper meaning the more you watch it and makes you feel more attached to the characters (Quintel did a great job with the characters) . Comedy wise it is good but if some changes can be made, this show can be as good as Regular Show.",/review/rw5894076/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2020,justintimms,8," Rated R regular show
","I mean it's not a bad show and it's pretty funny but I still kind of miss regular show but I understand stuff has to change and just light reebly and stinky, first it becomes a kid show and later on want to make a Adult show. Still not bad, not bad. Good comedy and getting Memes made from them everyday!",/review/rw5894076/?ref_=tt_urv

18 September 2020,roblloyds,8," Looking forward to another season!
","I really like the groundwork laid down by this show already, it's packed with some particular real-world problems you don't see often in many cartoons but theres otherworldly elements added into the mix. I loved ""The Perfect House"", it was a good early indicator what to expect from the rest of the season and I love the relationship that Emily and Josh have as parents trying to juggle their responsibilities while seemingly not being ready to grow up. Theres some great wee moments in here that have me excited for more to come.",/review/rw5894076/?ref_=tt_urv

15 September 2020,salfmus,8," It's...okay.. but still feels unsatisfactory for a Regular Show fan
","This show is ok but I did not fall in love with it. I absolutely loved Regular Show for its crazyness and high energy. Close Enough just feels like a more bland Regular Show and it focuses way too much on the insecurities of people in their 30s. At some point the jokes around this theme become redundant. There are a few moments in the series when you expect JG Quintel's former crazyness to show up but it feels like it's never going far enough to become satisfactory. I guess he was trying to get a more ""normal"" crowd with this show but for fans that are looking for the Regular Show experience; it's like an annoying tease at some point, you always expect it but they never deliver.",/review/rw5894076/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2020,crayolacoral,10," Quintel strikes again
","It's all the fun of regular show with a new angle and edge. It's clear that regular show was attempting to add older audiences and more adult jokes to Cartoon Network, and close enough takes it to the next level. It's a fun series with a lot of relatable moments mixed with J.G. Style humor. A great first outing for HBOmax and I can't wait to see what other cartoons they produce if this one is anything to go on.",/review/rw5894076/?ref_=tt_urv
