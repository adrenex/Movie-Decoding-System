",Those who liked 'Tenet' said it was confusing. Those who hated 'Tenet' said it was confusing. Having read so many contradicting reviews about 'Tenet' I decided to watch it for myself to make up my own mind.,/review/rw6327269/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2020,neil-476,5," Far too clever for its own good
","Following a muddlesome terrorist attack on an opera, this unnamed chap (who I shall call Z) is introduced to the phenomenon of inversion. Inversion is the reversal of entropy, and can be applied to an object, a location, one or more individuals etc. This means that time can run forwards and backwards at more or less the same time in more or less the same place. It is dangerous: if overused it can overbalance entropy, which will end everything. And a nasty Russian piece of work is trying to collect bits of a mechanism so that he can activate an algorithm...",/review/rw6327269/?ref_=tt_urv

","Clémence Poésy character says in the film ""Don't try to understand it. Feel it."" And later Pattinson character ask to the main character ""Does your head hurt yet?"" While he is trying to explain part of the plot to The Protagonist and to us as an audience, this is basically the whole movie, visually is great, the score even being loud is also great, the concept of moving backwards is also a great idea that give a lot great scenes, but when you stop to realize, a lot of things don't make a lot of sense.",/review/rw6327269/?ref_=tt_urv

7 September 2020,gcsman,8," Christopher Nolan does James Bond -- with time travel!
","I have a huge amount of respect for director Christopher Nolan. His recent films Inception, Interstellar, and Dunkirk are three of the best things I've ever seen on film and I automatically want to see whatever new production he comes out with. So, I'm just back from the theater having seen Tenet for the first time (I'm pretty sure there will be a second and third time) and in one sense I have no idea what rating to give. At a minimum it would be worth at least 6/10 for its technical quality alone. But it might be 10/10 for the quality of its fiendishly intricate storyline, which leaves your head spinning by the end. But it' s not without a few problems (see below). So, OK -- 8/10 it is.",/review/rw6327269/?ref_=tt_urv

","Nobody listened. This was the result. Sure, we get it, when some viewers make that special effort to ""understand"" the mad genius of the film-maker. Makes them feel special. But here is a tip from a member with 1600+ reviews. Like Seinfeld once said, if you choose your detergent based on its ability to remove bloodstains, you have bigger problems than laundry. If you need to watch the film several times, preferably with subtitles (quoting from one of the top rated reviews here), you are not here for the movie. Or the bear hunting.

",I'd suggest people read the synopsis on Wikipedia before watching the time. Otherwise it would be too hard to follow. If you're the type of person who enjoys watching a movie multiple times and dissecting it then you'll enjoy Tenet,/review/rw6327269/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2021,Leofwine_draca,7," Not as good as it thinks it is
","Christopher Nolan's latest head-scratching thriller is a far cry from INCEPTION, although as a blockbuster action film in the Bond mould it's fairly enjoyable. But, like DUNKIRK, it manages to be seriously flawed too, and less good than it thinks it is. It suffers hugely from a lead actor who can't actually act; even the Indian kid from EASTENDERS would have been better. Robert Pattinson, Kenneth Branagh and Michael Caine all act Washington off the screen at various points. As for the time travel, it's more like time reversal, and is essentially a MacGuffin which allows the director to incorporate some cool trickery into the otherwise routine action bits. Not bad, but not a film I'll think much about in years to come.",/review/rw6327269/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2021,claudio_carvalho,5," Another Overrated Mess by Christopher Nolan
","""Tenet"" is another overrated mess by Christopher Nolan, who is a Hollywood's darling. The story seems to be written under influence, in a confused screenplay. The action and mainly the special effects are top notch. But Denzel Wahington's son is not adequate for the role of super-spy and the plot is a complete mess hard to be followed. ""Tenet"" is adequate for Nolan's worshipers that do not have prejudice to paradoxes and confused stories, and for pseudo-intellectuals that do not fully understand the plot and are ashamed to confess. Do not waste your time watching this long mess if you are not in the previous categories. My vote is five.",/review/rw6327269/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2020,spencermcook,9," Built For Long Term Curiosity
","Trying to take my bias opinion away from my critical, logical opinion. Few people comprehend the immense detail with the story, I don't even comprehend all of it, but now I understand enough to believe that this is Nolan's most elaborate story yet. This is a complicated movie, and complicated in a good way. If you (as an audience) don't enjoy or understand this movie I understand why and I don't blame you, but on the contrary if you do enjoy this movie, if you understand the story, then I understand why you may believe this to be one of the most intelligent films of all time. (BOLD claim). We already knew what to expect with the quality of cinematography, visual, score, and even to a certain extent, the wild plot that Christopher Nolan ALWAYS delivers because he's consistent with all his films. What we received with this film though, was simply unexpected. This wasn't a film like the dark knight which provides authenticity to a sci-fi world, or even inception which provided clarity after simple attention. This is a film that is intended to be searched, discovered, thought of, looked at, and inspected in every way possible. And yet, this a film intended to give no easy answers, no simple clarity, no instant gratification. This is a film that wants to defy the odds of films by building curiosity over time rather than losing it. Overall I have a lot to discover, a lot to learn, and a lot to understand from this film, yet I'm extremely pleased with its performance in most categories a film has to offer.",/review/rw6327269/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2020,fciocca,5," Unnecessarily complicated, way too long. Very disappointed considering all the hype generated during last months
","I had big expectations for Tenet, since I first watched the trailer. Instead, the movie is very confusing and maybe in order to understand it, I need to watch it more than once. I managed to follow halfway through it, but then I was completely lost. Except the main two characters Neil and The Protagonist, the rest of the cast is pretty flat and Kat is really annoying, especially towards the end. At least actors were good enough to maintain the whole thing afloat.",/review/rw6327269/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2021,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,2," No story...no characters...no movie
","This is the first movie I have legitimately HATED in quite some time. The 2 and a half hour bore fest has almost zero winning elements. It's got a very effective music score. Outside of that, the movie has a couple of MILDLY amusing combat scenes occurring in reverse, as advertised, and one impressive death scene. That aside, what does Tenet really consist of?",/review/rw6327269/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2020,frezeframe,," Worth it- but intensely cerebral for 2.5 hours with no break in tension
","I respect the cinematic art that is Tenet. It's just something you experience- and if you try to follow the plot it will be confusing. But in this case, that confusion is intentional and one thing is obvious, this film is an intentional well planned out vision of Christopher Nolan. That confidence and certainty of a director is what you respect. Many great filmmakers make strange mind bending films. I think the action in Tenet was entertaining and the concept was interesting. But I feel it came up short given the storytelling ability of Christopher Nolan.",/review/rw6327269/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2020,Horst_In_Translation,4," I did not like it a lot, Nolan seems to be on a downward spiral for me now
","""Tenet"" is the newest movie by British Oscar-nominated filmmaker Christopher Nolan, who is widely considered among the most defining and visionary film directors these days, also because he writes his own screenplays. He had his 50th birthday this year and as a gift for his fans, there is a new movie out and here we have it. It runs for 2.5 hours exactly pretty much and I must say sadly that this is among my least favorites from the Oscar-nominated director. I wonder if he will ever win one. Probably, but I can't see it happen for this film here. I also struggled a bit with his previous movie ""Dunkirk"" three years ago, but there I thought it was maybe partially because war films were never my favorite genre. But this one here, in the widest sense, has parallens with ""Inception"" and that is a film I really appreciated, more with each viewing, but then again, maybe I need to watch this one also once or twice in the future and maybe I will appreciate it more. I just cannot say I am motivated at all right now. This also has to do with the cast. Or at least with lead actor John David Washington, who is strangely enough not even close to being first credit here on imdb. I also felt that on his big breakthrough film by Spike Lee that almost had him nominated for an Oscar, he was not particularly good, so I still do not really see any lead actor potential in him. This movie here definitely did not change my mind.",/review/rw6327269/?ref_=tt_urv

12 September 2020,briancham1994,6," The audience is now deaf
","Whoever did the sound mixing should be fired. The sounds and music were far louder than the dialogue which made it impossible to tell what anyone was saying. As for the story itself, I found it gimmicky, simplistic and predictable. I admire the amount of work that went into bringing this idea to life, especially the technical aspect which was perfectly executed with visual amazement and action. However, it felt like an artificial and forced physics demonstration with very jumpy pacing more than a genuine story with an emotional core. At times it dabbles in a bit of character depth (Elizabeth Debicki's character being the real star here) but this is balanced by some rather baffling or blunt moments as well. It was fun to watch this movie imagining that Washington's protagonist is actually the same as his character from BlacKkKlansman (2018).",/review/rw6327269/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2020,Top_Dawg_Critic,6," Nolan's worst film to date
","You can watch this once, twice or ten times; watch it forward or reverse; it doesn't matter, Nolan's story is riddled with amateur plot and technical issues. Aside from the convoluted story that has nothing to do with anyone's intellect to grasp it, Nolan threw in a bunch of useless Red Herrings and got lazy compared to his successful Inception movie. So no, you're not dumb if you didn't get this film; Nolan was just smoking some real wacky stuff to come up with this upchuck.",/review/rw6327269/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2020,crawford,1," Utter nonsense
","This movie may be glossy and pretty to look at but since it's utter nonsense it's difficult to care. The entire concept makes no sense. No characters to care about either, they are just there as set pieces.",/review/rw6327269/?ref_=tt_urv

","An unexpected work from Christopher Nolan
Well Christopher Nolan is undoubtedly one of the best directors, but Tenet is a big problem!
At first I'm not even sure how to write a review about this movie! Complex, strange and annoying at times, and I cannot even tell if the scenario is smart or is it just complicated?
On the positive side, the acting was perfect, especially in terms of Robert. And his acting is perfect. This is clearly his best movie ever.
There are other features such as music, photography, etc. However, the movie does not match the rest of the great Nolan films, but it is not bad so I will rate it 8 out of 10.",/review/rw6327269/?ref_=tt_urv
