19 May 2022,UniqueParticle,9," I don't understand the poor ratings/bashing of the series, I think it's excellent
","It's very well written, exceptional acting, makeup is incredible especially on Sean Penn and the cinematography is beautiful! Gaslit is intriguing even gets better and intense; barely boring at all. I love that Sam Esmail is a producer he's masterful at his craft so is director Matt Ross I've enjoyed his acting. Hopefully overtime the series gets appreciated more I think it deserves higher than 6.8! To me it's one of the most enjoyable political stories out there.",/review/rw8268041/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2022,cekadah,7," More than you imagine
","What has grabed me by the collar, in this series, is that I find myself wanting, wishing, needing for the plot to be different for the outcome, the fate, of Martha Mitchell. She saw the truth but her husband was too corrupt, too much into the game, too controling to let her speak. And she was too firmly imbeded into his talons to see a way out.",/review/rw8268041/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2022,jburtonprod-802-759029,7," What Happened to Martha Was Worse.
","Overall, this is a good mini-series that is reasonably accurate. The thing that bothered me was their depiction of E. Howard Hunt, G. Gordan Liddy and the others as incompetent boobs. These were evil people. Many of the players in Watergate are suspected of being involved in the assassination of JFK.",/review/rw8268041/?ref_=tt_urv

9 June 2022,ikanboy,8," Watergate redux
",Mostly well done series about behind the scenes Watergate. The focus is Martha Mitchell but Roberts version seems too on kilter from the M. M I remember. John Dean is presented as a naive Boy Scout who is in over his head in everything he does. Liddy is bang on.,/review/rw8268041/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2022,EUyeshima,7," Outsized Personalities Drive This Defining Slice of Hustory
","Watching Julia Roberts not intentionally play Julia Roberts turns out to be quite refreshing now that she appears to be evolving into more of a character actress. She doesn't resemble the real Martha Mitchell except in conveying her outsized personality in this intriguing account of the Watergate break-in and the detrimental ramifications on the Nixon administration. Director Matt Ross appears to take cues from the Real Housewives in his dramatic treatment as cartoonish moments were mixed in effectively with the hidden events and conversations that really did occur. Under layers of latex, Sean Penn makes for an appropriately coiled John Mitchell, while Dan Steele looks to be on hyperdrive as John Dean. More entertaining than I expected, especially when the fallout gains momentum toward the end of episode 2.",/review/rw8268041/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2022,stan_c,8," Great Start with a Great Cast
","The ads got me and I subscribed to Starz just to see this. How could a cast like this be bad? Well, it can't. I am really happy to say it's off to a great start. The cast is awesome and Martha Mitchell deserved better than she got. I love the photography and the gratuitous nudity. I also like the TV shots. Go Martha. Good luck. Hope it's a big success. This cast can't fail. So far it has a 5.1 rating. Don't believe it. If you don't like this, you just don't get it.",/review/rw8268041/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2022,PeachesIR,6," Something is off
","""Gaslit"" has a high-quality cast and production values, capturing the look and mood of the early '70s. But the tone is off-putting. Many scenes are played as broad farce, as if most of the key figures in the Watergate scandal were buffoons. These were corrupt people who made terrible blunders, but they were not all a bunch of clowns.",/review/rw8268041/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2022,jkrempelinsac,10," Brilliant
",So far the first episode is brilliant! Julia Roberts and Sean Penn the perfect picks for their roles. Julia and Sean both award winning performances. All the acting is superb. The writing is spot on. Let's hope all the future episodes are as spectacular as the first!,/review/rw8268041/?ref_=tt_urv

13 June 2022,lcpiet,9," Gaslit is Brilliant
","And sheds light on the behind the scenes I never knew. Most of the men caught and convicted deserved all their time in jail AND MORE, none more so than John Mitchell. He deserved prison if only for what he did to Martha. He was an absolute phycopath. I'm still confused about how his daughter could have looked the other way and believed his lies. Martha's son seemed to realize Martha was a lot, but could differentiate from her zaniness and her illness and her being abused.",/review/rw8268041/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2022,rkeilitz-19-537915,10," History Repeats Itself
","This series is a new comically tragic take on the demise of Nixon during Watergate. Professional reviewers are calling it disjointed and confusing. I found it to be an incredible satire. If readers feel that Woodward and Bernstein's book went too deep in suggesting that Nixon's lap dogs were shadowy masterminds and that this version all involved were just incompetent idiots on a cartoon level, then Gaslit hits all the marks.",/review/rw8268041/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2022,Almost_Soldout,9," A good one!
",The show is decent but the cast is WOW. Show is shot really well so far. For me as not US Citizen but familiar with the story it's still interesting to see but I guess some American people might think it's not accurate or intriguing enough.,/review/rw8268041/?ref_=tt_urv

25 September 2022,johnklem,9," Absolute stunner that must be watched 'til the final episode
","Happily, not a lot of bots reviews of this show (note to Amazon: you need to fix the bots issue on IMDb reviews) but too many reviewers posted after the first couple of episodes and missed the point - in spades! This show is extraordinary. It begins in low-key fashion and feels like a gentle satire. The sheer incompetence of most of the Watergate protagonists makes for a ready comedic target. BUT, then things start to get real - not instantly but gradually. Gradually the tone changes and jolly japes become matters of life and death. This is seriously grown-up entertainment. Both Penn and Roberts are extraordinary in their roles and deserve extraordinary plaudits. This will resonate long, long after the final episode.",/review/rw8268041/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2022,wvfempwolford,10," year of the rat...stunning!
","Kafkaesque comes to mind. Such outstanding performances by Shea Whigham. Sean Penn, and Julia Roberts. I wasn't too impressed by this series until this episode. I actually subscribed to the streaming channel to watch. Now, very impressed.",/review/rw8268041/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2022,mandypearsall,6," Good job with the actual facts
","So far so good but big important question: where are John Dean's big hornrimmed glasses?? I am old enough to have been a young adult during this pivotal time in history. What is super ironic to me is how the very ""scandalous "" events that took down an administration and changed political history back in 1974 are in current times not worthy of even a second thought. It's all pretty much how it's done these days. God help us, we are living in a sad and very scary era ðŸ˜³",/review/rw8268041/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2022,shapet99,6," Wish they'd been a bit more accurate (as it's relevant)
","This was, overall, a nice watch. Well acted and well written and I'm always a sucker for well designed and appointed period pieces. Julia has enough of the elements to remind me of the actual historical figure she's playing and I bet, coming from Georgia, she's familiar with the type. It feels like it.",/review/rw8268041/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2022,orcinussr,8," It's VERY well done (which frankly is surprising for a Starz endeavor) (haha 'Starz' with a Z which, come on)
","The cast is first rate and the production values are obviously high, even though they must have spent a mint on the casting - my advice is to check it out, even if you're not a fan of 70s political history (and the ever so charasmatic Gordon Liddy - the first really 'lit' individual lol)",/review/rw8268041/?ref_=tt_urv

19 June 2022,lornak-18008,8," Julia Roberts and Sean Penn are Amazing!
","I wasn't sure if these actors could pull it off, but both ended up being brilliant-Roberts in particular. The makeup and prosthetics on Penn remade him into the historical character of John Mitchell and he was unrecognizable as himself. The characters of G. Gordon Liddy was way over the top, but very well acted. If Liddy was truthfully portrayed than he comes off as a psycho. Although I remember the Watergate hearings being on tv everyday one extremely hot(no ac)summer, I don't remember the personality of Liddy's being talked about. His part of the story took up quite a bit of airtime and although it's fascinating, I found it to be not that necessary to the plot as a whole.",/review/rw8268041/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2022,jewellz48,8," Well-acted, but streaky quality
","Well-acted, particularly by Julia Roberts, Dan Stevens, and Sean Penn. When the show stays focused, it is interesting and at times excellent. The story of Martha Mitchell was complex, at times funny, and ultimately tragic. The stories of John and Mo Dean and Frank Wills were also well done. But its occasional forays into the absurd, particularly around G Gordon Liddy, seem to distract from rather than add to the story. Well worth a watch.",/review/rw8268041/?ref_=tt_urv
