23 July 2008,bobsgrock,8," Quirky and highly original.
","Wes Anderson has been the face of a new brand of comedy ever since he burst onto the scene in 1996 with Bottle Rocket. He further established himself with the 1998 hit Rushmore. The Royal Tenenbaums is considered by many to be his finest work and it is kind of hard to dispute that. This is a rich, complex movie dealing with multiple characters that all suffer from serious trouble in one way or another. Gene Hackman plays the father of a family that was once quite prominent in the world of geniuses. The oldest son Chas was a successful real estate dealer, daughter Margot became a famous playwright in the ninth grade, and youngest son Richie went on to become a great tennis player. Still, all their talent couldn't keep their father from leaving them, and now he returns to see them because he tells them he is dying.",/review/rw1366953/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2004,FilmOtaku,9," It's more than quirky!
","With 'The Royal Tenenbaums', Wes Anderson turns his lens to the American family, warts and all. The Tenenbaums are a dysfunctional family Â– the parents have been separated for decades, and Royal (Gene Hackman) is a disbarred attorney who has long since moved out of the family's enormous house (in an unnamed city of course). The children, all geniuses and overachievers in their own way, are then raised by Etheline (Angelica Houston), an archeologist. Chas (Ben Stiller) is a financial wizard, Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), is adopted and was a published playwright at 11, and Richie (Luke Wilson) is a tennis prodigy. We are provided the family history at the start of the film, then are introduced to the family 22 years later. Chas is still a financial wizard, but, having lost his wife in a plane accident is now the paranoid father of two small sons. Margot is married to Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray, who is basically Anderson's muse), is depressed and hasn't written in years, and Richie, after having a nervous breakdown on the tennis court a couple of years earlier is traveling the world by boat. Still hanging around is Eli (Owen Wilson) a long-time family friend from across the street who is now a literature professor and successful novelist. Etheline is being wooed by her accountant, Henry (Danny Glover) and when Royal gets wind of this, he embarks on a bid to win his family back after not speaking with them for years.",/review/rw1366953/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2019,dafoat,10," Sometimes a film becomes a place
",I loved this movie the first time I saw it. And it grows on me a little bit every time I rewatch it. It's like going to visit an old friend's house. Anderson did such a marvelous job building this odd little world. It's just one indelible image after another. Gene Hackman is just marvelous. And that shot of Margot getting off the bus.,/review/rw1366953/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2015,SnoopyStyle,6," love the style but not the family
","Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) left his family. Etheline (Anjelica Huston) raised their three children as oddball geniuses. Twenty two years later, their early successes are now old memories. Chas (Ben Stiller) is a death-obsessed widowed father to Ari and Uzi. Richie (Luke Wilson) is a former tennis champ in love with his adopted sister Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow). Their neighbor childhood friend Eli Cash (Owen Wilson) is now a successful writer and professor. Margot is married to neurologist Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray). Etheline is asked by her friend Henry Sherman (Danny Glover) to get marry. Royal is broke. After finding out about the proposal, he tries to inject himself into the family by telling them that he's dying.",/review/rw1366953/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2018,aaronlbacks,8," Wes Anderson's Staple Film
","It seems to be generally agreed that this is Wes Anderson's staple film, or perhaps his mission statement as far as movies he wanted to create: idiosyncratic, campy tales about complex relationships being told in often witty and blunt dialogue. And no one can forget the Wes Anderson tells - symmetry, pastel or earthy color schemes, and Bill Murray. Even though the way this story is told would never happen in real life (it felt fitting that the ""actual story"" being told was through a book), it still feels incredibly human and almost believable in an odd way. Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) almost feels like the hero of a classic Greek tragedy, except the movie focuses more on gathering yourself the day, or in this case, the two decades after. Royal's ex-wife (Anjelica Huston), his two sons (Ben Stiller and Luke Wilson), his adopted daughter (Gwyneth Paltrow), and his children's friend from across the street (Owen Wilson) have all fallen on hard times (meltdowns, depression, drug use) decades after the family drifted apart. Royal attempts to reconnect with his family initially to keep his distanced wife from remarrying a tax advisor (Donny Glover), but throughout the film, he finds the best days of his life with his long-lost family. The group catches up with varying success and share in each other's mutual sadness. There are many beautiful and crushing scenes, heightened by the Wes Anderson style, and the story explores several different feelings and tones. I think the only real problem is that even though every character is written well and intricate in their own special way, and I believe each has an arc as well, there are so many people and histories to keep track of, it becomes a little bit of a nuisance. And the film struggles to juggle all these characters and all of this information in a balanced way; they each kind of have their moment and disappear for a while and then resurface briefly. And this makes the telling of the story a little choppy and confusing at points because you're always wondering who someone is or why they are acting the way they are until you remember through context clues. But if it weren't chosen to have this movie told through a book, I think it might have been much more noticeable. Of Anderson's films that I have seen, even though it is not my favorite by him, I'd say it's the best introduction to one of the best filmmakers in the industry right now.",/review/rw1366953/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2018,classicsoncall,9," ""Oh, that's right. We've got another body buried here, haven't we?""
","This is the type of film that really appeals to me. It has characters that are flawed but human, and a story that moves along with it's absurdities using deadpan humor supplied by a talented cast. Just to give you a flavor of how offbeat the story is, every time one of the players calls for a taxi, it's a gypsy cab that shows up, prominently identified as being one of those unlicensed for-hire vehicles operating illegally in the neighborhood in which the Tenenbaums live. The title is a bit of a misnomer if you were expecting a film about a royal family, it's only the patriarch who's first name happens to be Royal. In that role is Gene Hackman, a scalawag and deadbeat who abandoned his family twenty years prior, and now, on sort of a mission to reconcile, attempts a comeback with a wife and three adult children who aren't particularly fond of the idea. Each of the characters in this story has a particular quirk or two, burdened to some degree by their relationship to each other and especially to Royal Tenenbaum. They've all moved on to the best extent possible, but when Royal returns to the family homestead, all of their lives become an exercise in sheer frustration and unlimited patience. Yet with a phony story about having just six weeks left to live due to stomach cancer, Royal Tenenbaum accomplishes the near impossible, bringing together a family deep in the throes of alienation and self doubt, and uniting them in a way that defies probability. Granted, the film will not appeal to all viewers, but if one's sensibilities are piqued by the off-beat and sometimes ridiculous, this movie may push all the right buttons for it's whimsical take on life and the absurdities that often intrude on daily existence.",/review/rw1366953/?ref_=tt_urv

","This was a quirky film that surprised me, in that I liked it....at least twice. By the third viewing, I had enough but I got my money's worth out of it. That's what I would recommend with this movie: rent it before considering buying it. It's very different, and you might love but also might hate it.",/review/rw1366953/?ref_=tt_urv

27 December 2001,killergawp,9," Thank you Wes Anderson! The film is brilliant!
","I think if someone tries to watch a Wes Anderson film, they have to have a certain kind mind to understand the real meaning of them. After being awed by the Royal Tenenbaums, I left with a certain kind of joy that only a great film can give me. It's like flying an electric kite, it's that hard of a buzz. As I began my travel down the stairs of the theater, I heard this couple talking about how stupid the movie was, and how they are going to ask for a refund. I suddenly smiled, because I hoped that they would get one. I think that I got something out of the film that they didn't. That inside the frames of the movie I felt like I was in good company and had a understanding for the material that they didn't.  What is so good about the Royal Tenenbaums?  The great detail in every frame, from the costumes (and they really are costumes)to the design of Chas, Margot, and Richie rooms and the house. This is brilliant film on every level, a delight for the senses and for the mind. This movie makes you think, and without giving too much away there is a lot of surprises that come from the characters dialogue and their past.  High kudos go to Luke Wilson, I loved his performance as the suffering Richie.  If you loved Rushmore, there is no doubt that you will love this film because it is at par with it, except that its a bit darker in tone.   I think its funny that way that people look at film, we each love or hate a film based on our own perception(and mind there are people who just watch film for entertainment). So if you have a complicated mind and you enjoy watching a challenging film, then the Royal Tenenbaums is for you. As for me, I plan on watching it again so I find more things to love about it. Thank you Wes Anderson, so much. You made laugh, you made me smile and I cried. A thousand times, thank you!",/review/rw1366953/?ref_=tt_urv

","The Royal Tenenbaums is a film that defies easy categorization. It is bizarre and funny, yet also deeply humane, a poignant tale about people who have had limited success in their lives. From the minute it began, I fell in love with its offbeat characters, its quirky, deadpan humor, its dream version of New York, and its message of reconciliation and renewal. For me, it's says that in spite of all the screw-ups you may make in your life, it's never too late to take responsibility and to set things right.",/review/rw1366953/?ref_=tt_urv

10 August 2007,ExpendableMan,1," The most depressing comedy ever made
","I still remember the first time I saw The Royal Tenenbaums. Principally, it was the box art that drew me in - Ben Stiller dressed in a red tracksuit with two sons wearing the same clothing? Gene Hackman raising an alcoholic drink with a cheeky smile plastered across his face? Bill Murray? Both the Wilson brothers at the same time? Surely, this would be one of the funniest films of all time, with a cast like that, how could it fail? Well I have to hand it to the art designers and the hype machine because they fooled me completely, as The Royal Tenenbaums turned out to be one of those comedies that is ""off-beat,"" ""dark"" and ""intelligent,"" but forgets to be ""funny."" Still, I'm a bit of a glutton for punishment some times so I sat through the entire film and was rewarded for my perseverance with over two hours of utter tedium. Worse, it is so depressing that by the time the credits started rolling, I'd found myself suffering crippling emotional pains from a vast range of personal demons that up until that moment, I wasn't aware I had.",/review/rw1366953/?ref_=tt_urv

5 January 2002,wisewebwoman,8," Over the top comedy with warmth and renewal at its core
","This movie was a wonderful experience on so many levels.  all the characters fascinate, I loved the almost fairy tale quality to it, the redemption of the characters, the mending of broken relationships.  Gene Hackman steals every scene he is in, his performance is flawless. the movie has the feel of the comedies from way back, all the minor players are hysterically funny, Pagoda, the short, fat Indian almost wordless houseman, stands on his head for no reason and always wears pink pants and spies on the family and reports in monosyllables to  Royal, the long gone father. The convoluted plot details and personal history of each family member add to the fleshing out of the characters.  Anjelica Huston, in one of her best ever roles, shows how gracefully and wonderfully she has aged and relishing the part, brings a wonderful wit to her complicated character, it is amazing what she can do with a smile. 8 out of 10 for this great film, one of a kind.",/review/rw1366953/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2018,framptonhollis,9," hilarity w/heart
","In many ways, 'The Royal Tenenbaums' could be considered the ""ultimate"" Wes Anderson film. It gleefully employs all of Anderson's principal cinematic traits and contains levels of quirk so high it isn't even worth describing. It is also a masterpiece.
 Every shot is beautiful and precise, as is oft the case w/Wes Anderson, but here the style is containing of more vigor and heaviness than is even to be expected. 'The Royal Tenenbaums' is essentially the archetypical Wes Anderson film and, since Wes Anderson is one of my very favourite filmmakers of all time, that just ranks it among what I believe to be the greatest films of all time. It tackles dark topics in a manner that is at once lightly and blackly comical while also be genuinely and successfully dramatic throughout as well. Punchlines don't get in the way of the drama, and yet they are still oft inserted into more dramatic scenes. Everything is timed w/perfection, creating an atmosphere that is theatrical, dramatic, and fantastical, and yet all of the emotions are incredibly raw and real. It's a beautiful film w/near perfect writing, cinematography, performances, etc.",/review/rw1366953/?ref_=tt_urv

","This film made me feel things, not only are the performances great and some really nice cinematography, nothing less than what you would expect from Wes Anderson, but the story itself is simple yet beautiful. There are some really touching moments in this film and I did come close to tears. It's a great film but if you're looking for a comedy I think this isn't your ideal pick, however if you're looking for a touching movie about family, friendship and love then definitely watch this, you won't regret it :)",/review/rw1366953/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2006,Howlin Wolf,3," Anderson devotees will cherish this one no matter what I say...
","... so if you're a confirmed fan, ""Tenenbaums"" bears the hallmarks of a familiar style. Myself, I don't find it too accessible because his characters all decidedly inhabit their own particular universe. I found ""Rushmore"" and ""The Life Aquatic"" to be at the very least 'watchable' (I rate both 6/10... ) but I think the problem I had with TRT is that the two other films I mentioned had 'oddball' characters where you wouldn't expect to find them; a dysfunctional family unit is bound to have its unique members, because that's WHY they're dysfunctional! Family conflict isn't exactly a fresh theme, it's been done many times, so in the end it just felt like an excuse for the Wilsons to gather together their actor mates and get purposefully 'wacky'...",/review/rw1366953/?ref_=tt_urv

24 February 2004,Theo Robertson,3," How Not To Write An Interesting Script
","I can`t believe so many people have written so many positive comments on THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS , personally I absolutely hated this movie due to the simple reason it has a ridiculous script structure . If you`ve never seen the movie let me point out that the audience are subjected a very lengthy pre title sequence featuring character exposistion with a voice over that goes on and on . The opening credits come and go and then we`re subjected to more voice over . I can`t give a clear answer as to how long this narration lasts for but it seemed to go on for several life times . I`ve nothing against narration or voice over , indeed two of my all time favourite movies FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and APOCALYPSE NOW feature this technique which leads me to believe that it`s handeled wrongly . Another fault of Owen Wilson`s script is the characters who are members of a very very rich family full of extremely gifted children . Is it just me or are poor little rich kids the least involving subject for a film ? ",/review/rw1366953/?ref_=tt_urv
