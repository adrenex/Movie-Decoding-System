15 December 2020,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,9," One of the most real, refreshing, endearing things on TV right now
","No matter what you're into, I recommend you give this series a shot. John Wilson is a timid, socially awkward, but simultaneously brave and empathetic, weirdo living in New York City. He's taken candid footage that he shot over the course of two years (from early 2018 to early 2020) and turned it into a creative docu-series that rides a unique line between satire, exploitation, education, and, well...art.",/review/rw6279042/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2020,UniqueParticle,10," Absolutely love this docu-series
","Awkward, soothing, interesting, and funny often! I thoroughly enjoy listening to John Wilson and everyone else talk. There's 6 episodes so far and I really hope more gets made!",/review/rw6279042/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2020,shelloflite,10," Not for everyone but
","It's working for me. I like it. Episode 4 is my favorite so far, it was strange. I hope the episodes get even weirder as the series progresses. Curious what direction they will take it. Not sure this review makes sense, I'm stoned.",/review/rw6279042/?ref_=tt_urv

25 December 2021,ruthburley,9," He's a genius
",John Wilson is truly amazing. How he weaves random images with the spoken word is truly genius. Watching along is one of the most relaxing experiences one can have while viewing tv. Thanks John!!,/review/rw6279042/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2020,mistercingilbort,10," One of The Funniest Show
","I loved the show because of John's personality. While I was watching the show, I always thought that If I were there instead of him, what would I did? I would automatically judge people's weirdness and it would react awkwardly, they would get angry to me.
But because of he is so nice person and he is okey with people whoever they are, whatever their opinion, weird people is cool around him.
Suprisingly, I learned a good lesson from this hilarious show. Even if I don't say it directly, judging people makes it impossible for me to get along with some people, and to understand point of view.",/review/rw6279042/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2020,cekadah,10," Brilliant
",I can find no flaw in this series! It's pure stream of consciousness and studied insight into our daily lives.,/review/rw6279042/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2021,kennethcbenson,10," Some kind of genius created this
","Very funny, very addictive, very creative. Rarely have I laughed out loud so often at a show. Frankly, it's almost impossible to believe that it ever got picked up by a network - it's that weirdly, wonderfully strange. Brilliant editing.",/review/rw6279042/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2020,meganrogers-43115,10," So Glad I Actually Clicked on this Featured Series
","Usually, the ""Featured"" or ""For You"" selections are the ones I know I won't like (just feels like they are trying to push them on you too hard, ya know?), BUT THIS GUY is hilarious and worth the watch and rewatch. This is genuinely the series of much needed comedic realism for all of 2020 and it doesn't even verge into politics like literally everything else does! I think he just improv narrates random footage he has collected to generate plot for each episode, or it could just be his delivery of a loose script, but John Wilson certainly provides a refreshing comedic take seemingly about nothing with incredibly relatable actualizations edited together to compose each themed episode. 10/10 would recommend",/review/rw6279042/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2021,aarpcats,9," The animals of NYC
","National Geographic documentaries seduce the viewer into believing that the cameras easily catch the drama and spontaneity of the wild as easily as an American teenager takes a selfie. The reality is that for every adorable clip of baby meerkats playing freely on the savannah, the camera has spent thousands of hours filming everything from empty grass to zoo enclosures to zebras wandering listlessly in the heat. National Geographic doesn't necessarily set out to capture baby meerkats playing. It happens to capture them, and then builds the drama into the documentary the viewer sees.",/review/rw6279042/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2020,vanguard-54486,9," Awkwardly funny
","Very personal, with touch of geekiness and sprinkled with awkwardness. Very different from what you see on TV today. Really enjoyed it.",/review/rw6279042/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2020,mnhertz26-818-895128,8," I really like it, but I'm just not sure exactly why
","It seems clunky and under-produced, but you eventually realize that it's done like this on purpose...Or is it? It has to be. This is HBO. Right? LOL. While slightly confusing, it's definitely different which is always a good start.",/review/rw6279042/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2020,paul-allaer,7," More ""how to"" musings from John Wilson
","""How To with John Wilson"" (2020 release; 6 episodes of about 25 min. each) is a TV documentary mini-series from John Wilson on the daily life and times in New York City. As Episode 1 ""How To Make Small Talk"" opens, Wilson ventures out of his apartment to make small talk with random people, and ends up talking to a guys who describes his job as a child predator catcher. Wilson accepts the guy's invitation to venture to his house in Pennsylvania to see how that actually works. It is the beginning of a journey down the rabbit hole... At this point we are less than 10 min. into Episodes 1.",/review/rw6279042/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2022,paul2001sw-1,7," Oddly charming
","John Wilson wanders the streets of New York, filming all sorts of odd things that he happens to see. He then assembles them into the backdrop to what puport to be self-help stories, presented by Wilson in the persona of a nervous, nerdy man who hasn't quite figured out the life-lessons he aims to be teaching. If this was just parody it would lack the charm it actually has, because while it might all be an act, Wilson never breaks character, and there's a pervasive feeling of sincerity in spite of the obviously deliberate construction. The result is not quite comedy, not quite documentary, not quite fiction; and yet oddly watchable and utterly unique.",/review/rw6279042/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2020,sammyball,," Funny, awkward, sweet, and surprisingly poignant.
","I was looking forward to this series since I saw the trailer. I loved the first episode. It was a great ""slice of life"" kind of show. I came in expecting a weird and funny show (which it is) but I also was pleasantly surprised by how touching it can be. I'm definitely on board for the whole season. I'm sure he shot the whole series/season pre-Covid. I hope this series is successful. If there is a second season, It would be interesting what this series would be like if he shot this during this time of Covid.",/review/rw6279042/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2021,MiguelAReina,9," Irony is its best virtue
","One of the weirdest documentary series that can be found. The irony of John Wilson manifests itself in episodes with strange themes such as scaffolding or ways of covering furniture. The mastery of the project is in how it manages to make each episode drift towards unusual paths, which cast doubt on the lucidity of the human being. It is an unusual look at life, a discovery of the most remote places of our existence.",/review/rw6279042/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2020,bajajakshay-36485,9," Uniquely documented and brilliant in its own right
","Although the narrator is a socially awkward person with cringe tendencies, his nature somehow makes his interactions with other humans a quite compelling visual experience.",/review/rw6279042/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2022,coles_notes,8," Great
","While waiting ever so patiently for each new episode of The Rehearsal, I decided to finally check out this similar show. Created, directed, and narrated by John Wilson, How to with... is a documentary style comedy bringing answers on how to do the mundane around New York City often with surprising depth and commentary. A definitely laugh out loud, deadpan type humour, if this is your style you will love it. Warning episodes can suddenly and shockingly become very NSFW, but b-roll style shots of people around New York that Wilson are able to capture are unbelievable in the most natural yet still manufactured way. Very excited for more.",/review/rw6279042/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2020,geeboy37,8," Brilliant and incredibly unique
","If you ever watched Nathan for You, you probably will like this since it has a similar vibe but completely different premise. Not only can it be hilarious but it's also informative and throws in an element of ""people watching"" which NYC is the perfect place for. It might seem like its going slow at first but stick with it. It's almost like a comical documentary but as I said, still informative.",/review/rw6279042/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2020,FatDumbAmerican,10," Unique and beautiful
","Probably won't gain a following, but I think it's amazing. The subtlest of humor and very relaxing, almost hypnotic.",/review/rw6279042/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2021,evanjustrocks,10," A celebration of the absurdity of life
","John Wilson has captured just how spontaneous and odd humans can be, if you film for long enough. Most of the interactions he has with the people he talks to are so fascinating because you can tell they are real and unscripted. John's dry, deadpan humor is in his camera as much as his voice, and the creative editing of his footage of New York over his raw, earnest narration never gets old for me. A unique and lovely - and often insane - show, definitely worth the watch.",/review/rw6279042/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2020,soccerball-48728,9," Strangely Deep for Nathan Fielder
","Going in I didn't know what to expect. However, the show slowly unraveled itself and revealed what it truly is. A quirky yet also in depth take on New York and the 21st century life.",/review/rw6279042/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2020,BiggaHD,8," What, what?
","Wow, what the hell did I just watched? It's pretty hard to rate the show, but here is a solid 8 from me. I can't believe there are people weird on that scale. It's completely nuts and I don't mind it. The show in itself, besides being wicked and strange, is nothing like you seen before. It's not for everybody, but I get the point. I don't know man. Give it a honest try",/review/rw6279042/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2020,kaideneve,10," Absurdly funny
","I came across this show out of COVID isolation boredom with no prior expectations and was mesmerized from the first few minutes. The humour is the perfect mix of subtle and absurd, and it's actually quite poignant at times as well. New York City is the perfect setting for this type of comedy, and I think Wilson has a great knack for observing and interacting with the daily chaos of the concrete jungle where most of the filming takes place. When I found out it was produced by Nathan Fielder, the style all started to make a bit more sense. Intelligent and entertaining.",/review/rw6279042/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2020,mlwieber-12167,10," Brilliant observational humor in NYC, the best city in the world
","This show is a laugh riot from beginning to end. Only in New York City can a show like this successfully exist because NYC has literally everything, from the most random to the most refined to life-ling NY residents to immigrants and all in between. The images & story lines, which sound dull & boring, quickly become hilarious & relatable. I hope John Wilson becomes the next Larry David. He's a beacon of humor in these dark covid times & I eagerly look forward to each episode so I can forget about my day in my tiny little podunk town & revel in the glamor, grunge & hilarity of NYC. Thanks HBO. You legit create the best original programming. It's not tv, it's HBO...and John Wilson 😁",/review/rw6279042/?ref_=tt_urv
