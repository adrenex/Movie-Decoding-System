19 December 2021,blanbrn,7," Wacky, far out crazy funny film that pays homage to 50's sci-fi.
","Always been a Tim Burton fan was hooked after his directing of ""Batman""(89) and ""Batman Returns""(92) and this entry from 1996 ""Mars Attack"" even though not his greatest is a carefree and fun little watch. As if your a fan of Burton's and like old comics and sci- fi then this wacky homage is enjoyable as from up above all across the galaxy call them aliens, Martians, or little green men these guys have invaded earth from the angry red hot Mars planet! These creatures also are about mean business as they are armed with gun rays that fry any human in their path. The special effects are pretty decent for 1996 and the humor and writing was funny and spot on. The Slim like green brain Martians have even outsmarted the U. S. federal government(2 out of 3 branches of the government are working for us and that ain't bad!). The acting and cast chemistry is top notch with all pros and all stars with Annette Bening, Glenn Close, Danny DeVito, Michael J. Fox, Martin Short, Tom Jones, Natalie Portman, Jim Brown and an eye candy treat with Sarah Jessica Parker(before her ""Sex and the City"" days) as a sexy colored bra wearing news reporter and interviewer. And last but not least the great and all time best Jack Nicholson as you guessed it the President of the United States! Overall funny watch and carefree feel good sci-fi comedy that doesn't take things or it's self to serious. Still a view for any Burton fan as the all star cast help make the film a watch too.",/review/rw1975590/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2016,Leofwine_draca,7," Refreshingly mean-spirited
","Tim Burton's sci-fi spoof was a massive flop on first release; this was because audiences were expecting a straight science fiction film, when what they got in fact was a comedy. People either love or hate this film, there is no in between, and thankfully I'm in the former camp in this case. As a comedy, Burton's film is wonderful. A star-studded cast of famous faces send themselves up shamelessly, all of those tacky alien invasion pictures of the 1950s are referenced and paid homage too, and on top of all this, we have loads of excellent CGI effects to contend with. The comic book feel of the film comes from the rich, bright colours, everything looks fake and tacky, and it's meant to.",/review/rw1975590/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2006,rebeljenn,6," If you have a warped sense of humour, you'll enjoy this
","Tim Burton's film, 'Mars Attacks!' combines elements of dark humour with an alien invasion to create a hilarious film. There's no doubt about it that audiences will be torn between those who enjoyed the film (the comedy) and those who hated it. This film is a parody of other Earth-invasion films, such as 'Independence Day' and 'War of the Worlds', which have been a common theme in story-telling for decades and particularly in the 1950s. In this film, the aliens are content on destroying Earth and humiliating the humans for the sake of it. It's not a serious film at all, and you'll either love it or hate it, depending on how warped your sense of humour is. I thought it was fun, even though it is not the best film of all time.",/review/rw1975590/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2002,bob the moo,," Very enjoyable sci-fi spoof
","When Martians make contact with earth opinion is split into two camps between seeking peace or preparing for defence.  When the inital meeting is turned into a massacre by a misunderstanding surrounding the dove of peace, the camp seeking war seem to have the stronger case.  However the Martian Ambassator apologises and is allowed to meet before the joint houses in the US.  However when the Martians use this as an way to wipe out America's leaders in one move.  Security is stepped up and the world is put on a war footing, however the martians seem only interesting in destruction and death and deliver both with a wickedly cruel sense of humour.",/review/rw1975590/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2008,planktonrules,7," A pleasant little time-passer
","This film is a homage to sci-fi movies of the 1950s and 60s--even down to the design of the aliens who were taken from the obscure ""Mars Attacks"" kids trading cards from the 60s. At a gentle send up of the genre, you see many of the expected clich√©s and dialog--there are not major surprises here.",/review/rw1975590/?ref_=tt_urv

","Based on the cult trading card series of the same name, 'Mars Attacks!' is Tim Burton's Craziest Hour!

28 May 2014,bowmanblue,7," The best movie ever to be spawned by bubblegum cards!
","The trouble is... 'Mars Attacks' doesn't have a lot (if any!) competition for that title. In the mid nineties, when alien invasion fever was at its highest, someone proposed a film about cheesy 1950s-style Martians attacking Earth and 'Mars Attacks' was born.",/review/rw1975590/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2002,moonspinner55,1," Amazing actors stuck playing ignorant yokels...
","After a first contact meeting in the Nevada desert between the U.S. President's science aides and the Ambassador of Mars doesn't go well, the President and his advisers suddenly find Earth at war with the intergalactic creatures. Rarely has a modern movie collected such an eclectic group of actors in one place. This is, of course, a testimony to the reputation of director Tim Burton, but Burton doesn't set up a very appealing showcase for his amazing cast. We're primed to laugh at who they are (their personas) rather than who they're playing (a bunch of idiots). Martian invasion movies from the 1950s were supposed to be scary but were instead funny and maybe a little campy--this one wants to be funny, but is instead condescending and mean-spirited. Usually, Burton's strengths as a filmmaker (eccentric bits of whimsy and character interaction) save the day; with ""Mars Attacks!"", he's coasting on shtick (pitched far too high) and relying on caricature-driven mayhem to carry the plot (concocted by screenwriter Jonathan Gems) and the players (willing stars, by the way, who were probably hoping for a slam-dunk). It doesn't work. Even the cartoon-derived violence is heavy-handed. NO STARS from ****",/review/rw1975590/?ref_=tt_urv

","There's one guarantee in life : When you're reading 5 reviews on Mars Attacks, FOUR of them are negative ones! Why, I ask?? It's really hard for me to believe that all these movie-lovers fail to see the film like Tim Burton intended it. Mars Attacks! is a great film and - above all - a very effective parody. Burton takes the opportunity to spoof and laugh with almost every form of nowadays filth...Politics, religion, the army, television, greed in Las Vegas and God knows what else. Mars Attacks! is the purest form of cinema anarchy I've seen so far, and I really want to encourage you to see it again if you didn't like it the first time. Tim Burton is a genius. Practically all movies he did before ( and after ) Mars Attacks! prove that. Do you really believe that he would deliver a failure? Or do you think the entire brilliant cast would agree to starring in an inferior production?? They all acknowledged the genius of this movie...why can't the audience do the same?",/review/rw1975590/?ref_=tt_urv

","No one likes and respects Tim Burton more than I do, but I draw the line at this movie.  I understand what it was supposed to have been, but it didn't do it.  See ""Invaders from Mars"" or ""Strange Invaders"" for the same story done correctly.  I do thank him for giving Sylvia Sidney another job, tho.

1 June 2004,stiv-7,," ACK!ACK! ACK!ACK!
","Anybody who hated this movie missed the point. This is a fun little satire on the American culture of assimilation, the great cultural melting pot. It dares to ask the question: What if another group of people doesn't want to be adopted into the American consumerist culture? The results are hilarious, as we have a group of Martians double-talking their way through the annihilation of the US of A, and the only people capable of stopping them are those who could really care less about the American Way: the President's daughter, who shows more respect for culture and history than her parents could ever muster; and Richie the donut store kid, whose primary concern is the welfare of others, specifically his grandmother, who ironically provides him with a way out of this mess. I've only seen this film twice, but it still makes me laugh my head off and provides me with the antidote for the jingoistic finale to the other alien invasion film of 1996, Independence Day.",/review/rw1975590/?ref_=tt_urv

","If you have seen a Burton film before, you have an idea of what to expect. On the other hand, if you have not, it is a little difficult to determine if you will enjoy it or not. What I can say is that this is *not* mainstream or Hollywood. If anything, it mocks the traditions of such. This is tasteless, sick, twisted fun, spoofing and satirizing the army, politics, the media, religion, etc. It also contains homages to the campy sci-fi flicks of the 50's, though you really don't need to be particularly familiar with those to get into this(I'm not, and I laugh my head off). This was my second viewing, and the other time was at least half a decade ago, and yet I remembered nearly everything(and the humor still ""worked"" for me, in spite of me knowing the punchlines). That doesn't happen all that often. The comedy is *hilarious*(with some exceptions that miss the mark), with silly and goofy material, absurdity, brilliantly written dialog and absolutely *no* holding back. This has a magnificent cast(all of them clearly in on it, aware of what the final product would be) and the characters are distinguished and memorable, and all the archetypes are there. The acting is spot-on for nearly every performance; Tom Jones isn't entirely convincing, but it doesn't get to be terribly bothersome. This never stands still, there is a ton of energy in it, and the pacing is fast without being overwhelming. The special effects are good, if you can tell that CGI was relatively new at this point, and the integration between the FX and the live-action elements is reasonable at best. There is plenty of moderately violent and disturbing content, a little mild language and brief(not graphic) sexuality in this. I recommend it to anyone who can imagine that they'd like it. 7/10",/review/rw1975590/?ref_=tt_urv

31 August 2011,KnightsofNi11,7," Great spoof, no matter how silly it gets
","I you're a sci-fi fan you might like this film, you might not. If you're a Tim Burton fan you might like this film, or you might not. I you're a fan of mixed genre films you might like this film, you might not. Personally, I really liked this wacky little flick. Mars Attacks! is a spoof of 1950's sci-fi movies, poking fun at all their cheese and clich√©. It centers around a variety of characters spread out amongst the USA and how they all react and cope with a martian invasion. There's nothing in this film to take seriously and, for what it's worth, I found it to be hilarious and a ridiculous amount of fun, no matter how stupid it can be.",/review/rw1975590/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2005,onepotato2,1," Please stop the pain...!
","Mars Attacks is the kind of movie you watch repeatedly thinking, ""That's a funny idea...."" without ever actually laughing. It shows up frequently on late-night t.v. where I have now given it several 2nd chances; always with a pained expression on my face, while my mind devises elaborate ways to casue Tim Burton pain. The movie needs a lighter touch (which Burton has at this point proved himself incapable of) and it's airhead humor & plotpoints are undermined by the starpower delivery. That goes double for the budget. The ""realism"" of CGI doesn't help an idea as silly as this one. I don't need to believe the martians have the correct radiosity, shadow depth, animation speed etc. to have a laugh, and the production design is pretty much ruined by the digital insertions (...purposely OR obliviously crappy). It would take a cast of nobodies to put this thing over. Watching a cast of overqualified stars trying way too hard to be funny, with a script and a director who can't help them, is remarkably unsatisfying.",/review/rw1975590/?ref_=tt_urv

","What a wild movie! I've begun to appreciate this more and more with multiple viewings. I think it's Tim Burton's most underrated film. Unlike many of his previous films, this seems pretty impartial when it comes to the satire: everyone gets it here, not just the usual Christians. Here, New Ange devotees and Liberal advisers and generals are also made to look stupid. This is probably one reason the national critics - who are overwhelming Left Wing - didn't like this movie.
