7 December 2013,Scarecrow-88,5," The Smurfs 2
","The success of the first live animation Smurfs film obviously meant a sequel in the works to cash in. This was playing over and over and my kids grooved on its repeated viewings. Sufficed to say, I was actually off today and tuned in and out to it over the four or so times it was on.",/review/rw2855425/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2013,gregeichelberger,2," Part 2 twice as bad as the first - if that's conceivable
","When we last left our intrepid tiny blue friends, they had just . . . oh, why bother explaining the plot of this film's predecessor, ""The Smurfs,"" when it's going to be difficult enough to write about this sequel's ridiculous storyline? And, unless one is either under the age of four or in a drug-induced coma, they are not likely to care an iota about it anyway.",/review/rw2855425/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2013,Hellmant,3," The first 'SMURFS' movie was bad and this one is even worse.
","'THE SMURFS 2': One and a Half Stars (Out of Five)   Sequel to the 2011 hit kids' film based on the popular comic-book  (which was later turned into a popular cartoon series in the 1980s) by  Peyo (a Belgian comic-book artist) about little blue people that live  in mushrooms. It once again stars Hank Azaria as the evil wizard  Gargamel and Neil Patrick Harris as the Smurfs' human friend Patrick.  It also features voices by Katy Perry, Jonathan Winters (who the film  was dedicated to, due to his recent passing) and many others as Smurfs.  The film was once again directed by Raja Gosnell and written by the  same team of writers (with Karey Kirkpatrick joining the team). I'd say  it's even worse than the first film in quality, especially since one of  my favorite actresses (Sofia Vergara) didn't return this time around.  This film revolves around Gargamel (Azaria) kidnapping Smurfette  (voiced by Perry), the only female Smurf (which he created), and taking  her back to Paris with him. He needs Papa Smurf's formula for creating  Smurfs (which Smurfette knows) so he can extract the Smurf-essence from  them (which gives him his magical powers). The film introduces two bad  Smurf-like critters that Gargamel also created. They're called  Naughties named Vexy (voiced by Christina Ricci) and Hackus (voice by  J. B. Smoove). The film also gives us a lot of Smurfette's back story  and introduces us to Patrick's stepfather Victor (Brendan Gleeson) as  well.  The first 'SMURFS' movie was bad and this one is even worse. The only  thing I did like about the original movie was it co-starred Sofia  Vergara (like I said) as a domineering antagonist (Patrick's boss). She  was great and extremely sexy in it (like always) but the rest of the  movie was a waste. Both films are pointless and about as dumbed down as  kids' movies get. I did like the cartoon and comic books when I was a  kid but I don't know if a quality live action film could really be  developed from them. So I guess I can't complain too much. Still this  movie, like the first, is a waste of time. Kids might like it though.",/review/rw2855425/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2014,kevingrain,7," If you didn't like the first film, why watch the second?
","I'm really puzzled by these reviews. Firstly, we have people saying they hated the first film but this is even worse. Excuse me, but what kind of stupid do you have to be to watch a sequel to a film you hated? Then there's people who complain that the film is for children? But hey, what did you expect? Well, I expected the worst, I never liked the Smurfs and I'm old enough to remember that awful song from the 70s. I've seen the McDonalds toys and I was prepared to hate this. But every Sunday we take our children to see a movie for a pound and this is what was on. I've seen Despicable Me 2, Turbo, Monsters University, Cloudy with Meatballs 2 and the Rise of the Guardians over the last few weeks on the same terms. I enjoyed those in varying degrees, but I wanted to give this one a miss. But it's for the kids, not me, so I went along. And I guess what, I actually enjoyed it.",/review/rw2855425/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2013,RevRonster,3," It has small improvements but still not for adults...
","There's no point in pulling punches here because, let's face it, these movies are meant as a distraction for kids. The jokes are bad, the acting is cheesy and the story isn't complicated. The whole point of the first film was to be something that will dazzle children with jokes only kids can laugh at and some brightly colored characters dancing across the screen. The formula for this sequel doesn't change that.",/review/rw2855425/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2014,SnoopyStyle,5," Still not good enough
","Gargamel (Hank Azaria) is now a world famous magician. He has created two darker version of Smurfs called Naughties named Vexy and Hackus. Meanwhile Smurfette has doubts about her personality since she was originally created by Gargamel. Papa Smurf had changed her from a Naughtie to a Smurf with a secret spell. Gargamel needs that spell to create real Smurfs to harness the powerful Smurf essence. Gargamel sends Vexy to kidnap Smurfette. Papa Smurf and others return to the real world to rescue Smurfette with the help of Patrick (Neil Patrick Harris), Grace (Jayma Mays) and Victor (Brendan Gleeson).",/review/rw2855425/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2013,kosmasp,6," ""Smurfing"" around
","So the first Smurfs movie was better. But this one has more than it's fair share of moments too. Is it predictable? Yes! But does it have a coherent theme running through it concerning parent hood and moral message that might be a bit hammered into our heads? Yes, though it's still acceptable and doesn't overdo it.",/review/rw2855425/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2013,Anurag-Shetty,7," An enjoyable film but, it is mainly meant for children.
","The Smurfs 2 continues with the adventures of the adorable blue creatures called, Smurfs. When Smurfette(Katy Perry) assumes that the rest of the Smurfs have forgotten her birthday, she's very depressed & wanders off alone. She thinks that she's not a true blue Smurf as she was originally a Naughty created by the evil wizard, Gargamel(Hank Azaria). Meanwhile Gargamel hatches an evil plot to kidnap Smurfette & get her to tell the formula to turn two of his Naughties, Vexy(Christina Ricci) & Hackus(J.B Smoove) into real Smurfs. Vexy enters the portal to Smurf village, kidnaps Smurfette & takes her back to Earth. Now,it is up to Papa(Jonathan Winters), Grouchy(George Lopez), Clumsy(Anton Yelchin) & Vanity(John Oliver) to rescue Smurfette from Gargamel before he coerces her to give him the formula. The Smurfs seek the help of their friends, Patrick(Neil Patrick Harris) his wife, Grace(Jayma Mays) & Patrick's step-dad Victor(Brendan Gleeson). ",/review/rw2855425/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2017,TheLittleSongbird,4," Return of the Smurfs
","Have a good deal of fondness for the original television series, if marginally as a child than an adult. Didn't care for the first feature film from 2011 but didn't find anywhere near as bad as it was made out to be, it had a lot of faults but was semi-watchable.",/review/rw2855425/?ref_=tt_urv

31 July 2013,afijamesy2k,1," La, La, La, La, La, this sequel is a waste of time
","The Smurfs 2 Zero Stars I Remember a long time ago when I Saw the smurfs cartoon, it was funny, charming, amazingly and whimsical, it had tiny blue creatures who battle gargamel and much more, but sadly the smurfs movie was a disaster and it made a big amount of movie at the box office and this one could be even worse, this is one of the most pathetic sequels ever made and one of the worst movies of the year so far, what a joke. this takes place 2 years after the events of the first film when the smurfs time traveled to new york, when in the case smurfette gets kidnapped by the naughties (one of the them played by a truly wasted Christina ricci in a what is she doing in the film like this) and the smurfs go to Paris to save her from gargamel and the naughties, Neil Patrick Harris is wasted yet again as the person who is trying to help the smurfs along with his wife, gargmel played by an embarrassed Hank Azaria of the simpsons fame who is completely lost.",/review/rw2855425/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2015,bryank-04844,2," Even if you enjoy the Smurfs, this sequel might leave a sour taste in your mouth.
","How can you not like Smurfs, whose sole reason for existence is to live a peaceful life full of fun, dancing, singing and love? Not to mention that they live in cool mushroom houses in the forest and all wear the same outfit. If you've wondered what those little blue creatures have been doing since the first film, you can rest easy, as life in the Smurf village has been Smurftastic. I'm sure the only reason we have a sequel is because the first movie made almost $560 million. With this outing, you can expect the same visual pleasantries, but beyond a couple of lines of dialogue that garner a chuckle, I don't see unimaginatively-titled 'The Smurfs 2â€² playing to anyone over the age of five.",/review/rw2855425/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2014,leonblackwood,2," What a terrible movie! 2/10
","Review: Not only was this movie silly and boring, it also put me off of the little blue people which I grew to love as a child. The director made this film just for kids in mind, without a thought about the adults that have to sit through it with there little ones. I should have known what to expect after seeing the first one, but I was hoping that there would have been something for us people without kids. The CGI was done well, but the storyline was terrible and extremely unrealistic. Maybe they shouldn't use real people next time and just keep it in Smurf la la land! ",/review/rw2855425/?ref_=tt_urv

",I liked the first one but I can't say the same about the second one. The Smurfs look fine but the story and characters leave a lot to be desired.

3 September 2013,Horst_In_Translation,6," Smurfing their arms around Paris
","First of all, I'd like to say that I went into this movie thinking it was the first one from 2011 as it was declared on the theater's website. As my plan to watch both films chronologically within one or two days was not successful, please note that I have not seen the first film yet. Another thing I'd like to add is that it's always nice to see a sequel just picking the original title and add a ""2"". Most of the time when the makers play with numbers or add title additions, the result is nothing to be proud of...",/review/rw2855425/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2013,billygoat1071,4," Losing Potential
","These ""The Smurfs"" movies seem to be nothing more than one of those childish animated, live-action hybrid adaptations of classic cartoons/comics that are obviously made for cash-in and distraction for little(r) audiences, but this sequel kind of hooked me. There is something behind the story that might help this being a little more than another juvenile family fare. We're not expecting it to become deeper or darker, but the film would've think that kids need to earn better lessons or genuine heart in their entertainment other than just feeding them with endless slapstick comedy and pop culture references. The Smurfs 2 had some good potential, but the rest stays mediocre.",/review/rw2855425/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2013,sjwicks,9," Great kids film
","Having already seen Despicable me 2 And Monsters University, these summer hols, I took my two kids to see Smurfs 2. I have to say, despite any toffee nosed film critics who have panned this film, we thoroughly enjoyed it. It was equally good, if not better than the two previously mentioned films. The animation, especially the interaction between real life and CGI was impressive. It was funny, fast-moving, and at times emotional. Gargamel's performance was wonderful. Some of the visual effects, such as the ""Roue de Paris"" coming of it's axle and rolling through the streets of Paris were amazing. Ignore the film critics, go there with your kids, and try and watch it through the eyes of a child and enjoy. Great in 3D. We thought it was better than the previous Smurfs movie.",/review/rw2855425/?ref_=tt_urv

4 August 2013,savafiend76,3," Bland and lackluster
","I'm not saying the first Smurfs movie was cinematic genius, but it was at least tolerable. Smurfs 2, for an adult, is agonizingly boring. My kids (ages 9 and 5) enjoyed it, so I guess it's okay for younger children. But honestly, I've seen many kids' movies in the past, and there's usually at least some element of humor in there that adults can appreciate and enjoy too.",/review/rw2855425/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2013,ketgup83,5," slightly disappointed with the sequel. If you are looking to make your kid happy, The Smurfs 2 might be the right appetizer

1 September 2013,coco69-774-831730,3," Boring for adult
","While I have seen a fair number of kids movies over my time (having three children), I, like one of the other reviewers, found the movie boring and did not enjoy. However, my 8 year old really enjoyed it and said we have to buy that movie. I had not seen the prequel to this movie, but it would probably not have improved my review. I did not think the actors were great. Having seen Brendan Gleeson in different roles, it was unusual to see him playing this character and he seemed way out of place. The movie had some touching scenes that step-parents and step children will appreciate. I thought some of the effects were over the top but I guess the movie is aimed mostly to entertain children.",/review/rw2855425/?ref_=tt_urv

22 August 2013,Robert_duder,7," An adorable, sweet, most for the kids movie and good for them!!
","I started my first review of The Smurfs (2011) the same way...because IMDb reviewers were doing the SAME thing they are doing to this. It is being absolutely trashed by adults basically saying...it was no fun...for them. THIS IS A CHILDREN'S MOVIE!! It was made for the kids 110% and so what? We can't make films now that are specifically aimed at a certain demographic? The other part of the reviewers are saying that they watched The Smurfs when they were kids (as I did) and they loved it but found this very disappointing. Well, you aren't ten anymore...and many of you haven't seen The Smurfs since then. Anyways..my point is, don't believe all the negative reviews. The Smurfs 2 is a sweet and cute story that brings our favourite Smurfs back in a new adventure. If you or your children enjoyed the first one then this is more of the same. The new film adds another layer by creating some emotional tension between a son and step-father that was actually really touching and definitely had a knot in the back of my throat it was so moving. There are plenty of safe laughs and chuckles to be had and many silly little moments that will have you smile and probably have kids in stitches.",/review/rw2855425/?ref_=tt_urv
