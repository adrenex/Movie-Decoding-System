14 May 2021,paul-allaer,7," Heavy duty TV mini series is worth checking out but beware...
","""The Underground Railroad"" (2021 release; 10 episodes ranging from 41 to 78 min.) brings an alternative view/take on the actual Underground Railroad of the 19th century. As Episode 1 ""Georgia"" opens, we are introduced to Cora and Caesar, the latter being eager to escape the plantation they are on. Upon hearing black music, one of the plantation masters is enraged and whips one of the slaves half to death. ""It is past time to go"", Caesar implores Cora, and they finally decide to run away in the dead of night...",/review/rw7709371/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2021,mstaffordca,7," Emotionally Hard to watch but excellent quality across the boards!
",Fantastic production value wonderful acting overall a high quality series but beware it is extremely hard to watch at times and gets heart wrenching.. Can get slow at times. But definitely still worth watching!,/review/rw7709371/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2022,zkonedog,5," Didn't Do For Me What The Source Book Did
","When I read Colson Whitehead's ""Underground Railroad"" book, I was impressed by the author's ability to capture the essence--both physically and emotionally--of the institution of slavery in the United States. Unfortunately, this Barry Jenkins TV adaptation didn't do nearly as much of that for me.",/review/rw7709371/?ref_=tt_urv

","The story it self is amazing I loved how there's An actual Underground Railroad and I love the story of the characters. Now to what I didn't like and what almost ruined the whole mini series for me is

6 June 2021,steiner-sam,7," Deeply moving magical realist interpretation of the Underground Railroad
",This 10-part series is filled with deeply impactful scenes of the African-American experience in the South and southern Indiana in the pre-Civil War era.,/review/rw7709371/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2021,Alwnva,9," Must see tv
","Barry Jenkins does what he does best! Beautiful cinematography, amazing score, excellent casting and acting, the pace is deliberate (if not a bit slow). Stand out episodes South Carolina, Fannie Briggs (for the cinematography), Indiana Winter (whew). I love that there aren't any standout stars to distract you as well....that being said you will see a lot for this cast in the future. I definitely recommend but I don't think you should binge it. The subject matter is heavy and you need to allow time to absorb the subtle details.",/review/rw7709371/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2021,kdparrack,10," An adaptation of a moving novel
","I read a few reviews talking about the accuracy/timeliness of the series. Factually, if you haven't read the book by Colson Whitehead, this seems like an inaccurate and propagandistic show. But make no mistake, this series is about the novel. As an adaptation of Whitehead's novel, Jenkins respects the source material and leads a superior cast. Each actor's emotions aren't expressed in the normal way we expect actors to emote. Each character's trauma has repressed their ability to emote and empathize. Cora's story is one of survival - and this adaptation (or what I've seen so far) does a great job at capturing how Cora copes with the changes in her life. And yes - in the case of the show and novel - the Underground Railroad IS real and tangible. Cora actually sees and follows it in the last chapter.",/review/rw7709371/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2021,glenn_gallagher,9," Forget the last 4 years and enjoy!!!
","Dont let today's world climate affect your decision to watch this show. Across the board a fantastic production that ticks all the boxes. Visually amazing, Great story, Good acting but most importantly it captures you from the start. This will be an extremely easy binge watch. The content is pretty fully on so tread lightly, this is not a family watch.",/review/rw7709371/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2021,rchrdcorteel1,4," As weird as Bridgerton
","(Edit: the novel on which this is based not only won the Pulitzer but also the Arthur C Clarke award for best SCIENCE FICTION book of that year, so why is Sci-Fi not mentioned in the classification grouping? Might help some viewers understand better).",/review/rw7709371/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2021,gracenash-54321,10," Haters don't understand that it's fiction with poetic license
","This movie, based on a Pulitzer-winning fantasy fiction novel, is heavy with emotion, violence, and even hope. Those who are looking for fast-paced action or historical accuracy may not enjoy it, but those who appreciate strong characters and a rich story will find it rewarding.",/review/rw7709371/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2021,kirbie-34481,5," Well, it's very well done, but it's so hard to watch
","I'm not saying it's not great, but it's hard to sit through 10 hours of '12 years a slave' level torture & cruelty. I get it happened, but it's impossible to enjoy watching that kind of stuff over & over again in a show, even for a hardcore horror fan like myself. I'm just now in the middle of episode 3 (by fast forwarding most of the torture stuff in episode one because-come on now). I'm hoping it gets less depressing & more about Cora's discovery of herself & her physical journey to actual freedom (not just more & different types of torture by white men). I'm sure it's a great series, that I don't doubt, all I'm just saying is it's hard to stomach. The feelings of guilt you get watching it just knowing you're a white person is difficult, even if I'm not a man, is difficult. I get the need for showing it this way, but time & time again, one person can only handle so much before saying ""is it really necessary that I watch this, or am I just torturing myself for no reason?"" When viewing is no longer enjoyable what is the point of putting yourself mentally (thankfully, not physically) through it all. Sometimes you just don't feel like subjecting ones self to10 hours of depressing ass tragedy at every turn. Hopefully it gets more interesting....",/review/rw7709371/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2021,zinitime,5," This is NOT history
","I expected a show about the Underground Railroad. This isn't that. It starts off on a southern plantation and the horrors of slavery, but, by the end of the first episode, and into the second, you find that it has a real underground train, and slaves, but it is more scifi than history. Bizarre is the word that comes to my mind. I'm not at all sure if I'll follow this to its conclusion. I feel like I'm Alice, and I just fell into the lair of the March Hare. Very strange!",/review/rw7709371/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2021,philthegreatone-786-63058,9," Masterpiece
",This series is so beautifully done. Cora is a slave in the south and decides to escape through an Underground Railroad. She gets captured for a while and struggles to keep hope through the darkness. Her experience is harrowing experience from what she has to go through. The cinematography in this series is gorgeous to look at. The score is incredible. The costumes are really well thought out and beautiful. The story telling in this series so beautiful and interesting to watch. The actress that plays young Cora is amazing in this breakout performance. I highly recommend this series.,/review/rw7709371/?ref_=tt_urv
17 May 2021,drashyagoel,6," Has a few highs, but overall a dreadful bore-fest
","The enormously well-received series starts strong with an incredibly powerful pilot episode, and a very interesting second one. But that's where the charm ends, and the show becomes obsessed with incredibly boring white characters. I dragged it out till episode 8 so far, and will definitely finish the show - but I think it should just have ended at Episode 2.",/review/rw7709371/?ref_=tt_urv

20 May 2021,angeljs-1,6," Not as gripping as it tries to be
","First of all, I was a bit shocked to see this rated PG. It should have been at the very least a 12. The first episode, especially, is very gritty with some disturbing scenes. Perhaps not at graphic as some shows today, but still not for children, IMHO.",/review/rw7709371/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2021,Michael Fargo,10," Manifest Destiny
","I don't know who gave Barry Jenkins the project of filming Colson Whitehead's Pulitzer Prize winning novel, ""The Underground Railroad,"" but thank you. Not only does this series do it's subject matter justice, it also elevates the form of episodic television series out of it's often sensational form and puts it squarely into an that of an art form. Each episode could be a stand-alone feature length film. And Jenkins has said that he needed a ""long form"" to tell this story because the ""hard"" scenes are so disturbing, they overwhelm the ""soft"" parts of the film. Watching the end result, I'm not sure he entirely succeeds in putting enough between the manifestations of horror of the subject matter, but he certainly pulls out all the stops in an effort to do so. From location scouting, to costume design, to cinematography, all pulled together by a soundtrack that is not just the score by Nicholas Britall, but a soundscape that includes insects, industrial, animal and natural sounds like trees rustling or wind moaning, it all fused together perfectly..",/review/rw7709371/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2021,sciencguy,3," An actual railroad?
",Dropped out after episode 1. Too many dark scenes where there are only moving shadows. To many unnecessary mini-flashbacks. Too many scenes with the lens looking directly into the sun. A lot of stilted and over the top acting. Choppy and poorly edited. And then there's the actual Underground Railroad that rolls up and takes them away. That was the last straw.,/review/rw7709371/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2021,fede4488,5," More slavery misery porn.
",I could barely finish the first episode but I still wanted to keep watching because I love Barry Jenkins work. I made it to the third episode. It's like watching an extended cut of 12 Years as Slave. Except the ending never arrives.,/review/rw7709371/?ref_=tt_urv
16 May 2021,james-s-walker3,5," Decent But Not For Everyone
",This mini-series has pretty good acting and has some beautiful scenery. But I didn't feel like I was always watching a young woman's attempt to escape slavery as much as a 10-part Twilight Zone or Black Mirror.,/review/rw7709371/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2021,judywalker2,5," Could have been really imaginative
","I had been meaning to start this series as soon as I heard about it on Amazon. It was billed as a reimagination of the underground railroad with a real train. Well there is a train but real imagination is interrupted constantly by terrible, unnecessary, repetitive reality that we know. That reality undoes all of the imaginative elements of the story. Too much time is spent on stereotypical characters (the overseer, the slave master, the slave hunter) when what we are really interested in is the story of Black people, where they would go on their journey and how they might see their world change or not change. That story come in bits and pieces and is jerky and sometimes difficult to follow. I did finish the first season, now that they have gotten rid (I hope they got rid of) an annoying character, they can concentrate on an imaginative Black story if they have another season.",/review/rw7709371/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2021,hunkazine,1," Awful...stay away from this trash!
","Not history. Perhaps some person's fantasy twisted into the title. This has nothing to do with the actual events of the underground railroad. No factual events. Merely jumbled, mumbled Inflammatory nonsense. Should be viewed by...no one.",/review/rw7709371/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2021,JimtownSteve,1," WTF?
","I was one of the viewers who watched this not knowing the story is a based on a book that is a total fiction about the brutality of slavery (which is not fiction) . I was confused, expecting an historical drama and was surprise to be watching, well, I don't know what. I had to Google to figure out WTF is this? Having realized it's a violent made-up fiction I thought I'd give it a shot tho and I pressed on.",/review/rw7709371/?ref_=tt_urv
