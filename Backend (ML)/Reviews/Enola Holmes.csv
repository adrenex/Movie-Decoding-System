20 April 2014,lee_eisenberg,10," nothing can show us the full brutality of slavery, but this comes close
","Solomon Northup's story of his kidnapping and sale into slavery got widely read upon its original publication but then disappeared as the Confederates built up an idealized image of the antebellum south (exemplified in ""Gone with the Wind""). Now that Northup's story has gotten brought to the screen, it's important for everyone to see it. ""12 Years a Slave"" not only takes an uncompromising look at the sheer brutality of slavery, but also shows how nothing could take away Northup's dignity and his hope that he would one day be a free man again. One of the ugliest scenes is the whipping of a slave for perceived disobedience.",/review/rw2939725/?ref_=tt_urv

","Greetings again from the darkness. Should this be labeled a historical drama? Is it one man's extraordinary tale of strength and survival? Does this fall into the ""art film"" category that so divides the movie-going public? The answer to all is YES, and I would add that it's a masterfully crafted film with exquisite story telling, stunning photography and top notch acting throughout.",/review/rw2939725/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2014,Sergeant_Tibbs,9," 12 Years A Slave earns the right to be called one of the best films of the year.
","If any contemporary director deserves to be in the mainstream spotlight without compromising their style, it's Steve McQueen. His debut, Hunger, already had the hand of a confident filmmaker taking a fly-on-the-wall style to the grimy art-house. Shame was one of the finest films of its year for its impeccable depiction of an addiction to one of humanity's primal survival instincts resulting in self-destruction. I'm so happy that his latest film has gracefully conquered early Oscar favourites from the output of David O. Russell, Martin Scorsese and the now delayed film from George Clooney to become this year's Oscar frontrunner. During its festival run when the buzz first began, I took it upon myself to read the screenplay. While I can usually sink scripts within a few hours, the poetic density of 12 Years A Slave took several sittings across a week or two. Even on the page it was a harrowing, exhausting experience. It's a film that needs a have a gut to truly display the length of time, but the script is bloated in its brilliance.",/review/rw2939725/?ref_=tt_urv

22 September 2013,tigerfish50,9," Abducted to a Southern hell
","Considering the social and economic importance of slavery in America's history, the scarcity of serious films depicting the daily life of slaves in the Confederate States is significant - especially since the after-effects from this shameful episode still echo through the culture. '12 Years a Slave' is based upon the memoirs of Solomon Northup, who endured a hellish period of enslavement in Louisiana, which is backed up by legal records.",/review/rw2939725/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2013,tavm,10," 12 Years a Slave is quite a compelling depiction of slavery at its most harrowing
","Just watched this true story of slavery with my movie theatre-working friend. It depicts the abduction of Soloman Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) from his family in New York State to the bayous of Louisiana (my home state) where he is made a slave. Director Steve McQueen does a fine job depicting how harrowing the experience is and provides catharsis when the ending comes. He also does a nice job of providing some background of other fellow slaves like that of the doomed Patsy. If anyone who paid to see this expected to watch Brad Pitt in a big role, they must have been disappointed to see him in only a couple of scenes but he does well in those and I have to assume most of the public was enthralled by the story to not even care by that point. Anyway, I highly recommend 12 Years a Slave if you want to be challenged as a viewer by the way someone is depicted as the main character is here. Oh, and nice shots of the Louisiana locations.",/review/rw2939725/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2014,gsygsy,10," As high as cinema can go
","It's rare that a movie lives up to its hype, even rarer that the hype is transcended by the actual achievement. 12 YEARS A SLAVE does both. Aided by powerful performances and cinematography, director McQueen exposes the barbarity of dehumanisation, of treating people as property. Reviews focus on the brutality on display, and it's true that the film is not easy to watch, with its powerful juxtaposition of sublime scenery and human degradation. But to me the final scene is the most powerful of all: we are party to the kind of raw emotion that in the hands of lesser artists could easily descend into tawdriness or sentimentality. Here, as in the rest of the film, it is raised up high, as high as cinematic art can go.",/review/rw2939725/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2014,rogerdarlington,," A very special piece of film making
","Let's be honest about it: this spotlight on the darkest days of American history is a particularly British triumph. The brilliant director (and artist) Steve McQueen and outstanding Chiwetel Ejiofor, as the eponymous Solomon Northup, are both British; even Michael Fassbender, in the main support role as a sadistically brutal slave-owner, is half British; and Benedict Cumberbatch makes an appearance as a 'kinder' slave owner.",/review/rw2939725/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2014,asda-man,10," 12 minutes of heartbreak (plus an extra 140)
","Steve Mcqueen is proving himself to be a director to look out for. I wasn't a huge fan of his debut, Hunger, as I found it too pro-IRA and slow. However, I thought that the directing was pretty outstanding and it had a distinct style. Shame is a film I've yet to see, but I've heard plenty of rave reviews. 12 Years a Slave looks to be Mcqueen's masterpiece. It's film-making at it's most effective and powerful. I cam away from the film feeling incredibly moved as I sat there in silence along with the rest of the crowd as the credits came up. 12 Years a Slave dares to bare all in a way that most mainstream films would be afraid of doing. Mcqueen shows all the unflinching brutality to create an overwhelming sense of power. I'm used to watching harrowing and depressing films, but these are normally little known like, Dancer in the Dark and The Seventh Continent. 12 Years a Slave is very much mainstream, yet I still found it incredibly harrowing and brutal. Mainstream audiences are go to in for a nasty shock.",/review/rw2939725/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2014,binducherungath,10," Soulfully depicts the human tragedy...
","Twelve Years a Slave is an adaptation of the 1853 memoir of the same name by Solomon Northup, a New-York state born free Negro who was kidnapped in Washington D.C. in 1841 and sold into slavery. He worked on plantations in the state of Louisiana for twelve years before his release. It is depressing, sad, annoying, frustrating to watch what Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) went through his 12 years as a slave. A great performance by Chiwetel Ejiofor whose act of bewilderment, despair, anguish, trying to survive is just outstanding. There are moments when with no sound and little movement, he projects what hopelessness looks like. His 12 years of unthinkable abuse, backbreaking labour, fading dreams of happy family, desperateness to figure a way out to his freedomÂ…every act moves us. The brutality, dehumanizing acts of the masters make it so tough to even look at the screen.",/review/rw2939725/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2013,maurice_yacowar,9," Black northerner sold into slavery and survives
","Like the whipping scenes we uncomfortably witness, in 12 Years a Slave the sting comes in the tail. The end titles tell us neither the slave pen manager nor Solomon Northup's kidnappers were punished. Solomon is saved, but that individual justice does not redefine the terrible system. Racism, slavery and savage injustice persist at film's end. Of course, the point is that even after the Civil War, the freeing of the slaves, the Civil Rights Movement and its legal and societal successes, racism and injustice persist. Hardly a major daily newspaper passes without a reminder, whether it's a regressive change in the voters' rights laws or a Florida bully justified in ""standing his ground"" against the unarmed black kid he hunted. 12 Years a Slave reminds us what contemporary America grew out of and where too much of its roots remain.

3 November 2013,george.schmidt,10," One of the year's very best; Ejiofor gives an Oscar-worthy performance in courage.
","12 YEARS A SLAVE (2013) **** Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender, Benedict Cumberbatch, Lupita Nyong'o, Sarah Paulson, Paul Dano, Paul Giamatti, Alfre Woodard, Brad Pitt, Garrett Dillahunt, Michael K. Williams, Â Kelsey Scott, Quvenzhane Wallis, Cameron Zeigler, Scoot McNairy, Christopher Berry, Bill Camp, Devyn A. Tyler, Willo Jean-Baptiste. Remarkable true- life account of slavery in America based on the biography of freeman African-American Solomon Northup (Ejiofor in an incredible performance that is truly Oscar-worthy), who is tricked and abducted while on a trip from New York to Washington and sold into slavery against his will where he burdens many hardships in his long journey into hell. John Ridley's powerful adaptation of Northup's book is a surprisingly clear-eyed, warts-and-all blinding depiction of how history can be a personal gauntlet in spite of the tremendous odds against surviving. Filmmaker Steve McQueen uses all the archetypes of the Southern 'hospitality' usually seen in the genre of a Civil War treatise but doesn't flinch at all in the underpinnings of what is a true blight of humanity. Equally powerful in their acting (and award noticing) are Fassbender as Solomon's cruelest master with nothing but pure hatred broiling at the surface and a heartbreaking stoic turn by newcomer Nyong'o as the 'personal' slave he terrorizes to no end. One of the year's very best films.",/review/rw2939725/?ref_=tt_urv

","A few years ago now, Mel Gibson made Passion of the Christ; a film which essentially is one long tale of suffering of Jesus on his way to the cross. It was a film that I found to be as vacuous as pornography and an ordeal to sit through because I lost all feeling for the character as he became little more than the subject for violence. I mention this because I worried that this film would be the same as it is very much an issue film and much has been written about how numbing it is in terms of the content.

11 January 2014,ironhorse_iv,9," A powerful movie that brings in new light to the dark topic of slavery.
","12 Years a Slave is indeed a very powerful movie. Directed by Steve McQueen, and written by John Ridley, the movie is an adaptation of the 1853 autobiography by Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a New York State-born free man who was kidnapped in Washington, D.C. in 1841 and sold into slavery in the South. Chiwetel Ejiofor did a great job, acting as Solomon Northup, and it wouldn't surprise me, if he wins a couple of awards for it. The supporting cast is just as amazing. I give mad props to both Benedict Cumberbatch, and Michael Fassbender for their performance as plantation owner, beloved William Ford and crude Edwin Epps. There are too many powerful performances scenes to count, but I had to choice some, it would be, the scene where Solomon is nearly lynch by John Tibeats (Paul Dano) and he is just hanging out there, while the other slaves couldn't do anything about it. Last is the trials and misfortune of Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o) with her being abuse by both Epps and his evil wife played by Sarah Paulsen. The movie doesn't have too much over the top moments, and seem very accurate. The movie puts a lot of insight, you wouldn't see in much modern movies today. First off, there is the good heart, slave owner William Ford. You would never see that in any other movie, as movies about slavery have all slave owners as a crude one-dimension evil human beings. Second off, you wouldn't see a white field hand (Garret Dillahunt) working besides the slaves in other films. To accurately depict the time period of the film, the filmmakers did a great job capturing the language, the look, and locations of the time. Still, the film did take artistic license, and create some new drama like the scene where a sailor kill a slave. One thing, I didn't like about the film is some of the music. Don't get me wrong, I found the songs, Roll Jordan Roll, and the classical American folk music great, but the soundtrack by Han Zimmer is kinda sound not new. Most of the emotional music being play in the background, remind me too much of 'Time' from Han Zimmer's 2010 soundtrack for the film, 'Inception'. It's seem recycled. Another thing that is bothering people is the flow of the film over the 12 years. It seems to go, really quick over the years. When he was kidnapped in the beginning, his children were kids and he looked about mid 30's. Throughout the movie he doesn't look any older at all or aged. The point is, they could have done was to add the age look for the characters because you can't tell that 12 years are going by or let us know that time is passing by. But it didn't feel like 12 years for me. It more felt like a matter of about 4 months. Maybe if they had showed seasons changing or done makeup on the actors to show them getting older it would have been better. About the brutality of the film, it was there, it wasn't too gruesome in my opinion. It was a lot harder to watch 1997's Amistad than this. I wouldn't say, this movie is for all audience, but I do agree, young mature adults should watch it. I don't find the movie, putting a white guilt to anybody, nor do I say, this is a movie trying to start hatred against whites for their ancestor mistakes. If anything, it is part of the healing process, for the most part, I found myself, not anger, but understanding what people went through back then. Most black audiences would agree with me. I have to say, all people of every race need to see this film, even if it's not teaching you anything new that you don't already know. The reason why people should see this film is indeed, while slavery seems like old practice, it still acts upon the modern world through sex trade, and the misused of illegal workers. Such modern sense of slavery need to quickly end. Indeed, if you like this movie, do check out, 1984's TV movie, Solomon Northup's Odyssey starting Avery Brooks. It's well done as well. Overall: While it did had a limited release, it is a must watch.",/review/rw2939725/?ref_=tt_urv
