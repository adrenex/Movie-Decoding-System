16 July 2011,DonFishies,8," Bittersweet, emotionally uplifting and distinctly hilarious
","Crazy, Stupid, Love. is one of, if not the best, American romantic comedies of the past decade. This may come as a shock to some (as it surely took me aback) but there is no other way to describe it. Going into an advanced screening of the film earlier this week, I had my doubts that it would be anything outside of generic. But instead of tripe, I got one of the most unexpected surprises I have seen all year.",/review/rw4392269/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2021,Instant_Palmer,9," Carrell/Gosling Synergy Drives This Zany Buddy-Film/Romantic Comedy
","When it all comes together in an ensemble romantic comedy, it takes a great script, spot-on casting, inspired acting, timing, synergy, and brilliant direction. Crazy, Stupid Love has it all. Arguably, the best romantic-comedy of the new millennium era, CSL synchronized two directors and a screenwriter who had all previously been noted for their top success in animation films and television including the 'Cars' franchise, 'Tangled' and 'Angry Beavers' (in addition to non-animation film), along with the brilliant Casting Director Cindy Marin who had casted 'Juno' a few years earlier.",/review/rw4392269/?ref_=tt_urv

31 July 2011,ferguson-6,7," Creme Brulee or a Divorce?
","Greetings again from the darkness. From the opening scene it is clear we aren't in for a typically lame rom-com with caricatures instead of characters and punchlines instead of feelings. Instead, this one is all about the characters and their feelings ... realistic feelings of pain, anger, hope and frustration. Now don't misunderstand. It doesn't go too deep and there is still plenty of humor in the moments.",/review/rw4392269/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2011,IronBallsM,," I enjoyed everything about this movie.
","My initial reaction is that this film is the best romantic comedy that I've seen in years. The genre has been pretty devoid of quality lately. So, I don't know if that plays a part or not and I really don't care at this point. I enjoyed everything about this movie. It has tremendous heart and charisma and it's so very easy to get caught up in to the lives of these characters. A certain degree of patience is required while viewing because some secondary characters that feel unnecessary to the story are worth getting to know. Steve Carell's character is the one everyone empathizes with and when the movie shifts away from the ""A"" story you wonder why and start to think that the ""B"" story is going to be muddled or cliché or one to endure. Well, they're not and everything comes together in a wonderful fashion. The entire cast here is perfection. The overall message may be one to debate but it doesn't matter because the ride and this film are just so smart and so well done.",/review/rw4392269/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2011,Reel_starz,9," Crazy, Stupid, Love is a real crowd-pleaser
","It was roughly two-thirds of the way into Crazy, Stupid, Love when I realized how invested the audience in my theater had become. The key scene involved a mom cleaning her daughter's room, a seemingly mundane moment that produced gasps and cries of ""Oh no!"" even before the character makes a very revealing discovery. It's a scene that, much like the rest of Crazy, Stupid, Love, a heartwarming and, at times, painfully honest depiction of three couples at various stages in each of their relationships, unfolds not with predictability so much as inevitability. Unlike your average, generic romantic-comedy, this movie focuses less on the end, on who will end up with whom, than on the special and often surprising connections that are made along the way. What's more, it achieves the remarkable and all-too-rare feat of actually moving the audience to care about the central characters, to cheer when they come out on top and sympathize when they don't.",/review/rw4392269/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2011,TheLittleSongbird,9," A very surprising Rom-com, and one of Steve Carrell's best ever performances
","I have nothing personal against Rom-coms, it's just that sometimes a film really surprises you in a good way or it falls flat on its face. Crazy, Stupid, Love fortunately belongs in the former category. If there was anything that lets Crazy, Stupid, Love down, it was that the film stumbles a little in the final act.",/review/rw4392269/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2011,nicki9112,9," It works
","You know usually I'm not into romantic comedies, as I find that most of them fall short & are extremely cheesy. I really liked this movie though. One of the great things about it, is the acting is great. Everyone plays their part perfectly and you actually kind of feel for them in their individual situations. Usually when I think of Steve Carell, I think of a jokester. He was great in his serious scenes though, very believable. And Ryan Gosling, Oh my goodness, Ryan Gosling. He has always been one of my favorite actors. He plays a ladies man in this movie, trying to get Carell back on his feet after splitting with his wife. The two of them have great chemistry together and provide plenty of laughs, along with touching moments. I just saw this movie yesterday and I already want to see it again. That almost never happens that I want to see a movie again right away. Very cute. This movie has a little bit of everything and I think that most people would enjoy it. 9/10!",/review/rw4392269/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2012,kosmasp,9," Not without flaws, but ...
","There is a moment (or two), where the movie is close to lose its way or get off its track. But it's only a momentary thing that will go away almost instantly. It manages to go through the clichés without hurting itself. And while women might only be interested in Ryan Gosling (and who can blame them?), there is more to the movie than that. It is rare that a romantic comedy can be as good as this.",/review/rw4392269/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2018,TheMovieDiorama,8," Crazy, Stupid, Love literally sums up my life right now.
","The ironic and embarrassing thing is, the person I was watching this with knows how relatable the theme of ""finding your one true soul mate"" is currently. This will be difficult to review without affecting me personally, but when a film does that to you it just goes to show how powerful the art can be. We follow a variety of characters as they explore the emotion of love. A middle aged couple going through a divorce, a babysitter who has fallen for her employee, a young boy who's in love with the babysitter, a promiscuous dating expert who eventually finds ""the one"" and a young woman hoping for a proposal. Eventually, we find that these characters interlink in a sprawling narrative detailing the joys and sorrows of love. Despite all that, the biggest element that resonated with me the most was to never give up fighting for the one you love. And I know the person this refers to in my life will read this review, and I know they will do everything in their power to not acknowledge my true feelings...but it's worth fighting for right? Absolutely, and the film conveys that message eloquently, particularly in the third act which I did not see coming at all. I literally shouted ""no...nooo...NOOO!"" as one character attempts to regain a form of relationship, albeit goes terribly wrong. The narrative consistently switches between characters, reminiscent of the classic rom com 'Love Actually', which keeps the pacing interesting. Acting was emotionally investing from everyone. Ryan Gosling shows us that his comedic timing is excellent, Steve Carell is able to perform some dramatic scenes and Julianne Moore is always dependable. Emma Stone's character needed a larger amount of screen time, I felt her character was unevenly balanced. We see practically nothing of her in the first two acts and then she becomes the main attraction in the third. It just meant I hadn't warmed to her like I did with the other characters. I thoroughly enjoyed this though, I laughed, teared up and smiled. Love hurts dammit!",/review/rw4392269/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2020,UniqueParticle,10," I love this movie!
","Such a wonderful rom-com with great writing! Ryan Gosling is superb as the ladies man and I love how Steve Carell is great in the drama aspect. Crazy, Stupid, Love is so enjoyable throughout with amazing charm and soundtrack! Not like most divorce films which is a pleasant surprise; every scene has feel-good entertainment embed in it perfectly.",/review/rw4392269/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2011,Danusha_Goska,9," Warm, Surprising, Funny, Grown-Up. Worth Seeing
","""Crazy Stupid Love"" is funny, warm, well-made, and grow-up. Ryan Gosling gives an Academy-Award winning performance as the lounge lizard who outdoes all lounge lizards. There are unexpected, politically incorrect, farcical moments, and at least one classic love scene that did something no other love scene I've ever seen has done. I laughed out loud and came close to crying. ",/review/rw4392269/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2013,tr91,8," fresh & clever comedy
","Romantic comedies aren't usually my kind of thing but I thought this film was great. The cast is strong (Gosling, Stone, Carell) which is the main reason I chose to watch this film. It is quite a long film but the plot is really clever. There is plenty of different things going on in the film and the way it all gets linked together is brilliant and certainly something I did't see coming.",/review/rw4392269/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2011,iheart_ny,10," Crazy Stupid Love
","Let me start off my review of this film by saying that I hate Steve Carrell. Watching him on ""The Office"" for all those years was painful, because his character, and it seemed his acting style was unbelievably stupid and bland. While he has occasionally been a decent funnyman, I hadn't seen him in a role where he was remotely interesting and believable.",/review/rw4392269/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2012,cat_ranchero,8," Better than expected!...
","I actually found it quite engaging eventually; it was a little hard to get into at first but when the narrative began to settle down I could see a structure there that had potential. Brief summary: When Emily Weaver (Julianne Moore) announces to her husband Cal (Steve Carell) that she wants a divorce, his world collapses around him. She had slept with another man, David Lindhagen (Kevin Bacon) and Cal finds that hard to take since they had been together since high school. He takes to going to bars to drown his sorrows and is taken under the wing of Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling) who shows him how to dress, behave and (most importantly) how to pick up women. At this he is quite successful (eventually) but he feels there is still something missing. Meanwhile there are a couple of other sub-plots going on. One involves Cal's son, Robbie (Jonah Bobo), who has become infatuated with his babysitter, Jessica (Analeigh Tipton). She, meanwhile is holding a torch for Cal With me so far?... Also, there is law student, Hannah (Emma Stone) who Jacob had been unsuccessful in picking up when we first meet him (I can't really say any more about her without giving too much away, so here I'll stop). All these threads eventually tie together in what (at times) appears like a French farce, but which does ultimately have a very valid point.",/review/rw4392269/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2011,littlemartinarocena,5," Somewhere between crazy and stupid
","I loved Glenn Ficarra and John Requa's ""I Love You Philip Morris"" but it must have been terribly frustrating for them, having to wait 2 years for the release and then, not finding an audience in sufficient numbers, not even with Jim Carrey. ""Crazy Stupid Love"" seems like a totally understanding attempt to go main stream and get the kind of box office response that will allow them to go on. I think Ficarra and Requa are two enormous talents - remember their script for ""Bad Santa? - the market needs made them do this silly, complacent, undercooked comedy. Something so far away from what they've done before that I hope we haven't lost them forever. I didn't believe for a minute that Julianne Moore and Steve Carrell were a couple. I love Ryan Gosling but didn't believe for a minute he will dedicate himself to the Carrell character. And Carrell's outburst at his son's graduation seems a monumental miscalculation. What's great about stealing your own son's thunder. I don't get Carrell, I must confess. I can't wait for him to play a serial killer. That will get him an Oscar nomination. To make things even more puzzling, Kevin Bacon plays a joke of a part and he's photographed without any regard. I'm puzzled and a little bit annoyed.",/review/rw4392269/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2017,zkonedog,10," Strong In Every Area
","Usually, I'm not a huge fan of this rom-com genre. There are just too many opportunities for films of this nature to go astray, from acting to story to ridiculousness. Fortunately, ""Crazy Stupid Love"" doesn't fall prey to those traps and instead provides a tight, stylish, funny, and even moving production that appeals to a broad range of movie-watchers.",/review/rw4392269/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2020,Kirpianuscus,," useful
","I am far to be one of the fans of Ryan Gosling. But this film changed a lot in my perspective about him. I saw, very often, Steve Carell as a decent comedy actor. But , it this film, he gives more than a conventional demonstration of his skills. The film has the virtue of apparence. It seems, in the first part, another one about relations, a sort of genius from lamp changing the life - sentimental first- of a family father, couple crisis and nice comedy. But its developpment is real impressive. It is a film about love, off course, but, more significant, about small things defining each of us, from family to acceptance of yourself. And that does it real special. And usefull.",/review/rw4392269/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2021,classicsoncall,7," ""I'm in"".
","The film was like a different spin on ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"", except in this one, Steve Carell's character is married with a family. When his wife (Julianne Moore) states she wants a divorce, he goes into a painful period of tutoring by consummate womanizer Jacob (Ryan Gosling), in order to learn how to pick up women. ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" is a romantic comedy that raises eyebrows at times, but ultimately brings our guy Cal (Carell) full circle back to his one time high school girlfriend Emily (Moore) amid a series of rash encounters and undisclosed identities. It gets farcical at times, especially near the finale when Cal and Emily's backyard barbecue turns into a free for all when all the supporting players show up. A side story involving newly barred lawyer Hannah (Emma Stone) with Gosling's character seeks to exonerate his womanizing ways, while thirteen year old Robbie (Jonah Bobo) suffers the pangs of young love attempting to win a high school sweetheart. It's not made evident up front that Hannah has a connection to the troubled couple at the center of the story, but the astute viewer will make the connection before Jacob does. Some questionable scenes aside, the story works as an effective rom-com that ends on a positive note for all parties involved, though one might question seventeen year old Jessica's (Analeigh Tipton) parting gift to her not so secret admirer Robbie. That seemed a bit on the tasteless side.",/review/rw4392269/?ref_=tt_urv

8 October 2011,JimmyCollins,6," Not as great as everyone says but it's still a notch above the usual romantic comedy.
","After seeing the trailer a million times at theaters I was looking forward to seeing Crazy Stupid Love as it has one of my favorite actors in it, Julianne Moore. It looked to me like a smart romantic comedy for adults with a bit of an edge, which is exactly what it is, the story is fresh and appeals to a broad age range, the Steve Carrell/Julianne Moore storyline appeals to the older married demographic and the Ryan Gosling/ Emma Stone storyline appeals to the younger hipper generation.",/review/rw4392269/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'm not much of a fan of 'rom-coms' (maybe being a guy?!), but I am a big fan of Steve Carell, so I figured I'd give 'Crazy, Stupid, Love' a go and, I'm pleased to say, that I wasn't disappointed. If you've ever watched one romantic comedy then you've pretty much seen the formula, i.e. boy meets girl, boy loses girl etc. And, 'Crazy, Stupid, Love' doesn't really deviate from this (is that a 'spoiler?'). However, just because it doesn't reinvent the wheel in terms of story-telling, doesn't mean it isn't fun.",/review/rw4392269/?ref_=tt_urv
