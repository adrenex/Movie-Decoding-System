","No wonder most of the comments are negative. Perhaps because we need something to pass the time in lockdown we stuck with this, but the actors were let down by a pretty daft script. The worst flaw was the casting of Cody Molko as Daniel. He's a most likeable and sympathetic young actor, but there's more than a hint of the Orient in his looks: the photo of Mark with an Asian woman should have told Jodie that he was their son rather than hers, who we saw aged 4, looking Anglo-Saxon. This made Daniel's alacrity in believing he was Tom incredible. Other flaws? I never bought Jodie's brother as a QC: night-club bouncer maybe, but not a QC. Would a QC be so influential he could arrange for DNA results to be falsified? The idea that a bunch of lowlife thugs living in squalor were able to magic up forgeries of a DBS certificate and a passport was equally ridiculous. Would an academy be so desperate for staff that they'd employ Jodie as a music teacher when she had no teaching qualifications or experience? Why did Jodie's brother row Daniel to the middle of the lake, clearly intending to throw him overboard, then bring him back and lock him in a shed or container? Just because Jodie was a distraught mother would the police really let her get away with false pretences, kidnapping, the attack on Mark, stealing his car and then giving it to the head gangster as part payment for the forged passport? Having said all that it was quite intriguing and, perhaps foolishly, we stayed to the end.",/review/rw6563691/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2021,carolynocean,1," WORDS FAIL ME!
","The whole storyline is ridiculous and unbelievable.
It is just impossible that this could happen in real life.
How on earth did this make it to our screens? and for four nights!
I am still speechless even a week on.
The biggest mystery to me was what on earth were they doing in that
garden business????? it looked like they were trimming the same hedge
for the entire series, and not very well at that!
Thats really all that I can say about this farce of a drama",/review/rw6563691/?ref_=tt_urv

4 February 2021,gallagherkellie,2," So ridiculous
","I can handle a bit far fetched when watching a fictional tv show but this is just laughable!!
Why would the police and ex husband be SO dismissive of Daniel from the beginning? They never found his body so all they had to do was a quick check, even if it was to prove that she was wrong.
Who just starts a job as a teacher without actually been properly hired? She just walked into a classroom and started teaching? And is rude to the principal and HR lady and isn't fired?
Why wouldn't she have told her best friend or close brother about all this?
Why would the mother invite the ex husband and wife to dinner after he cheated on her daughter and they have no ties anymore?
Why wouldn't she have just gotten a DNA test and proved he was her son BEFORE deciding to take him?
Why would she walk into the bad guy's home and talk to them like that?
Honestly so much is laughable! I'm still watching because there are only going to be 4 episodes. I've watched 3 so far.",/review/rw6563691/?ref_=tt_urv

","Three episodes in and nothing is getting any better. Having stolen a bunch of strange keys the lead actress knows exactly which key is for what. The boy has only one facial expression - pained!

","When I saw a new British crime series I was so excited. What a huge letdown. It's absolutely ridiculous and at times downright hilarious, which I'm sure the actors, producers and directors were not aiming for. Seriously, don't waste your time ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž",/review/rw6563691/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2021,colleypop,1," Well acted but oh, what a daft plot (episode1)
","Well acted, good locations, but surely if her son's body was never found and it was suspected that he could have been abducted, then as soon as she found where he lived, the poluce would have paid a visit. A quick check of his birth certificate and a DNA test, and all over bar the shouting in episode one.",/review/rw6563691/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2021,namstonk,1," Truly awful
","Bad acting, terrible directing and a score that just waffles on throughout, typical soap rubbish. However it's the story and dialogue that should win the prizes for being utterly rotten. Not one aspect is believable, mind this was written by someone who used to write for TV's Crossroads. Do not bother, you'll drown in your own drool.",/review/rw6563691/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2021,senorcoxy,1," Absolute Drivel
","I have never watched a channel 5 drama and I never will again. How or why Jill Halfpenny and Rupert Penny Jones agreed to this is beyond me. The simple premise of a is it or isn't it story of a drowned child is dragged out over 4 hours and could have been told simpler and more effectively in 1 and a half. The forged CRB, the side story of gangster,forger, car wash. The garden artist business , the lack of any proper police procedure. The brother barrister who can manipulate DNA tests in a phone call. The Family gatherings that include the ex and his new wife and the fact that the Dad did not visit his son for over 2 days when he reappeared after 10 years. The massive house that she lives in but can't find Â£500 from her bank account. It was the most ridiculous piece of drama and writing I have seen. I have seen some tripe in my time but this takes the biscuit I would say avoid at all costs but during lockdown we are really at the bottom of a very deep barrel.",/review/rw6563691/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2021,alexbeaumontpokemon,1," Man bad, woman good: typical Channel 5 mess
","As someone with basic logic and knowledge of the world, I felt like this show was patronising me.
Where do I start with this? Let's start with the actual basis of this show. Jodie is a total creep. She isn't some hero like you are meant to adore. She sees a boy who looks like her missing child, so what does she do? That's right, she stalks him. No, I don't mean she looks at his dad's Facebook and LinkedIn. I mean she actually follows him to his school, goes to his house and then forms an extremely inappropriate relationship with him when she gets a job in his school just to stalk him.
On that subject, the writers clearly don't understand how DBS checks work. Not even going to bother indulging the blatant stupidity so I'm leaving it at that. Anyway, she leaves her ""friend"" to struggle in their landscaping company alone before getting her other colleague beaten up and stealing money from the company account. She seems rational and kind, doesn't she?
Now we're onto my favourite character in the show: the fake passport guy. He is so original of a character, an Eastern European bald man in a long black coat who runs his dodgy dealings through a car wash, which is complete with a burning bin. How they came up with this complex never-seen-before character I will never know.
As the show progresses and the tumour that it planted into my head continues to grow, we see the boy -who has the judgement and reasoning of a sock- completely forget about the man who raised him in favour of the ramblings of a nutcase. He believes he is Jodies missing son, who conveniently had the same scar and hair, and then they go to the fake passport man so that they can flee the country in a van with Jodie's business details on the side of it instead of use their brains. Of course they're detained. Who'd have seen it coming?
A DNA test is done by the police and Jodie's brother is very coincidentally involved. He changes the outcome of the test to keep Jodie out of the prison cell she belongs in. Surprise surprise. So, Daniel (Jodie's alleged son) sees his father get thrown in jail, threatened with 20 years of prison time.
Jodie of course, gets away with everything and social services decide it is perfectly fine for her to be the sole guardian of Daniel. I mean, I know they're useless but are they that useless? After all, Jodie has committed multiple crimes including:
-stalking
-kidnapping
-using a false DBS certificate
-attempting to take a kidnapped child across the border with a counterfeit passport
-assault
But no, I forgot, she's a woman in a Channel 5 show.
Finally, we're nearly at the end of this sh!tshow. For some reason (wait, reason doesn't apply to this show) Jodie's brother decided to go on the Channel 5 version of a psychotic rampage and takes Daniel to the lake where Jodie's son disappeared. After some boring scenes of driving and talking, the brother explains that Jodie's real son is in fact dead and it's all his fault because a phone call was more important that watching a young child near open water, so he briefly tried to resuscitate the drowned child before pushing the body away into the lake. Wow. So anyway, after he finished explaining that his career meant more to him than telling a now grieving mother what he had done to her son, he somehow ended up fighting Jodie in the lake and he drowned? I don't get it either. I'm still trying to process it which is probably a waste of time. They threw in a wreath which was coincidentally there and it conveniently landed next to the dead boy's toy boat on the bottom of the lake.
This is a show that doesn't seem to understand that dead bodies float, it isn't THAT easy to get into a school, and that being a creepy stalker isn't heroic just because a woman is doing it.",/review/rw6563691/?ref_=tt_urv

","Yet another TV drama that disappoints. People just do not behave like this in the real world, and as for for being able to wander in and around a school with no identification, without being challenged, that's just stupid. Alarm bells should have been ringing the moment she attended the job interview, but the headmaster was obviously a total numbskull. Then she creeps out a child's Dad and nothing is said.

6 February 2021,stevepalmer-37543,1," Can't believe what I've just watched!
","So am I to understand that schools do not require references for job candidates. You need to supply a prospective employer with an original birth certificate, or driving licence plus a bank statement or utility bill. The school would apply for the DBS, not the candidate!
Are we to believe that the fourteen year old boy would have the same distinctive hairstyle, the exact same scar and conveniently, no memory of his life before the age of four. Yeah right.
Can you just park outside the school gates at the end of the day and be the only car there?
And why do programme makers have to fall back on these awful racial stereotypes - the eastern European criminals, the saintly asylum seeker, and worst of all, the white man in a suit who is without scruples.
I wish there was an option to give this show a zero rating, so now I'm forced to give a more than generous one star.",/review/rw6563691/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2021,elisaa-63297,1," Completely unbelievable

",This has to be the worst British drama of all time. I certainly can't think of anything worse. It is beyond preposterous.

4 February 2021,comhluadar,1," Oh dear, dear me.....
","Ditto what everyone else wrote with similar ratings. Also - what are the chances of the mum spotting a young lad of the age that her missing son would have been at that point, in the same town, with similar hair, scar in exactly the same spot as her son's, similar body language, smile, everything. Odd. Plus how come the HR lady at the school was portrayed as a complaining spoilsport, when her character was the only sensible one there? Ho hum. I'll just go back to counting the little holes on my teabags. It's a bit more enthralling.",/review/rw6563691/?ref_=tt_urv
