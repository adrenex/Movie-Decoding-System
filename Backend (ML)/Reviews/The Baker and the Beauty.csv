",I used to LOVE this show and i geniunly miss it. It was one of a kind and I enjoyed the aspect of her communicating with the dead. As a fan of horror grown up i always rmbr this show as one that i adored from the characters to the story. I wish it had gone on for longer!,/review/rw1416749/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2010,ctomvelu1,7," Decent ghost series
","And so it ends, and what an ending. Melinda must deal with a veritable army of ghost children haunting the local hospital. The series finale was a shameless knockoff of the SILENT HILL movie, but for a G-rated show oriented to female viewers, it still worked. In its prime, GW was must-see TV. Some episodes were scary, some were creepy and some were downright weepy. For the most part, they worked. The show took a wrong turn, however, when Melinda's husband dies and is immediately resurrected in another man's body (what was that all about, a salary dispute, perhaps?). Then Jay Mohr as Melinda's college prof buddy left the show and was replaced by Jamie Kennedy, Hewitt's beau at the time. He was a poor substitute for Mohr, and the show then went from bad to worse with the introduction of a child actor playing Melinda's son. If you stick to the first two or three seasons, you will see GW at its best.",/review/rw1416749/?ref_=tt_urv

30 September 2005,trudushkufan,10," Keep whispering...People Are Listening!
","I have just finished the second episode of ""Ghost Whisperer,"" and I felt compelled to leave a comment. This is the best television show of the new season. Melinda Gordon (Jennifer Love Hewitt) own an antique shop, has recently gotten married, and deals with everyday stress. But unlike anyone else, she has the ability to help ghosts finish their unfinished business and cross over to the other side. The first episode started off as horror, with some extremely disturbing visuals. But it turned into one of the most emotional stories I have ever watched, and the second episode follows in that tradition. I am a guy, and most people think that either this is a chick flick, or a teen horror show, but that's not the case. This drama shows that you should never take things for granted and that you should always do the best you can do! Because you never know if tomorrow will come. There are some people who don't believe in ghosts, and some that do. Either way, this show deserves a chance because it makes the phenomenon believable with convincing performances and story lines.

5 December 2006,Clifford04,10," Humane and exciting
","I was a bit worried at first if Jennifer Love Hewitt could pull this off, not that she isn't gorgeous and talented, but the occult has an inherent mushy quality. Gladly I can say that my apprehensions turned to dust. She does pull it off, and the scripting is excellent and varied enough  although the medium will regularly encounter and save a ghost, which sets the form fairly rigidly. Despite this I find that a lot of work has gone into varying the simple theme, the acting is good and the supporting cast is up to standard and especially, 'Love' manages to impart humane qualities without appearing too soft or weak. Some fun also with her mother-in-law. Entertaining and sometimes moving and thought-provoking series. What do we do with our lives? I should also add that the photography is up to movie standards, not uncommon in these days (vide: Lost), but a sign that those are right who claim that TV is where it is happening. We need at least 5 seasons of this and hopefully more.",/review/rw1416749/?ref_=tt_urv

27 September 2005,newage-master,," I loved it
","I loved it. I thought it was a great show. It was fun, exciting, and even touching. The way Melinda (Jennifer Love Hewitt) would help those in need of answers from beyond the grave was one of the kindest things someone could do especially with her skill. The acting was believable and well maintained. And who can forget the cool outfits of the characters? I don't know why some people hated the opening credits so much. I'll admit the the theme song isn't the best but I thought that the presentation and the pictures were pretty cool too. I really hope this one doesn't get canceled I'd like to see what happens next in Melinda Gordon's life. I can't wait to see the next episode. I'll be tuning in.",/review/rw1416749/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2007,Jetta91298,9," The comfort food niche of TV
","If you want an edgy show on mediums, then watch Medium. Not that this show isn't edgy, instead I feel it fulfills a separate niche in the TV world - it's almost like comfort food. Ghost Whisperer completely surprised me. I thought it was going to be some dopey show that would be shown in reruns on Lifetime (ironically enough, they show reruns of Medium on Lifetime). Out of boredom one day I turned it on and was pleasantly delighted! Like I said before, it's not super edgy but it's cute, it's interesting, Jennifer Love Hewitt is very likable and her husband Jim is hot, to say the least. It keeps you interesting without layering on the sap. I even enjoy the small town and I am a complete city girl. Bottom line: it's one of those shows that you can curl up with a mug of tea or hot chocolate and a blanket and watch almost anytime - seriously it's like comfort food.",/review/rw1416749/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2008,AnnaShade,," Involving
","When I first heard of this show I thought it would be the most ridiculous thing ever. But I have this habit of disliking really good shows at first. The thing about it that caught my eye and made me want to watch it was the theme song; the imagery was fascinating and the song was slightly haunting. Appropriate, I thought.",/review/rw1416749/?ref_=tt_urv

25 September 2005,ALDP57,," Very well done.
","The Ghost Whisperer is a really good show that has the potential to be great. The storyline for the pilot was very compelling and touching. I have watched Medium, but I prefer THe Ghost Whisperer primarily because of the fact that GW deals more with helping earthbound souls find their way to the other side and not about solving crimes. Jennifer Love Hewitt is a joy to watch and the rest of the cast seems to be well suited to their roles. The only problem I had was some of the dialog seemed too campy and a little rough around the edges, but that is common with pilots. I'm really looking forward to seeing more from this one.",/review/rw1416749/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2019,capitalist_pig21797,5," Interesting premise, started strong, ran out of gas
","The series had a very interesting premise, yet there was only so much the writers could do. By the third season it was getting pretty predictable - angry/sad spirit, estranged from loved ones, internet search finds key information about a tragic death that happened relatively recently (2-10 years, typically) that most everyone else in Grandview has forgotten, spirit reconciles with loved ones, sees the light and moves on. The series jumped the shark early in season #4 with Jim's death and his subsequent possession of Sam's body.",/review/rw1416749/?ref_=tt_urv

14 August 2018,juanruiz-65679,7," Doomed to Enter the Light
","GW suffered from what all one-premise series do: the eventual exhaustion of script ideas. The first two seasons were excellent, and even going into the third the writers and producers tried, by building on previous stories. But once it was necessary to bring in supernatural adversaries, a whole underground town, the death of the husband, the departure of the professor, quality could not be maintained.",/review/rw1416749/?ref_=tt_urv

14 September 2006,RuthAkien,1," ghost whisper...
","...is dreadful. After seeing some adverts that made the show look fun and interesting, i gladly tuned in; Big mistake. The writing is predictable and 1D. Ghosts always just want to move on, none of them are angry or confused about what's happened. None of them provide any kind of moral dilemma to the main characters e.g. in the second episode i saw (yes i did give it another try- never again) JLH's husband (through negligence) causes the death of a criminal, after grieving for the guy for most of the episode he finds out the guy was actually criminal and MIGHT have posed a threat to his ex-wife. Having learnt this everything is miraculously fine for him. No worry about his negligence (or any possible future mistakes he might make). No worry about anyone who might have loved the person whose death he caused; kids, mother, brothers etc Would he have been able to forgive his own negligence so easily if the person who died had been a young child? His attitude seemed to be that some people deserve to die.",/review/rw1416749/?ref_=tt_urv
