7 May 2022,paul_haakonsen,3," So slow paced it is hardly worth the effort...
","I hadn't heard about this 2022 horror movie ""The Twin"" from writers Aleksi Hyvärinen and Taneli Mustonen prior to sitting down to watch it. I stumbled upon the movie by random chance, and since it was a horror movie that I hadn't already seen, of course I opted to watch it.",/review/rw8123403/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2022,manuelasaez,4," Not good. Not good, at all.
","Watching this ""new"" film, I kept getting that nagging feeling that I've already seen it. You know the feeling; you find a movie and you tell yourself, ""This looks interesting! I'll give it a shot!"" only to find yourself getting 10-20 minutes in and realizing, yes, I've seen this already, but it was so bad that your mind completely forgot it did?",/review/rw8123403/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2022,Draysan-Jennings,4," Slow and boring
",Can't sleep? Watch this movie. It will knock you right out. How anyone could actually sit through this whole film is beyond me. I got to the hour mark and turned it off. This is definitely not a film I'd recommend. 4 stars.,/review/rw8123403/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2022,twelve-house-books,2," Teresa Palmer
","Two stars for the pretty Teresa Palmer and her above average acting chops. But, there is so much here that is not explained--even at the end--except by saying that the Palmer character Rachel is severely mentally ill, and so assigns various roles to people she meets; some roles good, some evil. The director has this story all over the board, therefore nothing ultimately works and the story becomes a travesty of a Horror story.",/review/rw8123403/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2022,avocadosrbad,2," Took the long way
","It was a mix up of the uninvited, rosemarys baby and a few others. Very lengthy for the explanation and when its explained it felt really forced. Not alike an aha moment just, like ok, I guess thats plausible. It would have been better if you didnt want to smack the kid the entire time. The child's character is rude, creepy, and has zero redeeming qualities. Who doesnt want to hear a 6 year old screaming at the top of his lungs, bossing his mother around? It was not worth a second watch for sure.",/review/rw8123403/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2022,tonyandsilvia1994,4," Seen it All Before
","My wife and I watched this in Shudder as she's a big Discovery of Witches fan and Teresa Palmer was in this. Unfortunately this was a mash up of several other films, with The Omen, Midsommar and Rosemary's Baby springing to mind, but without being anywhere near as good.",/review/rw8123403/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2022,jp_91,6," Nothing new.
","""The Twin"" is a movie that has a couple of great qualities: the cinematography and its setting. Fully exploited the rural locations of Finland and a house perfectly lit by the crew to make it look gloomy. The performances of the leads are decent, but the performance of Barbara Marten stands out. The big problem with the movie is its script that tries to emulate current horror movies that revolve around psychological thriller and drama embedded in an art film and fails in its entirety. In addition, there are obvious influences from classics like ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""The Omen"" but without being able to approach their quality. ""The Twin"" fails as a psychological horror film and offers nothing but excellent visuals.",/review/rw8123403/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2022,rotini-52586,2," Very poor
",Very bad rendition of Rosemary's Baby very poorly exicuted. Started off ok ...but soon fell off a cliff. The towns people were just dumb. Too darn long ...,/review/rw8123403/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2022,PutneyTrope,5," Variation of common horror theme holds it's own. Better than most.
","This film will feel very familiar due to an overused theme (grief). If you can somehow get around that...you may enjoy this. Beautifully filmed (CGI cemetery was weird though) and the acting was solid all around. Atmospheric, but not particularly frightening. Not a fast moving film, but no noticeable filler. I can't think of a reason not to recommend this. Might pair nicely with Wake Wood (2009) for a double feature and exercise in contrast and comparison.",/review/rw8123403/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2022,athawolsux,2," I feel like I've watched this movie a thousand times before
","The Twin has it all: the would-be writer, his depressed and traumatized wife and their little kid moving to an old remote house after a family tragedy, the little kid acting more and more creepy, surly old villagers, the single local who seems to know something but won't talk until towards the climax and then becomes a huge exposition dump, an overarching satanic conspiracy and The Big Twist Ending That Explains Everything.",/review/rw8123403/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2022,markvanwasbeek,6," Meh
","First of all, the athmosphere is nice. Teresa Palmer was pretty good as a grieving mother. But the story builds up to a massive let down. They could've skipped the whole Helen crazy woman story, that just feels like a filler afterwards. The kid is annoying, but they usually are in these kind of movies. 5,5/10.",/review/rw8123403/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2022,heno-45762,2," OMG Boring
","This is a type of movie you don't care about the ending because you don't care about the characters or what is going on. Twist turns roll over , play dead sit down get up and turn around.",/review/rw8123403/?ref_=tt_urv
15 May 2022,ptf_rp,3," Absurd ending
","I actually was enjoying this movie for the first three quarters of it, until the 'twist'. The ending is absolutely absurd. Giving it three stars is generous.",/review/rw8123403/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2022,ranwulfs,5," Nothing very new
","As God as my witness, I figured Elliot wasn't real about 5 minutes in. Notice the dad never looks at him or speaks to him, and later - at the welcome party - the kid isn't interacting and the adults don't see him. Matter of fact, he's only on screen whenever Rachel is. Shades of ""Sixth Sense,"" which was a much better movie. The main cast was exceptional, I thought - all except the kid. I know this sounds mean, but a creepier, more unattractive little troll I don't think I've ever seen. And annoying AF.",/review/rw8123403/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2022,bethsgem-13693,5," Ok this reminds me of the movie MOTHER..so confusing
","So, here I go...Around the 32min mark I checked to see how much was left and was stunned it had an hour still to go! But I hung in there..indeed I did, went from being a story of grief to batching crazy! I Enjoyed the beginning and I liked the end..it was the middle 50 mins I almost turned off or fell asleep. I'd pass the 5 stars is for 2 female leads.",/review/rw8123403/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2022,movieman6-413-929510,3," Great build-up with well-known horror elements and chlichés ends with an too simple end result.
","The Twin is a new horror film directed and partly written by Taneli Mustonen. Before this, he has directed more Finnish films. In the film, Rachel (Teresa Palmer) and Anthony (Steven Cree) move to Finland after a serious accident in which they lost one of their twin sons. Here, along with their surviving son Elliot (Tristan Ruggeri), they try to work through the trauma of the accident and put it behind them.",/review/rw8123403/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2022,becky-92346,5," Some positive elements, but overall just very dull.
","The Twin (2022) follows a couple who, after the tragic death of one of their sons, moves to Finland in order to move on with their lives. This wasn't a terrible movie, but it wasn't consistently interesting and just didn't feel unique. I liked how it was about cults thought! It reminded me a little of Mother! (2017) at times.",/review/rw8123403/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2022,Nevergivea10,2," Just not good
","I would describe this as a combination of Rosemary's Baby, The Omen, and The Shining. The only major difference is those were good movies. The acting is terrible and movie boring as hell. Pass on this one.",/review/rw8123403/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2022,lindajohnson-36205,4," All over the place
","This movie had zero clue what it wanted to be. The end result was just a mess and stupid. By the time it came together, I just didnt care anymore. But it is pretty tragic how your mind can turn on you... I dont recommend.",/review/rw8123403/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2022,Miq2u,3," So much promise
","Just like your local politician, there is so much promise and then once in place, it goes no where and doesn't deliver on the promises it made. It does deliver an interesting twist, but the slow burn to get there and the predictability once revealed makes it crash in upon itself. Arthouse horror in casual passing.",/review/rw8123403/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2022,jtnite,2," Ultimately an absolute waste of time
","Some fun spookiness, shades of Wicker Man, the Omen... all in service of a profoundly stupid and disappointing third act. I am actively angry that I watched this.",/review/rw8123403/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2022,srjuanm,4," NO HORROR MOVIE
",For a while now movies about people with mental or emotional problems have been sold off as horror movies via trailers. THE RELIC is another one about an older woman suffering from dementia.,/review/rw8123403/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2022,witra_as,5," Decent watch for convoluted psychological horror
",Quite a decent watch for slow-burn psychological horror though jump scares were lacking. Taneli Mustonen tried to put so many things into his own convoluted storytelling. Palmer's emotional performance still gave good example on how your brain copes with grief.,/review/rw8123403/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2022,SoumikBanerjee25,6," A decent attempt at Psychological Horror
","Flicking through the reviews of other people which are predominantly unfavorable by the way; I do wonder, what were they thinking? I mean, what were they expecting to see? While I understand the amount of frustration they might feel, their all-around cynical outlook, and their perspective in general; yet, I still believe, they had gone a little bit overboard with the criticisms this time.",/review/rw8123403/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2022,apryla-58795,8," Teresa & Stephen are great
",Ok so this was surprisingly good for being on Shudder. I was surprised to see Teresa and Stephen in something hot on the heels of 'A Discovery of Witches' where I felt that they had intense chemistry. I wanted her to end up with him instead of Matthew Good. I think SC developed a crush on Teresa and pry agreed to do this lackluster film just so he could be around her some more. She's taken and just had her FOURTH child so my hopes are dashed of them getting together IRL HOWEVER I digress...I felt this was pretty good but the twist got me thinking I gotta go back and rewatch it to make sense of it. It makes sense now why the Dad was so removed from the kid.,/review/rw8123403/?ref_=tt_urv
