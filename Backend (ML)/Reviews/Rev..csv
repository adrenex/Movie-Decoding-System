5 October 2003,bob the moo,," Great detective story full of character, characters and plot
","When Ezekiel `Easy' Rawlins loses his job he begins to worry how he'll make ends meet when DeWitt Albright offers him cash to help find Daphne Monet, the fiancée of politician Todd Carter.  He takes the job as she is known to like Afro-Americans and will be easier for him to find. He gets information from a friend but is then framed for her murder.  Stuck between the police and Albright's men, Easy has to uncover why Monet is so important to so many people and save himself from jail.",/review/rw7827777/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2015,hitchcockthelegend,8," Everyone was peeing on my head and telling me it's raining.
","Devil in a Blue Dress is written and directed by Carl Franklin, who adapts from the book written by Walter Mosley. It stars Denzel Washington, Tom Sizemore, Jennifer Beals, Don Cheadle and Maury Chaykin. Music is by Elmer Bernstein and cinematography by Tak Fujimoto.",/review/rw7827777/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2000,dfranzen70,8," Dazzling atmosphere, Washington make this a winner
","Denzel Washington plays Easy Rawlins, a down-on-his-luck sometime machinist, sometime detective in late-1940's L.A. Seems someone wants him to find a mysterious white lady in a blue dress (Jennifer Beals)who's thought to have been seen in a blacks-only club. Enter Easy, who with his connections can get into the club and find the girl. But, of course, there's more to this plot than just that, or else it'd be a mighty short film.",/review/rw7827777/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2003,michaelRokeefe,7," Heavy heat in the night.
","Murder, politics, sex and scandal; and it is all about a girl in a blue dress. An out of work WWII vet(Denzel Washington)is trapped in a web of lies, backstabbing and flying lead when he agrees to look for a politician's girlfriend(Jennifer Beals). Some real good movie music by the likes of Memphis Slim, Duke Ellington, Roy Brown and Jimmy Witherspoon. Very apt support from:Tom Sizemore, Don Cheadle and Lisa Nicole Carson. One steamy sex scene scorches and redeems.",/review/rw7827777/?ref_=tt_urv

30 April 2016,chaos-rampant,," Great immersion in LA world
","This has a convoluted story like out of Chandler. There's the dreamy woman who has disappeared, the unlikely schmo hired to find her. She is white, a rich man's wife thought to have disappeared in the black side of town. They get him to investigate, a black guy who just wants to make mortgage so he can simply keep owning his house.",/review/rw7827777/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2016,NateWatchesCoolMovies,8," A terrific spin on classic Chandler
","Devil In A Blue Dress takes the classic Raymond Chandler mystery form and uproots it just a smidge, setting it in the African American community of 1948 Los Angeles, with terrific results. Noir takes on a double meaning (naughty pun) as WWII vet turned private eye Ezekial ""Easy"" Rawlins (Denzel Washington) finds himself mired in the quick sands of corruption, coersion and murder most foul after taking on a job that's led him straight to the dirtiest little secret in town. After he accepts a missing persons inquiry from mysterious DeWitt Allbright (Tom Sizemore, first shady and then downright scary when we see what he's really about), he finds himself searching for a girl named Daphne (Jennifer Beals) a runaway with ties to a very powerful politician (Maury Chaykin makes your skin creep and crawl) with some seriously disturbing extra curricular activities. Rawlins recognizes danger when he sees it and tries to back out, but by then he knows too much and it's way late in the game. Now he must navigate the scene like the pro he to escape not only with answers, but perhaps his life. Washington gives him the underdog treatment, a worn out gumshoe who still has some grit left, enough for one last ride in any case. There's an L.A. Confidential type feel to the plot in the sense that it ducks some conventions in order to service true surprise from its audience. Sizemore is a charming viper as the kind of dude you never want to trust (isn't he just the best at playing that?) and Beals subverts the damsel in distress archetype by injecting her performance with a jolt of poison. In terms of L.A. noir this baby is fairly overlooked, but holds its own to this day. Watch for Don Cheadle as well.",/review/rw7827777/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2006,ccthemovieman-1,9," A Different Shade Of Film Noir
",This is the kind of film that can stay with you for awhile after you watch it: a haunting kind of film that isn't always pleasant or easy to understand but you remember it. It also helps to have a fondness for the 1940 film noir movies.,/review/rw7827777/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2014,Mr-Fusion,8," Deserved to be a much bigger hit.
","""Devil in a Blue Dress"" is one of those period pieces that so proficiently captures its particular time and place (1940s Los Angeles, the greatest setting in cinema). The art department nailed it, with the signage especially. ",/review/rw7827777/?ref_=tt_urv

7 June 2014,SnoopyStyle,6," Great noir style, some interesting racial stuff, but the story is confusing
",It's Summer 1948 Los Angeles. War vet Easy Rawlins (Denzel Washington) from Texas needs a new job with few options. His bartender friend introduces him to DeWitt Albright (Tom Sizemore) who is looking for missing Daphne Monet (Jennifer Beals).

18 February 2004,Andy44,8," Why review a nine year old film?

8 February 2020,Muhammad_Rafeeq,8," very good period piece crime mystery ( C+Movie ) My Ratings 8/10
","One of the finest film noir mysteries made since the 1940's, and one of the few to successful use color. A true classic, worth owning and seeing again and again. Excellent music too!",/review/rw7827777/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2003,Dfredsparks,7," overlooked gem (minor spoiler included)
","I really enjoyed this screen adaption of the prolific Walter Moseley's first novel.  Generally, it was nice to see a piece on this historic period focusing on blacks on the West Coast, as opposed to the usual settings of the South and NYC.  Also, the racial issues were handled with enough restraint that I could watch it (i am generally too angered and upset by period pieces with racial issues to enjoy them). Denzel gives a great performance in a much better vehicle than the one for which he finally won a Best Actor Oscar.  Jennifer Beals is also convincing, thought my knowledge of her real life biracial heritage sort of ruined her character's surprise revelation in the movie for me.  Lisa Nicole Carson gives an effective albeit brief performance, but the show is definitely stolen by Don Cheadle as Mouse. (""if you didnt want him killed why'd you leave him with me?"").  I had the pleasure of seeing him off Broadway in Top Dog Underdog, and i think that this film was his breakout role.  Overall very enjoyable.",/review/rw7827777/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2009,rmax304823,4," Flavorless Neo Noir.
","The acting is up to professional standards. Denzel Washington is in the lead as a jobless ex-GI in 1947 Los Angeles who is hired by a stranger to find a white girl named Daphne. He does a good job, as usual, without being in the least extravagant. The supporting players are all equally good, with Don Cheadle in the flashiest role as a friendly killer.",/review/rw7827777/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2003,macmar,8," Don Cheadle is stand out

12 February 2011,seymourblack-1,9," Murder, Corruption & Crossing The Line
","An ordinary guy in a fix tries to get out of it, but in so doing, actually gets himself in deeper trouble. This type of plot may be very familiar but it's also utterly irresistible. What makes it so compelling is that it's the type of predicament that most people can immediately relate to and as a consequence soon find themselves empathising with the hapless protagonist. In ""Devil In A Blue Dress"" the audience's inclination to respond in this way is made even stronger by the use of a narration which also helps to drive the story forward.",/review/rw7827777/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2022,kevin_robbins,8," This is a very underrated performance by Washington and movie overall
",Devil in a Blue Dress (1995) is a movie I recently watched for the first time in a long time on Tubi. The storyline for this picture tells the tale of a scammer in 1940s Los Angeles that is hustling to make money and appears to be assigned an easy task of finding a white girl who hangs out in black night clubs and likes sleeping with black men. When he finds his target and reports back he discovers his mission was on behalf a politician and what seemed easy and short lived wont be...,/review/rw7827777/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2016,PredragReviews,7," ""Are you on top of that trouble or not?""
","A voluptuously seedy tale of blackmail, murder and double-cross, ""Devil in a Blue Dress"" captures splendidly the mood of the forties, and is a worthy modern equivalent to old gems such as ""Double Indemnity"", ""The Blue Dahlia"" and ""The Big Sleep"".",/review/rw7827777/?ref_=tt_urv

10 February 2000,Mumba-2,," The most under rated film of the Decade
","Carl Franklin's adaptation of Walter Mosley's classic detective novel is a dark and funny tale of a detective with bad luck.  Denzel Washington handles the material well.  However, the star in the film is Don Cheadle as Mouse. This cold blooded killer steals several scenes away from Washington.  The film also creates an accurate depiction of the racial climate in the late 40's.  Issues of race and identity are displayed in the entire film.  And Franklin does an incredible job of controlling the characters and narrative.",/review/rw7827777/?ref_=tt_urv

15 May 2004,whpratt1,10," Denzel & Jennifer Were Fantastic Together!
","Missed this film and recently viewed this great film going back into the 1940s.  It was great to see a very young Denzel Washington(Easy Rawlins),""Training Day"",'01, who managed to have his own home in Los Angeles and was very well liked by his neighbors and many friends.  The photography was outstanding and depicted what life was life after WWII and how living conditions were among the black and white communities.  Easy Rawlins meets Jennifer Beals,(Daphne Monet),""Break a Leg"",'03, who seems to get him in all kinds of trouble, however, there is a great spark and attraction between the two of them.  After viewing this picture, I can fully understand why this picture is Titled,""Devil in a Blue Dress"", Daphne managed to get quite a few people KILLED!",/review/rw7827777/?ref_=tt_urv

","The mood and atmosphere is musically enchanting and you feel like you're descending into a seedy world on the wrong side of the tracks just this side of luxury and affluence and power and politics and wise guys who know where the real money is stashed. This is a wonderful little Private Eye story about on the level of LADY IN THE LAKE with Robert Montgomery, but Easy Rawlins is here to ferret out the clues from a Black perspective. He does not come to the world of private investigation willingly, but rather has it thrust upon him due to circumstances of unemployment. He is sitting in the bar of his friend Joppy, searching through the want ads when he finds out there is a white man with a job for him.",/review/rw7827777/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2022,blott2319-1,6," Modern Noir with some problems, but still worth watching
","I enjoyed the entire tone and style of Devil in a Blue Dress. This is a movie that embraces the time period it is set in wholeheartedly, and it reeks of noir all over. Hearing Denzel Washington open the film in voiceover, there's simply no denying they were aiming to make something exactly like a classic noir. I was eating it up, and because of the clear intentions of the filmmakers I was willing to forgive the fact that our protagonist isn't exactly the most virtuous and likable guy when the film starts. I also appreciated that there was a bit of mystery about what is happening and who is working for whom. However, there is one big ""twist"" that did not impact me in any way. Through a slight fumble in casting of the title character I think they tipped their hand way too much, to the point that I thought I missed something because this shouldn't be a surprise to anyone in the film. Of course, one misstep in casting is made up for in the fact that they got Denzel in the lead role. He seems surprisingly perfect for this type of gumshoe, because you can see how he'd charm people for answers or intimidate them if necessary.",/review/rw7827777/?ref_=tt_urv
