9 January 2023,nasdagoodshepherd,8," Michael Cusack's Newest Show about a Superhero
","I just watched a first few episodes of Hulu's newest adult animated show, Koala Man. I've got to say that I was actually kinda impressed with it. The show's background design has more texture, and the visuals are nothing special, the visuals are at least quite fun to look at. The character designs reminds me of the art style from Rick and Morty, Close Enough, Solar Opposites, and Final Space. The characters are kinda like a mixture of the characters from Solar Opposites and Close Enough to me, and yet they're likable and the humor is also fun. Not to mention some of the parts of the show are really great, for example, some animation segments on the characters are considered to be really fluid and it's actually splendid to look at.",/review/rw8806680/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2023,Amthermandes,9," I'm sold
","Ok, I may be a sucker for adult animation, and also for Australian culture. So I was pretty much destined to enjoy this show. What I didn't know is that I'd enjoy it this much.",/review/rw8806680/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2023,tommypezmaster,8," Well this is a pleasant surprise.
",Gives the superhero comedy gene a fresh new start. The characters are justified by who they are and what they do and still feel relatable at the same time. The Australian setting really helped elevate the series and makes it feel exotic like most titles set in Australia. The co-creator of Smiling Friends really know how to make me feel.,/review/rw8806680/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2023,sehij-05501,8," An excellent comedy romp
","I first watched Koala man as a series of YouTube shorts and when I first heard of the series I was very excited. I am pleased to say I have not been disappointed by Michael Cusack's latest series. I have appreciated most of his work and style and this series is absolutely no exception. I like the animation stlye, it's oddly sloppy but well done nature is something I appreciate. The jokes lead from banal everyday events taken to their comedic extreme with a man dressed as a koala. I don't know why but the Australian accent adds a lot to the humour for me, I know it's part of the Aussie thing but still the voice actors delivery and accent for me adds to the humour. It's very much the style my friends and I have enjoyed whilst we were growing up and I am pleased it now has a series and recognition. I hope it goes a long way.",/review/rw8806680/?ref_=tt_urv

13 January 2023,brodie-25686,9," A new Aussie classic
",I feel like if your going into this show as a non Aussie a lot of the humour will be lost on you. However as an Australian having a cartoon on the level the Big Lez Show which a high production value is quite the special treat!,/review/rw8806680/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2023,dylanrathmann,8," Refreshing animation
","A welcome addition to adult animation, taking inspiration from the likes of solar opposites and Rick and morty, Koala man is funny, action packed and crazy. Solid yet wacky stories, with likeable characters. The animation style is unique and solid to watch. First few episodes in and the superhero element is perfectly matched with relatable and everyday occurrences spun with a satirical twist. One more thing too note is the beautiful Australian accent that makes profanity worth hearing. I look forward to future seasons of this eccentric Australian gem of animation. The use of a timeline makes this especially rewarding too watch.",/review/rw8806680/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2023,orcinussr,5," It's not great, nor particularly funny, but it is mildly entertaining....
","Which, if your like me and have seen most of the available content AND love animation, will stave off the dreaded boredom whilst fulfilling your ever present need for distraction for roughly four more hours (actually less but who's counting?) (I am but I pressed pause long enough to type this and drew it out long enough to get to that 4 hour mark) Also, the keen listener might recognize a very special American voice playing Chad Wagon in episode 3 - anyway its adult animation but just barely and only because of some language - the themes are pretty tame as is the humor but it IS original and I enjoy Australian shows - give it a whirl mate, and make up your own minds.",/review/rw8806680/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2023,DarkVulcan29,9," It's like if Homer Simpson decided to become a superhero
","An enjoyable show, with The Simpson and Family Guy like edge to it. The story of a good but sometimes dimwitted family man who decides to become a superhero named Koala Man.",/review/rw8806680/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2023,abbylizbon,10," Hilariously pointless Aussie tv and I love it!
",I agree with other reviewers where this show may not be your cup of tea if you're not Aussie or understand our humour.,/review/rw8806680/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2023,mishahaynie,8," Outrageously stupid but funny!
","If you can get past how insanely moronic this show is, you'll have a good time! The show is so much better than I was ever expecting this to be! And it keeps getting better with every episode! I turned this on thinking it was going to be the worst thing ever made, but was pleasantly surprised by how insanely awesome and likable this show and its characters turned out to be! Went much deeper than I was ever expecting the show to go. At least watch the first five episodes! Give it a watch! You won't be disappointed. It's not for everyone, but it's unapologetically different in all the right ways!!!",/review/rw8806680/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2023,mz-30017,8," The Suburban Superhero we never knew needed
","So after watching the entire series in one sitting, I can syat that it's failr enjoyable. For non-Australians, there are alot of jokes and references some people can't understand, but regardless of the cultural differences, it's a bloody good time for everyone to enjoy the absurdity of the show.",/review/rw8806680/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2023,Father_RIPs,8," I really enjoyed it.
","I am not going to go too in-depth with the show simply because I am more of a movie critic, but overall I think Koala Man deserves a hell of a lot more than it received. Most people never gave the show a chance before flocking to Twitter to complain. I recommend watching it to the end because the show starts to shine later in its run, and then judge it for yourself.",/review/rw8806680/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2023,jake-atterby,10," Exceptional cast
","Don't be turned off by the animation style, the writing and voice acting is so phenomenal, with stand out performances from Hugh Jackman, Demi Lardner and the surprise appearance of Hugo Weaving! Honestly, I could listen to these characters talking hot nonsense for hours. Clearly a lot of love has been put into this, and the suburban Australian setting is extremely refreshing - not to mention the show's strict continuity which becomes stranger and stranger as it goes on. Do not go into this thinking it's just another Rick and Morty/ Solar Opposites, it is so much more and well worth your time!",/review/rw8806680/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2023,nicshampoo,10," Slam dunk
","This is the most authentic Australian comedy to ever hit mainstream audiences. The way it captures Aussie culture so perfectly and includes things like handball, show bags and tradies but still makes itself accessible to outside audiences is amazing. It's so satisfying to see Michael Cusack hit such success, he's one of the most talented Australian exports since Hugh Jackman. So many obscure Aussie references and expressions that'll go over Americans heads like Harvey Norman and cashies. 6 seasons and a movie please. Thank god he included damo and Darren... Hearing Jarrad Wright & Jordan Shanks voices was the icing on the cake.",/review/rw8806680/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2023,jonas-715-434529,2," Might be funny down under...
","But up here in boring old Scandinavia, it's barely worth watching in 8x. Weak storytelling, uninteresting characters and nothing humorous about any of the dialogs or the attempts to make weird twists on everyday family issues in the suburbs. To compete in the Rick & Morty, or Family Guy genres is no easy task - but this is scraping the bottom of the barrel. Will give it a couple of more episodes to at least see what they have in store for, otherwise prominent actors, like Huge Jackman and Hugo Weaving. Maybe they can help pick up the pace. Emu-man, koala-man, or what ever your name is: Godspeed :).",/review/rw8806680/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2023,lawrencehobart,10," Hilarious
","About time we had something like this. The septics (not a typo) might not get some of the cultural references, but it's just a great caricature of small town, lower middle Australia. And the characters are very relatable. It's kind of a spin off of Damo and Darren, which is kinda cool in itself, that was always going somewhere, and to see Justin Roiland in the mix is exciting. I'm shocked, I'd honestly expected after watching Season One to see a score of 8.2 or more, but I get it, some of us just have our artistic appreciation glands in our colons, and that's OK. All in all, bravo, great job, actually 9.5 out of ten but rounded up.",/review/rw8806680/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2023,dracforever,2," Just as powerless as the main character
","I have no clue how this show has such a high rating. Storyline is dumb, main character is impotent, and except for some overt adult content, is a children's show level content.",/review/rw8806680/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2023,ghostmodule,10," About time
","I've been waiting for Michael Cusack to create a show like this for years, especially one that included his Damo and Darren characters, which this show does. Among YOLO and Smiling Friends, this is definitely my favourite so far. I don't really have any complaints besides wishing Damo and Darren had their own real show, but I doubt that's going to happen.",/review/rw8806680/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2023,mjr-88739,6," Rick and Morty with an Australian coat of paint
","As a fan of the original koala man YouTube clips by Michael Cusack, I think the writing took a turn in the wrong direction for the series. The heavily fantasy themed plots and over the top Rick and morty style action is not what this show should have been. It should have felt more like a slice of life/king of the hill type show with more down to earth plots.",/review/rw8806680/?ref_=tt_urv
