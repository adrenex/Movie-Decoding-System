23 September 2022,tjxpyyhv,10," A must watch film
",I was invited to a private screening as a journalist and have to say loved every minute of the film. The storyline was genuine and something people can relate to. The acting is superb and I love how it showed the Pakistani culture in a positive light. It's a family film that tackles issues in a sensitive way without being sensational and patronising. Jemima Khan and all the team have produced an amazing film that will be very popular in communities. I suspect people will enjoy it as much as I did. Showcasing arrange marriages in a real way where there is no prejudice and bias. I strongly recommend it to everyone.,/review/rw8797171/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2022,suhairkhan,10," Written with love, empathy and a lot of joy!
","A beautiful, moving and funny script, written with time and care over many years - documenting stories of love and cross-cultural connection in a way which has never been done before.",/review/rw8797171/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2022,hanifqadir,10," What an amazing film!
","This film really tells an amazing story about the ground realities surrounding South Asian communities living in Britain. Packed with fun, emotions and some hard facts. Depicts something we South Asians experience regularly. In fact I've personally experienced something very similar to this story in my own life. So it really does hit home. But in a fun kind of way.",/review/rw8797171/?ref_=tt_urv

",My Review-,/review/rw8797171/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2023,steveinadelaide,7," An uplifting romantic comedy
","After an uneven, stilted start, WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT settles into an enjoyable rom-com. It follows the story of two childhood friends, now in their thirties, who must decide whether to follow their heads or their hearts when one of them decides to go through with an arranged marriage back home in Pakistan.",/review/rw8797171/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2022,niccareem-59025,10," In these hard times a movie that will bring joy to your heart
",I absolutely loved this movie so thoughtfully written and produced by Jemima Khan . My friend and I left the showing with a broad smile on our face and in these times of hardship that I is a rare thing. The movie was beautifully cast and the cross cultural element of the movie was sensitively handled by the Director . Some of the Asian characters reminded me of my own family specially the grandmother. I am in a cross cultural marriage my wife being Yorkshire lass so the story line resonated with my own story and I love my wife to see it. This is a movie I highly recommend you will leave the cinema happy promise!,/review/rw8797171/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,zztpvd,10," Great film!
","This movie portrays an amazing story about the diverse cultures intertwining in the UK, as well as how South Asians in particular experience this cultural shock.",/review/rw8797171/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2022,sophiapilkington,10," Wonderful uplifting film
","This is real escapism .. it's not only funny (extremely in some parts) but also a deeply touching story ...with a serious understanding of what it is like to be in an arranged marriage... without mocking the institution or beliefs in any way... the wedding scene made me laugh out loud in some parts and without giving anything away, the actress who plays the the grandmother is completely brilliant. I f you want to have a really cheering experience during these dark winter days ahead, go and see this film as I cannot recommend it highly enough. Also it has a wonderful happy ending , leaving the viewer with a certain buoyancy in their demeanour and a smile on their face.",/review/rw8797171/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2022,embreen,9," Very authentic and unpredictably warm - must watch
","Loved this film for many reasons - one being I thought I was getting a comedy but it turned out to be so much more. It was real, you can see it's been well researched as the characters reflect the Pakistan community to a T.",/review/rw8797171/?ref_=tt_urv

4 February 2023,flebber-crue,4," What's plot got to do with it!
","Totally lacking plot and character development the movie falls flat. Missing are all the usual twists, turns and laughs. There is no build or development of the main characters leaving them as empty and hollow as when they started.",/review/rw8797171/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2022,hamidabdullah-35992,10," A film not to be missed
","I had the honour of being invited to the private screening of this amazing film, written and directed by no other than Jemima Khan herself.",/review/rw8797171/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2023,aksterling-11355,9," Underrated
","I really enjoyed this movie. It comes under the heading of intelligent romantic comedy, a rare category indeed. It is sumptuously filmed, the colours are beautiful, particularly during the trip to Lahore. The movie considers what is important in a marriage, the weighting of love against family commitment. Emma Thompsons role isn't huge, but adds a lot of comedy. My usual gauge with a movie is whether it would hold up to a second viewing band I personally will see it again. The critics may not think much of it, but I think the moviegoers are going to love it, I think it will be in the cinemas for a while.",/review/rw8797171/?ref_=tt_urv

13 January 2023,maryamkhanxo-48552,10," Amazing movie!
","The movie was brilliant start to finish, it was an amazing fusion of being british but still connected to your roots. The movie highlighted the colourful culture of Pakistan, it was funny with accurate references and also highlighted the set backs of the society.",/review/rw8797171/?ref_=tt_urv
