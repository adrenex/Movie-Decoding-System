The somebody they sent for is archaeologist/linguist James Spader who deciphers some ancient Egyptian writing and poof, the gate is upright and operational.",/review/rw0966261/?ref_=tt_urv

4 May 2021,Calicodreamin,7," Decent 90s scifi
","For the 90s this is a decent scifi film, the characters were well cast and the storyline was interesting. The effects and costuming are pretty good. Russel and Spader make for unlikely duo, but they kind off work.",/review/rw0966261/?ref_=tt_urv

12 June 2003,bkam,7," Solid, Original Adventure Flick
","Stargate's plot, acting, and score all contribute beautifully to the mysterious ambiance that is the essence of this enthralling and suspenseful film.  While your disbelief definitely needs to be suspended to cover some inconsistencies, the atmosphere and action of the movie make it worth your while.  Not only does Stargate combine science fiction with history, but it weaves them together in a way that remains exciting the entire film, despite major changes of environment.  Upon hearing some major elements of the film, one might think that aliens, ancient Egypt, and atomic bombs could only come together in some kind of bizarre montage.  However, this film is strongly plot-driven, and while this does make it typical in some respects, the plot itself is remarkable.  Hardly artsy, the score is in many places Hollywood-ish, presenting emotion in a straightforward manner, yet it too is enjoyable.  None of the acting is spectacular, but this is made up for by the characters' wholesome qualities and ability to change (however slightly) over the course of the movie.  To summarize, while nothing in the film is a complete divergence from the standard, it follows the Hollywood style in a manner that is original enough to make a solid and enjoyable adventure. This is the actualization of the potential within the Hollywood film ""template"": a good story told well in all respects. [9/10]",/review/rw0966261/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2005,back_blast,8," An amazing story...
","Stargate is a terrific movie that has produced 2 hit TV shows, conventions and fans from all over the world. This movie started it all. I found it in my Uncle's basement and decided to watch it. It has an interesting storyline tying in Ancient Egyptian Mythology to make it even more interesting. It's about a struggling archaeologist with strange ideas about the gods and rulers of Ancient Egypt. Only one person is willing to believe him, and recruits him for a translator. What they find is even more amazing than they expected.",/review/rw0966261/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2001,RaHasGlowingEyes,9," One of my Favorite Movies of all Time
","I don't understand why this movie is so underrated. I have seen it multiple times, and each time I get something new from it. It is a beautiful work of art (The Director's Cut is also a must-see, because the added scenes elaborate on a few confusing plot points) Now, I would just like to take a moment and talk about the aspects of Stargate that make it an enjoyable, exciting, riveting, and thought-provoking film.",/review/rw0966261/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2005,kayabay,9," A science fiction which is comparable to the best ones...
","I don't quite understand why Stargate got an average point compared to many other science fiction movies. A wild guess that, it is not a US originated one I suppose. If after all those years it is still a pleasure to watch it then why ? A fine story ( believe it or not ), a fine cinematography and a beautiful soundtrack that stacks into your mind. Roland Emmerich is perhaps one of the best directors and the casting is superb.",/review/rw0966261/?ref_=tt_urv

25 January 2006,darkpatriot85,9," CLASSIC. Without a doubt.
","Stargate is one of those great movies that hasn't got the respect it deserves. At first I thought the movie was about time travel since they go to a place that is like Ancient Egypt, which didn't really interest me at all. Then I caught an episode of the T.V. show and got curious. When I saw the movie I was blown away. The special effects were ones I had never really seen before (such as opening the Stargate for the first time). I was getting tired of seeing sci-fi movies where every alien race spoke perfect English and I thought I would experience that until the team met with the villagers which I thought was better. It's always cool to see Kurt Russel kicking ass in films. It was also different to see James Spader play the semi-nerdy guy instead of the asshole he mainly plays. I was also amazed when Roland Emmerich chose one of the simplest villains for a movie, an ancient Egyptian god. I watch this movie every week and I never get tired of it.",/review/rw0966261/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2004,Theo Robertson,7," Old Fashioned ?

14 January 2008,Boba_Fett1138,8," Greatly made movie!
","This is the sort of movie that shouldn't had really worked out but yet it did. Everything about this movie screams B-movie. Just look at the title, read the script, see the characters, the cast, etcetera. Yet ""Stargate"" works out tremendously fine as great and above all fine entertainment. It's for most part due to the fine directing skills of Roland Emmerich, show really knows to uplifts this movie and its story. ",/review/rw0966261/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2009,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,7," ""Please do not leave your luggage unattended at any time, and we hope you'll have a nice intergalactic journey""
","Not many people know this yet, but I'm writing the next Emmerich film. Yes. It's going to have a lead who's a dorky, socially awkward, extremely smart yet ignored scientist of some field that will relate to the plot, which will be something big, requiring a lot of costumed extras and loud special effects, and be set or deal with something fantastic that isn't that closely linked to reality. Seriously though, for using the same basic formula, his flicks tend to be fun and enjoyable escapism. Plus, this marks the possibly unique occasion of James Spader not(!) playing the role of a sexual deviant in the movie he's in. I guess he wanted to branch out. Russell, as expected, nails his part as the hardened military man who does have a heart, and in general the acting is great. The story is interesting enough, and it develops fine throughout. Pacing is good, and this does notably not overwhelm or overstimulate the audience, in spite of presenting a world that we can't directly relate to. Stephen Sommers, are you paying attention? The FX are excellent. This is exciting, entertaining and cool. The action is awesome and not excessive. As for music, this uses a broad, sweeping score, and that works well. The humor is reasonable, the jokes and gags are hit and miss. There is infrequent mild to moderately strong language and a little violence and one or two hints towards sexuality in this. I recommend this to any and all fans of those who made it, particularly Roland. 7/10",/review/rw0966261/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2021,paul_haakonsen,6," Still entertaining after all these years...
","I remember watching the 1994 movie ""Stargate"" from director Roland Emmerich a couple of times back in my late teenage years, as it was a rather enjoyable movie back then. And I do remember the movie fondly back then, so as I had the chance to revisit the 1994 sci-fi movie here in 2021, of course I did so.",/review/rw0966261/?ref_=tt_urv

",I had never seen Stargate before 2020 the TV show or this movie but as a bit of a science fiction nerd I thought it was time I gave it a watch and I honestly wasn't disappointed with it the movie is quite unique and has a storyline that kept my interest and was pretty original for it's time.,/review/rw0966261/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2012,Leofwine_draca,5," Fairly typical
","STARGATE should be the perfect movie for me: an interesting premise, grounded in real-life theory (I've been reading Graham Hancock's FINGERPRINTS OF THE GODS recently, and am familiar with Von Daniken's writings) and made with a high enough budget to do the special effects justice.",/review/rw0966261/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2009,joshi_3592,9," A gravely underrated movie, that spawned a great franchise
","Even if you're not a fan of the Stargate series, this is an exiting Sci-Fi film, with a never tried before idea. Unlike most Science fiction were the characters have to travel around in spacecrafts, in this film they simply step through a wormhole, and saves us the time often spent in other films on space-travel and brings us straight to the action.",/review/rw0966261/?ref_=tt_urv

22 November 2004,bob the moo,," Passable sci-fi but only if you can swallow the silly plot, bad dialogue and average action
","With his 'crazy' views on the origin of the pyramids and his great intellect, Dr Daniel Jackson is the natural choice to join a team looking into the mysterious of a collection of stone tablets that had been uncovered many decades ago. Within a few days Jackson has cracked it and is soon introduced to the true mystery of the whole project  that of a metallic portal covered with the same symbols and hieroglyphics. Activating it under the watchful eye of the military, Daniel sees the gate open to somewhere else. Joining the group going through the portal, Daniel finds a world like Egypt, full of peaceful people worshiping the sungod Ra. Things go great for a while until, that is, Ra shows up.",/review/rw0966261/?ref_=tt_urv
