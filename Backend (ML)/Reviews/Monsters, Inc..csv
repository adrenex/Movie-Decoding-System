16 July 2020,Tweetienator,7," Better Than Most
","Defiance is a fine piece of a sci-fi show: unique world-building, good actors and a very good production (without CGI overload) makes Defiance one of a few (like e.g. Firefly, Farscape). In the end the show maybe did not hold the level of the first two seasons but anyway, still good enough to beat many of those ""modern"" sci-fi abominations of the last few years.",/review/rw2783332/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2013,atlasmb,9," Learn from Firefly
","I have read reviews on this site by viewers who do not like Defiance, sometimes comparing it to Firefly. Granted, Firefly is a great show, but what did we learn from its early departure from TV? The network wanted Firefly to capture the minds of its viewers quickly, so they did not air the first episode first. Believing that a more action-packed episode would grab new viewers more quickly, they shuffled the episodes--a strategy that alienated viewers and led to the show's demise. When I read criticisms about the pace of Defiance's first episode, I say let the show develop and see where it goes.",/review/rw2783332/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2013,Safetylight,," A lot of clichés done well makes for good TV.
","Reminds me of the old Masamune Shirow manga series, ""Appleseed"". Combine that with Mel Gibson's ""Road Warrior"" and a bit of ""Babylon 5"" with maybe a dash of ""Command & Conquer"" (yes, the video game), and you've got yourself ""Defiance"".",/review/rw2783332/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2015,bsofakind,9," Extremely Under-Rated Sci Fi Show
",Over the last decade I have had some difficulty warming up to many of the sci-fi shows produced. For me it was a case of being to conventional and uninspiring. ,/review/rw2783332/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2019,just_funme,9," I don't know how I missed this gem
","I know the show is old, but I shame myself by not giving it attention earlier. I somehow get the same feeling that I got when Fringe finished: I want more, but I don't want it to spoil with overcomplicated plots and lifeless seasons.",/review/rw2783332/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2013,maxwell-maximus,10," I see lots of potential
","While the pilot wasn't jaw-dropping, it was very entertaining and in my opinion it is worth recommending this show to sci-fi fans. I believe there is a rich world here with a story worth telling. This is not Game Of Thrones, this is not Breaking Bad.... this is a ""popcorn show"". Sit back, relax & enjoy the ride. Don't let the super negative reviews fool you, because, as always, they are the extra critical vocal minority. Most people don't go online and write personal reviews for TV shows / movies they like.",/review/rw2783332/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2013,info-5918,8," Not perfect, but interesting
","The scenario is a mix of genres - western, Mad Max apocalyptic, wandering Ronin and classic science fiction. The plot lines were a tad cliché as were some of the characters, and the action story lines a bit rushed, but it still managed to keep it together.",/review/rw2783332/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2013,eve_dolluk,9," Very good Pilot
",I was a bit sceptical as I have seen stuff on Syfy and its a lot of it is not very good. The good news with this is the FX are pretty good for a TV show and the acting while not Oscar winning and a little cheesy is not bad. ,/review/rw2783332/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2013,mike-ryan455,6," Cautiously hopeful but less than I had expected
",I just saw the pilot episode. I am not sold yet on whether it will crash and burn or it will be decent.,/review/rw2783332/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2015,baehr_adam,10," A Syfy Masterpiece!!!!!
",I just finished Binge-watching both Seasons 1&2 and the first 3 episodes of S3 so that is what this review is based upon. I will start by saying OMG this show is Phenomenal. I had nothing to watch since GOT ended and I decided to watch this and thank God for that bc this show killed it in every area. I will start with the story it takes place on Earth in the year 2046 after multiple alien species landed years prior and centers upon Nolan and Irisa in the Town of Defiance. The story is simple but gets even better as time progresses. I will now talk about the cast which is in my opinion the best part. I will credit the 2 best actors in the show that being Nolan played by Grant Bowler and my favorite character Datak who is played by Tony Curran both are astounding actors. I will also say that all of the actors and actresses did an Amazing job of keeping the story engaging. I will now movie onto the action which I will say is sometimes a tad corny but the majority of the time it's Insanely Epic. I would recommend this show in a heart beat and S3 is so far the Best season yet. F.Y.I one of the main villains in S3 called General Rahm Tak who is played by Lee Tergesen is an absolutely mind blowing villain who is now probably just after 3 episodes my favorite villain of any television show to date. Go and Watch this show Now lolz.,/review/rw2783332/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2020,Blumanowar,8," Better than the 7.0 rating..
","By the 3rd show I was hooked.. in the first couple of episodes, while interesting, I thought it was a bit over the top. But as it goes along, the story, acting and two of the most beautiful ladies I've ever seen.. I was hooked! Julie Benz/Mayor Amanda is absolutely one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen and her smile is the most devastatingly sexy ever. Her characters sister, Mia Kirsher/ Kenya is exceptionally beautiful as well. Not the reason I usually watch a show but they sure are easy on the eyes for a change and both are very very good actors.",/review/rw2783332/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2013,Tomoosterbroek,10," Quality is going up and I'm warming up to it
","The show started a bit slow in the first 4-something episodes. In the past couple of episodes, especially 6 and onwards the show has really picked up. More stuff is happening, new plot lines are opening up and the characters are getting broader and deeper.",/review/rw2783332/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2014,LouieInLove,9," Defiant Fun For Followers
","Look! Defiance doesn't take itself at all seriously and that is the key to it's success. Pretentious? Most definitely not! Here it differs from many other Sci-Fi shows rearing their heads at present. It has a real Anderson-esque sense of vibrancy, colour and intrigue.",/review/rw2783332/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2020,AvidWatcher101,9," Better than most and deserved more credit and another season at least
","As I am looking through my Prime Video, Disney +, Netflix and cable TV, HBO, movie channels - trying to find something I want to watch (this being March 31, 2020, the time of the social distance vs. the virus) that I have not seen, I'm scouring IMDB looking at things I liked, then jumping off to follow the show creators to see if they made anything else I liked - and that is how I landed on Defiance. I loved that show! So many really awful things get season after season, and a very cool TV show like Defiance is cancelled. I loved the premise, the characters, the story lines, the look and feel of the thing - it had it all. Maybe I will watch again. But, I did notice that Rockne O'Bannon also did Farscape, which for some odd reason I never did see - and it's on Prime - so we'll give that a go. I wish IMDB users could contact each other - I'd love to be able to share messages with people who have similar tastes. Meantime, quarantine TV's next stop will be Farscape.",/review/rw2783332/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2019,imlindaheart,9," Very cool, fun and action packed sci-fi with unexpected events
","I love this show, so sad they haven't made more of it. The actors are great, the plot is fast and always full of surprises. You will never get bored with this show as it is always changing. New characters appear, old ones die unexpectedly, people (both humans and aliens) are realistic, flawed but still likeable.",/review/rw2783332/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2020,surfisfun,8," underrated:watch couple episodes and enjoy this decent low budget
","Even if 3rd season was so so,
the compelling stories and drama and characters during the 1 and 2 seasons is great!!!
to me it is top 5 ever on Sci fi channel.
The main alien actress teen and surrogate father is interesting.
The white alien family is also well sketch.
A great low budget epic with a good cast and decent writing is very raRE!!!!",/review/rw2783332/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2013,anthony-burton,1," Terrible, juvenile writing, awful direction, poor animation
","I was looking forward to Defiance, especially after seeing the cast list. Grant Bowler, Julie Benz and Jamie Murray have all excelled in Dexter and Outrageous Fortune, but the script they've been handed doesn't give them one solitary chance to exhibit their talents. The writing is on a par with a third rate computer game cut scene, choking on its own clichés, dialogue is non-existent, characters tell other people who they are, or what they are doing, but no one actually has a real conversation with someone else.",/review/rw2783332/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2019,generationofswine,10," An Honest Review
","This show ended far too soon. It had so much potential, the show masters were just laying the groundwork for what could have been a great science fiction show...and they cancelled it.",/review/rw2783332/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2020,ksdouglas-23618,9," Far Greater than the public score it's given
","Listen, I watched this show when it aired and I'm shocked to see so many reviewers giving this show such a low score for things that basically nip picks than anything else. It's really not that bad, and I have no idea what these people watched because the show is essentially a post-apocalyptic western that features alien refugees and human war survivors banding together to create a better future despite how grim the world has become. It's an excellent premise with strong and memorable characters. This show really does not deserve the low score it was given and I mean that in all honestly.",/review/rw2783332/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2013,Justice68,1," Typical 'Sy Fy' and modern day melodrama
","You ever watch those shows where the actors and their 'issues' don't fit the surrounding environment? Where Emo and Juliet still try to live life as it was in the 'good old days', except the good old days refer to a time when shopping malls still existed and kids went to public school, not scrounging in gutters for scraps to eat amongst rubble left be either a bomb, aliens or mother nature?",/review/rw2783332/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2013,NikiES,9," Thoughts on the Pilot
","I don't normally write reviews on IMDb, but I thought I'd make an exception for this show. I find it rather weird that it has an overall rating of 8.1, but all the reviews so far range from mediocre to bad.",/review/rw2783332/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 2013,sqeaston9,2," Great cast and production values wasted
","The main character is the sheriff in a ravaged post apocalyptic town with a rebellious alien adopted daughter. There's an honourable, female mayor (love interest, I have no doubt), an alien gangster, a bigoted (against aliens) human mine owner, the gangster's son and the mine owner's daughter who love each other. The token black guy in this one is the deputy.",/review/rw2783332/?ref_=tt_urv

24 April 2013,johnsim,3," It's a Western. Set in a dystopian future.
","Picture a Western where a loaner and his partner walk in to town. They get in to trouble with the local law, and tangles with a corrupt businessman. But somehow becomes the local sheriff when a fight turns nasty.",/review/rw2783332/?ref_=tt_urv
16 April 2013,Rob_Taylor,8," Actually, not too bad.... so far!
",I admit I didn't have high hopes for this series. With it's Mad Max meets Alien Nation premise I feared the worst. Hearing that there is already a game tie-in with the series did little to improve my thoughts on the show.,/review/rw2783332/?ref_=tt_urv
