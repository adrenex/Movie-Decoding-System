22 September 2009,smallrage1,10," Time to boycott TV networks that cancel good shows
",I've said this in one of my comments about either Carnivàle or Eureka that I am not a fan of Sci-fi shows yet once again like those 2 shows I just mentioned comes yet another great Sci-fi show. Like Carnivàle it was canceled this time it was ABC turn to disappoint its audience.,/review/rw6641718/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2018,imdb-17961,9," Deserves a proper ending
","It's as if they pulled the plug on the show in the middle of the final season. If they were to do a movie to give the show a proper ending I would watch it and even though it has been nearly 10 years since the show ended, they could pull it off by making it about the characters 10 years later.",/review/rw6641718/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2006,unicornpeg2003,8," Not bad at all
","I must confess that I'm a nut for supernatural fare and was not expecting to enjoy Kyle XY but it's summer and there's nothing much on. I was pleasantly surprised at how much this pilot teased my interest. Sure the script might seem a bit familiar but the story is tantalizing and I'm hungry for more. It originally aired on ABC Family but don't let that fool you. It is not a strictly kid's show. Give it a chance especially if you have a taste for the unusual. This show is a combination of drama, family fare and supernatural. Any X-Files fans will have a pleasant jolt when you see the mysterious man watching our hero. I also have to admit that I felt a slight tug at my heart at the sight of how this family takes to helping this strange...and I do mean strange...teenager who appears from out of nowhere.",/review/rw6641718/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2006,Jackie_Michele,8," Interesting
","You know, after the whole Roswell and X Files debacle I really wasn't all too interested about the ""alien"" television show. The aforementioned shows were good but they were definitely lacking.",/review/rw6641718/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2021,Kingslaay,7," Interesting and had potential
","Kyle XY started off strongly with a very interesting story. The more things were left unanswered the more intriguing it became. I think once they revealed a lot about Kyle's story and they introduced Jessi it became a little steady. Things started to decline a little in parts when they focused too much on the relationships like Josh and Andy, no one was interested in a young teen getting it on. I felt they overdid this aspect of the show at the expense of a better story, sometimes it felt more like a soap opera with the 'love triangles'. Still this show had some good potential and it might have been worth to give it a chance to wrap. Far worse shows were given that chance. I think in the age of streaming platforms it might have earned a cult following and had a better chance of being saved. Alas it had its moments, not bad.",/review/rw6641718/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2006,huitzilipochtli,7," A new take on sci-fi
","Being somewhat of a mix of a soap-opera, ""The Pretender"", and ""Dawson's Creek"", this show certainly surprised me, especially since I don't much care for those three.",/review/rw6641718/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2006,juggernaut1977,10," The entire crew are all awesome!
","This is a show with pizazz and originality supreme. It is superbly cast. The star, Matt Dallas is truly a star. His eyes beam with sincerity and believability. He has a very warm and sincere personality. The family's interactions remind me of my own family. I came from a family of 8. The family interaction is totally believable and superbly acted by all parties. They make you want to belong to the family. Jean-Luc Bilodeau portrayal of the ding bat brother is supremely done. His character reminds me of me at his age. I just heard that there will probably be another season and I am elated. I hope this family continues in the new season. Can't wait. Next year it way too long! Next week would be much better.",/review/rw6641718/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2009,emotionalcripple,10," Incredible!
","Do not mistake Kyle XY for just a petty boring sci-fi series for teenagers. It is not. I'm an adult and I got hooked from the first 5 minutes of the pilot. It's got a little bit of everything; drama, humor, sci-fi, love, loss, pain, mystery, family...you name it and you'll find it in this amazing show. This is simply a show that meets all ages and satisfies all tastes. All the characters are so well written, and the cast did an amazing job portraying every character. It really breaks my heart that they are taking the show off the air after only 3 season!! How could they put an end to such a great show that fast!!!!! How could they not care about the thousands and thousands of fans that supported the show and still do!! I really really hope someone out there would realize what a HUGE mistake that is and would do something about it... Kyle XY needs a hero to save him !!",/review/rw6641718/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2006,trapt_headstrong06,10," Pretty Good
","I'm thinking that this was a pretty good show. The first time I saw the previews, I didn't think too much of it. I figured that the guy playing Kyle was pretty cute, but it didn't get my attention enough for the show. However, the more they came on, the more it got me to wondering why he didn't have a belly-button, so I decided to watch it. I'm really glad that I did. It was extremely interesting. It was the best. If you are really into shows that give off a bit of a mysterious air, then Kyle XY is definitely for you. I'm definitely going to be watching the next episodes, it's got me in suspense, and I want to know what is going to happen next. I give Kyle XY a 10 out of 10, it is an excellent show.",/review/rw6641718/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2006,trackstar195,10," Terribly Endearing
","I recently had the chance to watch the pilot for Kyle XY, and to my surprise, I enjoyed it very much. Of course, this topic has been experimented with before: mysterious figure with no past, relatives, etc. But something in this circumstance struck my interest. To be perfectly honest, I don't know exactly what did it. The mother, a psychiatrist, or paranormal psychologist of sorts, decides to take the stranger in, seeing as there are no other options as of the present time. The family, which is made evident of having its own problems, takes in the boy, and of course has difficulty with him, are reluctant to accept him into household goings-on, etc. Now, I know this concept seems predictable and juvenile, as stated previously. But to me, its both invigorating and intriguing for a person, or thing, to have the rare behavior to come to the aid of those whom he has hardly met-displaying the purity of the human heart, and conversely, the wretchedness of the impurities around him. The conclusion of the episode had to be the most enjoyable though. As the family members who had once merely discarded Kyle from their lives welcomed him into their household, the viewer is acquainted with the kindness of strangers in an effort to put others before themselves--a notion brought about so rarely on both television, and in life. And while not perfect, Kyle XY has thusfar, that is in the pilot, exhibited inter-familial machinations as well as captivating abilities of observing one's surroundings, and all without ever losing itself along the way. It is curious where this plot will lead, how all the mystery will be concluded, and we will all be there to see it...every step of the way. Afterall, it's part mathematics, and part....euphoria.",/review/rw6641718/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2019,AngelHonesty,8," Suprisingly Good
","Matt Dallas makes this show! He does such a good job as the lead role of Kyle. The show itself is a little cheesy mixed with teenage drama; but the storyline is very intriguing. The mystery of trying to figure out who Kyle is and the way it unfolds in this show; was very well done. If you're okay with watching a series with the normal high school drama in it, then I would give this one a try.",/review/rw6641718/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2006,teejayniles2345,9," A Parable for Foster Care
","This mystery-science fiction series pilot shows a lot of promise as far as commentary on how far can the ""helping professions"" go; it is definitely a ""blue state"" kind of show (set in Washington State) since it implies a kind of alien visitor who can be plopped in front of ""old style"" computers and assumed to be techno-adept without much sense of what language he speaks or their importance. The director knows how to fold in a certain sense of threat and danger without going off in bizarre or grotesque scenarios. The helping family is seemingly ready to become the means to socialize the alien/savant and they are ""instant foster parents/siblings"" since the mother is apparently a state social worker/psychologist at Children/Family services of that state/county. The alien (Kyle is a ""name"" which seems a little too quickly attached to him) doesn't come with supernatural tools as did the ""STARMAN"" of a few years ago but he isn't quite a full amnesiac either since he is capable of narrating the first episode at least. For those of you looking for a mildly entertaining made-for-network series, on the basis of its pilot (June 30) I give it a 9 * rating). I hope the next episodes get shown on ABC main network and the creative thinking is given its full credit.",/review/rw6641718/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2006,chrstngal03,10," excellent show
","This show is excellent. The writers have a way of giving you the information you crave in just tiny doses at a time, kind of like 24. They keep you wanting to continue watching so you can try and gather more pieces of the puzzle to find out who exactly Kyle XY is. If you're one for suspense and mystery and a little science fiction then this show is definitely for you. I can't wait for each new show so we can find out a little more about Kyle's past. Who is he, where is he from, why can't he remember anything at all about his past? How is it that he can do all these magnificent things but can't demonstrate simple human emotions? I guess we just have to tune in next week and subsequent weeks to find out.",/review/rw6641718/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2006,One_Blaze_Of_Glory,10," Fun show
","""Kyle XY"" is a fun and interesting show. Perhaps it's not the best ever, but personally, I quite enjoy it. The mystery of Kyle's past keeps unfolding in each episode, and keeps you enticed and wanting to watch more. Matt Dallas gives a good performance as Kyle, with a believable supporting cast. Though it can get a bit risqué at times, it is still fun to watch. I'd recommend it to anyone thirteen or older who enjoys a good mystery. It might not be for everyone, but those who I know that have seen it like it. You should try it out. As I said before, it's not the best show ever, but it's a guilty pleasure of mine. :) Thus, I give it an 8 out of 10.",/review/rw6641718/?ref_=tt_urv

","Wow! This was something I so looked forward to watching when it was on. I so thought there is no way they would cancel this show. They did and wow was this such a good story-line to keep going. Such an imagination could have really done good damage with this show. There was so much more to add and excellent actors and actress in this show. They are still acting today and I see them. They are so incredible that I watch the shows they are in today. Just goes to show you this is "" mind under matter""! Kyle XY and cast, you are so missed!",/review/rw6641718/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2019,browniesnack57,9," A Truly Timeless Sci-Fi Teen Drama
","Kyle XY is a show I wish I could've watched when it first came out(the pain of being born European..). It's thrilling, inspiring, heartwarming, challenges how we view ourselves, our choices and the people around us. Kyle had the misfortune of being born with no one, naked, alone, confused in the woods next to a rattlesnake. He later gains not 1 but 3 dads. There's Steven, his ""proper"" dad, the one who takes him in and helps him grow in all areas his big brain still needs to. Then there's ""scientist dad"", Adam Baylin, the man behind half of his genetic makeup and responsible for his entire existence. Lastly, there's military dad AKA Tom Foss. The man who saved his life, maintained his humanity during gestation through classical music, and helped Kyle to train his abilities. With villains, misunderstandings, teen angst and sci-fi, all accompanied with a very normal, factual aesop at the start and end of each episode, this series takes you through all the extraordinary and ordinary things Kyle goes through, in a highly captivating way. The ""Evil Brit"" at the very end is a huge plus for me personally. Definitely recommend watching this, even if you're not from US, it's not too American at all.",/review/rw6641718/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2006,mtnmanvt,8," Positive review
","I didn't know what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that for the most part, the show is interesting. It combines a number of concepts including that of the outsider, and the ""alien's"" eye view of humanity. The main character is at once an alien, an alienated teen, and a baby in an adolescent's body. These different experiential views combine to offer some commentary on humanity, particularly US culture (since that's where the story takes place). There are some hokey cheesy moments, but overall I think ""Kyle XY"" offers viewers multiple opportunities to ask meaningful questions about the nature of life, reality, and our own values.",/review/rw6641718/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2006,wolfmano23,10," ""John Doe"" lite.....in a good way!
","Back in 2002, their was a little gem of a television show called ""John Doe"" on Fox. It was about a man, who wakes up naked in the middle of the woods, on an island off the Seattle coast. He sees in black and white and although he has no memory of who he is, he knows practically everything.",/review/rw6641718/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2007,chrichtonsworld,7," A good sci fi show with focus on human nature
","Although there are a lot of science fiction elements in this show the focus is more on drama! It was good to see the main character (an excellent Matt Dallas) interacting with the people surrounding him! And it is also fun to see how he is developing! He is constantly learning important matters and adapting accordingly! In aspect to this fact he is just like any other teenager! Except for his extraordinary abilities! An important factor is finding out who Kyle is and what he can do and will do in the future! This suspense/mystery element is very interesting! But most is done in order to surprise the viewer than actually convince us of the conspiracy theory! (Plot of second season doesn't connect well to the plot of the first season. You get the feeling they make things up as they go! So people expecting some brilliant mystery show will likely be disappointed!) The mystery is just put in to keep us interested enough to follow the show! ""Kyle XY"" is a show that is moving and positive! Personally I think it is refreshing and much needed in a world that gets darker and darker!",/review/rw6641718/?ref_=tt_urv

","At first when I heard ABCfamily was making original series like ""Wildfire"" and ""Kyle XY"" I thought, ""Oh no! My favorite channel is going to turn into the Disney Channel where there are no good shows or reruns playing, but a whole lot of original series that weren't even worth making in the first place.""

21 October 2013,Vesharps,10," Kyle XY review
","Kyle XY is absolutely amazing, it is my favorite show of all time. Every episode has never been boring, it always interests me to watch the following episodes. I really love the story and plot this show tells to the audience, it has many defining moments and experiences I'll always remember. This show is great at building characters and telling their stories. This show also has many great music choices which fits to the scene it is placed in. The plot twists are great and unexpected, leaving surprises to people who watches the show. I really miss this show and I would like a few more episodes. The ending to this series was not very well, it left many questions. I feel that a proper ending to the fans should be made. Overall, I give this show a perfect 10 over 10. I really enjoyed this show and the experiences it has given me. I've learned a lot through the lessons it is teaching in the show. Thank you, Kyle XY and all the people involved in the show.",/review/rw6641718/?ref_=tt_urv
