","Beautiful scenery and lots of potential in the characters and overall vibe but I felt like it was lacking something. A lot of the plots made me wonder why anyone would want to be watching something like this happen. A show is for entertainment, so shouldn't scenes be enjoyable to watch? It felt like jumping from one uncomfortable or unpleasant moment to the next.",/review/rw8355897/?ref_=tt_urv

26 August 2022,cherold,5," why?
","I seriously don't know why this exists. It's in the general category of quaint English period pieces about English people and foreign countries which is a perfectly good thing. But based on the first episode, it's not remotely interesting. You don't care about the characters, no interesting situations are introduced, and the dialogue is bland. What made someone feel like this was a show that needed to be made?",/review/rw8355897/?ref_=tt_urv

","If a high school theater ensemble made a Riviera rehash of ""Downton Abbey"", with a reverential scent of Jane Austen on everything, this is probably very close to what the finished product would look like.",/review/rw8355897/?ref_=tt_urv

",The usual array of stereotypical & formula guests with the usual extreme personalities & backgrounds. Seemed very artificial & staged. Daytime soap level redux.,/review/rw8355897/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2022,grahamf-55542,9," Don't give up
","This series didn't have a great start. After E1 I was close to dismissing it as a rather inferior cross between Downton and The Durrells. I still wasn't convinced after E2. I was finding the short snappy clips rather annoying, the dialogue sometimes excruciating.",/review/rw8355897/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2022,ldmede-48385,5," $$$ not well spent
","Multiple storylines; too many, in fact. Perhaps if the characters were not cut from the same piece of cloth we might have a watchable series. The setting is gorgeous, if a little too polished and artificial, but it's not enough to makeup for tepid writing and cookie cutter characters.",/review/rw8355897/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2022,irnbru-333,7," Light escapist drama that's a winner
","The Durrells meets Downton (but not quite on a par with either of those just yet) in this new Britbox series following a British family who open the Hotel Portofino on the Italian Riviera in the 1920's, starring Natascha McElhone.",/review/rw8355897/?ref_=tt_urv

",I am writing this after bingewatching series 1.,/review/rw8355897/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2022,mosquitobite,8," This is nicely done, a very pleasant binge thanks
","Only 20 reviews? That's a bit poor. Anyway I liked this, its not nor does it try to be wildly groundbreaking. The charactors and well drawn and engaging all performances strong, some will say its cliche but really what does that mean. There are typical traits to be portrayed and this is done with care and in a genuine heartfelt way. Cecil is a great cad though we see his soft underbelly, loved Melissa she was the perfect pre debutante, best giggly, silly endearing girl in a period piece I think Ive ever seen in a very long time, Claudine was excellent, Lucien an absolute delight along with Nish, no one over-did their portrayal, staying within character confines which was awesome.",/review/rw8355897/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2022,lineart-12973,10," Excellent
","A period piece including the frightful politics of that day. Portofino shines and brings back many personal memories. Great character developments, variety of personas. Rich and entertaining. With all these dreary crime-dramas being churned out, like Ozark and Billions, this gorgeous film is a great escape for us today.",/review/rw8355897/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2022,bszorad,5," Average and boring
","This looked promising as it was compared to Downton Abbey. The scenery is beautiful. However, nothing really happens. The storyline is boring. Actually I'm only at episode 4 and I have fallen asleep several times when watching this show. It's a pity.",/review/rw8355897/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2022,bellab1972,6," Not bad but the sets are ridiculously fake!
","I have just started watching Hotel Portofino and it's based on an upper class family who move to Italy and renovate and run a hotel with limited funds. The characters are ok.. but a bit too predictable! The nanny who arrives from England will eventually hook up with the owners son.. It hasn't happened yet but I guarantee it will happen.. so no real thought has gone into the storyline, just the typical predictable stuff.. maybe I am wrong and the nanny won't win the son over.. but..
I love period shows but the town sets are beyond terrible and incredibly FAKE! There has been absolutely no effort to create realistic sets or get decent actors to play the part of stall owners or shop keepers.. they all look ridiculous.. I think a high school play could create a more realistic 1920's village scene and whoever signed off on the sets should be fired.. it's a massive distraction..
At this stage I have no idea how far the hotel is to the FAKE village/town and I still have a lot of questions that might be answered later on.. but at the moment the storyline is all over the place! The husband of the owner of the hotel was away when the initial guests arrived.. what was he doing and what is the relationship between the couple.. I don't know! Apparently the husband is a scammer and will do anything to make money.. and he is very cruel to his son.. that's about it..
I started describing the other guests at the hotel but got bored because the characters are boring..
I hope this show improves because some of the acting is very good especially the female owner of the hotel.. Bella..
So far it's ok but I really wish whoever approved the town sets knew what they were doing.. and had a better eye for realism..",/review/rw8355897/?ref_=tt_urv

",Enjoyed watching Hotel Portofino. Beautiful setting and when relaxing down having time to oneself with a lovely cup of tea this is just right to watch.,/review/rw8355897/?ref_=tt_urv
20 June 2022,cotennfl-1,3," Very Pretty but Totally Empty-Headed
","I gave it three stars for the absolutely beautiful country which I will never get to see in person. Beyond that, there's nothing to recommend this series. It never really moves along and it seems to me if one wants to own a totally British hotel it would be much more easily done to actually own one in Britain.",/review/rw8355897/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2022,bjarias,6," ... coming from watching one great series there can be letdowns
","... most important part of a new series is the very first episode... it has the responsibility of making you want to continue watching... as pretty as Hotel Portofino might be to look at, it's lacking in that reason-spark for continuing on with it... maybe there's just too many characters introduced too quickly employing-choppy-dialogue that's really just too boring at the start of a brand new series",/review/rw8355897/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2022,Littleredtulip,9," Beautifully shot

20 June 2022,dmadau-859-532006,5," Beautiful scenery but that's about it
",The plot is lacking. The characters are not very likable. They all have vices. Way too many sub plots. Music is nice. The only thing really nice is the scenery. They should have taken notes from Downton Abbey about script and plot lines.,/review/rw8355897/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2022,moonmark-52817,7," Has its good points and its not so good
","I did enjoy watching this. The scenery and production values are spectacular. The acting is variable but mostly good. But as others have noted, this is no Jullian Fellowes. The script and writing were a little wanting. The storyline fell into cliches at times. But I will watch the next season, hoping it picks up.",/review/rw8355897/?ref_=tt_urv

","A much needed tonic. Gorgeous scenery, excellent cast and storyline. If you're into Downton Abbey and The Durrells then this is the perfect blending. Don't miss it. This kind of series could run and run because we need more of this in these grey times.",/review/rw8355897/?ref_=tt_urv
