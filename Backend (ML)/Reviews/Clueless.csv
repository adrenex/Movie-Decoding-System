2 September 2007,ExpendableMan,7," Look at the size of that thing
","Independence Day is the sort of film that's best appreciated on a big screen, preferably a massive great plasma television that is so huge you had to cut the roof off your house and get airlifted in by helicopters just to get it in the living room. You should also have the most state of the art surround sound possible, with bass pickups so deep they cause earthquakes on the Eastern seaboard. Not because Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich's alien invasion flick is a masterpiece of cinematic art or anything, but because it's loud. Very loud. And if the windows in your house don't shatter when the spaceship flies over New York then well, you're just not experiencing it properly.",/review/rw0387675/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2008,g-bodyl,10," A Great Blockbuster!
","What's the fuss about this movie? Why does everyone think so poorly of this? Well, in my opinion they compare this film to the Best Picture movies. This is not a Best Picture film, but a very entertaining popcorn film. This tells the tale of aliens attacking Earth and a group of survivors must unite together to destroy the invading aliens. The acting is decent. Will Smith, with a movie career underway, is excellent. Bill Pullman is great as the President. The effects were amazing especially when the buildings were blown up. David Arnold's music score is just fantastic. The theme is still stuck in my head. Overall, this is an excellent film. I rate this film a 10/10.",/review/rw0387675/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2001,BaronBl00d,," Suspenseful Feel Good Fun!
","I am just shocked at all the negative reviews by pseudo-intellectuals saying the film was heavily flawed, incomprehensible, devoid of any merit, and ""lame"", to quote a few.  What were they expecting?  A remake of 2001:  A Space Odyssey.  Sure, I am not going to pretend the film does not has many glaring weaknesses.  The plot is hardly original; its execution is even less inspiring.  Roland Emmerich goes out of his way to use every cliche in the book, over-sentimentality, weak, flat characterizations, incredible jumps in logic and reasoning made on the viewer, and the use of special effects to overcome these shortcomings.  But what some of the reviewers seemed to have missed, and its there as substantiated by the huge popularity of the film, is heart. The film has a lot of heart.  It makes you feel good after watching it.  And although that quality does not make it a great film, it certainly makes it a good film in my book.  The film is vastly entertaining, very suspenseful, a delight for the eyes with dazzling special effects, and even has some dialogue that does just rise above its hackneyed origins.  The acting is adequate all around with no one pulling off a great performance, but a few doing marvelous jobs with what they have to work with.  Judd Hirsch easily out acts his fellow colleagues as a Jewish father with a gift for common sense and lack of tact.  Jeff Goldblum also gives a pretty good performance as his son.  Yeah, Will Smith is just Will Smith..lots of one liners and little meat so to speak.  But he is bearable.  Watch for Brent Spiner in an outrageous role as a hippie scientist.  His performance is a real hoot!  If you are looking for philosophical science fiction, this is not it.  See Starship Troopers(a great film).  This is just good old Americans against the universe stuff, lots of action but little substance. But whatever it may have as its faults, it is a fun, happy, sad, charming, engrossing film to watch...time and time again.",/review/rw0387675/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2003,Aaron1375,8," Fun summer blockbuster that some just took to seriously.
","I enjoyed this movie, sure it isn't the most original movie ever made or the best, but it was what it set out to be...which is a combo alien attack movie of the 50's plus an all-star disaster movie of the 70's.  A lot of critics don't like this one and a lot of people who think of themselves as critics don't care much for it either, but it still brought in over 300 million at the box office in the summer of 96.  I thought it was an entertaining film with lots of action and a good dose of comedy as well.  One complaint I have is that it runs a bit long and you feel the time pass not like other movies like ""The Two Towers"" where it doesn't feel like all that much time has passed.  Another problem with this movie is that it is best seen in the theater.  This movie has a score of only six at imdb, so a lot of people who saw it probably saw it on TV.  Or if they did see it at the theaters, realized it just wasn't as good on the small screen when they saw it on TV. The movie also benefited from a great ad campaign that started with a super bowl spot that showed the White House being destroyed.  The movie is basically an alien invasion movie and it is like a 50's science fiction movie.  It also has a lot of stars, not the biggest names, just like a 70's disaster flick.  If you don't care for either of these genres you probably won't like this movie, but if you like one or the other or both it is worth checking out.  Just don't take it too seriously and have fun watching it.",/review/rw0387675/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2020,drqshadow-reviews,6," Big and Dumb, but Weirdly Charming, ID4 is a Lasting '90s Blockbuster
","Giant, hostile, alien spaceships appear overnight to move on Earth's natural resources; humanity's last, desperate hope is a shaky plan involving a captured UFO from the 1950s and an old PowerBook laptop. Seems like this one was a guilty-pleasure classic from opening day. ID4 isn't well-written and constantly bathes itself in dense layers of cheese, but it tries hard, most the character arcs connect and the big special effects hold up quite well, despite their age.",/review/rw0387675/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2021,fernandoschiavi,7," A guilty pleasure. After all, action and tension is what Independence Day wants to deliver. It is not about complexity as his artistic expression resides in entertainment
","Roland Emmerich is, without a doubt, the Master of the catastrophe films. On his resume, the director not only has Independence Day, his first dive into the sub-genre, but also Godzilla, The Day After Tomorrow, and 2012, all marked by mass destruction - global most of the time - and a complete absence script or quality performances, absences that open the way for the visual spectacle in computer graphics with several memorable sequences. Here, Independence Day literally encapsulates the spirit of all those similar films from the 70s such as the series Airport, Earthquake, Hell in the Tower, Poseidon's Destiny, copying almost entirely from the classic formula, which usually addresses family nuclei or friends before the tragedy in a slow narrative construction and the consequences after the apocalypse sets in. And there's nothing wrong with that, actually, as Emmerich lends his ability to create epics - Stargate was his immediately preceding film, which already demonstrated his ability to handle science fiction well - and creates a film that will be guaranteed fun. Just ignore the various poetic licenses in the script and embark on the guilt-free adventure.",/review/rw0387675/?ref_=tt_urv

11 November 2006,faraaj-1,8," One of the better high-concept movies..
","As a rule, I don't like high-concept movies. However, Independence Day is one of the few with some merits. It is also the best film to-date by German sci-fi/action director Roland Emmerich. The greatest flaw of Indepence Day (aka ID4 due to initial copyright problems with the Independence Day title) is the excessive jingoism. Completely America centric, it seems that the rest of human civilization is helpless without the Yanks. The American President is not just the only world leader fighting for a free world, he even moonlights as a fighter pilot attacking the aliens.",/review/rw0387675/?ref_=tt_urv

29 July 2005,Theo Robertson,7," I Enjoyed It First Time But It Doesn't Hold Up To Repeated Viewing
","When ID4 was released I certainly didn't think it was a movie I'd be going out of my way to see due to its reputation as being overly jingoistic along with being a shallow story with no substance so I waited to catch it on network TV and when I did I was fairly blown away by its quality . The first half of the movie is nail biting as whole cities across the globe are vapourised by the invaders who can't be stopped and it's not often we get a blockbuster that starts off in such a pessimistic manner . As for the "" American nationalism "" that some people hated it for I suggest you avoid watching every American war movie that doesn't have Sam Fuller in the credits . Here is a movie that only celebrates the Utopian dream of multi racialism in America ( Unfortunately that's all it is in reality - a dream ) but also the international community where Arabs , Israelis and the RAF can all join together to take on the alien menace ",/review/rw0387675/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2006,mstomaso,6," Limited character development and an uncomplicated plot result in a one-shot movie
","Independence Day doesn't stand up particularly well to a second viewing. It is basically a millenial version of The War of the Worlds with grand-scale effects and a cast which probably cost almost as much as the effects. Will Smith, Randy Quaid, Jeff Goldblum, Adam Baldwin and Judd Hirsch help pick up a surprisingly talented (but underexploited) cast and seem to have enjoyed their parts. Unfortunately, the mediocre script allowed few of the other actors to make their roles shine.",/review/rw0387675/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2010,Rectangular_businessman,1," Terrible film
","Like many all the other films directed by Roland Emmerich, this movie has incredible effects but a incredible lame plot, terrible performances and a pathetic script. Roland Emmerich is one of the very few directors (Like Michael Bay and Paul W.S. Anderson) that is not able to make a single good movie even with all the talent of the world. Will Smith makes here his second worst role. (The first worst role must be for the dreadful movie ""Hancock"") The only good things of this film are the special effects, but that's it. Many people seem to hate the most recent movies of Roland Emmerich, but to be honest he never made a single good film, not even a decent one.",/review/rw0387675/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2006,writerasfilmcritic,1," Worst Movie of the Decade
","Sometimes you wonder just how bad a movie can be. Don't wonder any longer. Just rent this colossal piece of manure and strap yourself in for perhaps the worst movie viewing experience you have ever tolerated. This overlong, overblown, ridiculous cartoon has one redeeming quality and that is the buildings being blown up once the aliens FINALLY launch their attack on the world. Prior to that, and trust me, it takes awhile, you must tolerate scene after scene of reaction shots to the approaching alien craft. The cast aren't really looking at anything because the computer animation hasn't been added yet. Ho-hum. Between these scenes and for a long time afterward, the people featured in this story have a peculiar tendency to go on with their lives as if there is no particular hurry trying to deal with everything suddenly turned upside down. There's all the time in the world to say goodbye, eat a bag of chips, drive to work, go on a short vacation, or do whatever else you want. That's when you realize just how boring and absurd this thing is going to be. We must admit those effects are pretty good, the giant explosions and the flying cars and trucks squashing the running crowds as they attempt escape. I'll give this horrendous pile a ""1"" just for that. Soon enough, though, we're right back to the sappy, dreary, meaningless dialog. You can almost imagine one of the actors on the set acting confused and asking, ",/review/rw0387675/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2011,TheLittleSongbird,4," Great special effects, but little else to offer
","When I first heard of this movie, I was fairly interested. It does have a great cast and it looked good. But I was disappointed. Granted, I do not think it is Roland Emmerich's worst film, but it is far from his best either(that's The Day after Tomorrow and even that was pretty uneven). The film does look great though, the special effects are very good and the scenery and cinematography are also excellent. David Arnold's score is also serviceable, with some interesting song choices, and the ending is quite explosive. However, the dialogue on the most part is very cheesy and forced, the story is shallow and incomprehensible and the direction is murky. Also the film is much too long, and it doesn't help that the pace is uneven. The acting, despite this great cast, is not good, they all try hard but they can't do anything with the dialogue and with Emmerich fighting them every step of the way it is no wonder. I am not a huge fan of Will Smith but he has done some stuff I like, however he overdoes it here and his character for some reason annoys me. Bill Pullman and Jeff Goldblum are great actors, but their characters are shallow and Goldblum especially should have had more to do. Overall, not terrible, but it is a case of the special effects overshadowing pretty much everything else. 4/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw0387675/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2005,nycritic,5," The First of Roland Emmerich's Love Letter to New York City.
","And I say that swimming in sarcasm, because if vaporizing the City is love, I'd cringe to know what hate would be like. With this inane, extremely dumbed-down action movie he begins a trilogy of films that aims its ugly, brainless head towards destroying New York City (and the rest of the United States with it) as aliens decide we really would not make very good hosts and take everything with them, enveloping them in turquoise light -- somehow this color is akin to everything horror: see THE RING for another reference -- which consumes all it touches in a ball of fire. All the clichés of action films are here and just shows how empty this movie is, with all its patriotism and heroism plastered on almost every frame. But... for every great director there must be one counterpart, and Emmerich is more than willing to fill those shoes. Awful. And that's being kind.",/review/rw0387675/?ref_=tt_urv

","Independence Day was released in 1996 and was a box office smash hit. It managed to be the year´s highest grossing film! But reviews for the film at time of release the film had mixed reviews but since release has gotten more positive reviews. The film had a $75 million budget and made over 10 times the amount back. The film had a fantastic trailer which is probably why so many people watched this film. The film was directed by Roland Emmerich who beforehand did Stargate and would later do the sequel to Independence Day, the critcially panned Godzilla 1998, and other disaster films like The Day After Tomorrow. This film is often criticized for being unoriginal, sterotypical characters, but has been praised for special effects but I have a few things to say about that.",/review/rw0387675/?ref_=tt_urv
