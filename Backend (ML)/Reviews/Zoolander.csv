14 May 2019,Ed-Shullivan,7," Family themed mystery series void of shirtless heroes, T&A, foul language, and infused with (wo)man's best friend ""Rex"".
","Nobody said that all hour long TV detective series had to be filmed in California, Chicago and/or New York, and not everyone wants to see shirtless lead detectives (Aka) Steve McGarret from Hawaii Five-O, or hot looking and young detective babes like Kensi Blye from NCIS: Los Angeles. Hudson & Rex provides an alternative to the high testosterone fueled smash/crash/blow 'em all up and make the arrest in the last two minute cookie cutter crime series.",/review/rw5584893/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2019,jk-692-236394,7," Gets better in the 2nd half of the first season
","This is getting better as it goes. I feel like people/networks/studios do not give series a chance anymore. Yes it is a little corny, and the acting is a bit wooden sometimes, but I still like it. I do agree I wish the show would embrace it's location and people more. So many Canadian shows barely acknowledge they are in Canada. They all seem to have no accents, unless someone slips, ( like ahboat, for about). I am American. I watch shows from all around the world and I enjoy it. This show is rated G, the dog is great and the plots remind me of old Murder She Wrote, or Rockford Files. That type of murder mystery. There is always a market for that kind of show.
Embrace where you are shooting and from. The show is practically 100% Canadian actors.",/review/rw5584893/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2020,lyndavanleeuwen,8," Entertaining Canadian detective show!
","I quite enjoy this show! Perhaps it's the dog, perhaps it's the handsome lead actor, perhaps it's the enjoyable writing & supporting actors!
I look forward to it each week, & often pvr it to rewatch later! I've recommended it to dog owner friends because the dog is a big part of the storyline!
We been to Newfoundland & enjoy the scenery around the city as well!
Hope it continues many seasons! A little romance between the lead characters wouldn't go amiss!",/review/rw5584893/?ref_=tt_urv

",The handsome star of this show is GREAT...his human co-star is just OK!,/review/rw5584893/?ref_=tt_urv

",Watchable if you like dogs and police detectives,/review/rw5584893/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2019,nospamboz,," That didn't suck!
","Long, long time Kommisar Rex fan here. The first episode was a nice tribute to the original show. Sure, it's not the best written (or acted) drama, but neither was the original. It was fun, though, and entertaining enough for my taste. I'm also an old Republic of Doyle fan (as well as Little Dog), so I like playing the find-the-filming-location-on-Google-Maps game. (Hint: MUN) Like I said, it didn't suck. I'll be watching.",/review/rw5584893/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2020,ACA13,10," Love the show. Makes me happy and relaxes me.
",Rex is the best of course.,/review/rw5584893/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2021,ZinQ,8," Very pleasant.
","Very pleasant to watch, both Reardon and Rex. Easy going, easy watching very nice programme. Just what I need when I don't want to think too much.",/review/rw5584893/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2019,nsivaloganathan,8," Entertaining Cop Drama
","Nice scenery, decent acting and good production value. Overall an entertaining pilot. Anyone who complains about the plot and script is entirely missing the point. This is not supposed to be an Emmy winning show, it's made to entertain and that it does well.",/review/rw5584893/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2021,bd-allen,8," Against the norm of trash, gore & swearing Thank God!
","There is so much trash on TV but this is so easy to watch. Not always easy to pick the culprit & I think it is getting better. I love the relationship ""Rex"" has with the actors and he seems to understand every word.",/review/rw5584893/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2020,aguynameddrew,8," Cute Show
",This is a family friendly police procedural with a talented dog as the foundation character.,/review/rw5584893/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2020,copperleaftreasures,10," Fun New Show!
",Love detective shows...even listen to old time radio shows! BUT...Hudson & Rex is a fun new show that provides a twist to the detective partner scenario. Hope this series continues for several seasons...,/review/rw5584893/?ref_=tt_urv
29 February 2020,ryanolaf,8," Old fashioned and entertaining
","Just started watching and really like it.. BUT, since H & R is Canadian, I'm amazed that the star is male, tall, straight and not unattractive. Considering the new protocols for creating TV shows, doubt it will last.. Also, people who complain about the lack of traditional accents on this show are hypocrites, because they also complain about pigeonholing, ""Newfies"" when they appear on other shows using that accent. Damned if you do, damned if you don't. Anyway, good luck to H & R and thanks for not offending the majority.",/review/rw5584893/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2019,keaymvideo,8," Refreshing change from the blood and gore!
","In all due respect to the negative comments posted here,I found it refreshing to watch a ""clean"" detective show that wasn't filled with blood, gore, excessive loud gunfire for superficial effect. We should be supportive of Newfoundland content and give the show an opportunity to grow and characters to develop. I watched the Littlest Hobo as child. With the exception of the German Sheppard the synopsis is different. It was based, if memory serves, on a dog who befriends and ex-convict attempting to live a better life.",/review/rw5584893/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2021,Avidviewer-02847,8," A nice crime drama with a very smart dog.
","This is a take off from the Austrian series ""Inspector Rex"" and in many countries it's Commissar or Commissioner Rex plus spin offs. In the Canadian series Rex is paired with St John's, NFL detective Charles Hudson played by John Reardon. Rex does tend to steal the scenes, but John Reardon and the other cast are good.",/review/rw5584893/?ref_=tt_urv

22 March 2020,popcorng-1,10," Please develop Charlie
",Charlie is gorgeous it's just all he does is say the right things he's too perfect you have to give him something else to do. The other characters are better.,/review/rw5584893/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2021,fkairns,10," Great cast
","This is an extremely interesting detective show. The scenery is terrific. The cast fit into their roles very nicely and believable. Some fascinating storylines which differ from the American detective shows, which don't get me wrong, I love. This however is fresh and allows you to invest in the small ensemble cast. The handsome John Reardon is very good to watch and his connection with ""Rex"" seems real.",/review/rw5584893/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2021,Cilica,7," A bit of fun
","Canadian Drama is known for it's wholesome output. Murdock Mysteries, and the like.",/review/rw5584893/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2021,Ladybbird-269-945146,8," The Doggie REX is a Better Actor Than The Human Crew..
",Bunch of soggy drips..& the director needs a good bite up the azz from lovely REX.,/review/rw5584893/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2022,bosporan,7," Good doggy fun with a dash of police procedural
","Have enjoyed this show since the beginning, the dog detective has been done before, but this is charming and relatable. The two key human characters - Det. Hudson and Sarah - work well together, though the rest of the regular cast are often irritating. The first three seasons are strong, but season 4 leads me to believe the writers are running out of steam. I like the fact that Mayko Nguyen's character (Sarah) has been given an increased scope. She is a fine actress and her involvement helps mitigate the plot slide and provides more balance having a second human in the field.",/review/rw5584893/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2019,Patricia89,7," Brings back childhood memories
","As a child i always watched Kommisaris Rex. I love that they brought it back as a complete new series. Brings back old memories and i love it.
Also love that they used small details out of the original series.",/review/rw5584893/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2021,donnieeb,7," family fun
",A really entertaining family show. Something your not afraid to watch with the kids. I dont know why canada can make shows like this one and burden of truth. And they are actually entertaining mystery and crime drama and everything in us is always dirty and politicized and not nescesarily entertaining. This show is fun and like a breath of fresh air.,/review/rw5584893/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2020,sk-84555-76152,8," Predictable but lovely!
","As someone who grew up watching the original Austrian Kommissar Rex, I didn't really hold out much hope for Hudson & Rex as KR was exceptionally well made yet I've found myself pleasantly surprised!",/review/rw5584893/?ref_=tt_urv
