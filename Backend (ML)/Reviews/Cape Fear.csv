10 April 2001,BaronBl00d,," ""Counselor, Come Out! Come Out! Wherever You Are!""
","Robert De Niro is one of those actors that just melts into a role.  His performance as rapist, convict, and all-around not-a-very-nice fellow Max Cady is certainly one of his most memorable performances for its stamina, strength, and excessiveness.  The film by Martin Scorsece is a remake of the classic film starring Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck.  Although Scorsece keeps the spirit of the film intact, he does make some very modern changes. He changes the role of Sam Bowden and family from one of harmony to dysfunction.  No character is the epitome of a universal good, but rather flawed(very flawed) goodness.  Nick Nolte does a fine job as Bowden and Jessica Lange and Juliette Lewis both give deep, emotional performances. The film is really a sea of emotion...most of that emotion being fear. Scorsece adds some arty touches with the camera, but it is his gritty style that really dominates the film's impact.  Scorsece also is ever the protector of film as he gives cameos to Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum, and Martin Balsam(all in the original film).  The other acting standout goes to Joe Don Baker as a hired private investigator.  But make no mistake....this is De Niro's film all the way.  He has some of the best lines as he harasses the Bowden family, terrorizes the Bowden family, and strips the Bowden family of all civility, pretense, and dignity.  This film is definitely a keeper!",/review/rw6194985/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2004,rmax304823,," Mortal Sins
","The climaxes are emblematic of the differences between Scorcese's version and the original. In 1962, Mitchum was ordinary, ironic, sneaky. Peck was Peck. And the climax was quiet. Crickets chirped. There was no wind. Bodies crept around in black shadows or splashed together in shallow water. In this one, Nolte is a lawyer who has broken the code and DeNiro is his nemesis, tatooed, obscene, half his face burned off, a raving maniac. Not sinister, just absolutely loco. And the confrontation is situated in a howling gale, earsplitting noise, rushing rapids, the groan of fiberglass hull splitting on rocks, blood all over the place.",/review/rw6194985/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2005,lee_eisenberg,10," Robert DeNiro truly gives this movie its element of fear
","To me, it's amazing that there's actually a place in North Carolina called Cape Fear, but it provides the perfect setting for this movie. Several years after attorney Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte) defended convicted rapist Max Cady (Robert DeNiro), Cady gets out of jail and decides that Bowden didn't do a good job defending him. After Sam and Max meet each other a few times, Max starts getting crazier and crazier. After he tries to enter Sam's house, Sam and his family go into hiding at Cape Fear. Then, the terror really begins.",/review/rw6194985/?ref_=tt_urv
3 May 1999,bat-5,," Intense
","Scorsese inherited this project from Steven Spielberg when the two swapped films.  Spielberg got Schindler's List and Scorsese got Cape Fear.  It would've been interesting to see how it would've turned out the other way around.  As it turns out, Cape Fear is a film that follows Scorsese's usual themes, mainly guilt.  Nick Nolte suffers from it, and Robert DeNiro helps to amplify the guilt.  He attacks Nolte indirectly, letting Nolte inflict the most damaging on himself.  In order to fight this loon, Nolte has to sink to his level, which is what DeNiro's Max Cady wanted. Scorsese's use of the camera is fluid and always moving.  Those slow zooms on Cady, the whip cuts from one scene to another and the whole end sequence is a doozy.  Bernard Herrman's great score is pumped through your speakers in Dolby sound and gives the film, a proper level of menace.  Watch this instead of ""The Fan.""  You won't be disappointed.",/review/rw6194985/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2005,Smells_Like_Cheese,9," A disturbing and intense thriller
","You've pretty much read it in my comments, I am a huge fan of M.S. and R.D. But honestly, I watched ""Cape Fear"" because I bought ""The Simpsons"" 5th season on DVD, and I had no idea that the Sideshow Bob episode where he tries to kill Bart was based on this movie. So, I knew I had to rent this movie if it was good enough to parody on ""The Simpsons"". And it was very disturbing to watch. Robert DeNiro is one of my favorite actors, and he completely freaked me out in this film. Especially the scene between him and Juliette Lewis. Even though in some ways this film is done a little over the top, it all adds together very well. I was very impressed with this film and would recommend it to Martin Scorsesse fans of course. Even though I wouldn't say this was his best work, it is one of his best thrillers though.",/review/rw6194985/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2017,TheLittleSongbird,7," A case of slicker and bigger not meaning better, but not a remake to be denounced
","Not one of Martin Scorsese's best films by a long shot (though he has also done worse). This said, as said in my review for 'Hugo', even when Scorsese was not at his best the films in question were still better than the worst films of most. This is also coming from a director who when at his best, like with 'Goodfellas', 'Raging Bull' and 'Taxi Driver' for examples, gave some of the best films out there.",/review/rw6194985/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2008,bkoganbing,7," Don't Give A Psycho A Grudge
","Even though Robert DeNiro was nominated for Best Actor for this Martin Scorsese directed remake of Cape Fear, my heart is still with the original. The multi-tattooed voluminous DeNiro is far less menacing than Robert Mitchum was in the original.",/review/rw6194985/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2000,exterminator_99,9," Not Scorcese's best, but pretty good!
","Martin Scorcese's filmography as director is one of the most accomplished in modern film history.  While Cape Fear can't even hold a candle next to ""Taxi Driver"", ""Raging Bull"" and ""Goodfellas"", it is still a fabulous remake of the 1962 noir classic and it keeps the viewer on the edge right through until the closing credits.",/review/rw6194985/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2005,Dan1863Sickles,9," The Great Un-American Classic!
","This brutal, violent and suspenseful thriller combines a scorching performance by Robert Deniro, sumptuous location photography, and a powerful script that raises disturbing questions about religion, sex, and class distinctions in our so-called classless society.",/review/rw6194985/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2008,moonspinner55,5," Hammy and illogical throughout...
","Director Martin Scorsese is in over-the-top spirits for this illogical remake of the 1962 thriller about a just-released convict (Robert De Niro acting the badass, complete with ugly tattoos) terrorizing the lawyer/family man (Nick Nolte) who failed to keep him out of jail on a rape conviction. De Niro's cigar-chomping, sneering performance would be a highlight under different circumstances, yet he's used here as the ultimate bogeyman, hiding under a moving car or springing up like the killer in ""Halloween"". Scorsese revels in the opportunity to show an ordinary, wholesome family being dragged down into the gutter by a savage beast of a man, but the picture is really ungainly. One neat touch: the stars of the original version, Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum and Martin Balsam, appear in cameos (Peck and Mitchum cast amusingly against type). Otherwise, a well-made but baffling, ridiculous picture. Two Oscar nominations: De Niro as Best Actor and Juliette Lewis (playing Nolte and Jessica Lange's daughter) as Best Supporting Actress. ** from ****",/review/rw6194985/?ref_=tt_urv

9 December 2004,Idocamstuf,9," One of the better thrillers of the 90's
","I have wanted to see this movie for quite some time, and I finally saw it, and I thought that it was great. I am a huge Martin Scorsese fan, and I would have to say this is one of his most true to life films, even though its not his best film. The acting is great,and so is the music. The film will send shivers through your body. This is also one of DeNiro's most underrated performances and deserved more attention at the time of its release. Its also great to see some of the actors from the original version show up in cameo roles. If you like horror films and thrillers, you will most likely enjoy this. ***1/2 out of ****. A recommended viewing.",/review/rw6194985/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 1999,Chuck-149,9," Another classic in the bag for Scorsese and De Niro.
","I haven't seen the original ""Cape fear"" with Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck yet, but it's got to be pretty good to be better than this one. Although the end is somewhat a little farfetched, the rest of the movie is absolutely riveting.  De Niro got a very well-deserved nomination for his role as crazy Max Cady but fell on a bad year because it was pretty hard to beat Hopkin's performance in ""The silence of the lambs"".",/review/rw6194985/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2008,johnny-08,7," 'Counselor, could you be there?'
","Last night on TV there was ""Casino"" and today ""Cape Fear"" so I decided to take a look again at those two Scorsese movies. What I remembered from first viewing of ""Cape Fear"", about 8 years ago, is that that was one scary movie. I was only a kid back then, but even after all these years I felt again that this movie gives great doze of fear. Mostly it is because of brilliant portrayal coming from Robert De Niro (Max Cady is definitely not kind of guy who you wanna meet) and great Martin Scorsese ability to 'manufacture' terrifying scenes (for example when Nolte is hiding behind trash cans and when De Niro says: 'Counselor, could you be there?' - that one reminded me of Walter Hill's ""The Warriors"" and Luther in the same movie). Scorsese + De Niro (his all time favorite) never fails to deliver when they have as good script as this. Here, there is relationship between lawyers and clients, parents and children; also law in America is comprehended, where are holes in system, what can or cannot man do to protect his family and so on. I also read some of the comments that compare this one with the original and spits on this movie. To those people I say that this is an Oscar winning picture for some remakes I have seen in my life. If Mitchum and Peck (stars from the original) gave their blessing why can't you? So, I advise you to take a look at this Scorsese picture because it's scary, with Hitchcock elements and great acting coming from all actors involved. This is a great horror/thriller!!!",/review/rw6194985/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2008,Theo Robertson,7," Entertaining But Rather Flawed And Slightly Dated
","When it was released in 1991 GMTV film reviewer Paul Gambacini described Scorsese's CAPE FEAR as "" being ham directed "" . This is yet more evidence that if you want to be a film reviewer it's not what you know , it's who you know . CAPE FEAR isn't a film that suffers from "" ham directing "" , it's a film that is rather formalist and suffers from what David Bordwell describes as "" intensified continuity "" . If you're unfamiliar with the term then please look it up and Scorsese wasn't the only American director using the technique because many other directors especially Oliver Stone were doing exactly the same thing in the early 1990s . If Scorsese is to be criticised for doing this then the entire American film industry is equally guilty ",/review/rw6194985/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2009,mcfly-31,4," Scorsese on Elm Street....
","I think we all begin a lot of reviews with, ""This could've made a GREAT movie."" A demented ex-con freshly sprung, a tidy suburban family his target. Revenge, retribution, manipulation. Marty's usual laying on of the Karo syrup. But unfortunately somewhere in Universal's high-rise a memorandum came down: everyone ham it up.",/review/rw6194985/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2001,Quinoa1984,8," Not in his (Scorsese's) best, but definately has it's moments of glory
","Martin Scorsese takes his first whack at the horror/thriller genre with a remake of the 1962 classic of the same title.  While I can not truthfully say the original was better due to the fact that I never saw the original, I have a feeling that Scorsese has brought his maestro touch to the film that changes it slightly from the original to make it better, because this is quite the suspenser.",/review/rw6194985/?ref_=tt_urv

10 March 2018,pmtelefon,2," I saw this twice on it's opening weekend (1991) and it SUCKS!!!
","This is how Scorsese follows up Goodfellas? Shame on him. It's so bad... I remember back then Scorsese said that DeNiro talked him into making this movie. Well Martin, if Robert was going to jump off a bridge...? Come on, friendship only goes so far. The script is just so dumb. Scorsese was doomed from the start. What's really shocking is that he managed to get pretty bad performances from this usually rock solid cast. The only ones that came off well are Peck and Mitchum (sorry Joe Don). He takes the great (and sexy) Jessica Lange and turns her a shrill, screaming annoyance. Nolte, strong movie bad ass, is turned into a weak (most of the time), dumb (almost all the time) movie bad ass. And legendary DeNiro is somehow over-the-top and uninteresting at the same time. He only has one really good scene. His accent alternates from okay to silly but always remains distracting. The movie is also too mean. I'm fine with violence in movies (only) but meanness is a huge turn off. I don't like having my nose rubbed in it. On the bright side, the last half hour or so is laugh out loud bad. Unbelievably bad considering the giant talents involved in this one. I don't remember how I felt about it 27 years ago. I think it wasn't one of my favorites but I don't remember thinking it was that bad. But now, wow, it's a borderline camp classic.",/review/rw6194985/?ref_=tt_urv

","The film is overlong and fails to build suspense. The game of cat and mouse never turns the tables and watching the same cat play with a mouse becomes monotonous very quickly. The thrills of this thriller are pedestrian and this great role for Robert De Niro overwhelms the film as a whole. The story is not coherent and lacks credibility necessary to truly bring terror or suspense to a viewer..
I do recommend this film as the role is a great one for De Niro but the film itself is a puzzle of mediocrity. I read that the script had 24 drafts and this may be part of the problem. Obviousness. Hollywood crap.",/review/rw6194985/?ref_=tt_urv
