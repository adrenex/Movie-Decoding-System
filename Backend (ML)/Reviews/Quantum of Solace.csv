25 January 2023,chris-b-welch,10," Fantastic and funny depiction of JW Cult
","Ignore the low scoring reviews from currernt Jehovah's Witnesses who've sinned and watched this, because it is an honest and funny depiction of life in their cult.",/review/rw8847373/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2023,bazroad,10," Hilarious depiction of JW life
",Being raised a Jehovah's Witness and leaving 2 years ago I found this sitcom hilarious and surprisingly accurate. The writers must of also been raised in the religion because there were so many small querks that you'd only know if you lived through it first hand. I'm not sure how well people from a different background will understand the niche jokes but I couldn't stop laughing. I thought they did a really good job of balancing the hilarious side of some of the rules and also the seriousness of it and how it affects people's family. I like how they changed just enough details so as not to get sued by them! I hope they return for series 2!!,/review/rw8847373/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2023,pureplanning,9," Very Clever and Very Funny.
","This is an excellent sitcom. It is very layered, so takes a few episodes for things to settle in and become familiar and therefore comfortable to laugh at. It its both heart warming and laugh out loud funny. The acting is great, and the direction and setting is perfect. It is an excellent parody of organised religion,family life and modern Britain. But there is also a clear positive message and a feel good factor that makes it a great watch. Simon Bird plays his familiar uptight self, as a over pious dad.. But the rest of the cast play around this with real skill, making him seem even more uptight than in the inbetweeners. Really well done..",/review/rw8847373/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2023,greenwoodhugo,10," The best thing channel 4 has made in a while !
","I couldn't stop watching. I really enjoyed this show. It doesn't paint the believers of this fictional faith as moronic/evil , instead it paints a realistic picture of how some faiths and preachers can harm the people they're trying to enlighten.",/review/rw8847373/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2023,benjaminmann,6," Simon Bird can't act which is the main problem
","Good scripts and a fine premise. A parody of Jehovah's Witnesses and various hard line Christian sects. A talented cast that is let down by Simon Bird who is only capable of rehashing the same character seen in In-betweens. He's got no other range and it takes the whole story line into comedy clich√©, where as all the other cast are quite rightly playing the characters much straighter and therefore stronger.",/review/rw8847373/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2023,bambinboots,10," From the moment I turned it on ...fab
","It was quite clear it was the cult I grew up in in the first 5 seconds of the show, it was so unbelievably funny and accurate the person who wrote it must have grown up in the cult because there was so many tiny things you would only know if you was one, they even got characters down to a T - i could deffo relate also I liked the diversions for copywrite purposes lol it was refreshing to see this and it helps to laugh about this past traumatic life lol I hope they keep it rolling!",/review/rw8847373/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2023,backofthevan,3," Sadly disappointing
","Good idea poorly done. Just not funny. I got almost to the end of episode 5, despite my doubts all the way through. I like to give a show a chance and I was hoping it would improve. Ridiculous cartoon characters throughout. Nobody is realistic at all; just caricatures going through the motions reciting a dreadfully unfunny script written by people who, apparently, haven't a clue about ""funny"".",/review/rw8847373/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2023,MJP88,5," Great idea poorly written
",The premise for this show is great and I was excited to watch it after seeing the trailer but unfortunately it's written by people who are not good writers and don't understand comedy.,/review/rw8847373/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2023,sjo-15,8," Mostly enjoyable slow burner
","When watching new US series, if its a slow burner sometimes it can take a few episode to ""get it"". If that happens with a UK series, with only 6 episodes, the series is almost finished by the time it clicks.",/review/rw8847373/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2023,jefferons,1," Unfunny comedy
",It's not funny. A bit creepy.like a disturbing drama. Simon bird ruins it. The rest are OK as actors. But Simon doesn't take it seriously .,/review/rw8847373/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2023,owen-watts,7," Sacrilicious
","This spankingly new comedy from Dillon Mapletoft and Oliver Taylor (themselves quite new) is a functional little slice of familial and theological ribbing. It's not reinventing many comedy wheels and some of the side plots and characters are a little sketched-out, shallow or unfinished but there's some solid 'twists' (if you can call them that in a sitcom), quite a few surreal asides, and a genuinely effective character arc or two in here. The focus is mostly on the family so it doesn't feel too punch-downy on the little fish of the evangelical world, but it's lack of specificity makes it feel oddly toothless. I'd be interested to see what another series could add to it.",/review/rw8847373/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2023,bermondsey111,10," Funny, clever (but not smarmy) sitcom about a Christian cult
","I loved this show from beginning to end. It has all the hallmarks of a traditional comedy sitcom but also, quite originally, a moving narrative arc that runs throughout the episodes. It portrays what a religious sect is like ""from the inside"" which means it doesn't feel like a satire really but more like an exploration of the psychology of what it feels like to live with an extreme set of beliefs. Most importantly for me, it feels freshly written and funny, with character-based jokes that belong in the tradition of American sitcoms like 'The Office' or 'Arrested Development'. Kate O'Flynn, Amy James-Kelly and Lolly Adefope particular standouts.",/review/rw8847373/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2023,norwell-services,7," Religion = Control
","If you were brought up in a cult Christian religion then you'll have an ""in"" to what's going on. I don't think it's based on any one cult but is a very clever mix of several that I'm aware of and grew up in. E.g. The cult I was associated with did discourage going to college and encouraged full time door to door ministry.",/review/rw8847373/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2023,chriscookuk-91918,1," Didn't even raise a smile nevermind a laugh. Terrible
",I had high hopes but as some have said it's all very safe & very unfunny. Only watched episode 1 & might give another a try simply to see if it gets better (it really couldn't get any worse). Never mind laughing it never even made me raise a smile which is highly unusual. Maybe some that have escaped similar strange religions might relate & therefore find it funny but otherwise you'd be struggling. Simon Birds bowl haircut kind of sums up its desperate attempt to be funny and it completely failing in that. I'd go as far to say it's embarrassingly cringeworthy. C4 leave religious comedy to Father Ted!,/review/rw8847373/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2023,jonssmith-55302,10," Absolutely love it!
",I grew up in an evangelical christian cult-like religious organisation and much of this is so close to my experience it is uncanny. I appreciate that not many other people will have experienced this sort of thing but believe me it exists.,/review/rw8847373/?ref_=tt_urv
