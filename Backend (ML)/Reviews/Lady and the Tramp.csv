13 August 2010,mattechalk,9," A young girl just off a bus from the midwest tries to find her life's passion by working at a seedy strip club.
","This show's poor production value is not a fault, it is what makes it so funny. The acting is terrible, the plot is terrible, the dialogue is terrible, the characters are so extremely stock its terrible, but that is exactly why this show is so FUNNY and AWESOME. The people who made this show obviously wanted to make it look like a shoddy, poorly-produced 1980s drama. But its not a drama, that's the humor in it. Anyways, this show is more or less just an excuse to show hot, busty women parading around in barely any clothing. This show is not to be taken seriously. Perfect if you're in your 20's, male, and a stoner. So please, don't take this show seriously, you will only be wasting your time. Don't read too far into this one. I love HOT SLUTS!!!!!",/review/rw2157118/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2009,NumeroOne,4," disappointing. good talent, bad web series.
","This show has Alison Brie and Mac's mom from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, so I checked it out. It's not that funny. It has poor production value. The editing is almost as amateurish as the sound mix. Dialogue is mostly of the mediocre expository variety. The actors were not given much to work with. The little bit of humor that is there is obvious and underdone. Not funny, not endearing... just disappointing. I'm required to extend this to 10 lines in order for it to be posted, so I must find a way... Watch Community and Mad Men. Alison Brie is talented and is super pretty. I found this show because I wanted to see more of her work. But this web series was so mediocre that she hardly even managed to shine. If I'd seen her in this first, I probably wouldn't have given her a second thought, but it's the show's creators' faults, not hers. I empathize with all actors involved. I hope that the show was at least easy and painless for them.",/review/rw2157118/?ref_=tt_urv
