16 September 2018,Kirpianuscus,," Jim Carrey
","After decades , he deserves the role of Jeff. As the summary of a career. And as proof of his skills , out of ordinaries categories, from drama to easy comedy. The serie has the virtue of an admirable director, great actors, a dark plot , using the humor as precise tool for describe a world in which to save the appearences is more important than to be yourself. The film reminds the force of Jim Carreys talent. And it does it in splendid manner. Short, a man, under pressure, in show world. And his answers to a profound grief. All using the shadows more than the performances itself, using appearences in a too familiar manner for many lives of public . So, Jim Carrey. And his great partners.",/review/rw4377276/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2022,shanekraus,8," Most underrated show of all time
","This is one of the most amazing shows I've ever seen. Jim carrey delivers his best performance, and one of the greatest performances ever. This show is hilarious, but also exceedingly dark, which only makes it better. 2 great seasons. The ending of this show is a masterpiece. But still, the fact that this show got canceled is a tragedy.",/review/rw4377276/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2020,UniqueParticle,9," Wonderfully heartwarming
","A charming adult version of Mr Rogers mixed with any of Michael Condry's films and the incredibly talented Jim Carrey; he's so beloved to me! I absolutely love all the generosity involved throughout, it's so sweet. Kidding would be cool on drugs I'm excited for season 2!",/review/rw4377276/?ref_=tt_urv

14 March 2020,swordsnare,9," Beautifully Melancholic
",'Kidding' approaches the subject of grief and loss that is commonly masked by comedy. From Executive Producer Michel Gondry (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) and Creator Dave Holstein (Weeds) you can get a sense of the handling of this show. Bit of dark/quirky comedy that is quite poignant and inevitably gets you in the 'feels'.,/review/rw4377276/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2021,henrycoles9,9," Really cool dramedy
","""Kidding"" is fun, wry and dark. It's refreshing to see this side of Jim Carrey. Cole Allen is such a talented boy. Frank Langella's stern humor is amazing.",/review/rw4377276/?ref_=tt_urv

28 September 2018,mageh,8," Unique approach
","It is a good show, very different from current TV junk. It is unique and definitely will not appeal for average audience. It may not be perfect, but has potential to be outstanding, hopefully writers will not disappoint. I think Jim Carrey is a perfect fit for it.",/review/rw4377276/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2020,thomaspaynejramazon,9," Surprisingly great
","Let me just say that I'm not a Jim Carrey fan. At least not until now. Don't get me wrong I think he's a great actor I just never liked the characters that much and in fact I still don't like this character. However the show is really strong, the supporting cast is great, the pacing is slow but patient etc. whilel watching Homeland I kept seeing these ads and decided I would give it a shot, honestly three or four episodes in I still didn't like it. But it just gets stronger and season two it looks to be really excellent",/review/rw4377276/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2020,thegreekmason,10," holy.....!!!!
","Ok, any preconceived notion of who you thought was jim carrey should be thrown out the window. this is one seriously dark and odd show. you laugh at moments of complete cringe worthy moments. this isn't for the faint of heart. it is truly a weird show. I just wish each episode was longer. give it a go. first season is a little too weird, but it comes into its own. just give it a go if you want someone completely out of the ordinary and I mean completely out of the ordinary.",/review/rw4377276/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2018,MikeO_64,9," Hooked. No Kidding!
","While I admit after the first episode, I knew I liked it, but thought I could go either way depending on the next. I am now fully invested in this tremendous show. Jim Carrey doing TV again was the catalyst, obviously, but it has soared past any expectations I might've had. It is equally quirky, and shocking, and hilarious, and above all, supremely well-written. Never talks down or insults your intelligence. Why Frank Langella didn't become a superstar is beyond me. He is an absolutely stunning actor. I am glued to the screen when I watch ""Kidding"" every bit as much as I was to ""Breaking Bad"", but for obviously different reasons.",/review/rw4377276/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2021,Pinocchietto,8," A great TV series!
","Strange, particular, emotional, embarrassing, uncomfortable, modern TV series with twists! To be seen. As always, Jim Carrey's interpretation is successful. Recommended for those who want to see a TV series that is not boring and also makes you laugh!",/review/rw4377276/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2018,noellecm,9," Jim Carrey, once again, shows his incredible talent and range
","If you were expecting an ""In Living Color"" Jim Carrey, you will be sorely disappointed with Kidding. This is an absolutely grand dark comedy with an amazing supporting cast with Catherine Keener and the incredible Frank Langella. Kidding explores the reality behind a children's television icon. The face portrayed on the kids show is starkly contrasted by the reality of a man whose life is in pieces. Carrey's portrayal of ""Jeff"", the man at the center of the chaos, grasps at things and makes decisions that might seen good ideas at the moment, but may well cause more destruction down the road. Carrey is masterful playing a very broken Jeff admidst a life that is on the trajectory of coming undone.",/review/rw4377276/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2018,sammiesoonj,10," Heartbreaking but AMAZING
","Jim's portrayal of Mr. Pickles is wonderful. He is so pure and loving, but is going through so much pain. Witnessing the breaks in that demeanor is very real and touching. Seeing someone who strives to be a role model for kids react in such a human way. A reaction that is so opposite of the on screen Mr. Pickles. I cannot wait for more episodes. I don't believe I've ever wanted to write a review for a tv show as badly as I did for this one.",/review/rw4377276/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2020,sanosito,10," No Third Season? Really? Why?
","This show is so perfect. Very creative and unique. Reflects real life but in a funny and somewhat warped dark way. Makes one think deeply as to what is truly important in a totally new and different way. Jim Carrey is at his very best. The entire cast is great. In short, I am in awe of everything associated with this series. It should NEVER end.",/review/rw4377276/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2018,weho-40149,10," Don't rate the whole show based on just 1 episode
",My rating may change depending on the whole season... I am just shocked of the many bad reviews and the unfair low rating 6.5!!!!,/review/rw4377276/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2020,michael-561-692892,9," Jim Carrey is back!

4 October 2018,hishamkavarodi,10," Deciding who you want to be in the face of pain.
","The bleakness of this show, the darkness in it, shows you the contrast in human behavior as you reel from a loss. Jim Carrey continues to hold on to the goodness in him while the rest just delve deeper into the pit of their suffering. All the characters find the usefulness and weaknessess of their choices. The show gives you enough perspectives to see through on what pain can do to one another and how you can choose to percieve it and deal with it.",/review/rw4377276/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2018,arxontas21,," I dont know if its good or bad but its something special
","I really cant tell if this show is good. Not yet at least, but it really got my attention. Very heavy show trying to touch some very heavy topics. Jim is really good and im afraid that he is trying to reveal some of his true emotions in this show. I can surely say one thing. You should give it a shot. I promise you that you wont get bored.",/review/rw4377276/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2018,kathleenrose39-82-885577,10," Compelling and Original
",This show slowly pulled me in. Jim Carrey's performance is fantastic all around. He is surrounded by an amazing ensemble- even the young actors are terrific. The writing is impeccable. It's hard wait between episodes!,/review/rw4377276/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2018,namikazedante,10," Showtime does it again !
","With shows like Dexter and Californication. I am not surprised I love 'Kidding'. And same as with those shows, they are on the darker side with the mood, life and what kind of humor they represent.",/review/rw4377276/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2018,mauriciofernandogerhardt,10," a giver in a world of takers
","This is the story of a family that makes tv show with puppets, and one human host, called Mr. Pickles, (played by Jim Carrey), that tries to appeal to kid's kinder side. Trying to pass them the values of being a good person.
The controlling father is the director of the show. The son is the host. The daughter is the the puppet maker of the show, and one of the puppet handlers.
The host's wife is separating from him because, in the past, a faulty stoplight has caused an accident with another car that has killed one of their 2 twin sons. Since the host is such a good person, he accepts the death and is not filled with rage. The sepparating wife is filled with rage, and can't accept the death, and doesn't like to feel like she's a bad person in comparison to the host, so she finds another person.
The host's other son doesn't give that much attention to his father's words of the value of being good.
The host wants to insert into the show more messages to the kids about death and accepting death, and depression, and exposing the hipocrisies of the world, etc.
The father doesn't accept this, and thinks his son is close to a break down, but cares more about the future of the show, than his son's mental wellbeing, so he plans to create a puppet of the host/ mr. Pickles, and make a mr. Pickles on ice show, so that when he does mentally break down, he will have a replacement (another human dressed as mr. pickles).
The puppet is made by his sister.
With increasing stress to the host (dead son, bad son, sepparating wife, betraying father and sister), he becomes more and more unhinged. There's much more to the story, but I think this is enough for you to decide if this is for you. There's very little humor, except for some subtle dark humor when exposing the dark facets of human""kind"". It's smartly written and directed.
Particularly I think this series is very relevant in the face of the rise of the prominent narcisissistic psychopathic compulsive liars of this day and age, wether they be politicians, rap singers, people with no talents that are rich and expose themselves on reality tv, people who scare children on youtube to get revenue, people who generate drama on social media to appear relevant, etc.
It's as if the host is the last person with moral values in the world, trying to bring light to the darkness, but the darkness is much too strong and is closing in on him.",/review/rw4377276/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2018,danielnunez-81518,10," Carrey is brooding
","To start this review, I just want to ask people to please separate politics from this show. Mr. Carrey no doubt has some very polarizing political views and after looking at the comment section of a Showtime thread on Facebook, I can't help but feel that the reason this show has a score below a 7 is because of his political views. It's simply not fair to let a certain view that you identify with be the cause of a biased and unfair rating. Now onto my thoughts about the show so far...",/review/rw4377276/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2021,chervenkov,9," Everything is out of the orinary, the acting is unreal
","Firstly, Jim Carey is one hell of an actor. The range of emotions Jeff Pickles undergoes is so vast, and he as a character is written so idiosyncratic. I like how Jeff is this all loving, save the world person, however there is also a scene where he puts a dead parrot in the drain (pretty dark). It's not only him, can not tell if it's purely the actors or if it is the script writers but they all seem so incredibly odd. I mean little girl sleeping with an axe and naming it - pretty funny.",/review/rw4377276/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2018,pourdamghani,," A balanced show
","Please don't judge it by just watching its first episodes; it will become better gradually. Fortunately, it is a balanced show, even though you can say from the cover that Jim Carrey is bold. The storyline is well written and not flat and boring. The director (brightly) overuses colors and lights to change the mood of scenes, to mimic children shows, a format in which Kidding try to present bitter truths.",/review/rw4377276/?ref_=tt_urv
