27 July 2014,CalRhys,," The Most Visually Stunning Film Of 2013
","Truly epic in scale! Whilst 'Gravity' falls short against films like '2001: A Space Odyssey', it is a tense and visually stunning thriller from Alfonso Cuarón. Cuarón is one of my all-time favourite directors, and this CGI-heavy project just boasts skill and ingenuity from the director, DOP and VFX artist. The critics stated that you would be gripping to the edge of your seats, this is true in every aspect, the film is full of intense and thriller situations with amazing performances from Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Just shy from winning Best Picture over '12 Years a Slave', 'Gravity' left the Oscars with 7 Academy Awards to its name, and it deserved each and every one of them. A masterpiece that allows the viewer to become immersed within the scene to often thrilling effect.",/review/rw2904922/?ref_=tt_urv

13 October 2013,littlemartinarocena,8," Stars in Space
","Visually stunning. A real first in the technical department and presumably that was the extent of its intent. None of the great themes of Kubrick's 1968 masterpiece ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", are present here. This is a superlative, 90 odd minutes of remarkable beauty but the 90 odd minutes become really long because, just like the heroine we have so little to cling on to, story wise. It seems petty to criticize a film of this kind for whatever it doesn't accomplish because what it means to accomplish, it does in spectacular fashion. I just felt that I was served a glorious appetizer without a main course. Two huge stars in space Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. Why? If the idea was to dazzled us with something we had never seen before, great unknown actors would have added an extra something. Kubrick used Keir Dullea in ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", yes, Keir Dullea, or as Noel Coward put it, Keir Dullea, gone tomorrow. We know that if Sandra Bullock was in charge she, one way or another, will land safely. She's terrific, don't get me wrong, but I wasn't as worried about her as I should have been. The last problem was the score. Why? A standard horror/action flick musical score with cheap shots here and there. I think the purity of the work needed to be extended on every department. Now, putting all that aside, director Alfonso Cuaron must be applauded and I strongly recommend you to run and see it in the biggest screen you can find and in 3D.",/review/rw2904922/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2018,paulclaassen,2," Nothing believable about this yawner.
","Why is it called Gravity when there's zero gravity for most of the film? Wow, this was a lot of floating and spinning and deja vu. Could it have been any more dragged out? At times it felt the film wasn't moving forward at all and I wanted to give it a push. How much of the same thing can one stomach in one film??? They could easily have shot this film in a small, square blue screen room, since they hardly did anything and everything was CGI anyway. Why is a medical doctor fixing things on a space ship anyway? And why is the astronaut telling the doctor what happens when you run out of oxygen, and how you should act? The final moment as the craft entered Earth's atmosphere was quite spectacular, though...oh well, about 3 minutes or so...",/review/rw2904922/?ref_=tt_urv

","To me, 'Gravity' may not quite the masterpiece that it has been touted to be, though the critics and positive reviews do a fantastic job summing up the film's merits. However, while it is easy to see why some won't like it it is nowhere near as bad from personal opinion as the negative reviewers say. It is nowhere near the worst film ever and not deserving of a 1/10 rating with the visuals, effects and direction being such an achievement, the trend to bash critics and those who agree with the general consensus has also become extremely annoying.",/review/rw2904922/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2013,ClaytonDavis,10," 'Gravity' lives up to the hype with Sandra Bullock's crowning achievement intact (★★★★)
","There is a sensational and overwhelming power that Alfonso Cuarón's space thriller ""Gravity"" possesses and manages to sustain in its 90 minute run time. I think I left my jaw on the theater floor. There are four things in particular to credit for this occurrence. The first of which being co-writer and director Cuarón, who has constructed one of his finest outings. ""Gravity"" breathes in a way I haven't seen before and is probably one of the best technical marvels that cinema has offered in the past twenty years. Cuarón handles the film with absolute certainty, restraining himself from committing any science fiction bourgeois, and reinventing the genre in a miraculous execution.

This film makes you feel like you are drifting among the stars, instead of just showing you a story set in space.

12 October 2013,Robert_duder,6," Can't jump on the Gravity bandwagon for this one
","From the first trailer for the film I thought it looked intriguing, though the trailers never provided much information. You could guess at the concept and most guesses would be accurate. Its a survival/disaster story set in space with astronauts and no hint of science fiction whatsoever. I was a little surprised that suddenly the film exploded with huge ratings and huge box office returns. So because of that my expectations were high and I was prepared to potentially see a 10/10 film. I didn't hate this movie...do not get me wrong. It was entertaining and had some really nail biting moments. Visually it was good. But couldn't anyone make a visually stunning film with the backdrop of space looking down on earth. My biggest issue with the film is how unrealistic it felt. I am not a scientist and I know nothing about space travel but do I need to in order to know that NASA would not be sending up someone who is emotionally and physically unprepared and watching Bullock's character is sometimes laughable and that is unfortunate. I know I'm not the only one because other reviewers on IMDb have pointed out the exact things that bothered me. She makes poor decisions, completely unrealistic moves and generally is unbelievable in the role.",/review/rw2904922/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2013,grumpy-3,5," i have given it 5 stars for the graphics only otherwise its a 1 star film
","Oh deary me, the sheep like critics here in the UK and the US have all gone gaga over this really inane and very stupid film, with two lead characters who would never be allowed in space. Apart from utter trivial and bad dialogue, with no depth or feeling, we do not care one iota for them. the bullock character is so bad and useless and mostly out of control, yet we have to swallow that she makes it. the death of clooney is utterly pointless, there was no reason for him to die. the science, well the science does not exist in this movie, things happen that just would not. the debris that hits them would be falling as it rotates round the earth so would not be in the same orbit second time around, they very conveniently have the Chinese station doing that but not the other floating objects. What keeps really annoying me is that critics here that write for the so called intelligent papers and media, go in and see a film like this and leave their brains at the door, i know assume that in fact they do not possess and intellect whatsoever. they write like 14 year old fan boys, if any unknown director or someone they considered a hack had made this they would have laughed at it, but because it was cuaron they lapped it up.",/review/rw2904922/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2013,tcara111,1," Gravity is Weightless
","Did those who've written glowing reviews of Gravity see the same movie I did? Look, I wanted to like this flick, I really did. And I don't want to rag on it, but if you're going to make a dramatic science thriller, you had better get it right or expect to catch it from the smart people. Despite the cosmic setting, the only star I can give Gravity is for the computer generated graphics.That said, this is not a movie for intellectuals and those of a scientific bent will be sorely disappointed. What made Ron Howard's Apollo 13 so gripping was its dramatic realism and superb acting. Unfortunately, none of those adjectives applies to Gravity, with the possible exception of some drama. However, for thinkers, effective drama requires an intellectual investment in the credibility of the story, the characters and the interaction between them. Intelligent humans need to believe that what is being depicted could actually happen. Unfortunately, the events depicted in Gravity are likely to alienate anyone with an above average IQ. Once one has acknowledged the impressive graphics, any anticipation of emotional investment is quickly dashed to smithereens by the unbelievably vapid and inane dialog. It is painfully obvious that someone with a double-digit scientific IQ appears to have awoken one morning and haphazardly decided to write a ""space movie"". The physics are off, the events highly improbable. The entire story demands a suspension of belief in reality. Worst of all, the dialog and interaction between the characters is so juvenile that anyone with a brain gets the immediate impression that the project is the product of sophomoric show-biz types who think that the way to move the product is to recycle hackneyed clichés, shiny objects and big explosions. Bullock's character, Dr. Ryan Stone, is so unprepared and emotionally disabled by adversity that it is impossible to believe that she would have been selected as a mission specialist. Yet, she manages to flit from one space wreck to another and yet another. She consults operation manuals in Russian and, later, Chinese, yet she is heard muttering ""eeny meeny miney mo"" while haphazardly pushing control buttons like some clueless chimpanzee. The space vehicle's communication equipment fails to pick up ""Houston Control"", yet, miraculously, is able to receive a bizarre Chinese comedy and howling dogs, which Bullock's character feels compelled to imitate. Clooney's character, Matt Kowalski, is such a clichéd hero that he is depicted as nonchalantly jesting with the hysterical Dr. Stone while he himself is drifting into a desperately life-ending situation. We are expected to believe that, despite having trained intimately together for this mission, these characters address each other by their formal titles and make clichéd announcements back to a non-responsive mission control. Kowalksi has waited until he's drifting to his death to ask where Dr. Stone is from and if she has any kids. Finally, director Cuaron makes a supremely lame attempt at cinematic iconography depicting Bullock floating in a fetal position, a la Kubrick's Space Odessey. And after having had such a bad day and having plunged to Earth in a flaming meteor-like reentry, Stone emerges, unscathed and barefoot mind you, from the ocean onto an idyllic, uninhabited beach like some primal human emerging from the sea. Now, I feel bad about feeling bad about this movie. And I respect Ms. Bullock and Mr. Clooney as actors. However, it is my humble opinion that actors must assume some responsibility for the roles they accept. This movie was so cringe-worthy that the only reason I sat through it was to see how ridiculous it would get. Alas, other than the black hole into whose abyss was irretrievably sucked away any hope I once had for discovering intelligent life in this movie, ""Gravity"" lacked gravitas.",/review/rw2904922/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2013,robert-259-28954,4," A waste of time and money.
","First, the cost. Twenty dollars to watch this IMAX video arcade game on steroids would be far better spent elsewhere. After parking your car (if you have one) and buying a small box of popcorn and a small drink, and there goes your mortgage or rent. Movies today, sadly, have little to offer except how better to inundate you with bigger and better special effects and ear drum-numbing sound tracks. Sandra Bullock does her best with the thin script, but should actually win the Academy Award for bruised knees. George Clooney tried out his comic timing again, but alas, I couldn't buy him as a NASA astronaut. The fact is, however, ANY decent Hollywood actor could have handled these roles, particularly since they're covered up from head to toe in helmets and space suits. So far, the best sci fi heroine I've seen was Signourney Weaver in the original ""Alien"" (all of the sequels were nothing but wannabees), her strong and edgy presence ringing as true as Bullock's was a rehash of ""Miss Congeniality"" in comparison. Wanna know the entire premise of the film? Two hours of dummies bouncing around a space ship on a wire. There you have it. And if you think that's a pretty slim reason for a major motion picture, rest assured, it is. I can only hope that Bullock doesn't return for Gravity Part 2-16. So, for all you kiddies who loved The Jetsons, here is some expensive rocket fuel for you— a futuristic cartoon couple flailing about in outer space. Only the Jetsons reached much deeper. A flimsy special effects pot boiler, this is one turkey that should have never left the launchpad.",/review/rw2904922/?ref_=tt_urv

29 November 2018,andrewroy-04316,8," A visually stunning and yet also intimate film that makes us think about space and humanity
","Gravity is a wonderful work of art. Cuaron and Lubezki are at their visual storytelling bests, which is quite a statement. The shots of outer space are long and gorgeous, and the sound design is impeccable, both encompassing the vastness and silence of space as well as letting us see Ryan's perspective. The grounded, careful science of the film and the exceptional effects and camera work give us a sense of what space is like - a tall order. What brings Gravity to the next level is the level of personal connection we reach with Kowalski, and especially Ryan. I felt nervous and scared every time Ryan was faced with a seemingly impossible situation. It is so impressive that Cuaron could get us to connect with Ryan and make every moment so thrilling despite having next to no dialogue and only having two characters in the whole film! The scene where Kowalski returns and enters the shuttle was far and away the scene of the movie for me, especially as it hit me that it was in her mind. The score is effective in heightening tension. Gravity is a groundbreaking work of art that, despite its narrow focus on just Ryan's journey, he manages to both amaze us visually and thrill us, start to finish.",/review/rw2904922/?ref_=tt_urv

","I really cannot understand the gushing reviews this has been getting and the accolades being constantly bestowed upon it: there is really nothing outstanding, or even new, about it – period! Much has been said about its excellent visual effects – but the same is true of countless other sci-fi efforts, so, no big deal there! Similarly, it was acclaimed as a tension-filled two-parter set against a forbidding backdrop: well, this type of film has been done – and much more engagingly, if you ask me – for years...take John Boorman's HELL IN THE PACIFIC (1968), for one! As space operas go, then, its unabashed references to the likes of PLANET OF THE APES, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (both 1968) and ALIEN (1979) only serve to expose its essential dramatic (and artistic) shallowness – enough said! And, frankly, the decision to cast stars (annoying Sandra Bullock and narcissistic George Clooney – yeah right, I totally buy them as astronautswhich goes to show that very little has changed from the practices redolent during the old studio system, where they used to cast Caucasian actors as all sorts of ethnic types) in what clearly amounts to character roles is ample proof that the producers themselves did not have enough faith that the premise would sell itself!
