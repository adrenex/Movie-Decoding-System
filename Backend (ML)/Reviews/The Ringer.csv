26 January 2009,beresfordjd,9," Suranne superb
","Suranne Jones shows what she can do in this TV drama. A little predictable in plotting but Suranne's performance is excellent. You are always involved in her character and she makes Ruth believable. To go from a soap like Corrie (which must have been a marvellous learning situation for a young actor) to proper drama like Unforgiven is a leap which many do not manage. Suranne chose fairly wisely, with the exception of Harley Street, and was always watchable and credible. The supporting cast are pretty good too, some playing against their usual type. The three part series is one that appeals to me if one cannot watch it in its entirety.Itv seem to do this format well and in these more austere times they are still championing good intelligent drama when the mood takes them. The BBC still do period stuff better but credit where credit is due.",/review/rw7667476/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2021,Sleepin_Dragon,10," Awesome, amazing drama.
","An amazing miniseries from the pen of Sally Wainwright, this three part story tells the story of Ruth Slater, a young woman released from prison after fifteen years for murdering two Policemen.",/review/rw7667476/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2021,nancyldraper,9," It has it all
","First of all, never pass up an opportunity to watch a series from the pen of Sally Wainwright. Secondly, be similarly alert to watch performances by Suranne Jones. Now, add a stellar cast of the likes of Peter Davison, Gemma Redgrave and Siobhan Finneran and you've struck gold. This has a story with heart and depth with performances by the best. I give this series a 9 (superb) out of 10. {Crime Drama}",/review/rw7667476/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2021,kolleen_adelphia1,8," I Can't Bloody Believe It!!!!
","This is definitely one for the record books!!!! If I hadn't watched it with my own 2, blue, Irish eyes, I would've never believed it. Finally, a really great show (telly show, mini-series, or movie), from the beginning right through to the very end. Of course with a line-up like they had, it's no wonder why it came out so amazingly, awesome!!!!!! At the end, I had to keep rewinding it, just to see if I was actually witnessing this video streaming miracle!!!!! Well Done!!!!! X",/review/rw7667476/?ref_=tt_urv

","It is April 2020 and I am hiding from Covid 19 in a flat full of unwatched dvds.
I finally sat down to watch this and did not expect it it be a great drama.
I give no plot spoilers but it is very well acted and well written.
The locations are great (Yorkshire).",/review/rw7667476/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2013,damiensbride666,7," drama, tense in parts, excellent acting...
","excellent casting in this revenge crime ex prison ( yep multi genre ) drama. Suranne Jones wonderful as ever, simple loving and maligned young woman just released from prison for double police murder. Peter Davidson Plays sympathetic legal eagle willing to help her find her sister, after fifteen years apart. Plenty of back ground story from family of the victims and a twist in the tale to boot. Awfully tense in parts, touching in others, Suranne plays vulnerable yet with seemingly hard exterior. A thirty year old who has had little experience in an adult world since she had been locked up since she was a minor. We see in the character how she is still very child like and delicate despite spending fifteen years in prison and the reasons behind the madness that caused the actions that put her there in the first place... Interesting story I give it a seven out of ten. Suranne is always very watchable...",/review/rw7667476/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2009,simontlarsen,10," Outstanding
","Absolutely outstanding drama mine series. Best piece of TV I have seen for quite a long time. Really shows what can be done as long as the story is good enough and the actors are up for the job - there are several incredibly good performances here. Suranne Jones is fantastic in the lead role and Matthew McNulty also really stands out - but generally everyone puts in top drawer performances. The last episode has a bit more action in it than the first two but it continues to build on the story and doesn't let anything else get in the way. The ending is very, very touching as well and it is a brilliant way to conclude the series. Overall 10 out of 10 and a huge thumbs up to British ITV.",/review/rw7667476/?ref_=tt_urv

9 March 2021,kimmgould,10," With all this talent this was always going to be excellent drama
","Written by Sally Wainwright, starring Suranne Jones, a quality support cast, this is as good as English tv gets. Set, of course, in Halifax, this is tight tense drama. Jones is simply a brilliant actress. Wainwright is a genius at moral dilemma. Three episodes was perfect, I'm not sure I could have managed the suspense for much longer üòÅ.",/review/rw7667476/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2021,barryrd,8," Nerve-wracking and suspense-filled drama
","This is an excellent drama about a young woman, Ruth Slater, who is released from prison after serving a 15 year sentence for a double murder. However, she is far from the hardened criminal many falsely assume. Suranne James gives a first class performance as the wounded soul who possessed an enormous heart despite her treatment by the justice system. Her first mission was to find her sister who she loved beyond measure. In her quest, she was helped by lawyer Peter Davison. Siobhan Finnerty, as his high strung spouse, had far less sympathy but came over to the Ruth's side once she learned her story. Ruth was fighting an uphill battle to win acceptance, even while still using her own name. As a result, her record became known to the community. She was also very naive and far too honest about her past. This lack of awareness about how to navigate her way back also made me sympathetic to her character. It was easy to stay with this series with all its twists and turns. Thanks to Britbox for bringing ITV (and BBC) shows to Canada.",/review/rw7667476/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2018,digitalrep,8," Great but then disappointing
","I was very pleased with this depiction of life for an ex con for the first two episodes for several reasons - it was very realistic in that some people are ready to offer Ruth Slater a second chance, feeling that she's paid the price and suffered enough, while others are determined to continue to make Ruth pay forever. Obviously some people waver and change their minds but all in all it's a fairly accurate portrayal of the situation. When someone says to Ruth, ""... she would take one look at you and not know what to say to you. She's never met anyone like you,"" it shows just how people think about certain people, how they dehumanise them. In Britain it seems to be a lot worse than other places, but still, even everywhere else, there is that prejudice that is always present, always there. There is, in reality, no real way to 'pay the price', to 'serve the time' - as Ruth says, she 'served her time and paid her pound of flesh'. But honestly no one will really ever let her forget it for the rest of her life. And I think that would have been enough; it would have made compelling viewing. Switching between thinking she's a bad person who deserves her fate and she was a messed up kid with a messed up life who deserves some kind of redemption - it would make for good viewing. And this is the problem I have with the third episode, where we find out that Ruth is actually a Saint. I was disappointed, to say the least... It gives the viewers a nice sense of closure, sure; hey, this woman who we spent two episodes watching being treated like trash because we thought she deserved it suddenly turns out deserving of a medal. I don't know, I felt tricked. It's like, even in 'serious' fiction, as someone who broke the law and paid the price, you just can't get any representation. Ruth was innocent after all, and therefore totally deserving of a three episode melodrama. It's so neat, so tidy. Imagine, though, if it hadn't been the case - if she'd been guilty after all - the drama still would have held up, right? So was it really necessary to reveal her 'innocence' after all? I don't think so.",/review/rw7667476/?ref_=tt_urv

18 March 2019,kane-43668,10," EXCEPTIONAL
","What a wonderful, moving piece of drama. A very practical subject about the difficulty of offenders when they leave prison. Suranne Jones (brilliant performance) leaves prison and wants to find her little sister who she has not heard from in 15 years since she went inside. The story shows all the problems for many people from all different points of view. Heartbreaking in a way but so rewarding. Drama as good as it gets.

21 January 2022,jeffpsy,8," First-rate mini-series
","Kudos to Sally Wainwright, to Suranne Jones, and to Britbox for bringing this series to the US. It's only three episodes, but it's all meat and no filler as we get to know the characters. Suranne and cast are in top form, the dialogue is on point, and the story is compelling. I've never seen the Sandra Bullock remake, but it would have to go a ways to top the original. Worth a watch!",/review/rw7667476/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2016,stairways,3," Entirely unbelievable plot with good acting
","Unfortunately the good acting can't help this badly plotted piece of sensationalism, in which, after 16 years in prison for a double murder, the main character gets out of prison and, despite being incognito, almost immediately comes into contact with the son of one of her victims -- when he happens to be sent out to service the boiler in her flat. If this was Midsomer Murders, where the population of the village appears to be about 20 person, then we might go along with it. That it happens in a contemporary British city, makes it ridiculously convenient.",/review/rw7667476/?ref_=tt_urv

26 November 2022,vjliberatori-51192,10," Suranne Jones & Sally Wainwright/a winning combination
","Next to Anne Lister in Gentleman Jack, the role of Ruth Slater in UNFORGIVEN is Suranne Jones' most brilliant, emotionally honest and affecting performance of her career. Exceptional character creation and storylines by Sally Wainwright do not disappoint. A triangle of 3 sisters drives the core drama which unfolds over 3 episodes. In counterpoint is the story of two brothers left fatherless by a tragic event that remains a secret for fifteen years. The repercussions of violence and how its aftermath spreads through the lives of the principal characters is presented with great skill by Wainwright. Suranne's performance is not to be missed!",/review/rw7667476/?ref_=tt_urv
