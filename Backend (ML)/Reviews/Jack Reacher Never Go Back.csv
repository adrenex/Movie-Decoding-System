30 May 2011,aharmas,10," Allen's Dreams are Magical
","There's something about the midnight hour, something special, mystical, and magical. In the case of this marvelous movie, its impact is fully realized, as we see our protagonist suddenly realize that he has the opportunity to face that which he truly admires, treasures, and dreams about. In the opening scenes, he expresses his desire to settle in the city of lights, and we know it's not going to be an easy thing to do. His girlfriend and he are quite different in their appreciation of what being in Paris means. She understands it's special, maybe from an aristocrat's point of view. He might be looking at it, as the dream place for an artist to find aspiration to fulfill his artistic goals.",/review/rw2431288/?ref_=tt_urv

16 July 2011,littlemartinarocena,8," French Woody, at last!
","The love between the French and the Americans has always been mixed with an element of dismissal even contempt but the love is real. Woody Allen walks that fine line in truly inspired fashion. ""Midnight in Paris"" is a delight. This is he first time I actually loved Owen Wilson. He is terrific as Woody's alter ego. Rachel McAdams superb. Her mean American girl is hilarious and frighteningly recognizably, so are Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy as her parents. What a chillingly awful, normal pair. I loved the moment in which Owen Wilson, in a great close up, comes to accept what's happening around him. I accepted it too. Happily. Another stand out moment: the meeting with Salvador Dali, played brilliantly over the top by Adrien Brody. Highly recommended.",/review/rw2431288/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2012,barry_mooney,8," Ah, they don't make them like this any more
","I'd been meaning to watch Midnight in Paris for ages but, I have to confess, I was put off by the presence of Owen Wilson, who I could not really envisage as the lead in a Woody Allen film. He was actually surprisingly good though and did a decent job as the vessel from which Allen's brilliant dialogue could be heard. However, this is not an actor-driven film or even a story-driven film; its beauty lies in the simple but clever script and the easy-going laid-back style that you'd expect from a Woody Allen film all about nostalgia.

Like that's the first time we've heard that question in a Woody Allen movie.

23 May 2011,GeneralUrsus,10," A Magical Mystery Tour De Force
","Woody Allen's latest is beautifully written and a charming story that belongs in the top ten of his all-time greats. From the opening montage of lush, picturesque Parisian scenes the film is a love letter to the city of lights. Owen Wilson is perfectly cast as Gil Pender a Hollywood writer who has penned his first novel about a man who owns a nostalgia shop. Throughout his stay in Paris he hearkens back to the iconic characters who once roamed its winding cobblestone streets.",/review/rw2431288/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2011,howard.schumann,4," Insufferably shallow characters
","In an interview with L.A. Weekly, Woody Allen said, ""The human predicament is so tragic and so awful that, short of an act of magic, we're doomed."" Given his questionable view of the human condition, one wonders what the word ""magic"" means to him. There is little indication of it in his latest film, Midnight in Paris, a love letter to an imagined Paris in the 1920s. Set to the music of Sidney Bechet, the film opens with a 3 1/2 minute montage of Paris by cinematographer Darius Khondji's that is little more than a travelogue showing the usual tourist sights rather than the true Paris beyond the Eiffel Tower and the five-star hotels that Mr. Allen seems so enamored with - street vendors, bookshops, cheese, bread, wine, and pastry shops, outdoor cafés on the Left Bank, and quaint streets loaded with charm - the Paris of the Parisians.",/review/rw2431288/?ref_=tt_urv

17 February 2013,murtaza_mma,9," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Woody Allen's ode to the City of Love, and its most celebrated denizens of the past
","Midnight in Paris is a subtle romantic drama with a comical touch that has a little bit of almost everything: be it magic-realism, romance, phantasm, voyeur, surrealism or even noir. It wouldn't be a hyperbole to proclaim that everything that Woody Allen learned and gained during his long stint in cinema culminated in form of Midnight in Paris – An ode to the City of Love, and its most celebrated denizens of the past. Driven by the very impetus that gives cinema its resonant charm, Woody Allen the auteur has seen his art go from strength to strength, taking new shapes and forms, being completely oblivious of the existence of his larger than life alter ego, Woody Allen the showman, whose stimulating works have been a treat for us all for last so many decades, and who himself has been a force to reckon with, right throughout his long and illustrious career that still seems to be in its prime.",/review/rw2431288/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2011,fandbnoir,9," Midnight in Paris
","Woody Allen's love affair with France, which goes back decades, finds its finality with ""Midnight in Paris,"" the latest of Allen's Parisian brochures, which recently opened at the Cannes Film Festival on Wednesday. The good news is that Allen seems to be paying attention in a way he hasn't always done in recent films, and has found a way to channel his often-caustic misanthropy, half-comic fear of death and anti-American bitterness into agreeable comic whimsy. The nominal point of ""Midnight in Paris"" is that we've all got to make the best of life in our own time while longing for a past that probably never existed. If anything, Allen seems to be rebuking himself, ever so mildly, for his compulsive romanticism, his obsession with the past and his disconnection from contemporary American life. Allen has baked us a sweet, airy Parisian dessert with just a sense of sentimental substance in the finish. One of his better films in his latter years.",/review/rw2431288/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2011,gradyharp,6," The Obvious Star is Paris!
","MIDNIGHT IN Paris sounds good on paper and looks in ads. The film opens with a long sequence of views of the sights in Paris - no actors, no story, just the breathtaking magnificence of the City of Light. For this viewer that section i the most rewarding of the entire film.

","While I'm sure some moviegoers did find this film enchanting, I think the greater majority of critics and viewers who claim it's a masterpiece are just afraid to admit that a film that name-drops so many intellectuals is just not very good. For a film whose list of characters includes some of the greatest minds of the early twentieth century, ""Midnight in Paris"" has little to say about the creative process or inspiration.",/review/rw2431288/?ref_=tt_urv

29 January 2012,moonspinner55,5," Whimsical Allen and his time-traveling taxi-cab...lovely moments abound, though it is without charming characters
","Owen Wilson plays a present-day Hollywood screenwriter and novelist on vacation in France with his fiancée and her parents; he's transported back in time to Paris in the 1920s by a magical taxi, where he meets legendary literary and artistic figures who help the writer put his work and his love-life into focus. Allen, who wrote and directed but does not star, is seemingly in love with Paris, and he appealingly uses fantasy to both confuse and clarify reality, but he's lacking interesting, wonderful central characters (a major problem which cools this confection out). Stepping in for Woody, Wilson doesn't have a dynamic screen presence--he fades into the foreground; Rachel McAdams is also disappointing, and the comedic scene involving her missing earrings (which should play fast and smooth) has a bland denouement. Allen's nostalgia for the past is fun for awhile, but he doesn't use it to build momentum; fairly soon, we're stuck in a revolving door of personalities and romantic couplings, sequences which have an attractive sheen but ultimately feel a little underwhelming. Four Oscar nominations with one win: for Allen's original screenplay. ** from ****",/review/rw2431288/?ref_=tt_urv

","I loved this movie! It blends film noir with Stardust Memories, The Purple Rose of Cairo, and a bit of Annie Hall. The scenes of Paris were enough to make one fall in love. The music was superb! Having all the artists and writers show up was the ultimate name dropping contest! Their caricatures were hysterical! Casting Adrien Brody as Salvatore Dali was mind blowing, along with the surreal discussion about a rhino. ",/review/rw2431288/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2012,MLDinTN,4," why did this movie get such praise...
","I thought it was very mediocre approaching boring. Nothing exciting or funny or entertaining even happens. And I certainly didn't think any actor deserved an acting nomination in this. Owen Wilson plays Gil, a writer trying to write his first novel. He's in Paris with his finance and her family and they are seeing the sights. One night at midnight, he gets into this car and some how ends up in the 1920s; this part is never explained. So, he meets some of his favorite writers and artists, like Fitsgerald, Hemmingway, and Picasso. He also meets Picasso's girl,that he likes and this makes him see, he shouldn't marry his finance.",/review/rw2431288/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2011,estebangonzalez10,9," An Ode to Nostalgia and Art
","¨That Paris exists and anyone could choose to live anywhere else in the world will always be a mystery to me.¨ Woody Allen has directed more than 40 films in over four decades and I can honestly say that his last film is one of my favorites. If you think otherwise then you are just probably living in nostalgia and trying to remember the past as being much better than the present. Like Micheal Sheen's character would say: ¨Nostalgia is denial - denial of the painful presentthe name for this denial is Golden Age thinking – the erroneous notion that a different time period is better than the one ones living in.¨ Woody Allen has directed numerous great films and this is one of them that will be remembered nostalgically in years to come. It is not a romantic film as we are used to seeing, it is more of a nostalgic film; the true romance isn't between Wilson and McAdams, but between Wilson and Paris, between Wilson and art. The romance is in the city, in the art, in the past. The central theme of this film is clear: nostalgia. Woody Allen manages to deal with these issues in a very comedic way and the dialogue and story is just great. Midnight in Paris is a very funny and nostalgic film. The city of Paris may have never looked as great as it does in this movie. The characters are memorable and it is interesting how Allen intertwines the present with the past and makes fun of some of the stereotypes these artists have. I had a great time with Midnight in Paris; Woody Allen has done it again! Gil (Owen Wilson) and Inez (Rachel McAdams) are an American engaged couple who are visiting Paris with Inez's parents, John (Kurt Fuller) and Helen (Mimi Kennedy). Gil instantly falls in love with the city and the rich story it has to tell, while Inez on the other hand doesn't like Paris that much. Gil insists they should move to Paris once they get married, but Inez would rather stay in Beverly Hills where Gil has had success writing scripts for Hollywood films. Gil is unhappy with his Hollywood life and has decided to try his luck on writing a novel. Inez insists he should stick to what he does best. In Paris, Inez runs into some friends: Paul (Michael Sheen) and Carol (Nina Arianda). Paul is a very pedantic sort of guy who always has an opinion on everything and is showing off his great knowledge. Gil can't stand him, but Inez insists on hanging out with him and his wife Carol, and asks Paul to critique Gil's novel for him. One night the couples decide to go out and dance, but Gil says he's too tired and decides to head back to the hotel on his own. While wondering the streets of Paris the clock strikes midnight and a group of French partygoers invite Gil to a party. In this party, Gil runs into Zelda (Alison Pill) and Scott Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston), and Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll). Gil realizes that somehow he has travelled to 1920 and is meeting all these artists who he's admired all his life; he's in the decade he considers as being the Golden Age. Ernest tells Gil that he can get Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates) to proofread his novel for him; but when Gil goes to get his novel he is back in 2010. Gil realizes that he can only travel back in time when the clock strikes midnight, so the adventure begins every night where he meets interesting people like Picasso (Marcial Di Fonzo) and his mistress Adriana (Marion Cotillard) who he falls for, and other great artists such as Salvador Dali (Adrien Brody) and Luis Buñuel (Adrien de Van), among others.",/review/rw2431288/?ref_=tt_urv

","We begin with shots of Paris (yes, some of them in the rain) and I think I'm looking at a travelogue; but I'm wrong. Once it gets going this film is very witty and even whimsical at times, and I really enjoyed it. Woody Allen's writing is spot on here with some great dialogue and some marvellous characters. The plot has just the right amount of mystery to keep me interested and even has some important points about living your life in the past. All the performances were excellent with Owen Wilson and Marion Cotillard getting top marks from me.

17 January 2019,tabuno,3," An Awful Stuck In The Head Movie
","11 March 2012. I found Midnight in Paris unbelievable, unappealing, and unapproachable. Woody Allen's imprint is all over this movie, but his fantasy theme failed to carry over onto the movie screen. The dialogue and scenes were dissociated from any emotional connection and became more of visual and auditory reading of Woody Allen's own mental musings. He failed to capture the intense flavor and rhythm of Paris, insisting on his scripted words. He had Gil (performed by Owen Wilson) becoming a one-dimensional, monotone character who remains in an oblivious state throughout the movie. Add to Gil's unappealing character, an even more obnoxious fiancé who can't even be made to appear sexually seductive even needed. How can these two characters be together in the first place? This relationship is a mere a plot device, adding to the absurdity of the movie. Later Gil meets Adrianna played by Marion Cotillard's (the most important relationship) whose wonderful and delightful character watches helplessly with fewer script lines as Owen Wilson's character remains blank to the different surroundings that he takes in so nonchalantly at odds with the circumstances. If only Wooden Allen had made Marion Cotillard the primary character, then perhaps her performance or character itself might have been able to carry the movie sufficiently to make it bearable to watch. As it is, Gil unintentionally becomes a parody of the comedic Jerry Lewis or Don Knott's idiot character appearing as witless lout who cannot possibly be this amazing, creative writer.",/review/rw2431288/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2011,klassepige,8," You can do some thinking while laughing!
","Quite a lot of great lines carrying life's wisdom; Profound reflection and insight of living the precious present expressed in a light-hearted touch! If you have your own 'Golden Age' fantasy, you will likely enjoy it. This movie seems to be relatively more straightforward in communicating its message than some of Allen's other works, such as ""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger."" As a plus, lovely cinematography of the city of Paris - Mr. Allen has apparently fallen in love with the 'good old (and charming)' European major cities; e.g., London, Paris, Barcelona and etc. Very likely, you will leave the movie theater with a big and warm smile on your face...",/review/rw2431288/?ref_=tt_urv
