","One of the best TV mini serirs ever made. I am genuinely shocked by people taking offence at this adaption of this Dickens classic. I am a huge fan of the book. I have read it every Christmas for the last twenty years and have watched and enjoyed many TV and film adaptions.
I therefore approached this version with trepidation but ended up being blown away. My only complaint was that it wasn't long enough. It was a brilliant retelling of the classic take of redemption. The script, which unusually,didn't draw from the book, was sharp and engaging, the production was amazing with the mill, mine and church scenes breathtaking and the acting straight out of the top drawer. Truthfully I don't believe there has ever been a better Scrooge than Guy Pearce. If you haven't seen it please don't be put off by the negative reviews. This is a total treat.",/review/rw5334586/?ref_=tt_urv

","If you didn't like this movie just because you didn't like it, then fine, but to write a review about it being inappropriate is bewildering to me. You knowingly watched a movie on FX (known to push boundaries), with a TV-MA rating & even the promos were dark & obviously not for children. So if you ignored all that & watched with your kids, then that's on you.",/review/rw5334586/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2019,cruzarts-73946,6," Brilliant, but tragically underbaked
","I'm not a Dickens purist and appreciated many of the storytelling choices -- particularly the stunning, period-proper stretches which place the poor and vulnerable under the heel of the powerful and callus.",/review/rw5334586/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2019,spenfam-04145,9," Humbug
",I loved it and I am 65 years of age. I agree the expletives didn't add anything and were not necessary but it was well written and very well acted. If you want same old same old then watch Muppets Christmas Carol or Alistair Sims original (both of which I love) but this was different and I enjoyed it,/review/rw5334586/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2019,TheLittleSongbird,4," Plenty of humbug and not much to bless
","My main reason for seeing 'A Christmas Carol' was because the story, one of the most timeless ever written and Charles Dickens' most accessible, is one of my all time favourites, and was intrigued as to how this would adapt one of the most oft-adapted stories. Also have always tried to see as many new programmes as possible every Christmas, especially the ones hyped and advertised so much (like this one), and the cast is a talented one. Being somebody who has liked a good deal of Stephen Graham and Andy Serkis' other work.",/review/rw5334586/?ref_=tt_urv

11 March 2021,domialenic,1," Dickens will turn around in his grave
","One of the best classical stories by Charles Dickens raped and mutilated. For what ? The result is a mutant aiming at ""modern"" audiences. This is an abomination from the original master piece. The acting and the atmosphere where good, but the fact that this story has been so distorted and mutilated cancelled all the good qualities that might make it deserve a good rating.",/review/rw5334586/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2019,Sleepin_Dragon,8," There's a little good in everyone.
","If you're expecting something middle of the Road, and dare I say it, along the same lines as War of the worlds, you'll be disappointed, this is a very different, relevant and gritty.",/review/rw5334586/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2019,Pnkprinses309,1," This is disgusting
","These changes were unnecessary and disgusting. Scrooge hating his childhood and being scared because he was poor was enough to make him a stingy old man. He didn't need to be molested. This special is stupid, unbearably long, and filthy. They should be ashamed.",/review/rw5334586/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2020,Valkonian,1," Garbage
",Wow is this bad. I don't even care if it was dark and had language. That wasn't even bad. The modernization twist is a complete insult to the original. Why not make it in present day? Political correctness didn't exist back then so why insert it? Garbage. With so many great versions of A Christmas Carol no one needs to watch this trash,/review/rw5334586/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2019,SeamusMacDuff,2," Dickens Perverted
","As a fan of ""A Christmas Carol"" I enjoy the many the versions of the story, particularly those that stay close to its roots in time, place, and tone. So FX's new version had me a bit leery going in, as indications were it would try that and yet be modern, edgy, and dark. My fears were born out though by the twisted product presented.",/review/rw5334586/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2019,marktayloruk,1," Sick
","Vile, revolting, an insult to Dickens'memory. Why we're Fezziwig and his reconciliation with his nephew left out? Why the foul language and Scrooge and Marley shown as East End
gangsters? Why nothing cheerful? I'll stick to Alastair Sim.",/review/rw5334586/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2019,plombier-154-636834,3," miss this, watch the Patrick Stewart version
","This is in addition to my previous review-as there have been many versions of this tale, but none so poor as the BBC version. Watch Patrick Stewart and Richard E Grant make a proper job of this tale-no profanity, urination, navel gazing, virtue signalling.Snowflakes look away now..",/review/rw5334586/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2020,billsoccer,9," May also become your favorite, but it's not for kids!
","You'll be instantly struck by the different approach to this Dickens classic. Same Victorian setting, crushing poverty, darwinian capitalism. Same backstory - Scrooge, the Cratchets, Marley and the 3 spirits visit Scrooge, etc. However, I don't recall any of the vignettes are original - all new ways to show how lost Scrooge is. The acting is excellent. My wife and I now look forward to this version in the coming years.
This is an adult version - blood, death, sex, and the F word make regular appearances. For me, the only downside was the ending - Scrooge still elevates the Cratchets, but severs ties - apparently to allow them to recover and live their own lives. I prefer the original ending, but that doesn't stop me from loving this - it's mow real entertainment, not just a heart-tugging kids story",/review/rw5334586/?ref_=tt_urv

27 December 2019,Calicodreamin,8," Interesting dark take on a Christmas carol
","This new Christmas carol takes a dark spin on the classic, adding details and depth to why Scrooge is so dark hearted. The acting was great, the storyline compelling, and the whole experience well executed. I was captivated. Guy Pearce does an amazing job as Scrooge. My only fault would be that cinematography is too dark.",/review/rw5334586/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2019,adamsmith-51004,4," Poor retelling of a classic
","There must be 100s of versions of Charles Dickens classic story of a Christmas Carol. I have seen a lot of versions and liked all of them from the Alistair Sim, Patrick Stewart and the Muppets but this is the first time I have to say I was left very much unimpressed. I know a lot of people are saying they enjoyed this darker take on the tale but for me I found it unnecessary and didn't add anything to the story.",/review/rw5334586/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2020,ebeckstr-1,9," Very good TV14 adaptation
","An excellent TV14 adaptation of the classic Christmas tale. It is gritty, serious, and dark (eff bombs in Dickens??). In keeping with that mood and tone, even the moments of humor are dark or wry. This doesn't make it inherently better than other versions, but it might be the only adaptation that actually does something different from the others.",/review/rw5334586/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2019,dussaultjulien,1," Horrendous! Full of cursing, sex and just all around crass and even chock full of girl-power scenes
","I could not believe my eyes that this horrible retelling of Charles dickens's A Christmas Carol came on at 7:30 pm. There was cursing, sex scenes and even sexual innuendos. I could not believe that this was on around this time. Shows like this are usually reserved for after 10 p.m. for a reason, because children should not be watching it. Children should not watch this horrible retelling of the story, parents beware.",/review/rw5334586/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2019,maricam,2," Squandered potential
","I watched two and a half hours of this latest adaptation of ""A Christmas Carol"" and chose not to watch more. My intelligence had been insulted enough by that time and, given that it appeared Mr. Scrooge was about to prostitute or potentially rape Mrs. Cratchit, I just turned the TV off.",/review/rw5334586/?ref_=tt_urv

",Tiny Tim a little person and Mary a black woman with witch powers and who is willing to prostitute herself with her husband's boss...Really? Charles Dickens must be wallowing in his grave ... We cannot explain why they had to stain and change a masterpiece and lower it to the level of the daily garbage ... I prefer Hallmark's torture before seeing again this movie crap. I thought Guy Pierce was better than this.,/review/rw5334586/?ref_=tt_urv

20 December 2019,SnoopyStyle,5," dark and grim
",It's the classic Dickens' Christmas story. Ebenezer Scrooge (Guy Pearce) is visited by the three ghosts. This is darker. It's grim. Scrooge's greed is more brutal than penny pinching. It has dark consequences. I don't know how this compares to the original printed page but it ain't no Disney theme park ride. It's grumpy and it doesn't have the magic of Christmas. Even the lighting is dark. It is one step away from horror. It has CGI and big sets. The production is big enough. The simple poetry of the story fades. The joy and beauty in the emotion is lost and replaced with a grim death march. There is one major detour with an experiment. It is off-putting to say the least. This is not a fable for the family. The exercise still has its value but it's not found in repeated viewing which is the hallmark of any good version of this Dickens' tale.,/review/rw5334586/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2019,Vinny37,1," Does the F-word really help?
","Quite amazing the the spirit keeps using the blasphemous F-bomb on what's supposed to be a Christmas story of deity breaking in. Certainly neither for children nor adults, leaving only the director and the unholy spirit to watch?",/review/rw5334586/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2019,christophersarles,2," Mumble mumble
","Dark, hard to hear, still no idea why marley was in a casket, it was Scrooge that saw the ghosts. Terrible. Go see just about ANY of the others. Fx needs to rely less on the special FX and hire some writers.",/review/rw5334586/?ref_=tt_urv
