21 September 2020,maccas-56367,8," A powerful film that will stay with me a long time
","It felt a bit like 'Spotlight' transported back into the 1930s USSR. It sees journalist Gareth Jones traveling to Ukraine, and discovering the horrors of Stalin's man-made famine. This is the first film I've seen depicting this particular atrocity, despite learning about it (and the Holocaust) in school.",/review/rw7735568/?ref_=tt_urv

28 December 2021,brockfal,8," Brave Mr Jones
","Sometimes cinema can bring history alive and little known facts and personalities can be highlighted or rediscovered, and so it is here. Gareth Jones was a diplomat and journalist who wrote about the terrible famine in the Ukraine during the early 1930s which the Soviet's, and many others, we're trying to hide at the time. It's a sober but fascinating insight into a almost forgotten episode, and is very skilfully done with a fine central performance by Edward Norton as Jones and well staged scenes of his tense visits to the USSR and his gradual discovery of the regimes corruption and lies. Tightly scripted and directed, this is one worth discovering.",/review/rw7735568/?ref_=tt_urv

30 December 2020,hnapel,9," A story about genocide through famine arranged into an exemplary movie.
","To make a horrible story about genocide through famine, of which Stalin stands accused into a compelling movie requires some elaborate screenwriting for which we have to thank genial Andrea Chalupa who managed to arrange the dreadful experience of a journalist who ventures into far away Ukraine to witness the horror firsthand into an exemplary movie. Prewar political machinations and Soviet innate tendency for secrecy almost kill the story dead, but what you are about to relive in this movie is the adventurous and certainly gripping tale of a persevering journalist, who with his naive yet honest search for the truth lands on a story of a man made famine that was a combination of ill implementation of the top down Soviet agricultural system and deliberate repression. While this movie does not go too deep into the reasons of the atrocity it merely shows the results in a few gruesome examples that I guarantee will stay with you. End titles confirm the care put into the making with on location filming in Ukraine and the sad tale of revenge that befell Gareth Jones eventually at the hand of those who could not bear the shame of truth that he unearthed.",/review/rw7735568/?ref_=tt_urv

","With a good script Norton shows that he can carry a film all on his own. This is one of those rare Film's that appear now and again that are vital to both the art of film making and the telling of a very important set of facts. It's no story. What we are confronted with is one of the least known horrors of the 20th Century. It got lost in all the other human disaster's that were inflicted on the human race. For what? To prove one or another political theory was the way to heaven on earth. How many died? We'll never know, but we will continue to have to pay for them. The film shows in stark bleached colours this madness. Why George Orwell pops up is not relevant. His pigs at the start, maybe he did name the farmer in Animal Farm Mr Jones in homage to Gareth I don't know. All I think you should know about this film is that you should watch it and if ever you hear a political party say they have an answer to anything, run away.",/review/rw7735568/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Mr. Jones"" is a Biography - Drama movie in which we follow the story of a Welsh journalist (Gareth Jones) who travels into the Soviet Union to uncover an international conspiracy in the early 1930s. George Orwell's ""Animal Farm"" was inspired by him and his journey.",/review/rw7735568/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2020,harry_tk_yung,," A story so simple that a child can understand it
","My ""headline"", quoted from the beginning of the movie, has layers of meaning. It is a VO from George Orwell, writing ""Animal Farm"". It can also be interpreted to refer to the story of the title protagonist, who purportedly had inspired Orwell to write ""Animal Farm"", an allegory to Stalin's ""man-made famine"", from investigative journalist Jones's devastating revelation.
This biopic of Welsh reporter Gareth Jones (James Norton) runs like a thriller for the first half. With the credentials in the form of an interview with Hitler, Jones wants to do the same thing with Stalin, but is soon intrigued by something else: his friend and peer Paul Kleb in Moscow's tip to him in a phone conversation that is suspiciously cut short.
In Moscow, he is told that Kleb was shot dead in a robbery three days ago. The personage disseminating this information is Walter Durante (Pater Sarsgaard), the Pulitzer-honoured New York Times correspondent. Jones is suspicious but Durante is slippery as an eel. This man is also known as ""our man in Moscow"" in the U.S. political circle back home.
Through Durante's assistant Ada Brooks (Vanessa Kirby), a principled British journalist and a good friend of Kleb, Jones become privy to the clue left behind by the victim with Brooks. On the pretext of being Lloyd George's political adviser, he secures passage to the forbidden zone in the Ukraine. He tries to persuade Brooks to join him but the realist in her has the better over the idealist, and she declines joining his crusade.
The objective of Jones's mission is to find out where Stalin gets his money to finance the industrial big leap forward that is shaded with ominous military intentions. He wants to get behind the apparently impenetrable screen to see for himself whether the Soviet's claim of an agricultural paradise in Ukraine is true or a sham.
That is the first half of the movie. The second half some in the audience may not be able to stomach, literally, as there is a scene at which Jones vomits violently. As well, the ending is gloomy: in the real world there is no poetic justice. In the clashing duel of stories published on the Ukraine famine, Pulitzer winner Durante gain the upper-hand even though Jones manages at least to expose the ugly truth to those who believe him. In the on-screen text before the final credit roll, we learn that Jones died before reaching 30, assassinated, while Durante enjoyed a long life (73, definitely long in terms of the general life expectancy of the time) embracing his Pulitzer to his grave.
 But it is a good movie, well worth watching. Norton carries the movie well with his earnest portrayal of the Quixote-like Jones. The two supports are excellent. Sarsgaard brings his often-creepy screen presence to the sly villain he portrays. Kirby demonstrates her range beyond royalty and femme fatale.
Worth mentioning is the cinematography, particularly the sequences in Ukraine. It would look like this segment is shot in black-and-white, but in fact it is only the scenery and the objects shot. The landscape is snow-covered and the human's faces are pale and grey. Throughout the movie, you may also notice an extensive use of mirror reflections, in fact excessive, in my view.",/review/rw7735568/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2021,Dr_Mark_ODoherty,10," Great historic film highlighting atrocities in the Soviet regime - from which Russian leaders can learn a lot.
","Based on real events, this is a very serious and intense film which chronicles a British investigative journalist, as he travels deep into the Soviet Union to uncover an international conspiracy - namely the existence of the Soviet famine of 1932-33, including the Holodomor, also known as the Terror-Famine which was a famine in Soviet Ukraine from 1932 to 1933 that killed millions of Ukrainians. It was mainly the Soviet dictator Josef Stalin who was responsible for this horrific famine; as well as the Soviet Intelligence Community which covered up this dreadful atrocity against humanity - by seducing, bribing, threatening and even killing journalists, as this historic film indicates. So this part of history is certainly a black mark against the evil tyrant Josef Stalin - who just like the Nazi leader Adolf Hitler was partly responsible for World War 2; by instigating the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany, also commonly referred as the 'Hitler-Stalin Pact'. (Which even President Putin described as ""unacceptable"" in 2009; the general historic consensus being, that this particular pact with Nazi Germany paved the way for the Nazi invasion of Poland in 1939).
So certainly not everything was good about the Soviet regime - the Soviet regime under the evildoer Josef Stalin having been somewhat similar to Nazi Germany. Also, the secret police of the Soviet Union was similar to Hitler's SS in some ways - as this historic film indicates - with Putin's FSB in today's Russia also increasingly getting the reputation of evildoers and mischief-makers :(. So Putin's FSB has to be very careful in today's Russia, of not violating human rights any further, which they regrettably seem to be doing on an increasing level - just like Hitler's SS during the Nazi regime.
So hopefully another revolution can be avoided in Russia in the future; with the current Russian government making the necessary reforms in the Russian Federation, as stipulated by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights - such as Freedom of Speech and Freedom of Press :)",/review/rw7735568/?ref_=tt_urv
