3 March 2019,david-161-28390,10," In the top 5 movies list that i have watched in the last 54 years.
","I have just copied what another reviewer stated verbatum because it was perfectly phrased and exactly my thoughts:
""This film is absolutely great, and I recommend everyone to just watch it right now on Netflix. This needs to be seen and supported. It is full of interesting and powerful themes that are rarely portrayed like this in cinema, and teaches a lot of important lessons without ever being preachy about it. It's one of these based on a true story movies that are actually really good and achieve what they are going for, and also match the importance and beauty of the real tale.",/review/rw5678528/?ref_=tt_urv

12 September 2020,ron-newbold,9," A film that is about something and makes you care about the people
","As someone who was born in Zambia, grew up in Zimbabwe and lived in the short-lived Central African Federation of those 2 countries plus Malawi, this film meant a great deal. It felt and sounded very authentic, the characters spoke and behaved like real people facing problems that make many of ours (speaking as an Australian) seem minor in comparison. Like how to get a decent if elementary education and avoiding the lure of ready cash at the expense of the environment and future agricultural productivity. When you have to sell the tin roofing of your house and replace it with thatch. Beautifully filmed, acted and directed.",/review/rw5678528/?ref_=tt_urv

","Quarantine made me watch this...guess, the one thing, I have to thank it for!",/review/rw5678528/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2019,mks099,9," A great movie based on the book wrote by The real life man
","Ignore the review that says the story is not true. The book is an autobiography and the movie has Michael speaking at the end. There is pretty much massive amounts of documentation verifying his education. He went to school, several in fact, including Dartmouth and worked for varied non profits.",/review/rw5678528/?ref_=tt_urv

","What a great movie - powerful acting, cinematography and story line. Heartwarming, powerful and emotional - it brought tears of sadness and joy! Thoroughly recommend.",/review/rw5678528/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2019,khagen-89850,10," Perspective
",Incredible film really; helps one see how truly blessed and how we have an abundance of everything we could ever want and/or need. Further illustrates how supporting each other and thinking of the greater good will propel us further as a people. And really redefined what the definition of hardship is. Life is hard in general but some individuals are dealing with issues that most don't have to think about.,/review/rw5678528/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2019,jackreacher-57542,9," This is as real as it gets
","This was an incredible movie. It does not hide the brutal realities of life as an African farmer. As someone who was born and raised in the continent, I can tell you that everything is legit. They even went the extra mile and incorporated the local language into the majority of the dialogue instead of having it be all in English. This is a powerful and inspirational film. I highly recommend it.",/review/rw5678528/?ref_=tt_urv

","A very good movie. Every young people, especially teenagers should watch the movie. This is real world, poverty, global warming, hunger, suffering humans. Great job!!",/review/rw5678528/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2020,brianjohnson-20043,9," I thought it would be good and if still managed to supersede my expectations
",All I knew about this story going-in is that it's about a boy who uses a library book to make a windmill to help his small little African town and family. That alone seems like a great premise for a nonfiction movie. But the details of the family and town make the story much better than the basic premise. On that premise alone I was interested in going to an event at my university about 7 years ago where I could have heard from William about his story. Today I regret that I didn't go to that event.,/review/rw5678528/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2019,anyob,10," Impressed malawian
","Great film. Shout out to William Kamkwamba and am glad the world gets to know about him and his greatness!! I'm particularly moved emotionally with how well the film depicts the sufferings of the early 2000's in Malawi. I'd also say bravo for the effort made by british and american actors to learn chichewa, though the pronunciations are generally below par, as expected from such actors. Nevertheless the effort to make the film truly malawian by filming in malawi, speaking chichewa, amazing cinematography, etc, shows a bravery and respect for the story.",/review/rw5678528/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2019,iampeaceful,10," Powerful, real and moving....
","Incredible heart wrenching powerful family movie. This to me was gut wrenching and sad but in the end beautifully written about a boy whom saved his family. I cried lots but I also felt relief. This story humbled me and made me realize that I too need to be grateful daily for those around our world have less but make the best out of each day. Incredibly written and told. I am so glad Netflix had this incredible, well written story.",/review/rw5678528/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2020,tetrahymna,10," Great Positive Film
","I was anxious to see this film after reading the book. It is based upon the autobiography of a boy who brings electricity to his village. I loved the tie ins to ecological destruction, the desperate condition of the village, and the exploitation of the villagers for a quick profit. Th film actually waters down some of his experiences as he built the windmill, possibly for time's sake, or maybe because they didn't want to overwhelm viewers.",/review/rw5678528/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2019,kitcatch,8," Such a beautiful and powerful film
","Chiwetel Ejiofor knew exactly what he was going for with this film. You knew there was a happy ending to this and it still beats you into an emotional pulp by the end. Terrific performances across the board, with an absolute gem from young Maxwell Simba. There are so many scenes in this that are powerful, heartbreaking, beautiful, and in one case, terrifying, that by the end you will be so invested and a little saddened that you can't help but be overjoyed when the predictable happiness finally arrives.",/review/rw5678528/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2021,Muhammad_Rafeeq,8," Malawi ( A+ Movie) My Ratings 8/10
","A true story of transcendence over poverty, famine, corruption and lack of eduction. It made me so grateful for what I take for granted, namely, running water & food. An assured debut from director & actor, Chiwetel Ejiofor.",/review/rw5678528/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2019,w-bogdan,10," Wonderful movie, poorly promoted
","I've seen Chiwetel Ejiofor promoting the movie only as ""the story of a boy who builds a wind turbine"". The movie is so much more than that and it really worth seeing.",/review/rw5678528/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2020,IdiotBox_Recommendations,8," An Emotional True Story - A Must Watch
","This is a true story about a boy named William Kamkwamba - an ingenious boy who harnessed wind energy by building a turbine to salvage his village from extinction, a village affected by floods, famine and hunger, a village with no electricity or running water supply.
This is truly a heartbreaking story about the inordinate sufferings faced by an African country- Malawi, but the relevance is found in many such countries affected by global climate change, yet it's a story of inspiration and courage- courage to break the shackles that bind you to extreme grief and poverty against all odds.
Many a times we take our privileges for granted without even taking into consideration that there are families who are unable to meet even basic needs.
With only 1 meal/day, William's family was on the verge of death by starvation. His strong determination regenerates hopes not only for his family, but also for his village.",/review/rw5678528/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2020,rpabstnm20,10," Absolutely wonderful
","This is such a great and wonderful story. We, as nations could help places like this with little. Our help should not be millions of $, going into weapons and pockets of corrupt government. Solar panels, wind turbines, both cheap, give those people and villages enough electricity to have a decent life and food.",/review/rw5678528/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2020,pinkpab,7," Good but a bit too long
","We all know how the movie is going to end, whether because we know the true story behind it, or because we have read the title.
In my opinion, the time it takes to reach the final scenes before the ending is too long. Some scenes could be shortened or just eliminated.",/review/rw5678528/?ref_=tt_urv
