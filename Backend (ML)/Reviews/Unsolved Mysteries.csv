18 August 2001,evilmatt-3,9," An oft-misunderstood film about quiet desperation
","I wasn't going to write a comment for this one, but after reading all the nasty things said about it, and considering that _Happiness_ was the basis for one of my final undergraduate philosophy papers, I feel a duty to defend it.",/review/rw2335254/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2003,bob the moo,," Well drawn and depressing Â– a difficult watch but a worthwhile one
","Centred around a New Jersey based family of three sisters, their parents and their partners and acquaintances, this film looks at their lives.  Involving a lonely sister, a sister with a good family life, a paedophile, a telephone sex pest and an elderly couple breaking up, the film follows their short stories through whatever it takes them.",/review/rw2335254/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2004,drosse67,," Polarizing
","There are only a handful of films that have a distinct polarizing affect on the audience--A Clockwork Orange, The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover, and I would even lump in American Beauty--these are movies you either get, or you don't. And if you don't get it, you will hate it. Open minded viewers need only apply, and that's certainly the case with ""Happiness."" I remember leaving the theater absolutely shocked, and not just because of the events on screen. I was shocked that I found the movie so intelligent and oddly entertaining. The actors surely must have felt that, after reading the screenplay. And there are some big actors in this--veterans like Ben Gazzara, Louise Lasser, Elizabeth Ashley, mixing with new talent like Philip Seymour Hoffman, Camryn Manheim, Dylan Baker, Lara Flynn Boyle, etc. ",/review/rw2335254/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2001,Movie-12,10," One of the year's best films--but be prepared for some very disturbing material. **** (out of four)
",HAPPINESS / (1998) **** (out of four),/review/rw2335254/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2002,capkronos,10," Solondz is one of the best American directors working today. Period.
","I don't want to waste time analyzing the plot since others have covered it so well... Basically here we have a Robert Altman-esqe pastiche of characters stemming from a seemingly normal family, plus others who come into their lives. Solondz sets them up and examines their lives, their dreams, their interactions and their facades. What's important is that he doesn't JUDGE these people. And even more importantly, he doesn't condescend to his audience. Like it or not, the people in this movie do exist and I think viewers instantly realize that.",/review/rw2335254/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2005,FilmOtaku,8," Dark brilliance
","When a film opens with a scene between two people, one breaking up with the other, culminating in the dumped calling the dumper ""Shit"", you know you're in for something dark with this film. When the scene is followed by the simple opening title ""Happiness"" written in pretty cursive writing, you know it's going to be ironic as well. ""Happiness"" was written and directed by Todd Solondz, the mind behind the film ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"", a film that was fantastic but really hard to watch if the viewer has any kind of heart. ""Happiness"" follows in the same vein, though this time, instead of centering around one character, Solondz puts a New Jersey family at the center of the film and develops new characters through their relationship with the family.",/review/rw2335254/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2001,moonspinner55,8," Sex: it's on everyone's mind!
","The sexual foibles, perversities and hang-ups of a trio of sisters, their parents, neighbors and friends--told in a low, slightly monotone, key. It's a rich carousel of scared, scary lives with an inter-connecting pattern: the disillusionment of coupling--and how one keeps trying to succeed in this department despite the humiliations. Pretty funny once you get the idea--and only if you're attuned to this kind of sick black humor. Not for the faint of heart, but extremely clever concoction from talented writer-director Todd Solondz (whose first film, ""Welcome To The Dollhouse"", struck me as a stunt). This one is frank, funny, and very warped--almost over-the-top in places, especially the ending--yet kept on track by the terrific performances. Some might compare this to the later ""Magnolia"" (they're both tapestry films), but ""Happiness"" is superior, and certainly less pretentious. *** from ****",/review/rw2335254/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2015,michaelmunkvold,8," ""Happiness"" is where hope goes to die
","To call Todd Solondz's ""Happiness"" a dark comedy is to redefine the words ""dark"" and ""comedy"". It hates the world and everyone in it, and takes great pleasure in mocking people stupid enough to try to be happy. In Solondz's world, life is pointless, hope is for suckers, and everybody is basically bad at heart. It says something that the movie's most human, sympathetic character is a child molester.",/review/rw2335254/?ref_=tt_urv

14 March 2000,cchase,," One of the best ""horror"" films ever made...
","I'd heard and read the reviews, seen most of the actors in other films, and even though I haven't yet seen WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE, heard a lot of praise for Todd Solondz. Now that I've finally seen this, I can understand what all the hype was about.",/review/rw2335254/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2000,gmaland,10," A brilliant movie, but not for everyone.
","This is one of the best movies I've ever seen, but I would hesitate to recommend it to people whom I don't know pretty well.  It explores aspects of life and living (and suffering) that most films avoid or actively deny. And it does so brilliantly.  The characters are vividly real, and there is such a strong sense of situations unfolding in real time that it's truly mesmerising.  I felt like a fly on the wall, eavesdropping on conversations I could never hear otherwise.  I think many people would absolutely hate this movie, partly because it doesn't pass judgement on behaviours that are repulsive to the bulk of humanity, and partly because it exposes us to them at all.",/review/rw2335254/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2000,johnpil,," Transfixed, mortified, amused, devastated
","Gradually, as I watched this movie, I became aware that I was witnessing some of the most powerful and honest acting, writing, and directing I had ever experienced. And I'm glad, because if this material had been attempted by anyone without extreme skill and sensitivity, it would have been a monstrous disaster. As it is, I don't think I would add it to my DVD collection. I don't know if I could watch it again, and I'm not sure I'd feel comfortable people seeing it on my shelf unless they knew me well. There are moments of great hope in this movie, when you think misery may finally give way to happiness. There are moments of great honesty, when a character says just what you'd expect them to say, and you realize how ""safe"" every other movie character has been in comparison. The humor that other reviews talk about is not the kind of humor that makes me laugh, personally. It's the dark, visceral humor of human weakness, meanness and even pathology. I still appreciate it for what it is, and it is used in a profound and delicate way. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is willing to accept that life, and especially sexual life, is really much more complex and difficult than we usually admit. I recommend watching it alone, or with a friend or partner with whom you can discuss the most emotionally difficult topics. This movie will test you if you stick with it, but you'll know you saw something profound.",/review/rw2335254/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2019,christoffertoresen,8," I love this film, I'll never watch it again
","This is a horrible, distasteful, hilarious and brilliant film. A movie that has the modus operandi of displaying sexual frustration through deviancy will certainly alienate the vast majority of audiences, no matter how well it does its job. And let's make this clear: it does its job, and it does it almost too well as I had to watch it several times to stand getting to the end. It's amazing, but don't feel bad if you can't stomach it.",/review/rw2335254/?ref_=tt_urv
20 March 2019,tylerwoodrownichols,10," A Masterpiece of Black Comedy
","Happiness is one of my favorite films of all time. I feel compelled to echo the sentiment of other viewers who have stated that this film is not for everyone and is certainly not suitable for children/families under any circumstances. I love black humor, and the comedy herein is as dark as it gets. But it is dark comedy with a purpose, there is satirical subtext at every turn. It manages to get laughs out of taboo subject matter without ever feeling like it is mainly going for shock value, a feat that I've rarely seen anyone else pull off. I've seen Happiness at least 5 times, and with each viewing I pick up on things I'd never noticed before. The attention to detail is jaw-dropping; every single plot element has purpose, as does every line of dialogue. I honestly believe that in the coming decades this film will be seen as a classic of sorts, and if you can get past the heavy subject matter you will be highly rewarded for the time you invest in watching it. It's a masterpiece.",/review/rw2335254/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2001,nosunset,," A compelling watch, which will both amuse and seriously disturb
","Happiness - which centres around the lives of three sisters - Joy who's permanently unlucky in love, Helen a successful poet whose next door neighbour is obsessed with her and phones to explain this in graphic detail and finally there's Trish who has it all, a big house, a couple of kids and a successful psychiatrist husband who himself harbours uncontrollable urges.",/review/rw2335254/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2008,prufrock5150,," Honestly?
","This is the best movie I never, ever want to see again. It's dark, disgusting, powerful, painful and honest. The focal point of cinema has been used here as an assault on every day life. Everyone has had these moments at one point or another in their lives and now here's the hot-faced shame and moral nausea experienced vicariously through a parade of terrible, terrible people, not parsed out by blessed months or years between horrifying events as one would hopefully find in real life, but non-stop for however many minutes this film lasts. I can't deny that it was a good film, but it's also a film that hurts to watch. Good job in an era when the only thing I can remotely equate this experience to is being in the front row at ""Cloverfield"" and being surrounded by people vomiting.",/review/rw2335254/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2016,framptonhollis,10," Smashingly Powerful, Awfully Disturbing, and Unbelievably Hilarious!
","In ""Happiness"", director Todd Solondz manages to craft a true masterpiece that will definitely make some people a bit too uncomfortable to really like or enjoy. ""Happiness"" is certainly not for the easily offended or disturbed, since it deals with some very mature and unsettling subject matter such as perversion, rape, pedophilia, murder, depression, etc. ""Happiness"" also surprises us by making the whole thing a comedy. A really, really dark comedy-but still a comedy.",/review/rw2335254/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2008,rotildao,9," Hitting the right note!
","Another psychologically visceral film that pinches the nerve of human society. I am still not quite sure which one is darker: the human unconscious, the dark basements of our fears, or hypocrisy, the attics of our warmest intents. ",/review/rw2335254/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2020,niels2765,8," A seriously disturbing watch
","A truly disturbing film, yet was never graphic nor striking. It was disturbing due to the sheer empathy I felt for characters who commit unspeakable acts throughout the film. A hilariously depressing film (ironic as well), Happiness is remarkably well-written, with multiple plot lines interconnecting to one another to highlight the unhappiness in these characters lives. Happiness pokes fun at the ignorance of 'happy' people in the world and all the characters, despite being so pathetic and narcissistic, are incredibly relatable. I got a lot out of this film and its worth the watch.",/review/rw2335254/?ref_=tt_urv

","Happiness is one very dark and hard swallowing film that wont lie with everyone in a very good way cause it is full of sexual material ,mixed with jokes of same subject but done in a dark comedy way.For me this film was very interesting and full of quality conversations and script that was written in a very good way.Humor was also done in a very smartly and hidden way but i liked that our director decided to use it like that.Characters are fun to watch and follow and I found Hoffman character to be most cool to follow.Happiness is one of better black comedies that i saw.",/review/rw2335254/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2009,mikelepost,4," Gruesome
","Happiness is a gruesome and uncomfortable drama about sexual dysfunction, focusing mainly on three characters: a 30-something woman who lives with her parents and attracts romantic disaster; a schlubby office drone who can't speak to his sexy neighbor so he masturbates while making obscene phone calls; and a seemingly normal therapist who lusts after his son's pre-pubescent friends. Forget the ""dark comedy"" label - I found almost nothing even remotely funny in the movie and in fact the overall effect was completely depressing. Happiness is an interesting movie but it wasn't funny or entertaining in the traditional sense of the word and it's nothing I'd ever want to see again.",/review/rw2335254/?ref_=tt_urv

14 March 2015,petarmatic,8," Fantastic!
","When I watched this film I knew I was going to love it from the beginning. It simply describes life! Most of us would love that time does not pass but it does. For some it passes quickly, for others slowly, but it passes. Little children grow up and eventually become adults. They have to perform sexual act to continue the species. Some parents take that fact with normal attitude, others do not. Also, time passes for some male adults who develop interest for young(er) people. Hm, hm, may be a little too young. This film describes this film so well.",/review/rw2335254/?ref_=tt_urv
