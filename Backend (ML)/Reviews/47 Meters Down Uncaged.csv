3 January 2023,Tera-McBride,1," Sick musical scene Not for children!!
","Spoiler warning: The movie started out mediocre and I was fine with it since my five year old wanted to watch it with me. But once the scene came out of nowhere with Matilda imagining a pregnant woman ALMOST murdered , later to die after having every bone in her body broken except her finger tips ( as Matilda said) then giving birth to a child was a disgusting story line. This scene was over the top and somewhat graphic for a child. I was appalled to know that my five year old had actually watched this trash prior to my knowledge! Never again ! Society wonders where and why some children seem so mentally I'll now ... not a parents idea of a children's musical! I wish I could give it zero starts . The talented cast wasted their time on this !",/review/rw8770920/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2023,KaiserCipi,1," Don't waste your time with this. It's bad!
","I wouldn't even run this in the background while cleaning my toilet. It's so bad that you will regret even 5 minutes of watching this. The characters have no connection with reality, especially the principal and Matilda herself. Why would you expose children to something like this? It would be considered cruelty.",/review/rw8770920/?ref_=tt_urv
