9 December 2020,arod_85,7," Interesting, but somewhat mediocre
","The show is interesting, definitely binge worthy. However, ""interesting"" does not necessarily equate to good. It is a situation you can see happening, well, unfortunately, it does happen more frequently than anyone would probably care to admit. The acting is good and cast correctly. However, the show does have it's problems and had the potential to be much stronger. First, the teacher makes some unrealistic and illogical mistakes. The way the affair was exposed was unbelievable. A teacher would not likely confide such an immense transgression to a colleague, let alone a colleague she barely knows. Would have made more sense for the student to tell or the friends to see them out. Then, after being exposed and knowing she is being investigated, she continues to carry on the affair. Pure stupidity. Another issue is the series feels rushed. With a 25 minute run time, why not stretch this to an hour and expand on the plot and character build? There were several scenes that could have been omitted and the focus shifted to a more interesting focus. Instead of seeing Eric party at school, I would have rather seen Claire explaining her story to the lawyer and seeing her sentenced. I would have also liked to see the relationship with her husband after Claire was exposed instead of just being told about it. Overall, it's worth a watch. However, it wasn't something I'm overly excited to tell all my friends to watch...",/review/rw6309865/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2020,aprilsfriendorin,6," Intriguing and enticing, but steadily goes downhill
","First off, I want to say that the people leaving one star reviews complaining about how this is glorifying statutory rape have missed the point. Shows like PLL and Riverdale- where they portray the teachers as great romantic interests who are genuinely good people- those are glorifying these relationships. This show does not paint the teacher in a positive light. It's very clear that this relationship is problematic; just because they don't villainize the teacher doesn't mean they're condoning her actions. No awful person is 100% evil, and that goes for this character as well. If you think the show is actually condoning the student teacher narrative, something is wrong with your perception.",/review/rw6309865/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2020,perisho,6," Well done and nuanced- at least up to episode 3
","Lots of pearl clutching on this one. Lot's of moral panic and moralizing. But the topic is part of the human experience like everything else in popular entertainment. We watch murders and robberies on screen all the time and don't assume the makers are saying these things are okay or should be accepted in real life, This show should be given the same leeway.",/review/rw6309865/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2020,shane1181,7," Quick watch, gives you something to think about
","To reviewers calling this a love story, you missed the point completely. She even says as much multiple times in the final episodes. She USED the kid to ""blow up her marriage"" that she didn't know how to end any other way. She saw the kid had a crush on her and took advantage of him! She never loved him. She created the situations in which his crush would bloom by taking him to her alma mater campus (and to a frat party!), and tutoring him, which BTW, I'm pretty sure she never got that cleared by the school even though in the first episode she said she would have to ... even on the weekend away for his 18th birthday (which BTW means he was 17 while she was his 30-year old teacher when they started their affair) you can see how conflicted she is when he says that he loves her and she's happy to be screwing someone other than her husband. Recall she's an emotionally-immature character who was stunted by early childhood trauma (losing her mother) and an alcoholic father, and she married the first man she ever slept with, which doesn't bode well that it was necessarily love. Finally in the last episode she has a chance to acknowledge all of this and grant him some sort of apology, but he calls her out on how she's complaining about how this ruined HER life! She's still too self-centered and immature to apologize like an adult. It took him years to figure out what she did to him. The last line where he walks out on her is perfect.",/review/rw6309865/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2021,ue-53660,7," Good Drama
",This is a good drama unfortunately ruined by the very end scene. It is not credible nor right. Otherwise it is well acted and well written.,/review/rw6309865/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2020,julieshotmail,9," As addictive as pork rinds, if you like pork rinds
","I am not one to binge-watch a series which has become a popular activity these days. I prefer to consume a show in the weekly format. But I make an exception for this one, as I found myself inadvertently hitting ""play next"" through episode 4, which is the latest episode when I discovered this provocative show. The content offers so many layers, mostly questionable, just like pork rinds. You know the stuff is bad but the packaging makes it so engaging to consume so you keep at it anyway. Kudos to the lead actors and production crew for packaging up this content in a way that's weirdly entertaining, disturbing, and thought-provoking. For starters, this show would not be the same if the gender roles were reversed. As much as some people would like to believe, men and women are not equal and this show reminds you of that. Now I await episode 5 next week and thank Hulu for making the rest of the episodes available on a weekly basis.",/review/rw6309865/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2021,laragi,6," Better than most films like it

30 December 2020,cbouchard-53837,3," Worst ending ever...
","As a teacher I 100% do not agree with her behavior...18 yrs old or not...because it's still a position of influence and power. BUT...with all the grooming warnings I expected to see something very different. At his age he is absolutely capable of being interested in someone and ""hitting on someone""...but he may not be capable of understanding the consequences of a relationship with his teacher. She as the adult and teacher needed to know that and shut it down; but I didn't see ""grooming"". And then what the show seemed to portray is that their lives were miserable when they were apart and missing each other...rather than they are so destroyed by each other...until the last 2 minutes of the show Eric gets mad-ish. Just a weird portrayal and dumb ending.",/review/rw6309865/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2020,sagarshares7854,5," Pretty decent so far
","I started watching this show recently with a high note of caution, given the preceding comments and reviews all over the Internet.The imdb description too calls the relationship a ""predatory"" one.From what we know so far about the characters,neither Eric nor Claire fit this definition.Claire is an English teacher who has just moved to a new school.She's very attractive and the ""seniors"" immediately take a liking to her.Eric is a student in her class and through repeated ""coincidences"",Claire and Erik keep running into each other.I think this part could've been chalked out better.Overall,I feel the show is a bit handicapped by it's short run-time.The complexities of each character could've been better explored in a 40-45 minute/episode show.",/review/rw6309865/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2020,dbphotonut,7," Good show but silly from a European POV
","I'm enjoying the series but watching this from Europe really focuses on the ridiculous puritanical nature of US society. In most of Europe the age of consent varies from 14-16 (Ireland is an outlier at 17), and so called statutory rape is something most people in Europe have never even heard of, it's just not an issue. Yes she would probably have lost her job because he was a student, but that would have been it, the police would never have been involved in this mess. The US needs to get it's priorities in order, prosecuting people for having consensual sex is just mad when you don't even have healthcare, really? Stories like this really bring up the differences in what are seemingly very similar societies.",/review/rw6309865/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2020,jennfinn,6," Ehh.
",This could've been so much better if we would've gotten a little background about Claire (Kate Mara) or a reason as to why she'd throw her life away for this particular student. It seemed like Claire is only in it for the sex and maybe to add a little excitement in her life like stealing lipstick from the market. She said she didn't drink all through high school and college and didn't lose her virginity till senior year of college. So if she's always done the right thing her whole life why would she suddenly do something so reckless & irresponsible ? I don't buy it. In my opinion Kate Mara is a dull actress and she comes across as completely robotic as Claire so I find it hard to believe that Eric (Nick Robinson) would become so obsessed with her. Also Claire's friend/coworker is okay with drinking on school grounds and loves the idea of Claire having an affair but when she finds out it's with a student she suddenly gets on her moral high horse & rats her out. I'm not buying that either.,/review/rw6309865/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2021,DKosty123,5," Realism Destroyed Here By Poor Sequencing
","A couple of things go haywire including the characters but after binge watching this, the story leaves more questions than answers. First, remember this story was already done as a movie, which I have not seen. Second, this series feels like there are a lot of gaps in most of the characters and realism gets tossed out of the story at various times. Gaps lead development of everyone into a sort of limbo which really is a let down at the moralistic ending. I do not think Hannah Fidell's writing is properly treated here. I am wondering if in real life Hannah met as many messed up women as are in this story.",/review/rw6309865/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2020,alicianora,7," A problematic story told right
","Yes it's a tale old as time...but it happens more than our society wants to let on. FX does a really great job with the casting, acting & storyline. This show is gripping and entertaining for sure and it is shot beautifully. The shorter show time leaves me wanting more & I'm sure the rest of the audience is (still) conflicted despite how cliche this story is conceptually.",/review/rw6309865/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2020,candicelee82,8," Glad to see bravery on tv!
","Just finished the first 3 episodes and I'm glad someone was brave enough to show this on TV.
Was it hard to watch, of course, but let's not forget Mary Kay Letourneau who ended up going to jail for this in real life and ended up marrying her student and having children with him. Meaning THESE THINGS HAPPEN IN REAL LIFE!!! Does it make it right, of course not, but on an artistic level the show is written and acted well and Kate Mara was a great choice. Just remember when watching, these are actors who are of age, and if you can't stomach it, then do what my mom does when a horror movie is on... take a deep breath and change the channel.",/review/rw6309865/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2021,kfgfktflytghflg,10," Great show about a non-issue
","As a European, I don't understand how this is an issue for the law. Can it be problematic because of the power dynamc? Sure. Should teachers who sleep with their of age students be sanctioned? Sure.
But is it criminal? No. Two adults over the age of consent have consensual sex. How is this a matter for the police?",/review/rw6309865/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2020,Reviewer99,7," Good series but ...
",... they try to cram too much into a 30 minute episode. Episode 7 was a good example of this with all of Erik's escapades crammed into 30 minutes. The should should be 60 minutes.,/review/rw6309865/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2021,mycannonball,7," Uncomfortably Well-done
","I rank this as a 7 because I think it's well-done but I can't say that loved watching it, because the subject matter is a bit uncomfortable. It's like watching a train wreck with a bunch of characters that you kind of like, kind of don't like and ultimately disapprove of... and then it goes from bad to worse. Well-done storytelling and acting. Kate Mara is very good.",/review/rw6309865/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2020,MovieHead123,2," He is 18 for crying out loud!
","This show was good up until episode 10. I had a feeling from the very first episode when I saw the ""grooming"" warning that they would make out Nick Robinson's character to be a victim. I highly doubt any red-blooded male that age would consider themselves a victim, as it is every guy's dream to have a relationship with their attractive and relatively young teacher.",/review/rw6309865/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2021,reikihealer-dk,5," Great until the last episode
","I really binged this series, which could be a reality.
However, the super moralistic ending made me feel that it was a waste of time - going from 7 to 5 stars. Episode 10 spoiled everything.",/review/rw6309865/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2021,ZukoFilms,7," Major backpedaling
","We've all seen this plot before. Usually it's a man lusting after the super young girl (AKA every movie ever.) Obviously this is a VERY inappropriate relationship but the way it's presented for most of the series seems to show the POV that these two actually care for each other. The relationship is initiated by the 18 year old student, whom some would argue is legally the age of consent etc; however, the student/teacher power dynamic is at play so it's always wrong. This film DOES romanticize their relationship (music, romantic settings, dialogue) and it's odd when both of the main characters look the same age. These two are portrayed as star-crossed lovers for most of the series and we see how this affair affects their lives afterwards. But the film can't seem to make up its mind on what it's trying to say. He becomes a legend in college, girls want to hook up with him because of his rep.... but he's not always ok with it. Meanwhile we see her life has turned to shambles and she feels remorse for what she did. Then BAM 10 minutes before the show ends, the former student runs into her 10 years later and blows up at her for ruining his life and storms off. And then it just ends! WTF?!? The series seemed to want to delve into a controversial topic, and instead of getting deeper into the why and how this thing happened, they got notes halfway through filming and had to regroup and make sure that they made a very clear statement that this is unacceptable behavior. And then it becomes a super on-the-nose finale. Like an after school special. It just needed a ""The More You Know"" rainbow.",/review/rw6309865/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2021,namstonk,2," Acting fine, looks great, believable it is not
","Well once you realise it's not risky or salacious and is something lame like The CW or Alibi would show, you quickly thank the episodes are so short. Mara is a great actor and Robinson never does anything wrong per se, also the rest of the cast chip in accordingly with what is needed. However that's all very well for acting, it's the age problem, none of them look TEENAGE, (Robinson is 24 and looks it) they don't come across as being preyed upon in fact quite the opposite. Subsequently the so called emotion the viewer is meant to feel is thusly ineffective.
I don't see why TV production companies keep on doing this, yes they want a marquee name but at what cost? Surely it would be more fruitful to have a cast actually play the age range required.",/review/rw6309865/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2020,ahvigier,9," Excellent Show, great actors

30 December 2020,stoltzefish,3," The ending is ridiculous

25 November 2020,blanbrn,10," Provocative, brash, intense love affair with intimate raw emotional passion!
","""A Teacher"" captures a behind the scenes part time love affair just perfect, all of us over the years have heard and seen the effects of older teacher and younger student affairs. With most of them turning for the worst in left field. With this series those themes are captured just perfect yet with hot steamy scenes of lust and passion. Set in Texas high school teacher Claire(the beautiful and good Kate Mara) is stuck in a dead floating marriage however when she meets young and popular high school teen Eric(Nick Robinson) and she decides to help mentor and tutor him, the relationship turns and fate has it this leads to study sessions between the bed sheets. It's like this hot steamy lustful affair is masking up as real true love! Yet both have thoughts and doubts as it's clear this journey could be on a nightmare road for both. This subject for sure is for mature adults and watching these half hour episodes may not be everyone's cup of tea, still if your up for some tasty and juicy scandal and shame like local town tabloid like gossip that feels real and burns both lovers involved then this series is a nice treat on the eyes.",/review/rw6309865/?ref_=tt_urv
