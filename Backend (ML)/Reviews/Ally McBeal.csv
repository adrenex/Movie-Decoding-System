29 April 2022,amoore-4,9," Can't understand the 6 and 7 ratings for this...
","That Dirty Black Bag is a dark, sometimes violent but we'll written and acted western that pays homage to the classic spagetti westerns of the 60s with Clint Eastwood, Lee van Cleef and a host of well known actors of the time. Not only is it filmed in the province of Almeria, Spain (near Tabernas) with its stark, dry, desolate landscape, but it has overtones of Quentin Tarantino's dramatic, violent, oversized red credits style similar to what we saw in The Hateful 8. But more importantly it's a nod to the great director Sergio Leone who pioneered the good vs evil western with closeups of the cool, calculating and terror-filled faces with rousing academy award winning music by Ennio Moricone. We see hints of Sergio's directing style throughout the series but especially in episode 8 ""The Great Duel"" which is so reminiscent of the final scenes of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly replete with a cemetery, wide angle POV followed by angst-ridden closeups of the gunslingers as they prepare to shoot em' up. To make it even more interesting the evil protagonist is of Italian descent and of course the crew is 95% Spanish. As I write this there are few ratings for the last few episodes but I expect this series to be a sleeper, and fan reviews will come out soon with headlines like ""the best western you missed"" or that you should see... Definitely in the 8 area of IMDB...",/review/rw8258205/?ref_=tt_urv

1 May 2022,TruthSeeker4Life,10," One of my favorite shows! The way it's shot and the acting is phenomenal.
","The show has a lot of twists and turns but all believable and realistic. It's certainly not a Hollywood style film where you know what's going to happen and there is way too much cheese. This show is very realistic with some really great screen writing and acting. It's quality and I'm surprised there aren't more reviews of the show. I really hope they do at least a second season and I could certainly see this going on for a good four seasons, but only if they keep the sane people who made the first season. This is the big problem with a lot of shows is that they don't retain the same people who made it great and that includes actors but also screenwriters, casting, directing and so on. They don't need to change a thing! I think next season is going to attract a lot more viewers and I see this show going hire up on the charts if they continue to make this type of quality show. Westerns are real popular right now because they're raw and real! I think people like it a lot because they hate how much society controls us and fantasize about a time when people made the rules and they were freer but also had to fight to survive in a very different way than now. All around gear show and if the people at AMC are reading this then I hope you take my word for it that this show has too much potential to not make a second season!",/review/rw8258205/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2022,thejdrage,8," Personally ........ I can't figure this out BUT NOT for the faint of heart
",Spaghetti Western? Yep. Made in Spain instead of Italy. Dark western. Yep. Arty film? Yep. Great cast? Absolutely. Shock factor for shock factor value only. Yep. Blood and guts? TONS of it! Good writing? Not sure. I have no idea what the story line is - other than a town filled with very angry people and some religious ones too. But a story. Haven't found it yet. Black bag and all. Visually: Absolutely stunning.,/review/rw8258205/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2022,DUTCHY_BOY_1,10," ONE OF THE BEST
","One of the best TV shows out there, great acting, action, its also fun. It must be hidden gem as i see not many have seen it. If you havent defo give it try.",/review/rw8258205/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2022,misteraurora,8," No capes !
","It is a western ! And it is a good western - it has dominick cooper !! I thought every show and movie these days could only take place in a ""universe"" where people where capes. Between this show and 1883, i am hoping that westerns get a little more love. I am so sick of the super hero stuff. Its been going on for a decade now. It has been nothing but wonky cgi generated super hero's doing wonky super hero things via bad cgi and vfx. Burnt out. Give us more content like this please ! Good stuff ! Now, put your head in my sac.",/review/rw8258205/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2022,carter-96075,8," Thoroughly enjoyed
",I don't understand the negativity around this series. It has all you want in a western. Just because it's not made in America and is directed by Italians? Get a grip. It's a dark and gory western and keeps you hooked throughout! If you simply enjoy this genre then I very much recommend.,/review/rw8258205/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2022,Rogermex,8," Powerful, dramatic, complex, well-done.
","I wrote a ""preliminary review"" as I watched the first episode. Having finished the first season's 8 episodes now, I'd have to say it met my expectations and more. The cinematography and acting are superb. A very interesting cast of characters played with great finesse by top-notch actors. It is set somewhere in the Old West, but it's beyond the usual spaghetti Westerns by being more mythic and somewhat ""supernatural."" If there's a downside, that I'm sure some viewers will not like, it's that the the symbolism and hysterical motivations are kind of far-fetched. But as I said before, the ""Mad Max"" series was also far-fetched but due to being a fantasy of a dystopian world.",/review/rw8258205/?ref_=tt_urv

2 May 2022,joseesrocha,8," I'm looking forward to the second season.
","Overall this season was good, it was creative, violent and beautifully shot, the only negative point for me was the editing of some gun shots in some action scenes that disappointed me!!!",/review/rw8258205/?ref_=tt_urv

28 April 2022,andi-turner-605-373601,9," Great show
",Not really a review writer can't talk about anything in depth but great entertainment for me just my opinion great acting from some fine British actors more used to being in period dramas about the English class system in Georgian society. Enjoyed it immensely.,/review/rw8258205/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2022,AfricanBro,7," Good enough
","It isn't as good as it should be but I think it's still alright considering only the pilot episode's out. The cast lineup is full of actors who often play supporting roles pretty well so I'm looking forward to the rest of the episodes to see how it unfolds. I'm surprised I didn't hear about this show prior because I really just came across it by chance. For the most part, it felt like a simple, daytime action spaghetti western but there are a couple scenes that suggest things might get a little more crimson, I hope it does because it feels like it's floating in no man's land, it's not too this, not too that so it doesn't feel unique and memorable. Not bad, it can be better, I'm gonna watch the next couple episodes to see how it goes.",/review/rw8258205/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2022,johnmc963,9," Very Good Spaghetti Western TV Show
","Not sure what previous reviewers meant by saying this show ain't about nothing but ""hoors"" and a brothel (actually it's a very small part)
I guess the search for gold and all the people involved is a small part of the story. The crooked sheriff and all his killing and robbing is a pretty big part of the story as well. Don't forget all the money that the sheriff stole and the gang of really bad guys after him.",/review/rw8258205/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2022,dubwize,8," Better than expected.. Cowboy BeBop meets the Wild West.
","The flashbacks while opening up the background story are illuminating, they detract from the main flow of the story. This said, the performances, the casting and the plot lines / motivations have been better than expected. Great acting, surprising twists, I would say this is almost Cowboy BeBop for the Wild West, as there are a lot of interesting synchronicites in the overall eight part story.",/review/rw8258205/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2022,Headturner1,6," And a half: Update after finishing spoliers
","I looked every where on this page to write a review a few days ago and there's wasn't the usual place so I left one under episode one. I can't believe I'm the first person to review this?!? I found this ( as it popped up in things you might like or something) the page wouldn't load so I couldn't see a video or anything so I just hit play. I almost immediately turned it off when I saw the genre until I was Patterson Joesephs name! I love that man and he isn't in a lot of things I fancy. I'm not really a fan of Dominic Cooper but I like him in this. To my surprise Aidan Gillen is also in it unrecognizable and Travis Fimmel whom I'm not sure who he was. Lol. Only 2 episodes have aired and it's hard to find and when I bring it up it doesn't even show the 3rd or when it will be airing! Probably why there's no reviews. Well I guess they are paying for them which is good. Any ways .. I like it ok. There''s going to be a lot of gruesome things happening it has a Cohen/ Tarantino - esque vibe going so hopefully it's going to be great with all the dismal junk having been released so far this year. I don't know why but I can't stop thinking about this. I'll update after I watch more. I'm sure I will need to..
Edit: boy what a disappointment! After finishing. They didn't build any story what so ever! They stated and killed everyone off so they didn't have to! This could have been so good but went absolutely nowhere! And I mean nowhere! What happened with the satanic cult stuff? The rain, the gold, the revenge on the brother. Why did ( forget names) Dominic Cooper and the other guy( looks like Fimmel but knw it's not) just end up killing each other for no reason when they were going to get revenge on the brother?!? Forget another season because eveyone's gone! So utterly disappointed because this could have been fantastic! Ugh!",/review/rw8258205/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2022,lwmswm,4," Mish Mash Writing But Solid Acting
","This is a very weird series. Although the story ties together and clearly was thought out from the first episode it still felt like each episode was written on the fly. A lot of it could have and should have been eliminated to make a tighter story. 4 episodes instead of 8 would have been more than sufficient. Also, the ending is unsatisfying. The acting was good so it's a 4.",/review/rw8258205/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2022,Marc_cab32,9," Fantastic
","The show is fantastic. I was hesitant at first since AMC has gone the woke route but the plot, characters and acting are tremendous. An extremely dark western with lots of twists and turns.. The show is filled with drama and suspense and best of all....no virtue signaling . A solid edgy show that will capture your attention and have you binging the series quickly. Even the cinematography is cool. Need more of these type of shows. I'm hoping AMC continues this trend. This is my last review since the new 600 character minimum is over the top ridiculous. They really need to rethink this restriction to get more legit and active reviews.",/review/rw8258205/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2022,bbevis-47954,5," Okay Start
","I'm not sure there is enough here to compel me to keep watching. The main problem is there is not enough here in the first episode to justify further viewing. There is nothing you haven't seen before in a Western. Characters boil down to a brutal outlaw, crooked sheriff, desperate farmer, crime kingpin and an ambitious brothel owner. The brutal violence adds a little flavor and some of the cinematography is nice to look at. Some of the story threads are a little interesting. For example, red bill's predicament at the end of episode one. Unfortunately, everything else is a little boring in my opinion. That Dirty Black Bag has potential, but the first episode does not do a good enough job keeping me intrigued for further viewing.",/review/rw8258205/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2022,SnoopyStyle,7," a new spaghetti western
",This is a new spaghetti western. This centers on a dusty town and its inhabitants. There hasn't been rain in years. The gold mine has run dry but a farmer finds a huge nugget. Bounty hunter Red Bill takes down his target. Arthur McCoy (Dominic Cooper) is the local Sheriff. Eve runs the local brothel. That's before all the baddies. There are so many baddies. There may be a few too many people in this story but many of them get killed off eventually. The visuals are immense and beautiful. I've never heard of the show's creators. They seem to be Italians who love their spaghetti westerns and they have served up the spaghetti and the sauce. This should be a limited series although I read that they're planning for more. Maybe they're shooting for their own version of the Dollars Trilogy.,/review/rw8258205/?ref_=tt_urv
