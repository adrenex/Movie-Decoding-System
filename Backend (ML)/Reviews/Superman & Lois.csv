","TRON: Legacy is a literal misunderstood masterpiece & is one of the most intellectual, deepest science-fiction movies I've seen Disney produce - EVER! Let me explain:
Immediately, CLU has strong, deliberate similarities with Hitler - they both wanted to create ""the perfect system"" & viewed those in their society who were similar to themselves as superior, where individuals are only deemed valuable if they can be used to further implement & reassert the oppressive structures in place.",/review/rw3858592/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2019,KingCritic,9," An Underrated Gem
","Everything about this film works. The visuals, writing, acting, everything. There are very few wrong things I can find with Tron, especially the soundtrack which is timeless even almost a decade later. I still remember watching this film in theaters and not regretting it at all. I highly recommend this film for fans of anything quality.",/review/rw3858592/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2019,tron-legacy01,10," Amazing watch even after 9 years
","Yes. I had watched this movie back in 2010 when I was in school. Didn't understand much, but I was blown away by the visuals.. But now watching in 2019, it all makes sense and the visuals are yet world class. This movie was ahead of its time.",/review/rw3858592/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2010,garlonuss,8," Touching Spectacle
","It's not highly likely to win many new converts, but for those who already like the original and want to see more of that world, it more than satisfies. The visuals are a wonderful evolution from Tron and the story of a father and son who have to make up for lost time is very touching. The CGI face they developed for Jeff Bridges is not perfect, but it works very well with just a few exceptions and I feel, for my own tastes, that they have actually bridged the uncanny valley with this one. Still a bit of work to get it perfect, but this one works as it is. Oh, and the score by Daft Punk is beautiful. The first thing my brother and I did after leaving the theater was buy the sound track on the way home. It's very suggestive of the original but with plenty of today's newer sensibilities mixed in.",/review/rw3858592/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2015,MrGroovilicious,8," This movie has far deeper themes than people give it credit for
","The original movie was generic. While it's far from bad, it's plot was simplistic in terms of the overall focus being on the good vs evil side and less on the thematic element it established of Flynn and all users being gods. It serves as a mythology, however, to a much more insightful legend which unfolds in this movie. But the problem is, due to the somewhat simplistic nature of the predecessor, people failed to give attention to the themes of this film, preferring to focus on the generic side as that's what they'd expect from a Tron movie. But the movie doesn't stay generic, so when viewers find nothing simple to see they assume the movie is empty. It's not, they're minds are just preset to look for simple ""turn off your brain and be entertained"" values, which simply aren't present in this film.",/review/rw3858592/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2020,briancham1994,7," Style over substance
","This film is the best example of ""style over substance"", but wow, what substance. It has some of the best production design and soundtrack I have ever witnessed. Visually and aurally speaking, I would even call it a masterpiece. It is like no other techno-futuristic cyberspace I have ever seen depicted. However, it is let down by a dull main actor and an unpolished story that didn't fully convince me.",/review/rw3858592/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2011,TheLittleSongbird,7," Surprisingly enjoyable
","I actually wasn't expecting to enjoy TRON:Legacy, but coming from someone who is fond of the original 1982 film, I did. TRON:Legacy isn't a perfect movie though, then again neither was the original movie. The film thematically is deeper than the original, but there are some parts where it comes across as rather formulaic for my tastes. Also while the characters are likable, they aren't given that much depth, and again while the dialogue is intriguing at most some of it is weak and dare I say stilted.",/review/rw3858592/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2020,fqwfqiu,9," One Under-Rated Movie
","This is the one sequel I actually like. More correctly, I love it.",/review/rw3858592/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2010,tavm,8," TRON: Legacy improved immensely on the original from 28 years ago
","Just watched this sequel to TRON with my movie theatre-working friend and we both thought it was awesome! Yeah, I said it! And while I had a few questions like what happened to the Cindy Morgan character and was she the wife of Jeff Bridges' character that died, I was ready to let myself get in to the movie on its own terms, no matter what and that's just what I did. I mean, it was at least nice to see both Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner from the original reprise their roles and age gracefully to boot though it was also awesome seeing the former one ""de-aged"" to look like the now enemy program CLU. And how about Garrett Hedlund playing the now-adult son of Kevin Flynn, Sam, as he learns about his father after he disappeared in 1989 and discovers just what happened to him and his relationship with the fascinatingly appealing and brave female live-in played by Olivia Wilde. It's possible that not everything that was talked about and explained in the movie will make the most complete sense but while watching, I was just riveted throughout that all I could do was just marvel at everything going on with nothing but a smile on my face. I think director Joseph Kosinski did a good job in expanding what Steven Lisberger created 28 years ago and the score by Daft Punk is just as good a compliment to this movie as Wendy Carlos' was to the original. So on that note, I highly recommend TRON: Legacy. P.S. When the beginning disclaimer said that parts of this movie was in 2-D, I figured that the live-action sequences was what was referred to and occasionally took my 3-D glasses off to watch those scenes and often found them looking better that way during those, especially at the end.",/review/rw3858592/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2010,Chalice_Of_Evil,8," Trontastic...
","I have never seen the original 'Tron', nor do I really know much about it really. I've only heard the movie referenced on occasion (like that one episode of The Simpsons where Homer's trapped in the Third Dimension and he asks if anybody saw the movie 'Tron', and everyone says ""No.""). The previews for 'Tron: Legacy' looked visually stunning, and I'm happy to report it does not disappoint in that regard. Everything seen inside ""The Grid"" is a wonder to behold, a visual feast. But is this the only thing the film has going for it? Well...yes and no. As far as the characters/actors who portray them are concerned...",/review/rw3858592/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2010,DICK STEEL,10," A Nutshell Review: TRON: Legacy
","There's a fairly coherent storyline here that would appeal across the spectrum, striking a fair balance between drama and action, although action junkies would have preferred for set action sequences given the investment in souping up and introducing a number of vehicles other than the light cycle.",/review/rw3858592/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2010,dvc5159,6," A dazzling and spectacular special effects extravaganza, despite its flaws.
","Right off the bat I'm going to say that I didn't see the first film. Obviously I've heard from a lot of people saying that they need to see the first film before watching this one, seeing as this is a direct sequel to a nearly 30 year old cult sci-fi film. But, seeing that I didn't have time, I decided to watch the sequel anyway.",/review/rw3858592/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2011,dbborroughs,9," there is more to this then the visuals
",Late in the game sequel is probably one of the most under rated film of the year. Blame it on the over whelming spectacle which swamps the wonderfully layered story.,/review/rw3858592/?ref_=tt_urv
1 May 2011,bob the moo,," Effects heavy style that works as such despite having a basic plot and nothing really in terms of characters
","The sequel to Tron took the right approach to the marketing and went into effect a good year before the film came out. Recognising that many people (apart from real fans) will only have a hazy recollection of the film and will probably vaguely remember it as ""good"" but really only remember the iconic bikers and design of it all, the marketing focused on the updated design, bikes etc that make up this world. In every interview there was always a smattering of talk about father/son and comments made on the power and omnipresent nature of computers and networks but really it was the visual aspects of the film that were pushed to the front. So it was with the marketing, so it is with the film where we join the rebellious son of Flynn as he gets sucked into the grid and discovers that his father's dream has been corrupted by a clone programme of himself.",/review/rw3858592/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2010,aaronjbong,9," A Cyber-Epic Film With an Amazing Rendering of the Digital World
","A science fiction movie made by Disney seems interesting enough especially when it's live-action and targeted for kids (Disney targets its movies for kids, right?). And there it is, ""Tron: Legacy"", a science fiction movie, Disney science fiction movie, live-action and targeted for kids. And yet, 3D.",/review/rw3858592/?ref_=tt_urv

",Great great movie always get chills from the music and when he first uses the bike. Love the atmosphere of Sam Flynn's life and how much love he has for his father at the end of the movie. Fantastic message in the movie where we as people think things are important in our life such as work or possessions but nothing is more important then family 👍.,/review/rw3858592/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2010,griffolyon12,10," Smart, Savvy, and Electrifying!
","There is a moment in Tron: Legacy where Jeff Bridges' Kevin Flynn shows up at a cyber nightclub to save his son, Sam. At his arrival, the lights dim, and with a single touch, he derezzes the evil programs detaining Sam. Kevin Flynn is the creator of the cybernetic universe in Tron: Legacy, and the movie never wants us to forget his deistic importance to the Grid. While, Tron: Legacy could be seen as a father-son story, it is more a movie about the spiritual; the Grid possibly standing in for the spiritual battlefield between God and Satan.",/review/rw3858592/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2010,evan_harvey,7," Amazing visuals, okay plot, shallow story
","Just got back from Tron. This film looks frickin' amazing. The SFX are incredible. I saw it in 3D, but to be honest I didn't notice it much, so it's hard to say whether it is better than 2D.",/review/rw3858592/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2020,cole1987_1,8," Everything right
","An under-appreciated film (first and last time one can say that about a Disney film - the world's crappiest studio), Tron: Legacy expresses brilliantly the tightrope between progress and commercialism in a very stylish setting full of incredible tech, imagination and sexy thin women. One often has to walk between pleasing style and pleasing substance and Tron: legacy does both.",/review/rw3858592/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2010,blackmambamark,8," If 'The Beatles' are to ""Avatar"", then 'Pink Floyd' is to ""Tron: Legacy""....take that how you will.
","When is the last time you saw a Disney movie in December? Hard to think isn't it. Normally around this time, each studio breaks out their big guns just in time for Oscar season. But Disney has refrained from doing so for quiet some time........why? And an even bigger 'Why' is, why make this sequel now? Why not 5...10...or even 15 years ago? Many questions surround Disney choices as of late, like spending over $250 million to make an animated feature with ""Tangled"".......well, if this outcome is anything like that, than we are surely in for a treat.",/review/rw3858592/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2010,fjhuerta-2,6," Fails to capture that special something TRON had
","I wouldn't call myself a TRON hardcore fan - I couldn't even crack a single message from their website during their ""Flynn lives"" viral campaign. Still, I know the movie perfectly well - I watched it on a movie theater when I was 8 years old, and I simply could never get out of my head the Recognizers and Lightcycles. I did master the Intellivision Tron Deadly Discs game, and the movie jump-started my love for all things computer related. I've watched the 20th Anniversary DVD and all the extras far more times than I can care to count. Guess I'm a TRON hardcore fan after all.",/review/rw3858592/?ref_=tt_urv

19 December 2010,drakula2005,10," A sequel, that's on par with the original and even better.Stunning!
","I must begin with the explanation of why i'm giving the full note to the movie-i wasn't the biggest fan of the original Tron (1982) when i saw it, and even though i didn't expect much from the sequel, i was eager to see it, because i am a fan, a huge admirer of Olivia Wilde's and because the timeframe reminded me of another movie, i wasn't so keen to see, last year.A movie, which then turned out to be one of the fullest movies of the year-full of both heart and soul.I even saw it the same day-on the 19-th last year.And i said to myself, there were too many things alike, such as the fact i saw Legacy's trailer at the teather, just before the beginning of Avatar-too many things to throw away such an opportunity.",/review/rw3858592/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2011,ma-cortes,7," Late sequel with rousing images and fantastic computer generator scenarios
","This belated follow-up deals with Sam Flynn ( a brave young man well played by Garrett Hedlund ) , a rebellious 27-year-old , is haunted by the mysterious disappearance of his father , a computer genius named Kevin Flynn ( the old creator whiz who was flapped inside a computer game , being stunningly performed by veteran Jeff Bridges ) , a man once known as the world's leading video-game developer . When Sam investigates a strange signal sent from the old Flynn's Arcade -- a signal that could only come from his father-- he finds himself pulled into a digital world where Kevin has been trapped for 20 years . During his investigation Sam is zapped into another dimension and finds himself a player in a giant gladiatorial video-game competition . As he is sucked inside a powerful computer where he must fight for his life but with the help of the fearless warrior Quorra ( a gorgeous Olivia Wilde ), father and son embark on a life-or-death journey across a cyber universe -- a universe created by Kevin himself that has become far more advanced with vehicles, weapons, landscapes and a ruthless villain ( a computer generated Jeff Bridges who with his charisma keeps afloat the film ) who will stop at nothing to prevent their escape.",/review/rw3858592/?ref_=tt_urv
