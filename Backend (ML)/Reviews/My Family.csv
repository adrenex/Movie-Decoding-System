5 December 2019,Sleepin_Dragon,9," Exhilarating viewing.
","I have been hugely impressed by Vienna Murders, three episodes of absorbing, exciting, and hugely enjoyable drama.",/review/rw7655530/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2019,pontram,," Very fine murder Mystery
","First to say, it's not Sherlock & Watson. It's more of a team player effort. Of course, Both main characters, Lieberman and the inspector, have to come together from very diametrical positions of how a case should be solved.
The term of 'profiler' is used, and I'm quite sure that's for the audience only, and wasn't known then. But they may have had a similiar name for a killer's extrapolated personality.
Acting is really very good, and Mathew Beard is just optimal for Liebermann, exploring new methods of deduction and investigation.
Very high production values, meticulously catching the flair of the young 20th century during the short time when Vienna was the capital of a huge empire, where the Jews tried to find their place by assimilating themselves.
There is always some dry humor present, which makes the show a very pleasant watch.
Directing by Robert Dornhelm in the first episode is great. Tension is built very well until the case is solved in a nice finale.
Of course Vienna is the third main Character, as it is shown in most of it's remaining Glory from the old days.
There are some small references to the famous 'Third Man', or I thought to recognise them.
In this first episode most of the secondary characters did not get much attention, but I hope this will change in later episodes.
I hope the coming episodes are equally high in quality to the first one.",/review/rw7655530/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2019,peterrichboy,8," Sherlock moves to Vienna and it's rather good
","First of all Vienna Blood based on the novels by Frank Tallis (no me neither) and developed for TV by Sherlock's Steve Thompson, is beautifully filmed, the whole production oozes quality from the costumes, script to acting. Maybe the lack of big name stars in the lead roles prevented the BBC from giving this show a more prominent slot on on BBC one. Which is a shame as the show has all the same qualities that made Sherlock such a successful worldwide hit. Set in Vienna at the start of the 20th century our dynamic duo played by Mathew Beard and Jurgan Maurer one an old school detective, his partner a student of Sigmund Freud plays a budding criminal psychologist and between them set out to solve a series of murders with the stunning backdrop of Vienna.",/review/rw7655530/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2019,mgumsley,9," Great atmospheric drama with psychological input
",I really enjoyed the first episode of this new BBC1 one detective series. Bringing a young doctor who has studied Freud to help the detective solve a bizarre string of murders makes for an exciting beginning! I didn't know any of the actors but the wonderful cast and settings around Vienna circa 1900 made for an excellent production. Can't wait to see the rest of this compelling series.,/review/rw7655530/?ref_=tt_urv

9 January 2022,dklecan,9," Great fun show, Season 2, tonite!!!
",Stop with all the comparisons with Sherlock Holmes. Just enjoy the subtle burgeoning relationship between a freudian psychiatrist and a working class policeman set in the beautiful city of Vienna.,/review/rw7655530/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2019,irishsounds,9," 10 Minutes in and I was hooked.
","Not for the unsophisticated block-buster fans or the action movie addicts. This superb, refreshingly different, historical who-done-it series takes a little bit of work to fully enjoy. It's not popcorn and candy cuisine, and it requires a degree of digesting.",/review/rw7655530/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2019,flrestan,," Very enjoyable
","Very good and fresh crime-solving drama set in Vienna on the eve of the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire.

19 November 2019,oldtraff,7," Sherlock Holmes esque Whodunit not bad
","Only seen the 1 episode but the plot was better than most of the cut and paste whodunits. Anyone enjoying murder mysteries will enjoy this, also deeper than the ave with side plots that will develop. Will be watching ep 2",/review/rw7655530/?ref_=tt_urv

26 November 2019,keithfmanaton,10," Relief from the relentless Shire & Christie mysteries churned out by British TV
","Wonderfully shot in a stunning city. Respite from Oxfordshire, drab Victorian England & dystopian London which English viewers only seem to want.
The introduction of psychological history & the history of the roots of facism & anti Semitic will be challenging for most Brits. Who's are comfortable with their island views. And I'm sure the right will be out in force to trash this.
It's a thumping good detective story, certainly beats the repetitive tired reimagining that's plagues British TV for 20 years or more.",/review/rw7655530/?ref_=tt_urv

13 December 2019,laurotur,9," Utterly compelling...
","I loved the setting in Vienna which highlighted the beautiful architecture which was a setting that held and supported the characters incredibly well. Each episode was a slow burner composed of many layers which, little by little, kept the viewer captivated and drawn deeper into each episode as it unfolded. I loved each of the three storylines and really warmed to the two main characters.",/review/rw7655530/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is a very watchable series, but someone should have told the director that they drove on the left in the Austro-Hungarian empire. Vienna did not switch to driving on the right until 1938, after the German invasion. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",/review/rw7655530/?ref_=tt_urv
