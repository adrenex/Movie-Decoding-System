26 April 2017,trashgang,9," weird but it does have it all, a gem
","I stepped into this flick without knowing what it was all about so it was a big surprise that I found this one a gem. Can I say something negative about The Void, well, no. Maybe for some the story will be a void because it's all about weird things, supernatural stuff, I don't know what to say but pick it up without hesitation.",/review/rw3733798/?ref_=tt_urv
19 September 2019,azathothpwiggins,," ""This Isn't My Face!""...
","Imagine if John Carpenter had decided to combine his remake of THE THING with ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, and set it in a hospital, like in HALLOWEEN 2. Add to that, the murdering madness of EVENT HORIZON, and the overarching, occult horror of HP Lovecraft, seasoned with a dash of HELLRAISER, and you're close to THE VOID.",/review/rw3733798/?ref_=tt_urv

8 April 2017,Quinoa1984,5," half the work was done here. guess which half?
","On the effects and style end, The Void is an example to all of those filmmakers who say ""fix it in post"" and want to only use CGI blood instead of actual syrup mixed with whatever. It's an often grotesque display of what can be done with rubber and latex and some imagination. Is it the *most* imaginative use of practical effects? Perhaps not, but it's a lot of the time in the designs, and that the lighting is often cued to make us see the creatures and monsters and tentacles so that it's just real enough without becoming fake. And there are some unsettling choices in direction and atmosphere - how we first are introduced to the mind-control aspect involving a nurse with a scalpel and a face as revealed to be pretty much (gulp) torn off is exciting and disgusting. These directors weren't lazy when it came to effects, but unfortunately they became lazy when it came time to do the *work* of a movie script.",/review/rw3733798/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2017,SmartGun,7," Hell Hasn't Been This Much Fun In Ages
","First off, I've seen some negative reviews on here that have truly surprised me. After growing up as a fan of Horror during that wonderful 80's period, I can honestly say The Void felt as comfortable as it does uncomfortable, especially if you're a fan of those movies of that time. Yes there are some very strong Clive Barker influences running throughout the movie (both Hellraiser and Nightbreed for example), but I think that's what kept me hooked throughout. That with a dash of Lovecraftian themed fantasy here and there really gave this movie a lot of (albeit dark) charm. I think the last time I saw something this twisted was probably the Turkish movie 'Baskin', with which it shares a lot of similarities, but The Void tends to push the boundaries a bit further, The landscape and atmosphere are nightmarish, imaginative, and gleefully sinister and foreboding. If they set out to create a true vision of hell then I can safely say that they've achieved that goal and then some.",/review/rw3733798/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2018,Leofwine_draca,7," An unashamed John Carpenter tribute
","While I don't like open rip-offs and remakes of previous, better fare, I have no problems with watching films that are heavily derived from their predecessors. The low budget, crowd-funded Canadian indie horror flick THE VOID is such a film, a throwback to 1980s creature cinema which feels heavily indebted to the movies of John Carpenter. It's a siege film in which a bunch of characters holed up in an isolated hospital are assailed by hooded cult members and horrific monsters, and the viewer witnesses bits of the HELLRAISER series as well as PRINCE OF DARKNESS and THE THING as they watch. I'm a huge fan of anything remotely Lovecraftian, and the tentacled horror of THE VOID was right up my street. Sure, the budget is low and they have to cut corners at times, leaving some parts fairly unconvincing, but the prosthetic effects are quite terrifying and the gore scenes hard to stomach. The unknown cast work hard to convince in their roles, and there's enough energy and imagination to make this a lot of fun.",/review/rw3733798/?ref_=tt_urv

26 February 2018,seanpatrick-36000,9," Criminally underrated
","I'm floored by the poor reception this movie got. It's a loving throwback to horror classics with modern polish, clearly influenced by HP Lovecraft and body horror classics like Hellraiser and The Thing. If you like ""classic"" horror - i.e., horror before CGI and jump scares replaced practical effects and slow dread - you owe it to yourself to watch this movie.",/review/rw3733798/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2021,Woodyanders,8," Excellent horror that goes for the throat
",Deputy sheriff Daniel Carter (a fine and likeable performance by Aaron Poole) delivers an injured man to an understaffed hospital late at night. Freaky stuff starts to happen in said hospital after a group of mysterious robed people surround the place.,/review/rw3733798/?ref_=tt_urv

","A small group of people we barely know are trapped inside the Marsh County Hospital with folks in white hoods sporting knives outside. The cop inside has a shotgun so....okay let's not confuse the issue with facts. Strange things happen within the hospital, i.e. re-animator type stuff along with blob creatures and of course the void, also called the abyss.",/review/rw3733798/?ref_=tt_urv

17 August 2018,evanston_dad,5," Never Gets Around to Being a Movie
","""The Void"" is one of those horror movies with a big (capital ""M"") Mystery at its center, but let's just see if you give a damn about it by the time the film finally gets around to (badly) explaining it. This film is all build up, dropped hints, and dangled carrots. The problem is that it never gets around to just being a damn movie.",/review/rw3733798/?ref_=tt_urv
30 May 2017,Naive-fox,7," A nightmarish surprise
","As much as one might try to watch each movie unconditioned, unprejudiced and ready to judge it for what it is, it's really hard to tackle a title such us the void and not to expect another B horror movie filled with clich√© and disastrous acting. Luckily, it takes but a few minutes to realize ""The void"" is something else, a bold take on cult movies with a very limited budget.",/review/rw3733798/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2017,manuelasaez,8," The unholy union of The Thing X Baskin X Silent Hill
","What do you get when you cross the creature designs of The Thing, the gruesome depravity of Baskin, and the atmosphere and aesthetics of Silent Hill? You get The Void, one of the most deliciously gory and stomach churning films of recent memory. The movie begins with a deceptively simple set-up, and gets progressively more complex as it goes on. The acting is top-notch, especially that of the supporting cast, and the soundtrack is effective and nicely implemented. The star of the show, however, are the incredibly disturbing and disgusting creature designs. It takes a truly depraved mind to create such abominations, and I enjoyed every single frame that was used to showcase each forsaken vessel of filth. It was a masterclass in practical effects, and anyone who says that the craft is dead would get a run for their money after seeing these atrocities.",/review/rw3733798/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2018,slimecity-38663,8," Underrated Horror
","Not sure why this movie isnt rated higher. I saw Cold Ground before this - and it had a rating of 7 something, yet it was another cliched found-footage tripefest, very dull with screaming women and glimpses fo monsters in torchlight. Yawn. ",/review/rw3733798/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2017,krogchoi-69376,10," The less you know, the better. Just go watch it.
","I saw this movie at the Festival du film Fantastique (Gerardmer, France). We were watching 6 movies per day for 3 days in a row, ""The Void"" was the last movie we were going to see for the day and I had absolutely no idea what it was about. In fact I thought it was a sci-fi movie when we stepped into the theater, and boy am I glad we did not know more ; we were in for quite a ride.",/review/rw3733798/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2021,davijieienne,8," Solid classic horror, not for weak stomachs
","In the final part, this movie strongly reminds ""Silent Hill"" or some of the most gory and creepy ""Hellriser"" installments.",/review/rw3733798/?ref_=tt_urv
10 April 2017,sicbassman,7," This movie almost had the making of a science fiction/horror classic. No spoilers
","I gave this one a solid 7 out 10. What it lacks in solid lead actors it makes up for with some amazing visuals and special effects. The void does have some real levels to it and really immerses you into the threat of imminent danger. It's almost reminiscent of silent hill meets Netflix's stranger things. The only thing that drove me bonkers about this film is it's unapologetic and total lack of explanations on plot and drive. It's like being dropped into hell and the devil forgets to tell you how you died. The whole time i was waiting for that one character who seemingly knows all but for ""reasons"" inconveniently discloses the full story by the time its too late. The void is worth watching for sure but don't expect to understand right away. I will definitely be pondering away and painfully scratching my head on this film for a while. It isn't without it's perks though. For the avid horror and sci fan it contains some real tone and plenty of gore to tide you over",/review/rw3733798/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2017,BA_Harrison,4," Hellraiser Hospital
","My friend Phil recommended The Void to me, saying that it was 'weird'; he clearly understands what I look for in a film. Phil was spot on: The Void is totally bizarre, but a little bit too strange and inexplicable towards the end even for my particular tastes.",/review/rw3733798/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2017,fox_davidson,8," A remarkable throwback creature feature
","I attended a screening of The Void at the Nevermore film festival in Durham, NC. It was a remarkable throwback to classic John Carpenter-style films. I hesitate to list too many details about it, since the feel of the film is very much like a nightmare that might be spoiled if you go in knowing how it turns out. I can say that the creature designs were some of the best I've seen on film in recent years. The feel of the film reminded me a great deal of Silent Hill, perhaps because it shares a lot of the same influences.",/review/rw3733798/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2018,robertemerald,7," Strange horror movie will please some ......
","Void is an oddity. I'd best describe it as somewhere between Hellraiser and The Thing, but without the commanding theme of the former, and without the far better special effects of the latter. I'm reminded of the movie The Mist, and perhaps Alien as well. The effects are, well, kind of slapdash, with a lot of slosh and gore, but to my mind rather badly cobbled together, although this situation improves toward the end, and, gratefully, the movie at least delivers a very cinematic close. The acting and script are good, and there are aspects to the horror that certainly have potential, such as the mysterious figures that arrive at various junctures to shepherd the action. And there are various miens to the plot and characters that also have potential, such as characters that morph from bad to good and visa versa, and the different reactions from various unusual players that was also pretty original. The idea for the film is overall sound, but for me its execution (certainly by the mid-point) was just too confused to work properly. The film never seemed to have the time to concentrate on the tension before someone gets it, so to speak. I thought it lost shock potential here and there. It's certainly worth a look, and an important selection for anyone into collecting monster movies. A very hard movie to review. There's a lot going on, but it is definitely a very bloody horror movie, and it will entertain.",/review/rw3733798/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2017,metalrage666,7," Great low-budget 80's style horror
","Had no real idea what to expect when I picked this up, my decision was based almost solely on the cover and the small synopsis on the back, the same way we used to choose movies back in the day. Well I'm glad I did as this was a very pleasant surprise and although it doesn't break any new ground, it was refreshing to see a new horror done in an old style and still manage to work.",/review/rw3733798/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2017,BandSAboutMovies,10," The Void has my highest possible recommendation
","Steven Kostanski and Jeremy Gillespie, who also worked on Manborg, created this ode to all that is wonderful and slimy and bloody and gross about 80's horror. Seriously, this film feels like a spiritual cousin to Prince of Darkness by way of Halloween 2, with an army of cultists surrounding an understaffed hospital which becomes a gateway to another dimension.",/review/rw3733798/?ref_=tt_urv

","Now what could the movie be about? If you haven't seen the trailer and you are as me, you will go watching this ""unprepared"". Apart from hearing it was a Horror movie (it was playing at a Festival), I knew nothing about this. And the movie works on many levels. You get thrown into a situation that leaves you kind of speechless. On a weird journey to discover what this truly is about.",/review/rw3733798/?ref_=tt_urv
