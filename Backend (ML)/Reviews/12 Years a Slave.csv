14 November 2020,ahmedgorshy,10," Dexter Review
","Thanks to the quarantine, I watched series that I never imagined I would ever see, one of these series Dexter, which I heard had a bad ending, so I decided not to watch it, what a nonsense I missed myself watching one of the best series ever.
Dexter has eight seasons and a renewed new season to fix the poor ending and everyone's excited about it.
All seasons are excellent, from the first to the seventh, with the exception of the last.
You evaluate each season as follows.
First 9.7
Second 9.6
Third 8.7
Fourth 9.9
Fifth 9.0
The sixth 8.9
Seventh 9.0
The ex Final season 7.0
Waiting for the new season",/review/rw6834440/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2020,Supermanfan-13,10," One of the best shows ever created!
","Dexter is easily one of my favorite tv shows of all-time and one of the few shows I can watch all the way through several times over without getting bored. It's hard for me to put into words how much I love this show. The only thing that's not good about it is the ending. The ending was pretty bad but that still doesn't take away from how good the show is overall. You should watch this show for Michael C. Hall's performance as Dexter alone. He's amazing in this. This is a thrilling, one of a kind tv show that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire series. If you haven't seen this incredible show yet just make sure you give yourself enough time because you're going to want to binge watch it as fast as you can. Once you start watching you won't be able to stop!",/review/rw6834440/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,10," One of the best shows of all-time!
","Dexter is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the best shows ever created! It follows Miami PD blood splatter expert Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) as he both solves murders and commits them too. He only murders bad people who've gotten away from the law. Being a blood expert he's able to outmaneuver the police at every turn. It's a thrilling, one of a kind TV show that will keep you at the edge of your seat throughout the entire series. Michael C. Hall is perfect as Dexter and the rest of the supporting cast is just as fantastic! Yes, the ending was terrible but like Game of Thrones, Lost (or any other show with a bad final episode), a few bad episodes at the end doesn't spoil what an overall great show it was and that's what Dexter is...a GREAT show!",/review/rw6834440/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2020,mimiybyazphil,10," Unforgettable!!
","One of the best series of
ALL time, period! Michael C Hall is one of the most
underrated actors alive
He was BRILLIANT in this role, as he was in HBOs
Six Feet Under!
It is not often one can watch a series, over and over, and see a NEW
thing each time!
Hate to sound cliche'
but, "" They don't make
them like this, ANYMORE!""",/review/rw6834440/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2022,latinfineart,10," One of the best shows, ever!
","Every season was great. The characters were so well written, they just kept evolving. Great cast, great production. John Lithgow and Edward James Elmos were outstanding villains. Michael C. Hall was amazing. Few shows in the history of TV have been this good.",/review/rw6834440/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2022,oscarjneklund,9," Very Good! ðŸ’‰
","Great Tv-series with all the blood and revenge you will get, and even more. Dexter, a blood-splatter analysis at the police is a cold blooded, sociopathic serialkiller who kills in the darkest nights, but only the ones that deserves it! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡²",/review/rw6834440/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2022,jjlawler-98324,10," Top 10 series of all time
",Have watched the series through 3 times. Still a thrill ride. Each season keeps the audience engaged with audacious storylines. The finale one of the best. Sets up another gift of the new Dexter series 10 years later.,/review/rw6834440/?ref_=tt_urv
28 September 2022,IPyaarCinema,8," Must Watch
","This is really more a summation of the all 8 seasons. Dexter is compelling, no doubt about it. I really liked some of the characterizations (if choppy at first). Dexter is an interesting character, but, while making a sympathetic serial killer is an impressive feat, the show always kind of wobbled between dark and light, and I wasn't always rooting for him. The show kind of slipped in to a rhythm of finding a really messed up person who could bond with Dexter on a dark level, and then it all goes wrong, and Dexter has to kill the person. Actually, at least in the last couple of seasons, I was way more impressed by the Debra character, who suffers an almost Shakespearian tragic arc, which is almost inevitable given the show's premise. Debra was masterfully done, and I could almost palpably feel her pain.",/review/rw6834440/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2021,UniqueParticle,10," One of the best series ever!
","Micheal C. Hall is mesmerizing brilliance throughout, interesting how he went from Six Feet Under on to this. The music is one of the best things I've ever heard it gets me excited! I've seen the series a few times before I'm even one of very few that likes the ending. Such great writing that is easy to crave for more even though a lot of it is morbid Dexter is so well made; I'm jittery that there is gonna be more.",/review/rw6834440/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2020,kundanbbisht,9," Totally worth to watch each and every episodes
","Despite being so many seasons, no one gonna feel bored or detached.
Impressive and outstanding series.",/review/rw6834440/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2022,camels-55854,10," Re-watching for Halloween Season
","Decided to re watch Dexter for this Halloween Season. It's truly addictive; however, I had forgotten how much I hated.the girlfriend Rita's character. She played a really good insensitive witch while perpetuating a sensitive facade to others in the series. Perhaps the writers intended for me to loathe her; perhaps not. You judge. Some episodes are brilliant and some, so so. After it became immediately popular, some of the stars that decided to join in on the dark fun, I loved, so be on the lookout for them. I won't spoil the surprises. This series is not for the faint of heart w. Explicit sex and serial killer actions.",/review/rw6834440/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2022,cbentrott,8," First few seasons are gold
","I watched this in 2021, and it was still a fantastic show, even with all the TV that is out today. It has compelling storylines and dark characters that keep you coming back episode after episode. There are several twists that are unpredictable. The first four seasons were fantastic, and after that, it definitely slipped in quality. Some of the guest stars, particularly the villains, are great actors and fit into the cast seamlessly. Michael C. Hall is perfectly strange and feels at home in this role. His sister is a bit less of a classic actress, but her personality grew on me, and she's a crowd favorite. Overall, a memorable show.",/review/rw6834440/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2006,emvan,9," The Best Show on TV
","After four episodes, I'm ready to proclaim this the best show currently on TV, one that may someday rank with the likes of _The Sopranos_ and the first season of _Twin Peaks_ as a contender for the second best TV show ever (after the incomparable _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_; one of the show's producers and writers is former Buffy writer Drew Z. Greenberg, and the cast includes Buffy / Angel mainstay Julie Benz).",/review/rw6834440/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2022,gEn3tic,10," my fav show of all time !!!
","This is my fav show till now, no doubt. This is because inspite of so many eps and seasons it has never let me down. I was always so excited to watch the next ep. There may be some seasons better than others but none was bad. If you havent seen this show, do it asap if you like crime and mystery genres. It definitely left a void when i finished it. And the main char is also so effing cool.",/review/rw6834440/?ref_=tt_urv

25 August 2022,HBO-,9," one of the best shows i have ever seen
","Not even the ending can spoil this series for me michael was impeccable as dexter, the cast has a lot of chemistry, the cinematography is great the writing and plot are sharp and very well constructed.",/review/rw6834440/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2021,said_kurollo,9," Perfect serie with worst ending !!!
","I think this serie is one of the best series ever. I mean the acting / drama / dexter's life. Everything is perfect. Except for the last season. They ruined the whole thing.
But that doesn't mean that you don't have to watch the serie ! It absolutely worth.",/review/rw6834440/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have watch this series twice and will watch it again. One of the best tv. shows ever. The cast is amazing
Michael C. Hall is excellent. I would like to see him in more shows and films. You will enjoy Dexter just watch it. A great Dark film starring Michael c. hall is cold in july check this film out as well.",/review/rw6834440/?ref_=tt_urv

30 August 2020,Fella_shibby,9," Like the ethereal guitar music, the show, the characters, the camaraderie between the siblings n the surrealistic n poignant finale episode will stay on ur mind.
","Been on my radar for more than a decade. Jus finished watching all the 96 episodes in 30 days on Amazon Prime.
It ain't a record but the addiction with the character Dexter made it possible for me n the other factor is the lockdown.",/review/rw6834440/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2006,msperling,10," A Bloody Masterpiece!
","Dexter will never disappoint. Each and every episode is a work of art, and it never gets boring or old. To start, we have excellent deliveries from Michael C. Hall as the serial killer (yet a like-able one) known as Dexter Morgan. Add ""The Excorcism Of Emily Rose"" star Jennifer Carpenter, who plays Dexter's sometimes moody sister, Deb.",/review/rw6834440/?ref_=tt_urv
10 May 2021,RJBrez,10," Let's hope the revival gives this series the ending it deserves.
","Dexter fans are well aware of the atrocities that season 8 committed. How could a show that was so brilliant for years end so terribly? Well, in the midst of an awful 2020 we did get some great news. Dexter was coming back! Maybe it's only a limited run, maybe there will be more. All I care about it the fact that they have a chance to correct their mistakes.",/review/rw6834440/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2006,infiniter-1,10," A wonderful new look at the crime drama.
","I read Lindsay's excellent books - Darkly Dreaming Dexter and Dearly Devoted Dexter - some time ago, and when I heard that there was to be a series based on the books, I was extremely excited. So much so, in fact, that I feared disappointment merely because my standards were so high.",/review/rw6834440/?ref_=tt_urv

21 April 2021,DaTruth510,10," 3rd time watching whole series
",I love this show! Didn't think i would be going through it a 3rd time but since season 9 is coming soon i thought i would. So far im on season 4 and i have to say DAMN Jennifer Carpeneter character can be so annoying. The smallest thing can give her a brwakdown at any moment and that gets a bit annoying pretty fast. Rita is more annoying than Deb. Show is still my second favorite show ever coming after Game of Thrones. Which ive also watched 3 times.,/review/rw6834440/?ref_=tt_urv
