26 May 2021,ThomDerd,7," It's not The Raid. But it's good enough.
",It's definitely a good martial arts/ action film but not as good as the 2 Raid films which are kind of similar style to this one.,/review/rw4408972/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2018,Leofwine_draca,10," The Raid 3 in all but name!
","I was hugely disappointed when RAID director Gareth Evans revealed that THE RAID 3 was never going to happen, but I'm delighted to report that THE NIGHT COMES FOR US is the next best thing. It's another breakneck Indonesian action flick with a routine plot, good actors, and astonishing and lengthy action sequences. Joe Taslim - the SWAT team leader in THE RAID - plays the hero, a former assassin who leaves his old life but find it coming after him. Iko Uwais is unusually cast as the villain while Julie Estelle - THE RAID 2's Hammer Girl - appears as an assassin. This film boasts a series of incredibly violent martial arts fights that utilise all manner of props and weaponry in a bid to destroy and disable the human body in as many creative ways as possible. The fight choreography is crisp and clear, the actors obviously skilled at what they do, and the pulse-pounding mayhem never lets up; it's hard to pick a favourite fight when there are so many stand-out moments here. What I can say is that the bloodshed is incredibly explicit, making this by far the most gruesome action film I've ever watched. And I can't wait to see it again!",/review/rw4408972/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2018,BA_Harrison,9," Oh so violent.
","For those who thought that The Raid 1 & 2 were the last word in kinetic, ultra-brutal martial arts movies, think again: The Night Comes For Us, from director Timo Tjahjanto, is a strong contender for the most excessively violent, blood-drenched action flick ever made. The film's many fight scenes are wonderfully choreographed and flawlessly executed, Tjahanto's breath-taking direction employing shooting techniques that are guaranteed to astound, although it's the sheer quantity of blood and guts that really impresses.",/review/rw4408972/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2018,Fella_shibby,10," One of the best action film after The Raid Redemption. Brutal, gruesome, gritty, relentless action extravaganza.
","What an amazing action/horror film it is man.
Yes, u heard it rite. U can call it a horror film too. The amount of non stop kills, stabbings, brutal n insane violent scenes, the non stop splatter is far more than in any recent horror films.
Coming back to the action, the choreography of the fight scenes is top notch. It is a non stop action extravaganza for fans of the genre. There r too many brutal action scenes. The pool ball scene with the scalp attached to it may upset some viewers.
With Iko Uwais as the villain, Joe Taslim as the man seeking redemption, Julie Estelle as the badass femme fatale n Zack Lee as the strong n daring junkie, then u probably get a solid action film.
Hats off to Timo Tjahjanto (Macabre, segments from Vhs 2 n ABC's of death, Killers n Headshot).
Kill Bill, John Wick, Rambo n Expendables looks like kindergarten in front of this film.",/review/rw4408972/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2018,kamau-15267,10," One of the finest
","This will easily go down to the best Martial arts movie I've seen in the last 5 years or so. Iko Uwais and Co. did there parts perfectly. Am very thrilled of the ideal of brilliants of the choreography *madness*
This was truly a gem not only the action sequences spectacular, and I iterate spectacular but the story line and acting as well as screenplay was very tastefully done.",/review/rw4408972/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2018,AndreasHardcastle,5," Great gore, painful story/story telling, so and so martial arts
",My first thought when I saw this one released: New Iko Uwais movie? Must see!,/review/rw4408972/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2018,HotDoggyBoomBooM,6," martial art gorefest 10/10 with a bland character script.
","WATCH THIS MOVIE IT's WORTH FOR THE ACTION AND GORE
Yes when i heard the name iko uwais new movie is out on netflix i just jumped into it cause even though story is weak his actions his enough to steer through and i was kinda disappointed in this .not here to spoil the show but here's how it goes if you have seen these movies headshot (DIR & PRO made this flick) ,raid 1&2 you might have seen how quick and agile group of minion thugs wielding machete are ..but here they made it like some sort of horde waiting for the cast( not here to spoil) to make the next move and yeah to be killed eventually but here is the catch after 1 or 2 fighting scene you can see that they made these cast like meat shield absorbing more than 3 or 7 maybe even more death blows only to be killed by enemy boss Eventually sigh:(
it bugs me the most to say that it was like some martial art tournament game strong vs strong which we could forsee it already with a story so vague i cant expect more .
GORE PART: only word i can say is daaaaaaaaam and brutal junks of flesh flying & lying everywhere coupled with vicious martial arts and weaponry which is a huge + and a treat to watch if you love gore of course.",/review/rw4408972/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2018,lebronjamesisaloser,10," Makes John Wick look like child's play.
","I am going to keep this review nice and short.
If you don't mind over-the-top violence and appreciate action movies then this movie is, plainly put, the best action movie of all time. That's right, I said it.",/review/rw4408972/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2018,fluffset,9," Pity for the henchman

","You think you've seen it all? Action, blood, guts, brains, bullets, body parts, broken teeth, sliced fingers, chopped heads, smashed heads, broken skulls, broken bones, protruding bones, hmmm? Think you've seen it all? SMH ... you haven't... until you watch this film.",/review/rw4408972/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2018,ryansalamence,9," An insane bloodbath.
","I've been needing a good insane action movie fix for a while now, and this was definitely it. Once this movie ramps up, it never comes back down. Nonstop incredible action all the way through. This film is amazing at using its surroundings to its advantage. A fight scene in a butchers room? Every cleaver, slab of meat, meat hook, and bone becomes a weapon. Fight next to a pool table? Pool balls and pool sticks used in the most brutal way possible. The fight choreography is phenomenal and I was almost convinced they were just beating the piss out of the actors. This movie is such a brutal and fun time, a great movie to watch with a room full of energetic friends.",/review/rw4408972/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2018,paul_haakonsen,9," Watch it! Just watch it...
","Right, well if ""The Raid"" or ""The Raid: Redemption"" didn't put Indonesia on the worldmap of action movies, then ""The Night Comes For Us"" certainly will do so. This 2018 movie is definitely one to watch. I found it on Netflix and didn't hesitate for a moment to sit down and watch it.",/review/rw4408972/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2018,fachrial-ilham,5," Plot what plot
","This is my fifth Indonesian action movie. Unfortunately, all of them have one problem: no heart to the story. I can't relate to the characters, I don't care if they live or die, I don't even know their motivation.",/review/rw4408972/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2019,trashgang,10," xtreme gore and a lot of fighting
","Indonesia did it again, after the much acclaimed The Raid franchise this one goes even a step further. And by further I mean, it's not all about fighting this added extreme gore to it.",/review/rw4408972/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2018,Aswinning_11,5," Like playing a video game with cheat code
","So the scenario... meh nothing interesting... A world-class killer becomes friendly, is chased down by his former colleagues, fights an old friend... saves a little girl... Seen this before.
Barely any character development; the characters are a mixture of the Raid with Kill Bill. The acting's average. All the budget went for the thousands of fake blood and CGI that they used. Fights were too long, too bloody, too unreal, like literally 90% of the movie is blood, sweat, and more blood.",/review/rw4408972/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2018,dhoparu,4," Comparing this with Raid or Raid 2 is a an insult to those classics
",This can be a one time watch for people who like extremely violent movies with dollops of blood and gore. I enjoyed some of the action scenes but they seem to be choreographed and not raw like the Raid series. This does not come close to those 2 classics and comparing this would be an absolute insult. The movie is very uneven and does not make any sense.,/review/rw4408972/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2018,Gresh854,7," Who Needs The Raid 3?
","Yes, yes, I'll answer the question you'll have on your minds. And the answer is an affirmative, courteous AMEN cause the action in The Night Comes for Us is miraculous. This is A+, 10/10, The Raid level of action prowess. It's untoward however, that such an astonishing assemblage of top-notch combat spectacle was brewed with such an insipid and often, inattentive story. That's still not to say though, that I didn't thoroughly savor the heck out of a bulk of this movie's runtime.",/review/rw4408972/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2020,Top_Dawg_Critic,9," ""I wish there was more action, violence and gore"" said no one ever
","As one user stated, ""Makes John Wick look like child's play."" Wow is all I can say!

The best Indo action film I've seen. 9/10",/review/rw4408972/?ref_=tt_urv

1 January 2019,destroyerwod,6," Overdone in some aspects, underdone in others...
","I love martial arts movies and lets just put something clear, i am not against violence or blood/gore. I actually enjoy when movies don't shy away to show the violence and how brutal fights can be. But at some point, too much become almost cartoonish and this is the case with this movie.",/review/rw4408972/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2018,redrobin62-321-207311,8," Good Lord! Can Any Other Movie Be So Violent?
","Without a doubt, ""The Night Comes For Us"" sets a new standard in ultra-violence. The filmmakers probably had to take out a serious loan just to cover the gallons of squibs used in this production.",/review/rw4408972/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2018,wjosephjorob,8," No where to hide
","I just watched this gangster film and don't know how to describe what I watched, it was a very good tale of a criminal coming full circle with his past and an act of violence that will determine his future,being a fan of the current Indonesian gangland style movies, this one takes it way up a notch with the onslaught of violence , almost to the point getting fatigue after seeing so much death, there is no remorse or redemption, just trying to survive and somehow escape the madness of doom that surround the characters, the fight scenes are magnificent, it makes up for the lack of plot this film doesn't have, otherwise this is some next level gangster s&^t that has to be seen to be believed, fans of the Raid, forget part 3, this should satisfy you totally.",/review/rw4408972/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2018,zzzxxxcccvvv-43202,1," Absolute Garbage
","Some people might argue that martial art movies don't have to make logical sense, or have good acting, or a good story, or a good script, or good directing, but when you combine all these together and the fact this is a cheap knockoff of the Raid movies, well.... then you got a big problem. Normally, bad acting like this doesn't bother me but these characters are just so cartoony I mean this is stuff straight out of a Mortal Kombat fan film.",/review/rw4408972/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2018,fits-47019,6," I miss Gareth Evans
","Contrary to what you may have heard, sadly, this is NOT Raid 3, despite featuring most of the cast of that franchise. Therefore the inevitable comparisons only lead you to disappointment.
The Night Comes for Us has all the insanity of the first raid movie, but none of the cinematic feel or plot coherence of the second. Compared to every other action movie this year, this is firmly at the top, but compared to the mastery of Raid 2, this is quite a letdown.
You will still have a good time if you ignore the story and just focus on the action as I did (most of the fight scenes are topnotch) but in your heart and in the back of your mind, you will still be wishing Gareth Evans comes back to direct Raid 3.",/review/rw4408972/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2018,bakerstreet-862-612840,7," The ""Violence"" Comes for Us on Netflix
","The Night Comes For Us had always been in my movie watch list since it's been announced in 2014 after Mo Brothers released Killers. It planned to involve some of ""The Raid"" series veterans like Joe Taslim as the main character, Arifin Putra seemed to be the main antagonist, and Yayan Ruhian as an undisclosed role. The project was then somehow put to halt for some reasons and Mo Brothers went on another project which's Headshot (2016) and there's a plan of The Night Comes For Us being adapted into a graphic novel instead.
After the release of Headshot, it turned out only 1 of Mo Brothers, Time who's gonna continue and direct The Night Comes For Us and it seemed Iko Uwais & Sunny Pang're replacing Arifin & Yayan.",/review/rw4408972/?ref_=tt_urv
