20 July 2000,AKS-6,8," Brilliant comedy
","What a wonderful film! ""Blast from the Past"" is charming, sweet, and hilarious. Very funny. The premise is original and interesting, and I thought the film was engrossing and thoroughly entertaining -- I laughed out loud several times. Brendan Fraser is perfectly cast as the goofy, innocent Adam. Alicia Silverstone is better than she's ever been, I'm certainly no fan of her, but she did a more than okay job in this film. But the really ingenious casting decision was to give the roles of Adam's parents to Sissy Spacek and the always brilliant Christopher Walken -- I dare say that the casting of Spacek and Walken in this film is the _opposite_ of type casting, :-).",/review/rw1169262/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2008,Chrysanthepop,," 60's dude meets 90's chick in this fun film
","'Blast From the Past' is a funny little romcom. It's very enjoyable as long as one does not expect anything serious. The plot does follow the romcom cliché where dude tries to woo dudette but here the dude was raised all his 35 years in an underground shelter, away from the outer world and that just makes the story funnier. Wilson maintains to sustain the movie's lightness as the screenplay is consistent. Silverstone and Fraser make an odd but fun romantic couple. There's the sweet chemistry. Fraser plays his awkward goofy naive persona that we've seen in a few other films but he still manages to be funny and likable and Silverstone is pretty and charming as she ends up delivering a decent performance. Pity we don't see her much these days. Spacek and Walken are cast against type and I have got to say that they provide some of the laugh out loud moments without going over the top. Of course they play Fraser's parents who have been living underground for the last 35 years. What I also liked about 'Blast From the Past' is that its comedy does not rely on crude humour (unlike most American comedies today). The film does have its downside as I felt it was moving a little slow in the beginning but the fun that I had from watching it made that a minor flaw.",/review/rw1169262/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2000,=G=,8," If there was an Oscar for ""best little comedy""...
","...""Blast"" would have likely won. It boasts excellence in all aspects of the film from story to casting to acting to sets to costumes, music, etc. This tight, creative, unpretentious, and lightly romantic comedy romp between a hip ""new millennium"" chick and an old fashioned stuck-in-a-fallout-shelter-for-35-years guy is a breath of fresh Hollywood air deserving of it's critical acclaim.",/review/rw1169262/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's 1962 when we first set eyes on Calvin and Helen Webber. They are having a party for some of their friends. Calvin, a genius scientist from CalTec, is a man that has been preparing for bad times. When the president of the United States, J.F.Kennedy takes to the airwaves to announce an impending clash with the Soviet Union over the missiles in Cuba, Calvin figures this is it! He decides to end the party and he and Helen go to their well prepared and stocked bomb shelter. Little does he know, but the falling of a military jet in the area triggers the lock system and before they realize it, they are trapped in his own invention.",/review/rw1169262/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2004,movieguy1021,7," Blast from the Past: 7/10
","There surely is a lack of originality in movies now. Romantic comedies always seem to have the girl outwit the guy, the guy persisting, and then they finally get together. That's exactly the case in Blast from the Past, except that the guy has been living in a bomb shelter for all of his life. It's a joke that could work for a five minute sketch, or it might just flop overall, but that's not the case here. It's a simple romantic comedy with a huge twist thrown in, which works to the movie's advantage.",/review/rw1169262/?ref_=tt_urv
28 March 2004,MichaelOates,," Blast of fresh air
","Brendan Fraser and Alicia Silverstone are on screen gems in their aptly named characters Adam and Eve.

30 March 2012,pachl,10," The epitome of what Hollywood does better than anyone
","Five and a half years ago I moved from Chicago to Europe. Europeans have a different taste in movies. To be blunt, they have a BS Meter that reads off the chart. When something doesn't ring true, when it's contrived and phony, they react harshly.",/review/rw1169262/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2004,Smells_Like_Cheese,7," It's a cute movie
","That's pretty much it. ""Blast from the Past"" has a decent amount of laughs and fun. Brandon and Alicia are adorable together. And the story is very original and interesting. Adam is a boy who grew up in a bomb shelter with his parents, who fear that a nuclear bomb struck from the cold war. For 35 years they raise Adam to be a perfect gentleman. When he wants to meet a lady and the parents need more suplies for the shelter, they send him up to face the world of the 90's. He meets a girl, Eve. She seems cold at first, but they both fall for each other.",/review/rw1169262/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2005,philip_vanderveken,7," It certainly is one of the more original romantic comedies
","It has never happened, but during the Cold War many people feared that they would be the victim of a nuclear war between the West and the USSR. A lot of those people had visions of living in an atomic shelter for the next three to four decades, perhaps even longer and not being able to see the daylight ever again. Well, it may never have happened, but this romantic comedy shows us what it must be like.",/review/rw1169262/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2016,Uriah43,8," Extremely Hilarious!
","This movie begins with a nutty scientist named ""Calvin"" (Christopher Walken) who is convinced that the Soviets are about to launch a surprise nuclear attack on the United States. So in order to prepare for it he abandons his academic work at Cal Tech and secretly builds a fallout shelter in his own back yard. Then, during the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis, he and his pregnant wife, ""Helen"" (Sissy Spacek), relocate into it as a precaution. As luck would have it, a jet just so happens to run out of fuel and subsequently crashes right above them. This causes Calvin to believe a nuclear strike has occurred and because of that he locks himself and Helen into the fallout shelter for a period of about 35 years. And then he opens the doors... Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, despite some obvious weaknesses here and there, I found this movie to be extremely hilarious! Not only does Christopher Walken perform in an exceptionally superb manner but I also liked the acting of Brandon Frasier (as ""Adam"") along with David Foley (""Troy"") and the ""Arch Bishop"" (Joey Slotnick). Likewise, the presence of Alicia Silverstone (as ""Eve"") certainly didn't hurt. In any case, I liked this movie and I recommend it to anyone looking for a first-rate comedy of this type. Definitely above average.",/review/rw1169262/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2007,lee_eisenberg,9," the Cuban Missile Crisis has always made for some great stories
","When ""Blast from the Past"" came out, it looked kind of silly, especially since Brendan Fraser had just played a very good role in ""Gods and Monsters"". It turns out that this is a very well done movie. In this case, a scientist (Christopher Walken) and his wife (Sissy Spacek) move into their fallout shelter during the Cuban Missile Crisis and lock themselves in for 35 years when they think that a bomb has fallen. So, when their son is born in there, they continue raising him as though it's still 1962.",/review/rw1169262/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2008,zardoz-13,8," What a ""Blast!""
","Not only have ""The First Wives Club"" film director Hugh Wilson and freshman scenarist Bill Kelly injected new life into a timeworn tale of initiation (it's about a young man's rites of passage into an evil, corrupt, decadent urban society), but they have also tweaked the formula in several refreshing ways. Happily, ""Blast from the Past"" refrains from portraying its gullible, time-warped protagonist as the butt of every prankster's joke. Although he played the same role in ""Encino Man,"" Brendan Fraser of ""George of the Jungle"" and ""Airheads"" manages to imbue this farcical but sympathetic naïf with an individuality that makes his character memorable. Co-starring Alicia ""Clueless"" Silverstone, ""Blast from the Past"" emerges as an offbeat but uneven romantic comedy about an improbable courtship between Eve Rostokov, a streetwise California gal, and Adam, a naïve 35-year old guy who has spent his entire life in a fall-out shelter. Fearing the prospect of a nuclear holocaust during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, Calvin Webber (Christopher Walken of ""The Anderson Tapes"") and his wife Helen (Sissy Spacek of ""Coal Miner's Daughter"") seal themselves up in an elaborate, subterranean bomb shelter in their backyard and wait for the radioactive contamination to wear off. Thirty-five years elapse before the Webbers dispatch their intelligent but immature son out to procure supplies and a wife who doesn't glow in the dark.",/review/rw1169262/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2000,helpless_dancer,8," Gives a whole new meaning to time capsules
","I thought this was a very funny comedy. The sets used were very realistic, looked just like some of the furniture we used to own back then. The acting was right on target, the dialogue was interesting and amusing, and the story was well done. Made me wonder if this could happen, only not on such a large or lengthy scale. 3 stars.",/review/rw1169262/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2013,jjnxn-1,10," An absolute charmer
","The premise is absurd but the picture is played with such charming whimsy that it pulls you right along. Brendan Fraser uses his size and somewhat goofy personality to make Adam believable as a big overgrown child in a man's body. He and Alicia Silverstone have a nice vibe with her worldliness playing well off his innocence. As his parents who spend the majority of the movie in a bomb shelter Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek are simply swell, an utterly adorable couple who react very differently to their confinement but are a joy whenever they are on screen. A sweet, breezy film with the underlying message to respect each other and enjoy the world around you.",/review/rw1169262/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2002,SMLA11,10," Great comedy/romance
",Brendan Fraser and Alicia Silverstone make a great couple in this hilarious romance.  Brendan Fraser does good as playing a guy who never seen the light of day for 35 years.  Alicia Silverstone is good as Fraser's love interest and she was very cool.  Sissy Spasek and Christopher Walken are good as Fraser's parents and I enjoyed their presence.  dave Foley is good for when he's there.,/review/rw1169262/?ref_=tt_urv

18 February 2012,sddavis63,8," Just A Simple, Nice Movie To Watch
","If you're looking for a nice, pleasant, funny and fun movie, you need look no further than ""Blast From The Past."" No, it's not a masterpiece, but all the adjectives above describe it perfectly, which means that it's thoroughly enjoyable to watch. The movie begins in 1962, with a party at the home of an eccentric scientist and his pregnant wife (Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek). It happens to be the night when President Kennedy goes on television to begin the Cuban Missile Crisis. Convinced that there's about to be a nuclear holocaust, the two enter a massive fallout shelter they've built under their house, which automatically locks them in for 35 years, at which time the world is supposed to be safe to re-enter. Shortly after they enter, their son Adam is born and is raised in the isolation of the shelter, totally cut off from the world and all its changes, untainted by the changing city above them. After 35 years, Adam (the son, played now by Brendan Fraser) is sent above for supplies, and hopefully to find a nice girl to marry.",/review/rw1169262/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2004,amarkey,," Relax and enjoy a trip to the past!
","Need an escape?  Here's your ticket!  This is a delightful movie depicting life in the past and the shock one can get when fast forwarding to the future.  There's something about gong back in time!  For those of us who lived thru the 60s as teens, it's a reminder of a more innocent time. Seeing the past come alive in the form of music, baseball cards and even the furniture makes you feel like a window has been opened and you're actually watching family life in the early 60s.  Watching the reactions of a full grown man who has been in a fallout shelter with his parents, now coming above ground for the first time is hilarious!  Seeing him search for a ""non-mutant"" girl friend while he learns all about life above ground, is just as funny.  You have two choices.  You can watch the movie as a critic and look for things that you think ""don't work"" in the movie.....or, you can relax and enjoy the trip, the jokes, the characters and the trip back to the present!  That's what I do, every chance I have to see this ""Blast From The Past.""",/review/rw1169262/?ref_=tt_urv

","When my sister brought home the movie 'Blast From the Past' from the video store, I can tell you, I was not pleased. It looked really sappy and I'm not a big fan of Alicia Silverstone. During the opening credits I was surprised to see such a great cast; Dave Foley, Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek. It was one of the funniest movies I've seen. I went out and bought it after we returned it. Too many good parts to describe. As you can tell from my screen name, I have a bit of a 'thing' for Dave Foley, and I was not disappointed with this movie at all. A guaranteed laugh out loud.
