11 March 2013,blanche-2,6," not a very good film version of a good musical
","The movie version of the musical ""Nine"" (based on Fellini's 8-1/2) was released in 2009 with a wonderful cast that included Daniel Day-Lewis as Guido, Marion Cotillard as his wife Luisa, Penelope Cruz as his mistress Carla, Kate Hudson as a reporter, Judy Dench as his costumer, Nicole Kidman as his muse Claudia, Fergie as a woman on the beach, and Sophia Loren as his mother.",/review/rw2245816/?ref_=tt_urv

","Let me say off the bat that seeing Sophia Loren and Sophia Loren singing gave me a chill. That is quite a bit to get from a film. Chills. I knew I had to forget this was a musical adaptation of 81/2, but I couldn't forget the way I forgot that ""Sweet Charity"" was a musical remake of ""The Nights Of Cabiria"". Here the score is iffy and scarce and the story, translated into musical numbers is kind of shallow and, quite honestly, not enough. There are, however, moments to enjoy. The look of it is great, and Marion Cotillard makes something enormous from the little she was given. Penelope Cruz dances an erotic dance and Kate Hudson, well I don't quite know what she was doing. Nicole Kidman is starting to look like a wax work, what a pity! And Judi Dench is always fun. I was reminded she was a sublime Sally Bowles in the first London production of ""Cabaret"" - Daniel Day Lewis has been one of my favourites for a long time now but here he is far too pale, inside and out. I want to repeat that the whole thing is worth it just to have a glimpse of Sophia Loren singing. So, 6.",/review/rw2245816/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2009,Matt_Layden,6," I Wanted To Like This Film More Than I Did.
","Guido Contini, a famous Italian director, is struggling with his next big film. He has no script and no inspiration, but everyone is counting on him. He tries to juggle both his new film, his wife, his mistress, his producer and his muse. Oh yeah, he also talks to his dead mother. ",/review/rw2245816/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2010,moviemanMA,6," Chicago style doesn't work for Italian style
","I was surprised when Rob Marshall's Chicago took home the Oscar for Best Picture. A great movie but not my choice for best of 2002 (that I would award to Gangs of New York). All that aside, Marshall hasn't done much since. Only one movie, Memoirs of a Geisha, which I for some reason have neglected to see (I try to watch films that win for best cinematography). That's all beside the point. In his third film, Marshall goes back to his theatre roots and tackles another musical.",/review/rw2245816/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2010,3xHCCH,6," Fine Musical Numbers Tied Together by a Very Thin String
","The song numbers of ""Nine"" are really very well-staged with all those fantastic actresses in this Oscar-winning stellar cast. ""A Call from the Vatican"" by Penelope Cruz is very sexy and playful. ""Folies Bergere"" by Judi Dench is nothing like what you have seen her do before. ""Be Italian"" by Fergie is very sensual with unique choreography, and for me the best number of the whole film. ""Cinema Italiano"" by Kate Hudson is decidedly faster-paced and modern with lyrics that are meaningful to the story, but her character seemed forced into the sequence. ""Guarda la Luna"" by Sophia Loren is ethereal. ""Unusual Way"" by Nicole Kidman showcased her beautiful face more than her voice. Marion Cotillard had two numbers ""My Husband Makes Movies"" and ""Take It All,"" both of which fully showcase her sensitive acting chops.",/review/rw2245816/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2010,Buddy-51,8," Much better than advertised
","""Nine"" has taken the same circuitous route to the big screen as ""The Producers"" did a few years back. First, it started out life as a beloved movie - in this case, Fellini's classic 1963 ""8 ½"" - then got itself reincarnated in the form of a Broadway musical (undergoing a name change in the process); finally it got adapted back into a movie by the trusty hands of Hollywood, much to the consternation, apparently, of most of the nation's film critics.",/review/rw2245816/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2013,leplatypus,1," Not nine, just zero (web)
","This is one of the finest jewels in Hollywood crap crown! So much famous names, so much budget to shoot a stinker like this, it's amazing! There's absolutely no story as it's about a lousy director seeking inspiration! The music, songs are just horrible! The musical is poor as they kept using this dark roman arena and the dancing is just at the level of music videos now: lascivious girls jiggling. And for the cast, they found the exquisite idea to have them speak English but with a loud Italian accent, just to tell the movie happens in Italy ! Day-Lewis must be very shameful of his participation as he looks his feet, bent behind shades all the time. Fortunately, Penélope is here and brings the only good moments: she is truly the only one to show that's she's a fine dancer and a true actress...",/review/rw2245816/?ref_=tt_urv

","What do I know about musicals? From my limited experience of musicals, (""Singing in the Rain,"" ""Guys and Dolls,"" ""The Blues Brothers"" {yes, it is considered a musical comedy} and ""Legally Blonde the Musical"") here is the basic linear format as I see they are written in — opening dialogue, singing, more dialogue, more singing, even more dialogue and then a grand finale. Then for a week after that, you have the songs stuck in your head. Director Rob Marshall chose not to follow the old standby format through to the end. His actions placed ""Nine"" in a different category from the standard musical.",/review/rw2245816/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2010,iheart_ny,5," The best music film of 2009!
","Today, I went to see Rob Marshall's new musical, Nine, obviously based upon the Broadway musical of the same name, that based off Fellini's 8 1/2. It should be mentioned that the movie contains not quite as many songs as the stage performance does, but, each actress in the wonderful cast having one song, and the way the songs are presented, it certainly works.

","When I first heard the announcements for Golden Globe nominations, they announced a film called ""Nine"". I thought to myself, 'wow, Tim Burton's has done it again...', then they announced the cast, 'Daniel Day Lewis, Nicole Kidman, Fergie...' and I thought...""They were not in that movie, nor did the do the voices for it"".

9 December 2009,alexart-1,10," Bellissimo!
","Let's just start by saying this: Nine is one of the best of 2009. Not to be confused with District 9 and 9, Rob Marshall does a splendid job bringing the Broadway musical of the same title to the screen. The whole main cast is great at acting as well as singing. The movie is also an adaptation of Federico Fellini's 8 1/2 and it's a nice homage to that as well.",/review/rw2245816/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2009,doubleosix,7," Another excellent adaptation from Rob Marshall
","The film is beautiful, visually stunning, and exciting, and the cast is remarkable, especially Penelope Cruz (no surprise there), Marion Cotillard (her singing is wonderful), and the gal who blows the doors off -- an unrecognizable (to me, anyhow) Fergie! I was watching the credits to see who the hell played Saraghina, and was stunned to learn it was Stacy Ferguson. Go Fergie! Judi Dench is a smash as well. Nicole Kidman doesn't reveal anything we haven't seen before, but she does bring the large dollop of Movie Star shine for which her role calls. Even Kate Hudson pleases; her 60's go-go dance will inevitably bring comparisons to her mother's ""Laugh In"" heyday.",/review/rw2245816/?ref_=tt_urv

","In one of the most anticipated films of the Oscar season, Rob Marshall directs the adaptation of the Broadway musical, Nine. The film stars a studded-cast of A-list celebrities including Academy Award Winners Daniel Day-Lewis, Marion Cotillard, Penelope Cruz, Judi Dench, Nicole Kidman, Sophia Loren, Oscar Nominee Kate Hudson, and Stacy Ferguson a.k.a. Fergie. What the film is proud of is ultimately its failure. ",/review/rw2245816/?ref_=tt_urv
8 December 2009,andrewcappelletti,1," Tedious, and painful
","Lots of money spent giving incredibly beautiful visuals with some extraordinary performances by a stellar cast, in this monotonous dull and lifeless movie. What a shame. The cast obviously poured their hearts out, and worked their asses off. The production design and cinematography are award worthy. The directing is absolutely horrendous. Atrocious. Horrible. Hey Rob, where you put the camera is really important. I couldn't see inside any of these characters! I never felt sympathetic, empathetic, or even slightly connected to any of these characters. Sad, cause the actors brought it. The movie never showed it to the audience. When Guido (Daniel Day-Lewis) kneels at his Mother's (Sophia Loren) feet and admits his faults, we see his hair back-lit. I will bet had the camera actually looked into his eyes we might have had something there. One hour and forty five minutes into the movie, the conflict with the wife happened. Finally some real drama. Had that been the first scene I might have decided to care about this man's journey. Kate Hudson's number was the highlight of the film, although completely disconnected from the story. But then again, everything is disconnected. And there really is no story. And making a film with an Italian sensibility in the English language is probably an impossibility. Remember when they dubbed ""La Vita e Bella"" into English? That, like Fellini's work was beautiful in Italian. It sucked in English. I say, leave the making of Italian films to Italian filmmakers. Uhhhgggg. Thanks for the free screening, But I sincerely wish I could have those two hours back.",/review/rw2245816/?ref_=tt_urv

","I for one didn't see Rob Marshall's 2002 best picture winner ""Chicago"" as really musicals have never been my cup of tea. Yet when this similar creation of ""Nine"" was released I gave it a watch mainly the interest was due to the star power and the sexy female cast it employed. And I must say I wasn't disappointed as the film was entertaining and a stylish joy of tease and sex appeal, and true many knock ""Nine"" for having to much glitz and splash over substance which is true. I still found the work to have connection and emotional meaning as it's themes of a man battling alcohol and women problems while he struggles to make a film interesting and soul searching.",/review/rw2245816/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2010,Michael Fargo,10," Inventing the Devil's Playground
","There's a deep vein of guilt and shame at the core of ""Nine,"" Rob Marshall's adaptation of a musical of a famous Federico Fellini movie. First, this bears no resemblance to the Fellini film, other than the barest of plot outlines. I can't compare it to the Broadway version, since I didn't see that. But it was a very pleasant surprise for me to see this film after some serious misgivings based on what Marshall did with ""Chicago."" Casting non-dancers in a piece that was nothing BUT a showcase for dancers made it excruciating to watch. The bad reviews for ""Nine"" only added to my misgivings, but working on the principle that the people who knocked ""Nine"" were the same ones who praised ""Chicago,"" I bought a ticket.",/review/rw2245816/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have to declare that Fellini 8 1/2 is first on my list of favorite films so it is rather obvious that, as far as I'm concerned, any one that tries to mess with it will be received with a huge amount of resistance. On the other hand I have been perversely attracted to the musical version from its initial opening on Broadway years ago. Nine, both on Broadway and unfortunately of the new film, clearly show that today's culture has exhausted its own creativity and simply lost any shame in accepting the lack of an original idea.

14 February 2010,DICK STEEL,8," A Nutshell Review: Nine
","I wonder why so little love was given to this film, given its bad critical reception toward what I felt was an enjoyable musical with film-making as a backdrop, based on the Broadway equivalent which was in turn inspired by the story of Federico Fellini's semi-autobiographical film 8 ½. Adapted for the screen by Michael Tolkin and the late Anthony Minghella, Nine the film version is lavishly produced with a mix of film and stage elements thrown in to straddle the thin line between reality, fantasy and memory in which the protagonist, fictional Italian film-making maestro Guido Cortini (Daniel Day-Lewis) experiences at the cusp of his next film production.

10 December 2010,hall895,5," Where is the fun?
","The best movie musicals are a lot of fun. There are big, brassy songs. There's lots of joy, spectacle and razzle-dazzle. Then there's Nine. Not much in the way of razzle-dazzle here sad to say. If director Rob Marshall got it mostly right with Chicago here he's gotten it almost entirely wrong. He has an interesting enough story to work with but the success or failure of the movie was always going to come down to the songs. And if there is one word which can sum up the songs on offer here that word would be forgettable. Nothing that sticks with you, that leaves you humming a tune long after the movie has ended. The whole thing has a very blah feel to it and blah is not what you're looking for in a musical.",/review/rw2245816/?ref_=tt_urv
