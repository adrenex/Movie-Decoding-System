4 September 2003,McGonigle,," Surprisingly good
","When my girlfriend told me she was going to start watching this show, I figured it would give me 60 minutes a week to myself. But when I actually watched part of the first or second episode, I was surprised to find myself starting to get drawn in. ",/review/rw0918977/?ref_=tt_urv

",This might sound silly but i'm not lying or being exaggerating - this tv show changed my life. It gave me a good feeling for the rest of my life. I could watch this show many times all over and all over again without getting bored or tired. ,/review/rw0918977/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2017,tapio_hietamaki,8," A phenomenon of its time period
","When 'The O.C.' aired, it was a phenomenon. I can only imagine what the craze was like in America, but here in Finland it aired when I was in high school and the teachers would talk about it in class. Everybody watched 'The O.C.' and it's no wonder why.",/review/rw0918977/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2004,dark_elf02,," Great characters make a great show
","Have we seen this plot before? yes we have albeit not in a place this great looking and thats part of the charm of this fantastically addictive series. So many shows like this take place in a normal setting. This one defies the rules and showcases it in a very rich, very snobby like area full of interesting people. ",/review/rw0918977/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2018,dannijohnson,10," No other teen show compares!
","I have so much love for this show! I started watching it about a year after it came out and have re-watched it probably once a year since. No other teen show has been able to do what the OC does. Not only does it follow the drama that unfolds in the lives of a group of teenagers but, it shows that people from different backgrounds can come together and forge unbreakable bonds. The friendship between ryan and seth is one of my favourite things to watch unfold. Alot of the time teen dramas focus on the relationships between female best friends so, its really refreshing that in this instance the main relationship was two guy mates. The support and love that they showed to each other was heart warming. 
Kirsten and Sandy cohen.......urgh! I just love them! Their relationship to the outside world looks perfect but when you delve deeper into the show you see that they too have their fair share of problems. But no matter what they always work together to get through those bad times. I think thats a very vital thing to portray to the youth of today as, most people struggle to understand that a relationship takes alot of work, trying and understanding. We're only shown these perfect couples leading perfect lives and, this relationship was genuine. 
My only negative about this whole show is that there just aren't enough seasons! I would loved to of had another couple of seasons because this is my all time favourite show from my teenage years.",/review/rw0918977/?ref_=tt_urv

5 April 2020,alie-hunter,9," A Great Teen Show with Legitimate Adults
","The scenery, clothes, and music transport back to simpler times of my youth. While most of the storylines revolve around the ""core four"", the writers did a great job of also writing quality material for the adults. Compared to other parents on teen dramas, Sandy and Kirsten are extremely involved in their kids' lives and hold them accountable for mistakes. They also gave the adults heavy storylines. Try watching Kirsten spiral into alcoholism and not cry. One of the most well-written characters on the show is Julie Cooper and she started off as a guest-role. That said, there were some pit-falls over the course of the 4 seasons. One of those being the Marissa/Alex and DJ/Marissa arcs. Both were just opportunities for Marissa to off Julie. The show was filled with many classic scenes, most occurring in the Cohen's kitchen, which makes the Cohen family one to root for... ""Yoga-lates"". The series is a great ""Quarantine and Chill"" watch if you can get your hands on a copy.",/review/rw0918977/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2021,donadey1990,9," Still feels real
","Having watched this entire series twice. Once when it aired back in 2003 and now in 2021, I can honestly say that they don't make shows like this anymore. The plot line is simple and at times predictable with high volumes of unnecessary drama. But it has a deep honestly rooted in realism. The characters and plot line actually feels real. This is one of those teen drama's that even after almost 20 years feels fresh.",/review/rw0918977/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2004,andibabyx,," OK, so they may be tanned, pretty and skinny, but hey, there's sarcasm!
","OK this show is without a doubt hilarious. The user who said it was boring, i can simply not fathom. Okay, so the storyline may be a little bit of a cliché, a kid from the wrong side of the tracks, posh galas every week and people who are too pretty to exist in the real world. But isn't that what T.V is? An escape from the real world? This is the only show the me and my family actually agree on. Why? Because the story lines, although they may seem obvious, are interweaving. (E.G Caleb is kirsten's dad, who is marrying Julie Cooper, the ex-wife of Jimmy Cooper, who was kirsten's high school sweetheart.-OK, when i put it like that it sounds like a sunset beach episode.*shudder-twitch*)",/review/rw0918977/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2005,dashfashion,," Why do people think this is ""unrealistic""?
","I come from a part of Australia called the Sunshine Coast where most people come to escape city life and live by the sea. Most of the people who live along the coastlines here are just as beautiful-looking in that sun-drenched, California way, but not only that: this is a place where people come to avoid their problems, only to end up taking them with them. For all the glitz, glamour and romance of this place, I have never come across a more dysfunctional group of self-absorbed people in my life.",/review/rw0918977/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2017,supermaggie,10," This is how it is done - A plus, an example for everybody
","The O.C.-one of the best shows ever and forever, and that's why: not only is it an encouraging, positive show that lifts you up when you need to watch something to forget the world and its cruelty, it does so without being destructive/not at the cost of other people/values. There is no clumsy, obvious affirmative action (which is always reverse racism underneath), there is no bashing of Europeans/non-Americans for the sake of a nasty political agenda/clumsy propaganda, there is no twisting of historical facts (especially European ones), no turning European legends into villains and so on. And yet, it is a thrilling, entertaining, sometimes thought-provoking show – yes, it can be done, and it can be done successfully and artfully. True, there have been shows about teenagers in rich neighborhoods before, true, there have been shows about unlike couplings/brothers. There have been shows about noble criminals and teenage romance. But this show unites it all in a unique and charming way, and adds a lot of heart and soul and smartness. This is not just a dumb teen/romance/hypocritical family show, these are beautifully written, round (and perfectly cast) characters with heart and wits – entertaining and educating at the same time (without being overly didactic). This is the show I would recommend to parents to show their kids in order to show them how to behave in the world. A truly uplifting, funny and also instructive show – for viewers and writers alike, this is how it is done, you can entertain/be entertained without violence and xenophobia. A plus!!",/review/rw0918977/?ref_=tt_urv

8 December 2018,Kirpianuscus,," a good choice
","It is one of my favorit series. For the story and for Peter Gallagher and Adam Brody, for atmosphere, love affaires, tension and smart use of the rules of drama. A film about generations, love and friendship. About opportunities and about the way to define them more than use them. Fights and alliances and confessions. And the way for define the meanings of ordinaries lives.",/review/rw0918977/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2015,RavenGlamDVDCollector,9," Mischa, Mischa, Mischa
","First off, to state something quite clearly, I disagree with the legions out there who criticize Mischa Barton as Marissa Cooper. Look, I have studied this show, especially her performance. I have scrutinized her every move. The girl is poetry in motion. I think ""the actress has a difficult streak"" but that is her personal life, I am talking Marissa Cooper here, and she did great! It is grossly unfair to discriminate against her because or your own petty jealousies, people. I think she gave Marissa more than just a dash of Mischa and it worked. Marissa comes across as ""not exactly thrilled with this world"", somewhat aloof, and that's the Mischa Barton trademark and that's what many of you can't take. Look at her performance again and you'll see how much she gave the character.",/review/rw0918977/?ref_=tt_urv
26 October 2003,BluRaf185,," A nice surprise
","I watched the pilot episode of ""The O.C."" when it first ran because I was sick of watching reruns of ""Friends"" and ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" (even though I love those shows) and I wanted to watch something fresh and new. I expected to be sitting through an hour of a cheesy, sudsy soap opera with a really hot guy (Benjamin McKenzie) and in truth, I did. However, I surprised myself by actually LIKING ""The O.C."". For all its sudsiness and corny dialogue, it was really somewhat enjoyable. After having watched all 7 episodes of it so far, I think that its just getting better and better. I mean, sure Mischa Barton's acting skills are drastically limited, and the plot is nothing original, but I don't find it to be TOO much like ""Beverly Hills 90210"". Besides, I liked ""90210"" up until a point. Also, the theme song to ""The O.C."" is amazing, even better than the one for ""Smallville"". I am looking forward to the next few episodes of one of my newest favorite shows!",/review/rw0918977/?ref_=tt_urv

9 January 2008,Brownsbros3,9," Greatest Teen Drama Ever
","When I first saw advertisements for ""The O.C."", I really didn't think I was going to like it. When the first episode drew such a big rating for FOX, I watched one of several replays later that week, and was instantly hooked. In four years, I think I missed only two or three episodes total. There was just something about Ryan Atwood that you wanted to see him rise up and reach his full potential, and unknown Benjamin McKenzie did a great job of making the audience want to pull for him.",/review/rw0918977/?ref_=tt_urv

","This show is great. It is emotional, funny, dramatic, corney and hooking. There is a lot of struggle, love and life happening the whole time and you grow to love all the characters. However I honestly feel like the 4th season ruined the show. It turned really weird and different than the other seasons and I am really disappointed with how it ended. It didn't even seem like the same show by the end.",/review/rw0918977/?ref_=tt_urv

","You know, sadly enough I have become a fan of Dawson's Creek in the past year but no other teen drama compares to the OC. I'm an intelligent college male and shouldn't be attracted to these kind of shows but I just can't get enough of the OC. I actually bought the DVD the night it came out, sad right? No its not. This show has everything. I find myself sitting with my roommates every week watching the OC and at some points cheering to the TV or yelling at the TV. One case was when Oliver showed up, this p***ed me off. Why screw up what Ryan and Marissa had, what a jerk. ",/review/rw0918977/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2003,copeknight,," Brilliant
","The best show on TV in a decade.  Funny, surprising, and always entertaining this is far more than a teeny-bopper 90210 knock-off.  It's wonderful. The acting is top-notch, but the writing is simply brilliant.  If only we all did it like they do it in The O.C.  I hope it'll be around for years to come, but, even if it isn't, each episode is 60 minutes to treasure. Plus: the best soundtrack on TV.",/review/rw0918977/?ref_=tt_urv

","The OC. How can I describe it? It is an amazing show. My brother wasn't that big of a fan when he first started watching it, but then I bought the first season on DVD, and now he's completely hooked! The story line is amazing, yet a bit confusing with the whole love triangle thing going, but it's exciting because you never know what's going to happen next.",/review/rw0918977/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2015,taylorkingston,10," An awesome show...
","This show is awesome. It really is. I just love it. I love the cast, the characters and the story lines. The only thing I don't like about this show is the fact that it only went for four seasons and how much they put the adult characters into the plot lines. I would've liked it better if they had focused mainly on the teenagers, rather than half on them and half on the adults. My favorite characters are Seth and Summer, who coincidentally are my favorite couple on the show. My favorite season is probably Season 2, and then Season 3, Season 1 and Season 4 would have to be my least favorite. But it's still great.",/review/rw0918977/?ref_=tt_urv

29 September 2014,ComedyFan2010,7," A fun soap opera with great actors
","I started this show with not very high expectations and must say the first few episodes just made me cringe. I found it unrealistic, cliché and it involved some bad acting from the younger actors. But it rapidly gained on quality and the story lines just sucked me in. The show has both good and bad times. It went down in the season three and the beginning of season 4 made me think that it will turn into garbage. But once again they gained on the entertainment and I felt sad at the end saying good bye to the characters I now loved.",/review/rw0918977/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2003,Roxburyfunny1,," This is too good to be True! ~!
","So all the promo's were.  90210 or whatever.  Nothing like it, much better. This show is totally the opposite.  Their not all friend's and there's bigger problem's. A great drama for kids who knew dawson's creek was for thirty year old's and not for teens.  Just kidding.  Better than dawson but a different kind of 90210 for the new millienium.  Love Adam Brody.  He's so real when he act's and he's so good at it.  He's one of my favorite actor's. And the led guy that play's Ryan.  He's totally going to make a name for himself.  This show is great and it better stay on or i'm sueing fox.  I lost keen eddie i'm losing this one, i can't do two show's in one month.
