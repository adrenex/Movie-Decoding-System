3 January 2021,zacattack38,8," Great game but not as good as Spider-Man 2018
","This game is great! Fantastic gameplay (better than spidey 2018), great story, great graphics. I enjoyed every second of the game. I just wish it was longer. The story felt too short. Not nearly as long as the other game. There was also a poor plot. And I think they really screwed up the villain...like a teenage girl is leading a terrorist group? Really? You gotta do better than that. Also, a teenage boy is hacking into a huge companies firewalls and data banks? Cmon you gotta do better. But other than those two things...the game was great. Highly recommend",/review/rw7767947/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2020,hfreinoso,10," Ah yes a fantastic dlc
","This spinoff video game was looking to be at least OK or good. But I was proven like from the opening start of the game. We start as Miles and we are riding the subway. Something Spider-man would do without the costume. He is just a regular guy who is here to help HIS neighborhood. Of course Peter is here but Miles Morales is the gut you play for and it's fun to see and play a different Spider-man for once. Yeah of course the villain is in fact very generic. And the tinker was really his friend and common sense. But there are so many things in this game that I swear it made you feel like Miles Morales is in fact a friendly neighbor Spider-Man helping a deaf girl and have her give her scarf to Miles is all about being a human in the end. That's what is being a neighbor is all about. I love the fact that we see the human aspect of Spider-Man and that is what us people should see. The fact that we should get more of this in TV shows, movies and games this is what makes me love this game 10/10.",/review/rw7767947/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2020,nix-cornelissen,9," This game is SHORT
",This game is extremely fun to play. But it is SHORT. I finished this game very quickly and without putting a lot of time into it. It needs more.,/review/rw7767947/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2020,darkwizard404,7," Good but not great
","After a highly successful Spider-Man game in 2018, Insomniac Games decided to follow it up with a spinoff focusing on Miles Morales. The gameplay was highly enjoyable and the bioelectricity possessed by Miles was so much fun to use on enemies. The characters were well written however the story was highly predictable and nowhere near as exciting as the original game.",/review/rw7767947/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2021,gamerreview,7," Every good story needs a villain.
","Spider-Man: Miles Morales is an extremely fun game with great gameplay, audio, voice acting and when played on the PS5 is as beautiful a game that I've played, however there's a glaring problem and that problem is the games lack of an truly engaging villain.",/review/rw7767947/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2020,shonen-68558,10," Just as good as the first one
","Loved this game, however could get repetitive like the first one did.",/review/rw7767947/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2020,mayalvss,9," Starting the new generation in style!
","Spider-Man: Miles Morales original game from PlayStation 4 and 5, the new generation of consoles starts with a lot of style and quality, Miles shines in the game, the performance is incredible, so we want the quality of the games of this new generation. The end of the game is exciting and incredible, I am waiting for the continuation (THERE ARE POST-CREDIT SCENES)",/review/rw7767947/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2020,beowolf-45163,7," Good but, nowhere near as good as its predecessor.
","There are a few things that have noticeably improved since Spiderman ps4. The graphics look incredible on the ps5 and ps4 versions of the game however, the most impressive thing about the game is the performance mode available on the ps5 version which provides a smooth 60fps performance. This makes the already improved combat feel more responsive and overall a much enjoyable experience. There are a lot of new and improved animations for the characters like more expressive swinging and fighting style from Miles Morales. The one and only issue I have with the game is the story. The story truly feels like a complete downgrade compared to the amazing story of spiderman ps4. The first 25 minutes of the game was absolutely amazing and it set my expectations for everything that was to come however, those expectations were met with pure disappointment. The missions were very boring and they felt like side quests. I had heard that the game was meant to be DLC for Spiderman ps4 and after playing many hours of the game I can truly say that it really does feel like it. The story was dragged out by the side quest like missions that were needed to play to progress the actual story. I was excited to play as Miles Morales but in the end, I wanted to go back to Peter and continue his story.",/review/rw7767947/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2020,yankeyson,10," Best Spider-Man game I've ever played
",This game is so good. The set pieces. The drama. 10/10,/review/rw7767947/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2020,coltonhaley,7," The story blows
","Everything else is on par if not improved upon from the first one. The story is soooooo weak and cringy. I felt myself wanting to skip the cutscenes to get to fighting. It's cheesy, and unrelatable unless your 15. Not to mention it's so short. I agree with these other reviews it feels like dlc, when I finished the first one I expected this to be in the dlc after or before the other 3 dlcs but I guess insomniac thought it more financially sound to sell it as a new game. Spare me",/review/rw7767947/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2020,toews-55064,7," I wanted more.
","I won't spoil anything, but I would wait until this goes on sale for 20-30 dollars. I got the platinum in a day. Not worth fifty dollars. The story is a big mess, and is predictable, short, and very cringy at times. However, the gameplay is better than before. Combat is more fun with the addition of venom and camouflage, and swinging just feels way better. This would be a 6/10 if the gameplay didn't feel this good. If you liked the first game, you'll like this one fine. If you think it looks fun, than it will be to you. Personally, the 2018 Spider-Man is in my top 3 games ever, and I was just expecting more from Insomniac. Good, but not great. Wait until it's on sale.",/review/rw7767947/?ref_=tt_urv

12 November 2020,byrocow,8," Be Yourself
","The next gen consoles are here with brand new games and we start with this one which I've been looking forward to (I LOVED Spider-Man PS4 and I was really excited to see what they were gonna do with Miles in his own game) set almost a year after the events of the first game, New York now has a second Spider-Man with Miles Morales who is still trying to learn how to be a hero. Then, Peter Parker decides to leave New York for a bit and leaves New York to Miles who suddenly has to deal with threats like the Tinkerer and the underground and learn what it means to be a hero. First off, the game looks fantastic and the gameplay is still amazing (I love how differently Miles plays from Peter with added abilities like Venom Punch and cloaking but also in the way he moves and acts and it's cool to watch him progress and get better) and I, for the most part, liked the story (I loved watching Miles grow throughout the game and learn to be his own kind of hero and I love the lesson of this game about it not matter where you come from or what you look like, you can be a hero) and the map of New York is once again a blast to swing around and do fun missions in (I especially love the winter setting) In regards to issues, the story can be a little rushed (it's around half the length of PS4 Spider-Man's story and it feels like it sometimes) and some characters I didn't find that interesting (they weren't bad. Like the Tinkerer as a character I didn't really find that compelling) in the end, I had a total blast playing this game and I still can't wait to see more of this world with a great lead character, great world, fun story and missions, epic gameplay and a reminder of why I love Spider-Man.",/review/rw7767947/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2021,yaszi-83296,7," Not as good as Spider-Man ps4 but......
","So the graphics and music were pretty decent but gameplay wasn't really the best, it's pretty good and you can have some great fun, but the normal Spider-Man ps4 game just had some more great fun to it, the villain was ok but kinda mediocre.",/review/rw7767947/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2020,Cazdood,5," It's alright, but nothing compared to the first game
","I'm a huge fan of the first Spider-Man from insomniac. The story, gameplay, controls and Easter eggs are incredible. Almost a near perfect game which is why when miles appeared i was very excited.",/review/rw7767947/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2020,Foxyojimbo,7," Basically a DLC
","Pencil thin story, way too short, open plot threads, just a re-skinned city, and I won't even dignify the ending story animation. Fun to play, but never feels like a fully fleshed out game.",/review/rw7767947/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2021,lukeb-16082,8," Fantastic game, looks superb through an OLED
","Absolutely fantastic game, although quite short it still feels extremely refined. Swinging through the city is a hell of an experience and really takes next gen to the next level.",/review/rw7767947/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2021,eskimosound,10," Another Utter Joy!!
",I can't express the joy I felt being able to swing through New York Again!!,/review/rw7767947/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2020,jebyvyson,8," Great superhero story
","Spider-Man PS4 shows what a Spider-Man story is and how he relates to everyone struggles, Miles Morales is no different. Love how the characters are betrayed, the new direction it went with better gameplay improvements. Only thing I hate is the face changed for Peter Parker, but overall, Insomniac Games did it again. That is all.",/review/rw7767947/?ref_=tt_urv

15 March 2021,ryanwalton-39615,9," Paving the way for greatness!
",I really really enjoyed this game. It was similar to the main game in terms of gameplay but tweaked enough so that Miles felt like his own Spiderman in terms of web-swinging and combat.,/review/rw7767947/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2021,cthulu-614-538357,5," Boring, convaluted Story, bad villain
","Anoying characters, bad writing and unskippable cutscenes. Gameplay is good. Puzzles boring. Two playthroughs for the platnum was painful, becouse of the reasons above.",/review/rw7767947/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2020,ujjayirider,1," Fun gameplay, really stupid storyline.

14 January 2021,calebmccranie-78430,1," Trash
",The first one was a lot better. This was a ok dlc to the first game marked at full price. The combat is fun and the swinging is better but that's about it. People are praising the game for that but there forgetting that just because you like the combat and swinging doesn't make it a good game. The story is very predicable and the villains are really forgettable. Also they still have boring puzzles and non Spider-Man stuff. Over all just don't buy it it's not good.,/review/rw7767947/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2022,Vololv0,8," A significantly worse story but improved gameplay
","The story wasnt as good as the first game. They never explain how Miles got his electric powers, but the fighting mechanics are way better. Web swininging is also alot faster.",/review/rw7767947/?ref_=tt_urv
