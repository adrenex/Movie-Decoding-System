2 June 2011,planktonrules,10," Wonderfully entertaining.
","It's hard for me to review this film, as I have not seen a huge number of Indian films--probably no more than a couple dozen. Most of the ones I've seen were wonderfully entertaining but I am far from an expert on Bollywood. Because of this, I have a hard time knowing how good this film is relative to other films from this country. So, consider this when you read this review. This may be among the very best India has to offer or it just seems that way to me.",/review/rw2452785/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2011,donutpizza,9," Wow this American loves this movie
","I asked my co-workers to recommend a Bollywood movie. I expected ""Dumb and Dumber"" by the title. It wasn't that at all. It is more of an inspirational comedy with some serious but good messages. A more accurate title would have been ""The Legend of Rancho"".",/review/rw2452785/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2013,Fella_shibby,10," Finally a masterpiece from Bollywood. Aamir Khan is the best thing to happen to Bollywood.
","Awesome film man. Saw this with my family in a theatre. Worth every penny n worth every minute. Never seen such an amazing film from Bollywood.
What is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. The last 30 mins were beautifully shot. Very good direction by Hirani. The star cast is good n Aamir khan steals the show.
The editing is top notch. U don't feel bore for even a sec. Awesome screenplay. It's hands down the best film in the history of Bollywood.",/review/rw2452785/?ref_=tt_urv

3 August 2021,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,9," Don't be fooled by its name, it's a great movie
","The film not only shows the mistakes of the education system, but also reveals how the truth should be. That life is not actually a race; reveals that this is imposed on us by the education system. Rancho, our character who opposes the order at every opportunity, cannot make sense of not talking about new ideas but grades at schools. Because he goes to school to learn, not for a diploma, he gives importance to knowing the meaning, not memorizing, he does not say ""what I learn at school stays at school"", he applies what he learns in daily life. The secret of its success; Reading the part he is passionate about.",/review/rw2452785/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2020,Xstal,9," Hat-Trick Heroes x 3...
","Like Dead Poets Society but with Robin Williams as a student and some extra tonic and spice thrown in for good measure. Serious, sad and silly, often concurrently but overwhelmingly very, very funny and engaging, as engineering students at an Indian college end up teaching as much as they learn. Who could disagree with the distinction between education and learning while recognising the often sizable gulf that exists between the two after watching this. Who would dissuade those with aspiration and passion from pursuing their dreams and goals. Weighing in not too shy of three hours you'll be shocked how quickly the time flies as your attention is vacuumed up and your view of the world turned on its head, or inverted, depending what you've learned.",/review/rw2452785/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2016,deloudelouvain,7," One of the better Bollywood movies I saw
","Because the movie had such a high rating on IMDb I was intrigued. Bollywood movies are not particularly on the top of my list I must admit. But I gave it a shot and I'm glad I did. It only has two scenes where they start singing and dancing so that was not too much. Why they start singing and dancing that I will never get. The story does not need that at all. The story itself was very pleasant to follow. Full of mixed emotions, happy ones and sad ones. The cast and the filming was great. All actors gave a good performance throughout the whole movie. Like in most American television series they want to give you a lesson in life and most of the time it makes me want to barf but in this Bollywood movie it works perfectly well. I had fun watching this and I get why I am not the only one. Certainly worth a watch.",/review/rw2452785/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2013,StevePulaski,10," Scarcely has a comedy provided its audience with so much insight, intelligence, and human affection
","""All is well,"" the three ""idiot"" heroes of 3 Idiots recite when they become frazzled or nervous, while frantically tapping their hearts. They know that reciting the oversimplifying phrase will not provide their problems with a solution, or even a catalyst, but it gives them the onset courage they desperately need at a time of uncertainty and despair. One character even tries to use the line after an amateurishly-given birth may have gone terribly wrong. It's times like that when the saying may not be so effective, even if its goal is not to provide certain relief.",/review/rw2452785/?ref_=tt_urv

","The title may conjur up images of the 3 Stooges and the crude humour of the opening might suggest a Hindi ""Porky's"" but with a running time of almost three hours ""3 Idiots"" clearly has its mind on higher things. It's a Bollywood buddy-movie devised as an epic and determined to outdo all the competition and being a Bollywood movie is full of large-scale musical numbers as well as a lot of very broad and very funny comedy.",/review/rw2452785/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2009,sumanbarthakursmailbox,10," 3 idiots is a masterpiece and easily one of the greatest Bollywood movies of all time
","I saw the paid premiere of 3 idiots today.On the whole, 3 idiots is a winner all the way everythingwise.3 idiots suits the term 'landmark cinema' and has all it takes to help Bollywood take a giant step into world cinema with pride.3 idiots is a sparkling example of qualitative cinema.3 idiots not only entertains, it also enlightens.3 idiots is forward-thinking, but also makes you recall your roots. It promises lots of laughs and also a heartwarming message.There are movies aplenty, but very few remain etched in your memory and possess recall value. 3 idiots is one of those films. Indisputably and undeniably, this Aamir-Madhavan-Sharman outing is worth the price of the ticket and more.The film will set new records and has the merits to emerge one of the biggest hits of all times. The weekend business should be historic, the Week 1 business should be unparalleled, the lifetime gross should be amongst the biggest of all times. In short, 3 idiots has 'Blockbuster' written all over it.The story of 3 idiots has been told differently and most importantly, the story offers so many twists-n-turns that you just can't guess what would unfold next.There's so much happening in every scene and the screenplay is so gripping that you don't feel the need to look at the auditorium ceiling or at your watch at brief intervals. You aren't restless. 3 idiots demonstrates how strong film-making can enhance and elevate an already solid concept.An Aamir Khan film is nothing short of an event. The supremely talented actor acts in one film a year and no two films are ever identical in terms of plot line.To sum up, 3 idiots is commercial Hindi cinema at its best. The film has 'Hit' written all over it. Let me put it this way: Cancel whatever you're doing today and go watch 3 idiots instead.Director Rajkumar Hirani strikes a fine balance between humor and emotions. The comic portions are executed with panache, the drama is attention-grabbing and the emotional quotient is strong enough to turn you moist-eyed. The marriage of humor and emotions as also technique and content is what drives 3 idiots to the winning post.",/review/rw2452785/?ref_=tt_urv

",Never would I have thought that a movie that looked this stupid on paper could have turned out so good. Just looking at the DVD cover would have been enough to turn this film back in but it shows up in IMDb's Top #250 so I thought I'd give it a try. It didn't start out that well for me but before long the movie's magic began to take hold. Not that there's anything daringly new about it's message; it all has to do with believing in one's self and doing what you really want to do with your life after one's formal education is completed.,/review/rw2452785/?ref_=tt_urv

","This particular movie is my most favorite movie of all times. I don't even know where to start with. I have definitely watched over 600 movies in my life, and this happens to be the only movie which was able to have a positive impact in my life. Long story short, I have been in the place of each of Rancho, Fahran and Raju in my life. And I have always applied the principles this movie introduced whenever I have been in a tough situation. I have learned to follow after excellence rather than success. I have learned to follow my passion and care less about what society thinks about my decision.",/review/rw2452785/?ref_=tt_urv

11 August 2015,ironhorse_iv,8," All is kinda well for 3 idiots. It was mostly a great feel-good movie.
","In a country, where over-achievement is expected & anything deem a normal life is look upon as the idiotic or lazy failure. A lot of Asians feel, that slaving away, their lives, for the chance of extraordinary wealth is the only way, to live, even if it's does not suite their personality. Indeed, the hunger for success and wealth is so engrained in Asian culture, that it's hard to escape, such burdens. It's true, that Asians societies, do put extreme pressure on its members. Often, weighting down on them to a point, that some people feel, that it's too much; causing them to common suicide. So, I can see, why people would want to see this film directed by Rajkumar Hirani. It has a more healthy and positive approach when it comes to a country's wants and don't wants, when it comes to the individual member. Set in an India academia world, 3 Idiots revolves around three students studying in the Imperial College of Engineering, in New Delhi. The first idiot, Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi) comes from a poor family and is desperate to pass and get a good job, but lacks the self-esteem to go with his plans. The second idiot, Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan), comes from a relatively better family, but has joined engineering to please his family, while he really wants to become a wildlife photographer. The last idiot, Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chanchhad (Aamir Khan) is a radical-thinking young man, who more willing to challenges the educational system at every step he takes, rather than accenting the harsh-crude teaching practices of the college, often infuriating the headmaster of the school, Viru 'The Virus' Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani). However, Farhan and Raju lost contact with Rancho after graduation. Ten years later, Farhan gets a call from an old enemy colleague of theirs, Chature 'Silencer' Ramalingam (Omi Vaidya) who says he has found Rancho. Abandoning everything, Chatur, Farhan and Raju set out on a road trip, to find him. But all is not as it seems. Can the idiots find their friend or will the search end up as a wild goose chase? Watch the movie, to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to look at the film, in a western world view set and say, the Animal House style college scenes, far out-live the present day, road trip movie. I really felt, those scenes were far, more effective, even if the social message was somewhat too broad. I like that, the modern day teaching standards are called into question. It made a very interesting film. Sadly, the movie takes the often funny yet brilliant Patch Adam like, school challenges, and mixed it, with below average Bollywood film dramatics. The movie often moves into such clichés, that it become somewhat emotional jarring to watch. One minute, you're listening to a Bollywood musical dance number, and then, you cut to an emotional, over the top preachy death scene. The pacing for the film is all over the place. It really drags at times. Some of the film's greatest twist comes inappropriate mistimed. You'd know that Raju will survive his suicide attempt since he's alive and well in the present day scenes. You know, that the men will end up, being successful, regardless, what the Virus pull onto them. Don't get me wrong, the twist about Racho's past was pretty good, but the film was pretty predictable. Then, there are the unrealistic over the top scenes that are absolutely nearly implausible in any universe, like the whole stubborn baby scene. Anyways, the acting, throughout the film was pretty good. Each character had a moment to shine. My only problem with the acting is Kareen Kapoor as Pia. She was so disappointing, most of the film. I really don't get her character. Why would she still go after, Suhas (Olivier Lafont), after three-times, where characters warn her, not to!? It doesn't make sense. Plus, that noise ring, she wore, during the film was so distracting. Another thing that kinda hurts the film is the songs. Shantanu Moitra's score is a bit too gimmicky. The song, Zoobi Doobi sounds entertaining, but sounds too similar to other Bollywood songs. The song 'All Izz Well' sounds like it should had been, put in the credits than in the middle of the film. Anyways, I love the over-the-top childish humor. While, the jokes are simple and old. They work mostly within the means of the story. Chatur's engineered speech is by far, the funniest scene in the film. Still, the movie does seem, a bit, one-sided when it comes to condone misbehavior. I'm deeply surprise that the three men, wasn't kick out of the school, within the first couple of minutes in the film. Much of the film's controversy, comes from the fact, that the movie is loosely based on the novel, Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhaget. Any fan of the book, would know, that the film is way different. The suicide message of the book, get somewhat lose in the film. Yes, within the last five years, India has one of the greatest absolute numbers of suicides cases, but here is where the movie get some of the information, wrong. Other countries have the highest rates, overall. It's also untrue, that extreme pressures of academia cause most of India's suicide rates. Farmers are more likely to kill themselves, versus any other professions in India, as list by the World Health Organization. Despite that, the film is fun for the most part. The film is distinctive for featuring real inventions by little-known people. The cinematography is beautiful to look at. I love the aerial shots of Shimla and Ladakh. The film felt like a typical masala film. It's good to eat, but a bit too spicy, at same moments. No wonder, why this film is one of the highest-grossing Bollywood films ever. Overall: While it's kinda overrated. It's emotional, entertaining and enlightening. In my opinion, it was a somewhat above averaged Bollywood film.",/review/rw2452785/?ref_=tt_urv

","When I told a friend that 3 Idiots is the best film this festive period, he told me it takes an idiot to be able to tell one, and that I saw myself in the film. If anything, I'll take that as a compliment, as the film is about self-actualization, or the simple fact that it's a wake up call in this rat race of a world that we live in, that we lose sight of things that matter in the pursuit of success. It's a wake up call that we should be pursuing Excellence instead, which in the work environment one gets easily drowned in mediocrity, or blind faith that success follows without putting in too much hard work.",/review/rw2452785/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is a significant Bollywood movie, but for European or American viewers, it is best compared to a binge-watched colorful Hollywood miniseries by style, melodramatic and light in tone, but much more filled with meaning. It celebrates Gypsy style music and ingenuity in poverty while criticizing strict education systems of high Asiatic pressure and parental authority which stifles creativity by senseless rot-learning even at top institutions. Quite entertaining and watchable, and different in style - but not at all inferior in quality - to the top Hollywood production, it has some authentic light humorous touches and some intense melodrama - an over the top Bollywood type soap opera that is somewhat a significant social critique at the same time.",/review/rw2452785/?ref_=tt_urv
