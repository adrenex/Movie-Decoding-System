22 December 2022,cliftonofun,8," An origin story without capes
","The Fabelmans
I have been interested in this film since the moment I heard about it. As a kid whose first memorable movie theater experience was E. T., no filmmaker has more influenced the way I experience movies than Spielberg...and nothing influenced those movies more than his parents' divorce. So I was 100% ready for a personal tale, an origin story without capes or superpowers. No CGI. No motion capture. Just a movie about the power of families and stories through the eyes of a kid. It is just that... But it is more too. There's a generosity in the way that Spielberg makes sense of his own story after the fact. Nobody is a villain or hero. They are just people choosing between happiness and responsibility while realizing slowly and painfully that it may not have to be either/or. There were scenes that worked better than others (and I am still sorting through the third act), but it was fun to see him tell a story like this, whether it was his own or not.",/review/rw8534545/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2023,pkertes-59666,7," A nice homage but too long and not one of Spielberg's best.
","This semi-autobiographical film centres around Sammy Fabelman who is transfixed by the first movie he sees at age 6 and develops a passion for film making. Other themes explored with variable depth and success include the fracturing marriage of his parents, bullying and anti-semitism at high school, young love and coming of age, and selfishness in general.",/review/rw8534545/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2022,boblipton,8," ""A movie is a dream you never forget""
","It's watching Steven Spielberg grow up from a child terrified by the train crash in THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH, to an adolescent film maker. He's pretty up front about the family issues and his parents' break up. I suspect he has realized that being an adult is a tough thing and is willing to forgive.",/review/rw8534545/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,5," Throughout the entire 151 minute runtime, the horizon was in the middle.
","This felt more like a revenge film targeting ""Bennie"" and Spielberg's high school bully ""Logan"" - characters names that have been changed to protect the real identity of those who may otherwise had legal slander recourse, had their real names been used. I'm even willing to bet Spielberg specifically cast actors that looked like his nemesis, just to spite them even more. Then we get a story of those that deprived him of a normal childhood, instead of those that inspired him. I still have no further knowledge of what made Spielberg a great filmmaker. The entire first 90 mins was utter boredom of a typical dysfunctional family - all just shallow filler, and the remaining 1 hour was just another high school drama story playing out, with very little substance. What the heck are all these critics raving about... there was nothing brilliant in this dull, bland, self-indulgent shallow slog. I learned more about Spielberg's mom than him. This is literally the most boring Spielberg film I've ever seen, and for that matter, a film no one should care about. Even the screenplay was riddled with unnecessary subplots that had more plot holes than engaging narrative. Granted, the dated set pieces and wardrobe were on point, and all casting and performances spot-on, and the score was perfect. But none of that matters when you're forced to sit through a two and a half hour film that leaves you frustrated and unsatisfied. It's amusing how another great filmmaker, James Cameron, gives us Avatar 2, and Spielberg gives us this nonsense vanity project. You can tell one is falling from grace and the other rising past. It's a very generous 5/10 from me.",/review/rw8534545/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2022,levybob,2," Spielberg's Heart Was In The Right Place
","'The Fabelmans' is not good. Director and Co-Writer Steven Spielberg's heart was in the right place (the idea, the conceit, the structure is fine), but the execution fails to deliver. The film is too long by far, scenes run on forever, the story seems flabby and unfocused (and yes, that includes the hero's undying desire to become a film-maker).",/review/rw8534545/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2023,dromasca,8," the fascination of the camera
","Hollywood likes to make movies about Hollywood. Several of the great directors (including
Spielberg's friends and collaborators Truffaut and George Lucas) have made autobiographical films inspired by their own childhood and adolescence. In 'The Fabelmans' (2022), Steven Spielberg combines the two genres and the result can only be a film that pleases the public as well as the members of the Academy. In fact, it's the film that will have to be beaten in several important categories in this year's Academy Awards competition. But I don't think it was an easy film for Spielberg. It's not easy to make a film where the main characters are your parents and yourself at the ages of childhood and adolescence. Anyone who has read a biography of Spielberg will recognize the characters, years and dates of the main events depicted in the film as belonging to the first 19 years of Spielberg's life. Without being a masterpiece and even if it brings back to the screen some of the strengths and weaknesses of the director's previous films, 'The Fabelmans' is a film full of emotion and above all of love for cinema and fascination for the power of the image.",/review/rw8534545/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2022,Xstal,5," Just Another Coming of Age Snory...
","... with a very central horizon, albeit with a rather successful director revealing his grounding, but you've seen it many times before, watching other people grow up's such a chore, we've all been adolescent, distracted and pubescent, it's a boring set of takes and you will snore. Perhaps if it had something new to say, portrayed a family more uniquely in their way, a novel circumstance, to catch your eye, a second glance, not monotony of people day to day. If you make it to the end you might just wonder, why fine actors chose to loot your time and plunder (I'll give you three guesses but you only need one), must be quite a fallow year, to want to make this and appear, in something that's so dull, it makes you want to slumber.",/review/rw8534545/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2022,subxerogravity,9," A movie about artist, by an artist, for artist.
",I can't shake the fact that there is something very pompous about Steven Spielberg making a fictional movie about his real life. It does not help that I first herd of this film after watching a documentary on HBO called Spielberg in which Steve and his family tell the same story as the Fabelmans. It's not like the movie Crooklyn which is a Spike Lee joint about Spike Lee and his family. I think it hits me as arrogant because we know from the jump Sammy Fabelman is Spielberg cause from the jump its all about Sammy making films.,/review/rw8534545/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2022,SnoopyStyle,8," childhood recollection
","It's 1952 New Jersey. Mitzi Fabelman (Michelle Williams) and Burt Fabelman (Paul Dano) bring their son Sammy to his first movie, The Greatest Show on Earth. He is mesmerized by the train crash scene and works to recreate it. It's the start of a filmmaking career. Friend Uncle Bennie Loewy (Seth Rogen) works under Burt and is a constant fixture around the family.",/review/rw8534545/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2022,li0904426,3," The Worst Spielberg movie!!!!
","The movie ""The Fabelmans"" is the worst film directed by Steven Spielberg so far. I am not sure if it was intentional but the film looks amateurish and not made by the incredible director.",/review/rw8534545/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2022,gangeshgnair,8," Spielberg's love letter to cinema
","Steven Spielbergs semi autobiography. This is his love letter to cinema. This is one of the legendary filmmaker trying to show us how he fell in love with cinema in the first place. Once i watched this movie I just wanted to take a camera, go out and just start filming something, that's how heartwarming it is. The movie mainly is a coming of age story. Any aspiring filmmaker or anyone who loves cinema for that matter will love this movie. There is some exceptionally staged and shot moments in the movie, for example there is this scene where sammy (the protagonist) realises his mom is having an affair with his dads best friend. The way they show that scene is just amazing. The scenes where he try to shoot a movie with his friends and the techniques he uses to show a gun firing Or shoot a war sequence were just amazing. The movie also tries to show a family drama, sammys relationship with his parents and sisters and how they deal with the divorce of their parents. Gabriel La Belle is just amazing as sammy. I really liked his performance. Michelle Williams, seth rogans, paul dano all gave amazing performance. The girls who came as sammys sisters were amazing. The movie is technically awsome. Kaminskis cinematography is so awsome, the retro effect, the nostalgia just hits you and gives such a nice vibe.",/review/rw8534545/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2022,UniqueParticle,10," Steven Spielberg still makes masterful cinema
","The Fabelmans is very worthy of Oscar nominations the acting throughout was one of the best ever! The family dynamic was so sweet and I wish could be a filmmaker or work on movies in some aspect like Sam's character which I'm pretty sure was based on Steven Spielbergs life. I absolutely loved everything about the movie only hard thing is the length even that is worth it. Packed with great emotions, how to make movies, tender moments, perfect humor, cinematic scenery, and brilliant acted scenes that electrified me! I'm proud of Seth Rogen being involved in serious roles where as the bulk of his roles were raunchy or less serious. All around wonderful film for anyone to enjoy.",/review/rw8534545/?ref_=tt_urv

1 December 2022,jaredpahl,8," Dear Diary, It's Steven
","After 50 years of making movies, Steven Spielberg is still, in the 2020s, finding new muscles to work. His semi-autobiopic, The Fabelmans, is different in style, reach, and aim, than anything Spielberg has ever made. The consummate ringmaster has never helmed a film so modest. And for a director whose personal attachments are spread all over his filmography, The Fabelmans may also be his most intimate.",/review/rw8534545/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2023,Galina_movie_fan,9," A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
","Many years ago, Steven Spielberg conceived the idea of the movie based on the story of his family and growing up in various states, cities, and towns across the US. By his own admission, he has told the parts of the story in many of his films. For a long time, he could not come to terms with his parents' divorce when he was a teenager and for many years, he blamed his father and almost did not communicate with him. Over time, he learned details that he did not suspect, and in the last years of his parents' life, he was close to both. Both of his parents lived to a ripe old age. His mother died at 97 and his father at 103. While himself in his 70s he was blessed to be a son of two loving living parents. After their death, he finally decided to tell the story about them, about his childhood and adolescence, about the origins of his love for cinema, the love that became his calling, profession, and obsession for life.",/review/rw8534545/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2022,sme3,8," Never Say ""The End""
","Steven Spielberg knows how to tell a story and stage a scene. As a result, watching THE FABELMANS is an enjoyable experience. However, this loosely autobiographical tale largely lacks forward momentum. Although the teen Spielberg went somewhere, this film offers a pleasant journey that refuses to say ""The End"" or provide much of a conclusion. Some scenes are comically overplayed, others are excessively melodramatic, while most are better balanced.",/review/rw8534545/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2023,jaysonpajaronvistal,8," A love letter to filmmakers and cinephiles.
","The Fabelmans is both a coming-of-age story and a love letter to filmmaking; calling this movie a labor of love is an understatement. The Fabelman is Spielberg's most personal film ever as he shared how he developed his passion for filmmaking while demonstrating the power of escapism the movies brought to his life. Steven Spielberg understands that love for art is not just a hobby but also an expression of one's self and exploration of humankind. Steven Spielberg was able to articulate himself in a very raw yet profound way with his film, The Fabelmans. It is good to see him tell the story of his life while recognizing that his family is far from perfect and how a young man deals with one family crisis and overcoming it through the power of filmmaking. If you share the same love for film, like everyone here, you would certainly appreciate this movie. But, the movie is far from perfect as most of Spielberg's films.",/review/rw8534545/?ref_=tt_urv

",I cannot believe this movie has this high of a rating. I must not have watched the same movie. It was agonizingly boring. Michelle Williams looks weird the entire movie.

24 November 2022,old52,2," The Miserable Mythbergs get a Movie
","I was so wanting to love this, Spielberg hasn't done a decent movie in a long time so I was really rooting for this but it's a sappy soggy saggy slush through a gauze filtered revision. The story if one can call it that just rambles with mind bending cringe lines. Stories happen to people who can tell them. Worst dialogue heard in theaters since the 90s. This will do well in streaming but I would advise against spending money in a ticket. You'll feel like you just paid movie theater money to watch a lifetime movie you could have watched on your living room couch for a lot less money. Biggest problem is that the story isn't that interesting or compelling.",/review/rw8534545/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2022,estherde,4," So disappointing
","While Michelle Williams and Paul Dano are gifted actors, there's not much they can do to save an overly long and boring movie. Easily 45 minutes could have been cut from this 2.5 hour flick. I just don't think it was necessary to see every film Spielberg made as a child. The antisemitism in California was interesting, but the rest was a snore. I was supposed to feel sorry for the mother and think her creativity was smothered, but she sure got to do what she wanted. What was the lesson for Spielberg about that? The three sisters were cardboard cutouts and never developed. Os this movie his story or his parents' story as neither happens effectively. If this is nominated for awards, then Hollywood really has lost its way.",/review/rw8534545/?ref_=tt_urv

","Magical Egotism is the current vogue in American non-franchise moviedom. Leading practitioners are David O. Russell, Richard Linklater, Noah Baumbach....and now the old hit-maker Steven Spielberg proves himself a master of the genre. This blancmange of a film is redeemed in part by Michelle Williams' remarkable performance and an all-too-brief one by Judd Hirsch. Otherwise, it's tooth-rot.",/review/rw8534545/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2022,eliaemil,1," The Boremans
","The most disappointing movie I have seen in my life. It's unbelievable to me that a great director like Steven Spielberg couldn't make a believable movie about his life. It could easily be a magnificent film like Cinema Paradiso about the love of film. The first twenty minutes was so interesting that I was so excited about the rest of the it. But storyline got digress and focus on the other subjects that destroy the soul of movie.it is like make a film title batman, and the story line about Cinderella. The most disappointing scene was about the great John Ford, who can believe that scene was exactly that had happened. Again, like my other reviews, filmmaking technology has advanced a lot and the negative direction, the screenplay has become weaker and weaker.",/review/rw8534545/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2022,beatricegl,9," ""Great stories happen to those who can tell them...""
","Just watched the world premiere of this movie at TIFF. Engaging from start to finish. Delightful in that Spielbergian way in which he manages to create scenes that are equal parts poignant and comical. Beautifully shot and scored, and perfectly cast, with standout performances by Michelle and Gabriel. While it is deeply personal for Spielberg, it is relatable in so many ways, with family being one of the central themes. Having studied film, I just enjoyed watching how this legendary filmmaker showed us his journey IN filmmaking in the context of his own life and upbringing. A movie for movie lovers BY one of the biggest movie lovers of all time.",/review/rw8534545/?ref_=tt_urv
