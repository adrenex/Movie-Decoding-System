12 February 2018,bowmanblue,6," Know what you're getting
","I have to confess I didn't research this film to any great extent before I sat down to watch it. However, the two things I did know - mainly courtesy of all marketing - was that it was based on the true story of three men who foil a terrorist attack on a train and that it was directed by Clint Eastwood. Both seemed like equally good reasons to watch the film. And - technically - both of those statements are correct. However, I guess because the promotional material seemed to focus so much on the 'terrorist attack' that I expected something more like 'Under Siege 2' or 'The Commuter' than what I got.",/review/rw4066824/?ref_=tt_urv

7 January 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,6," Proof, that amatuer screenwriters can take down even the best directors.
","Why Eastwood would direct a screenplay from a Production Assistant/Secretary is baffling. He should've at least looked it over and made changes, or even team her up with a seasoned screenwriter. But what he gave us here, is a flop, and an embarrassment to his filmmaking career.",/review/rw4066824/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2018,kristen_225,8," very enjoyable
","I really don't understand the dislike for this movie. I enjoyed the back story, superimposed over the beginning of the conflict on the train. Eastwood shows us how these boys lifestyles contributed to putting them in the perfect frame of mind and experiences to thwart this particular attempt at terror. I've seen people commenting on their acting abilities but honestly, I thought they did better than some people who actually call themselves actors. Eastwood and these three men did a great job with an amazing story and I was very glad I took the chance on it",/review/rw4066824/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2018,rockman182,6," The 15:17 to Paris (2018)
","SPOILER: I'm very mixed on Clint Eastwood's filmography especially in recent years. He is responsible for some great work from behind the camera but that hasn't really been the case in recent years. The 15:17 to Paris looked a bit bland and like a run of the mill affair when it comes to recreation of recent global events in film. It didn't help that critics weren't too pleased but of course, I then remembered that I never listen to critics. I'll tell you, the film is flawed and has slow passages but I liked it more than I thought I would.",/review/rw4066824/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2018,neener3707,5," Nowhere Near Clint Eastwood's Best
","While it doesn't come close to Clint Eastwood's best films, I still definitely enjoyed this story of life and bravery., but some will find the film too slow and just waiting for the thwarted terrorist attack. We all know the story, 3 Americans stop an attempted terrorist attack aboard a train to Paris, but the film is almost barely about that, its more of story about their lives and what led them to their destiny. I only really sort of didn't like the acting, which I will discuss later, but for the most part I had no issues with this film, which is not over-patriotic flag waving propaganda like many anti-military Liberals will say it is. Its a story about the lives of men as well as when bravery is forced upon average citizens.",/review/rw4066824/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2018,phd_travel,9," A victory against terror - enjoyed this thoroughly.
","For those who criticize the non action parts of the movie miss the point. This movie is about ordinary people who had to deal with an extraordinary situation. The events only took minutes so of course it isn't a non stop action movie. It was a good thing to use the actual people as much as possible the three from Sacramento and the other from Virginia played themselves. It didn't have a reality TV feel - it actually helped make things much more real - not just some famous actors in perilous situations and there is nothing wrong with their acting. The parts showing the training of Stone were useful for the way he tackled the terrorist later and helped the shooting victim so it wasn't wasted. I actually enjoyed their trip through Rome, Venice, Berlin and Amsterdam. Their dialog was so much like any person who has done the Eurailpass thing would recognize. Showing their happy times helps emphasize the beauty and good times that still exist in Europe ",/review/rw4066824/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2018,tavm,7," The 15:17 to Paris was a pretty good true-life heroism story enacted by the three men who actually participated in it
","My movie theatre-working friend and I just finished watching this movie about and starring three American heroes who had prevented a terrorist attack in a Paris train a few years ago. They are Alek Skarlatos, Anthony Sadler, and Spencer Stone who all play themselves here. Other actors play them when they first met-at a school when they were kids and played war games together. Spencer gets most of the scenes since he was very gung ho about joining the Air Force and had some personal troubles while taking the tests along the way. Compared to the professionals surrounding them-many of whom me and my friend recognized from various TV shows and other movies-they aren't really actors but when the climatic scenes come, you feel some excitement. And the reward ceremony was also touching. So on that note, I and my friend recommend The 15:17 to Paris.",/review/rw4066824/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2018,classicsoncall,7," ""You don't need anybody to approve your dream. Do what you know is right.""
","For whatever reason, this felt like the shortest movie I ever watched. Can't really explain it, but it seemed to be over in a flash. Though it did hold my interest, I didn't think it was riveting given the subject matter; it certainly didn't have the suspense of ""The Taking of Pelham 123"" for example. Where I agree with a lot of reviewers is that this wasn't one of director Clint Eastwood's finer efforts, however where I disagree is with the quality of the three young men who stood in for themselves as the heroes of the story. Not that they were great actors per se, but on the flip side, I didn't detect that they were self-conscious at all in their scenes, whether alone or with each other. I think that would be a difficult thing to avoid for anyone suddenly thrust in front of a motion picture camera. Regarding the actual event, it felt almost anti-climactic considering how the three men responded, particularly Spencer Stone, who seemed almost foolhardy in rushing the terrorist who's intentions would have mitigated a major disaster. Be that as it may, it was visionary on Eastwood's part to display American heroism at it's finest in a situation that could have gone horribly wrong. Alek Skarlatos, Anthony Sadler, and Spencer Stone certainly deserved the accolades bestowed upon them by President Mitterand and the citizens of France, who without their unwavering bravery, might have spent the following weeks and months in mourning for the hundreds of passengers who might have perished in another senseless act of terrorism.",/review/rw4066824/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2022,spookyrat1,4," A Half - hour TV Documentary Would Have Been Preferable!
","I have the greatest admiration for Clint Eastwood, both as an actor and director. In the directorial role he never fails to astound me with the breadth of topics and genres he is prepared to operate within. Even his failures such as Absolute Power and Jersey Boys still have degrees of interest. But with The 15:17 to Paris, he's clearly hit the wall.",/review/rw4066824/?ref_=tt_urv

11 February 2018,george.schmidt,7," Well produced true-life account of ordinary heroes
","THE 15:17 TO PARIS (2018) **1/2 Judy Greer, Jenna Fischer, Thomas Lennon, Tony Hale, Jaleel White. Based on the true-life account of three childhood friends Ray Corasani, Alex Skarlatos & Anthony Sadler who became heroes when they stopped an attempted terrorist strike on the titular journey from Amsterdam to France, filmmaker Clint Eastwood gives backstory and intertwines the past with the contemporary event with deft aplomb and steady nerves. Based on the collaborative book by Sadler, Skarlatos and Spencer Stone & Jeffrey E. Stern, the adaptation by Dorothy Bylskal streamlines the parallel timelines evenly yet predictably too. Better than anticipated and with the gimmick of stunt casting the real-life trio (not actors) heightens the stakes of what is already knowledgeable with clarity.",/review/rw4066824/?ref_=tt_urv

","Greetings again from the darkness. Allowing three regular guys to play themselves in the cinematic re-telling of their courageous and heroic actions is a fitting tribute to the men, and it's an approach that we must be willing to cut some slack. On August 21, 2015, a terrorist aboard the Thalys train bound for Paris was thwarted in his attempt to carry out his mission of evil. Spencer Stone, Alek Skarlatos, and Anthony Sadler ultimately subdued the terrorist (who won't be named here), likely saving many lives.",/review/rw4066824/?ref_=tt_urv

","Going into this I didn't have high expectations. If you haven't heard, the ""stars"" of the film aren't actors. They are the guys who actually lived the story. I knew this going into the film, and I was still shocked at how jarring an experience it was to watch regular guys act on the big screen. Don't get me wrong, I certainly couldn't do any better. Not to mention, I haven't done anything in my life anyone should make a movie about. ",/review/rw4066824/?ref_=tt_urv

","If I hadn't known Clint Eastwood was the director, I would have guessed some college guys in film school got their buddies together in order to take a European trip. It was all very good-hearted and I salute these young men, but $30,000,000 to make this movie seems over the top. I hope the 3 heroes go on from this to do even more heroic things.",/review/rw4066824/?ref_=tt_urv

","I admit I'm a life-long Clint Eastwood fan. I also know he has an uphill battle in Hollyweird because he tends to portray conservative values and masculinity an heroism in the face of the media's liberal resistance. His films portray strong men doing good deeds, which the radical left feels is somehow inappropriate so his films get slammed in the ratings. This is a great film. Maybe a little clunky and slow at times but the message is 100% gold.",/review/rw4066824/?ref_=tt_urv

","Can't understand the negative reviews, the film relays the American mens lives to when they were kids and best friends with the incident shown at different times, though the majority of the incident is at the back end of the movie.The acting is really quite good, makes everything all the more interesting in that these people were actually involved in the real thing.

25 February 2018,duffjerroldorg,2," Something To Be Said
","Extraordinary real life event transformed into a rather embarrassing show of opportunism. Alek Skarlatos, Anthony Sadler, Spencer Stone are likable men, heroes in real life but as actors...didn't Clint Eastwood know, being an actor himself, that to play yourself you need acting talents. As a consequence Alek Skarlatos, Anthony Sadler and Spencer Stone play themselves, unconvincingly. If we start right there, nothing works. A very disheartening attempt at cashing in from an act of real American courage.",/review/rw4066824/?ref_=tt_urv

20 February 2018,zardoz-13,8," Real Heroes, Real Victims, and Real Action!!!
","The terrorist thriller ""The 15:17 to Paris"" recreates the chaos aboard the Amsterdam-to-Paris train on 21 August 2015, when three American tourists foiled an armed and dangerous fanatic from killing more 500 unsuspecting passengers. Anybody else but director Clint Eastwood would have turned this ruckus into the equivalent of ""Saving Private Ryan"" on rails. Instead, the director of ""American Sniper"" and ""Sully"" has adopted an entirely different tactic. Not only has he cast the 'real-life heroes' who saved the day as themselves, but he has also lensed it with a documentary like realism to underline the credibility of the incident. Indeed, those 'real-life heroes' (Alek Skarlatos, Anthony Sadler, and Spencer Stone) play themselves. Mind you, none of them will take home Oscars, but casting them gives ""The 15:17 to Paris"" a verisimilitude that would be sorely missing. Furthermore, the American-born Frenchman Mark Moogalian, who initially disarmed Ayoub El-Khazzani before the terrorist plugged him in the back, played himself, too! Critics have argued that 87-year old Eastwood has wrought a routine, perhaps even a tedious tale that spends too much time leading up to the headline heroics. They have complained the casting the 'real-life heroes' deprives the film of the gravitas that seasoned actors might have generated with their charisma. ",/review/rw4066824/?ref_=tt_urv

","Don't listen to the bashers. Maybe they're happy watching comic book heroes fighting comic book villians. That's fine if that's what you like. This, of course, is about real heroes fighting real villians. This movie does take it's time getting to the meat and potatoes but it's never boring. It's only an hour and a half long. The acting by the three heroes is fine. They held there own. The rest of the supporting cast is solid (as it usually is in most of Clint's movies). This is the first movie that made me want to visit Italy. It's beautifully filmed. The audience really did applaud so I wasn't the only one there who liked it.",/review/rw4066824/?ref_=tt_urv
