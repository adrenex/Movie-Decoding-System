28 February 2022,cscott2331,10," I am in love with this show
","Everything about this show is great. The characters, the storyline, the sorrow, the happiness, the pain, the acceptance, the grief, the loneliness, the family and friends, insiders and outsiders...ALL OF IT...spot on. Real things happening. Real life ups and downs. It makes me laugh and it makes me cry. I love it and I need more of it. Period.",/review/rw8039814/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2022,holchie,10," I don't want it to ever end.
","This is so good that I'm worried it won't continue. The type of humor and storyline may not be for everyone, but I love it and hope enough people are like me and it stays in production.",/review/rw8039814/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2022,chiltonsjillfreeport,9," ""We're F@&$ed, but we're OK""
","Seriously, this show is so terrific I feel like I'm getting away with something just watching it. Even better, every episode so has been better than the last.",/review/rw8039814/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2022,ellipseanostalrius,10," Yassssssss
","Guess what? A series that is *not* about beautiful, young, rich people doing stupid crap while trying to figure out who to sleep with.",/review/rw8039814/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2022,niseynisey,8," Fun. Real. Puts a a smile on my face
",Just a real show about people who don't have their life together. I always end up with a smile on my face and laughing out loud. It's an enjoyable 30min show.,/review/rw8039814/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2022,dpoland-76589,10," Bridget Everett is great. The show is great.
","A nice change of pace. It's cute, funny, charming, sad and dramatic. All elements are there but in perfect bite sized portions. I am not familiar with small town USA but it seems like it also is a love letter to such places, not necessarily a true to life representation, which is totally fine.",/review/rw8039814/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2022,h2223,10," Can't think of anything I'd change! It's a 10 so far.
","I am not a ""misfit"" in the traditional sense but this show TOTALLY nails the feeling of not being good enough, not fitting in, not feeling like you're ""doing life right""... y'know, the feeling EVERYONE has to some degree or other. It's so relatable. And incredibly heartwarming already, only two episodes in (I teared up at some point watching each of them!).",/review/rw8039814/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2022,theredhairedcrow,8," Perfectly understated, promising and powerful
","The memories many have, of not quite fitting in in high school, of being the butt of cruel jokes and gossip then and sometimes decades later, especially if you're from a small town or community. Of still trying to be a good person, do good work and have a good life, but the losses, the banality of the privileged and being made to feel unwanted and weird because of how you look, who you love or don't love begin to add up and you feel lost and maybe even a loser.",/review/rw8039814/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2022,killercola,10," A beautiful slice of real life
","Unbelievably original, heartwarming and so relatable, especially for Gen X'ers. When I saw her pull out the yearbook and it was class of 87' I said, ""yep, this is for me."" So I watched the entire episode and it was fantastic. One of the best new shows on TV. If you see low reviews please ignore them. It's most likely millennial knuckleheads who only watch brainless superhero movies. This new show is a gem. And it's for us Gen Xers. Watch it.",/review/rw8039814/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2022,ketny601,9," Exactly my kind of show.
","I love this show! The actors are absolutely amazing, especially Bridget Everett and Jeff Hiller. Their portrayals are so real, funny and down to earth. Great show, I would recommend anyone to watch...although I'm sure not everyone will connect with it or appreciate its understated charm.",/review/rw8039814/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2022,paul-allaer,7," What is an outsider to do? ""Don't Give Up""
","""Somebody Somewhere"" (2022 release; 7 episodes of about 30 min each) brings the story of Sam, a 40-something woman in Manhattan, KS. As Episode 1 opens, Sam is at work in a test grading center, where she runs into a HS classmate of hers, a guy she doesn't remember at all (but he remembers her for her choir singing back in the day). Meanwhile we learn that Sam's sister Holly has passed away not too long ago (but we don't know the circumstances of Holly's passing). At this point we are less than 10 min into Episode 1.",/review/rw8039814/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2022,wushu2222,10," Am I alone in this.
",I have read a lot of reviews that seemed to trash this gem of a tv show.,/review/rw8039814/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2022,rkeilitz-19-537915,10," Real Life, Relatable Characters, Bittersweet and Fun
",Many Americans think that America is the East coast and the West coast and everything else in between just farmlands. In some ways this maybe true but there are real people out there with stories just like those that live on either coast. Many of them feel unremarkable and invisible to others yet they contribute much to the economy without fanfare or publicity.,/review/rw8039814/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2022,UniqueParticle,8," Pretty enjoyable
",I don't know why I didn't watch sooner but it flows very well and Bridgett Everett is magnificent throughout! A little off at times yet worth it regardless. Hard to say what the series is about except the quote about being more of a people person and family drama. I really Ike the comedy and how authentic everything is; some unfortunate realities talked about.,/review/rw8039814/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2022,Fujiko-san,10," So many feels
",I just absolutely ADORE this show.,/review/rw8039814/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2022,tracyleaogden,9," Only one episode in ....
","........ and I am hooked. It's relatable. I think for so many people, it will be. Maybe not all of it. But pieces of it.",/review/rw8039814/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2022,kjohoy,10," If you have grieved it is Relatable
","Loosing a loved one is one of the hardest things to endure, there are steps we all and each go through and this series shows them all in a empathetic way. Very relatable, the family dynamic is hard yet the character and friends are hilarious especially if you grew up in a small town. Give it chance you will laugh and enjoy it!!!",/review/rw8039814/?ref_=tt_urv
21 February 2022,staciarose20,7," I tune in every week.
","Can't say what it is about this show that's appealing because it's not exciting, nor does much of anything happen. It feels real, though. She's still navigating grief and finding her way in a small town. Making friends. I like the dynamic between Sam and Joel.",/review/rw8039814/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2022,millerwilliamh,10," maybe not quite a 10, but...
","Trying to make up for the ridiculous low reviews. If you have always been comfortable in your own skin, have a family free from disorders or tragedy and lack empathy, skip it. If half your life is in the rearview and you love to root for the underdogs in life then this is your show. The characters develop in real ways. I have watched most episodes twice waiting for more to drop.",/review/rw8039814/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2022,tkmce2008,10," Bridget Everett is excellent in this slice of life series set in small town USA
","The latest offering from HBO is a comedy drama set in Manhattan, Kansas. Starring comedian Bridget Everett in the lead as Sam, Somebody Somewhere is the story of how she navigates though life after her sister's death.",/review/rw8039814/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2022,ginaanimals,10," Not just for Gen X'ers
","I loved this show, anchored by Bridget Everett. Bridget plays Sam, who has recently returned home to her small Kansas town to care for her sister, who has just died. Life exists in a boring job completely devoid of passion. While still in mourning, a peer from high school show choir has penned a self published memoir about their experiences in High School, and is as mean as ever about her depiction of Samantha. Luckily, Sam reignites her friendship with a fellow classmate/workmate Joel, stunningly played by Jeff Hiller - an empath and long time admirer of Sam and especially her talent for singing. Through this new friendship buds a glimmer of hope for Sam.",/review/rw8039814/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2022,kattmorsan,10," Love it!
","A female lead character who is both overweight and without makeup, now that's something you don't see every day. Only seen two episodes but loves this feel good, funny series. It's like After Life only Sam does not constantly wallow in self pity and is actually nice to other people. And you don't have to listen to the c-word constantly. What's not to like?",/review/rw8039814/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2022,awake-76458,10," I usually wait
","To review a series so I can see if the ending resolves well, but not for this show. The actors are so good that I feel like I'm just watching them live - they say stupid things that hurt a friend and are authentic about resolving that. And they are really funny, too. As a community theater actor, I'm certain that in a coffee shop scene an actor flubbed their lines but the recovery was perfect. Just watch it.",/review/rw8039814/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2022,lisab61367,10," Love this so much!!!
",I can so relate to the characters. So easy to watch and enjoy. It's warm and funny. It also deals with real life issues. I have watched every episode so far and will be watching again! Already looking forward to season 2!,/review/rw8039814/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2022,jenniferpitt71,10," More shows like this please!!!!
","First of all I Love Bridget Everett! Everything I have seen her in has been great (likely because of her) This show was such a needed break from all of the other more intense shows. This just felt so real and normal in ways you can relate to. I laughed, I cried, and I can't wait for season 2!!",/review/rw8039814/?ref_=tt_urv
