5 April 2021,DeBBss,7," Improves With Each Act
","Cherry was such a strange watch for me. For the most part, the film was a 5/10. I was generally uninterested for the most part; but then the third act happened. The film spent so much time developing the characters and relationships, and when everything came together, it was just great cinema. The pacing was iffy, it was rather quick in the war portion of the film, but then slowed a lot in the third act. I think that when the film was finally doing what it was supposed to do, it was at its best. And the amazing soundtrack gets played so much more at the end; seriously, the soundtrack carried a lot in this movie.",/review/rw6870229/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2021,twilightmominohio,9," Don't listen to the critics!
","I think people are forgetting that this movie is based a a semi-autobiographical novel written by Nico Walker.
I first heard about this movie when my boyfriend had to remove some wires that were in the way for a scene they were filming back in early December of 2019. As Tom Holland fans, we were eagerly anticipating the release of this film. It's gritty, hard to watch at times, and highly emotional. The acting by Tom Holland and the rest of the cast was very well done.
I've read reviews with titles saying if you're a veteran you're going to be angry. But again, this is based on a real life account of an Iraq veteran dealing with his PTSD after coming home to Cleveland.
As a Clevelander, it was also interesting trying to recognize where some scenes were shot. The Russo brothers love their home town and we are grated they filmed it here, not elsewhere.
Bottom line, don't listen to the critics. Superb acting by Holland and a wonderful adaptation of the book.",/review/rw6870229/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2021,gotdayummm,10," As a 2004 Iraq War Vet, This hits home.
","The main thing I want to point out is the way the movie addresses PTSD. I served in the Marines during the same time as this movie is set, and Fallujah was no joke. When I came home I was having seizures and really bad nightmares myself. So addressing this in a more in depth was great.
Secondly the perspective of how a solider felt about the war was also handled very well. Way different than the movies like Jarhead.
All in all this is an excellent movie. I read a review that said this movie is trying too hard to be smart. It doesn't try, it is smart.",/review/rw6870229/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2021,gracerosadi,7," Dark and Depressing, Nevertheless Powerful Performance by Holland
","This film took effort to watch, some scenes are tough and upsetting but it just prove how great and phenomenal Tom Holland as an actor in this film, he really did push his limits which makes it an oscar-worthy performance.",/review/rw6870229/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2021,cyer32,9," 6.3 ??!!
","This is a dark, haunting, and beautiful film. Not sure what movie some of these reviewers were watching, but Cherry is incredible. Cannot recommend it enough. The subtle details that you'll miss if you're not paying attention make it all the more interesting. Will definitely watch this again after I have a chance to fully process it. Excellent work Russo Brothers, Tom and Ciara.",/review/rw6870229/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2021,tgainey14,9," My oldest brother is in recovery
",This is an incredibly accurate depiction of an addict. Tom kills it and I'd happily watch it again. It's definitely a long movie but it's worth the ride. Super dark though so be prepared.,/review/rw6870229/?ref_=tt_urv

15 March 2021,sammybeno,8," Pretty damn good
","I don't understand the low ratings. All this film does is show how much range Tom Holland and the Russo brothers have, that their not confined to the Marvel movies. Just watch and form your own opinion. Its good.",/review/rw6870229/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2021,laceup-96849,8," Critics are so wrong
","Its a good movie, yes the message is kind of confusing but still you can understand what's it trying to say, emotional film no doubt great performance by Tom and Ciara",/review/rw6870229/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2021,sailorman-12617,8," I don't understand the low ratings.
","Very briefly: Cherry is a brilliant movie and a fitting translation of the story of a real person. The pacing feels chaotic at times, compared to traditional movies, because real stories aren't paced like screenplays. The cinematography is nothing short of stunning, and most of the events are ugly to give a hint of the ugliness that is being translated from real life to a book and to a movie.
Tom Holland once again flexes his range as an actor, and the Russo Brothers continue to elevate cinema. Ciara Bravo didn't have too much to do in the movie, but I personally believe she aced her tonally contradicting scenes.",/review/rw6870229/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2021,darrel076,10," BELIEVABLE ADDICT. GOOD MOVIE.
","His acting as a junkie is on point. The movie was artistic at times and still hit he nail on the head.
I see these low reviewers and they are mainly little girls. They have ro be by how they talk., They clearly have no taste.
Enjoy the movie, it's good.",/review/rw6870229/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2021,arungeorge13,5," Tom Holland shines in a messy, dope-driven crime drama! [+49%]
","The post-Avengers-era Russos come with a truckload of directorial weight. We've almost forgotten their filmography prior to Winter Soldier. So, when they adapt Nico Walker's semi-autobiographical novel into a film with Tom Holland playing the protagonist, it's natural to have raised expectations. The outcome, however, is a mixed bag. Holland comes up with a mostly credible performance. As a college dropout and later, a drug addict, he delivers the goods with aplomb. The army scenes are where his performance seems a bit off. That could also be attributed to weak writing. Stylistically, Cherry is on the higher side. Several scenes play out like music videos. The jarring genre shifts (from romance to war to stoner to crime drama) between chapters affect the emotional payoff in the viewing experience.",/review/rw6870229/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2021,kabeyamarcelina,8," Tom Holland absolutely smashed it
","Tom Holland's acting was phenomenal, 11/10. Showcased his true talent - magnificent. The Russo Brothers over did it with how they set things up though; trying to be too smart in my opinion.",/review/rw6870229/?ref_=tt_urv

","There's a lot of critics out there. And a lot of them seem very keen to slate this as much as possible, beyond what seems objectively reasonable.",/review/rw6870229/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2021,mlivziey,8," Dark, emotional and illuminating
","Cherry is a film that takes on dark, depressing issues (addiction and PTSD). The film shines a light on these issues and the star of Tom Holland helped bring them into the spotlight. At times it had imperfections, but overall it was a memorable film with excellent performances.",/review/rw6870229/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2021,deloudelouvain,8," Great performances, drugs are bad m'kay...
","Second movie in a row for me featuring Tom Holland. After Chaos Walking, that was quite enjoyable to me as a fantasy movie and that despite the low ratings it got, this time Cherry, a powerful movie about PTSD but mostly about addiction, heroin addiction to be more precise. Not as powerful as The Basketball Diaries but certainly good enough to keep you far away from heroin after watching it. Tom Holland just nailed it here, very good performance playing his character. Ciara Bravo also did a good job. The destructive relationship they are in, the issues that both have, it's all well filmed and keeps you interested in the entire story. A long movie but never boring. Good to excellent cinematography, great cast, great story, what else can you ask for? Again an underrated movie with Tom Holland.",/review/rw6870229/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2021,ferguson-6,6," he likes trees ... and drugs
","Greetings again from the darkness. Brothers Anthony Russo and Joe Russo are known for their work with Marvel, including, AVENGERS: ENDGAME, and AVENGERS: INFIINITY WAR. This time they tackle a stylish crime-thriller based on the Nico Walker novel, and adapted for the screen by co-writers Angela Russo-Otsot (sister of the directors) and Jessica Goldberg. The Russos reunite with Tom Holland (Spider-Man in the Marvel universe), and he proves quite capable of carrying the heavy load in a bleak and somber drama.",/review/rw6870229/?ref_=tt_urv

","The two screenwriters who wrote this should find work in a new profession. One of the worst screenplays I've been subjected to in a long time. Tom Holland is a talented guy, but not talented enough to bring life to this dreck. Give it a wide miss.",/review/rw6870229/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2021,paulozavaleta-28773,10," An Extraordinary, Amazing and Sad Story, Tom Holland has proven he is worth Hold
","I don't care what critics say, Cherry is a good movie with a sad plot that will make you feel bad for the main characters, Tom Holland's performance is Oscar Worthy and Henry Jackman's music and The cinematography are great I would watch this movie again and again",/review/rw6870229/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2021,ohkcomputer,9," This is not your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man, this is Tom Holland being so much more than that
","Will keep this short: I'm expecting that a lot of the negative reviews come from people who expected a Toys R Us colorgraded Tom Holland Disneyflick. Jim Carrey took years to outgrow his stereotypical roles but Tom Holland is already way beyond being just Spider-Man, which role he embodies wonderfully might I add just as well. I'm expecting this to become a classic, highly underrated at release.",/review/rw6870229/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2021,Xstal,5," No Cherry on this Cake...
","... or icing for that matter. Fabulously forgettable and completely unoriginal - begging, borrowing and stealing from films you've seen aplenty and plenty done far better, the empathy required diluted, diffused and decayed as the lead is just too flimsy for the role and still presents as a child, even as a mature man approaching middle age, the theatrical moustache no help whatsoever.",/review/rw6870229/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2021,jens-58105,10," 10/10
","Wow. What a great piece of cinematic art. Tom Holland completely catches me off guard with this one. Because I was expecting the typical slightly above average, predictable type of movie. Now, after watching it it feels like I've discovered something new in movies in Tom Holland. Last time saw him he was Spiderman. Now he is a complex character I can relate to and sympathize with. This movie needs to be watched at a time you have said time to really invest in it. Enjoy this Shawshank Redemption meets Forest Gump type of movie. I loved it.",/review/rw6870229/?ref_=tt_urv

",The film opens with Cherry (Tom Holland) as a bank robber. The bulk of the film takes us up to that point and then beyond. Summary plot spoiler: Cherry goes to college. Meets Emily (Ciara Bravo) Joins army. Married. Iraq. PTSD. Drug addict. Bank robber. Prison rehab. Happily ever after. While it had some good scenes for the most part it was tedious to watch as the film dragged on. I was way too long. Tom Holland just wasn't that good or interesting.,/review/rw6870229/?ref_=tt_urv
