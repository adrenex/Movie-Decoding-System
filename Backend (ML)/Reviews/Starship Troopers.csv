5 April 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,9," Sadly, they don't make movies like this anymore.
","All star casting and performances, creative and suspenseful writing, excellent directing, and spot on cinematography and score. A little far fetched you say? Maybe not if you're RICH rich. Either way, that's the point, and why it was so fun! Maybe one day we'll see a Part 2. A well deserved 9/10 from me.",/review/rw2536848/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2016,Leofwine_draca,9," Twisty-turny thriller makes for compelling viewing
","A thriller that is actually thrilling? A complex film which is actually easy to follow? Well, it doesn't happen very often, but occasionally a certain director can pull off a potentially baffling movie and turn it into something of a masterpiece. This is the case with THE GAME, a typically dark and mysterious, occasionally disturbing film from director David Fincher. It's very much in the style of Fincher's other films, so it might be a good idea to have some idea of what to expect with this one. Basically, nothing is what it seems and the whole perception of reality and normal life is subverted in THE GAME, which starts off with a typical businessman in a typically dull life and soon goes off in some very strange directions indeed. Okay, so it's mightily implausible and some parts just don't make sense when you think about them a lot, but this is a darn sight better than most contemporary thrillers which are content to rehash old ideas and styles. Yes, it's original, and yes, it's a cracker.",/review/rw2536848/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2005,Theo Robertson,7," Worth Watching - But Only Once
",THE GAME is the type of movie that was very popular at the turn of the century - One that has a great twist in the tail . Unfortunately when the great twist is revealed the film comes crashing down . The producers may claim that that THE GAME is more of a journey than a destination whereby the audience are transported somewhere but the more you think about the plot at the end of the line the more the audience will complain that the journey was a little too contrived to be worth going back on the same route ,/review/rw2536848/?ref_=tt_urv

12 December 2008,Lucabrasisleeps,10," A Classic Thriller
",I have to say I didn't expect this. I didn't have great expectations when I saw this. Especially considering the cold reception given to it by critics and audiences alike. But it is one of the most original Hollywood thrillers ever.,/review/rw2536848/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2018,planktonrules,9," I was surprised how much I enjoyed this one.
","Sean Penn is not the most popular celebrity and has created a few enemies over the years. However, this does not make his performance nor the film ""The Game"" something to avoid...and considering I am no fan of him as a person, the fact I loved the movie so much says a lot. THE GAME is exceptional...and you'd be doing yourself a favor by watching it. THE GAME is one heck of a great film, as I give it a well-deserved score of 9 because it's so well written and entertaining. It is one of the most exciting and riveting films of recent memory. You've got to see this film! I'll say no more because I don't want to spoil it.",/review/rw2536848/?ref_=tt_urv
20 May 2007,MaxBorg89,9," Tight, twisted and tense - one of the most interesting thrillers of the '90s
","Having conquered the critics (and the box-office) with Se7en, David Fincher could have ""sold out"" and kept delivering more of the same. Fortunately, he was wise enough to try different paths, and although all his movies can be classified as thrillers there's no real similarity between them, except maybe a common theme of alienation and solitude.",/review/rw2536848/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2020,Xstal,8," Wild Game...
","Like 'A Christmas Carol' with the ghosts replaced by 'Interesting Events', enough to make the most self absorbed think again. Wholly unrealistic in its portrayal but intensely engaging with some boomerangs to navigate and some thoughtful reflections to ponder.",/review/rw2536848/?ref_=tt_urv
17 June 2018,classicsoncall,7," ""This is your game Nicholas, and welcome to it.""
","What I'll say about ""The Game"" is what I say about a lot of action/thriller films. As you're watching, the story engages with an innovative concept, uses clever twists and delivers excitement at a visceral level. But then, when you have time to reflect on the story, it kind of falls apart when you consider what would have been required to pull it all off. This one relied on Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) to make the decisions precisely that he did, especially at the very end when his attempted suicide was thwarted to put an end to the game. How did the 'Game' manipulators know he would even think of something like that? Sure they ran that psychological profile, but by the time came when he shot his brother Conrad (Sean Penn), Van Orton's judgment would have been severely put to the limit to act rationally.

18 April 2002,Agent10,8," ....and when it was all over, I was blown away
","Very few films have captured my attention the way The Game did. Every turn, every corner seemed to have some hint of intrigue and deception. This film would be the life's work for any major film maker, but then again, this David Fincher were talking about.",/review/rw2536848/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2020,Criticalstaff,8," A brilliantly executed mind-trick
","I have always loved the Game. It sits right between The Truman Show and The Matrix as these 90's weird deconstructions of reality and sci-fi with a hint of social commentary on media. It was really the decade where TV and movies discovered the awesome power these new images had, and trying to reconcile their own moral hazard (spoiler alert: they did not). In The Game, Michael Douglas' character has basically a feature film inserted in his life. With a rewatch there are some little details that stand out and you realize easily none of this would work for real. But it works for the audience and as such it works as a movie.",/review/rw2536848/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2021,safenoe,7," Ages well over time
","I saw The Game just a few nights ago and I was captivated for sure. Yes you have to suspend your disbelief, but so what? It's a meta-movie that keeps you guessing to the end. It's an honor that the Simpsons referenced the ending in the episode Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind.",/review/rw2536848/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2016,Mr-Fusion,4," What a rip-off
","For the most part, ""The Game"" is a decent thriller. You question what is and isn't real, and Michael Douglas does a great job of selling the character's descent into paranoid angst (the whole thing's on his shoulders, and it's an admirable performance, mostly). But even so, in a movie that puts your protagonist through all manner of doubt and peril, I might've cared about his character were the direction not so detached. This movie is cold. Stylish, sure, but definitely clinical.",/review/rw2536848/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2005,Bogmeister,9," Play to the End of Your Life
","The Game weaves its way into and around your brain, challenging you to figure out the puzzle. It's a rather unique film experience because of that no-holds-barred challenge - it challenges you to figure out what's coming next, in a direct way not many other films attempt. It's a thinking person's film; whether it's actually intelligent or not probably depends on the individual, but I'd like to think it's pretty smart. Also pretty smart is the character played by Michael Douglas - business smarts, that is. Douglas was near the end of a roll playing businessmen, began in Wall Street(87). He becomes involved with an odd company, CRS, introduced to him by his younger brother (Sean Penn in a small role). What begins as amusing distraction for his orderly world soon turns sinister.",/review/rw2536848/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 1998,Benzzo,10," As gripping as it gets.
","Whether you love it or hate it, The Game definitely will not bore you.  By far the most engrossing movie I've ever watched.  I saw this on the big screen and throughout most of this masterpiece I kept asking myself, ""where is this movie going?""  For 128 spirited minutes The Game takes your mind and twists it ruthlessly, contorting it in any way it so desires.  Michael Douglas is the perfect actor for this role, he played it flawlessly.  I love this movie, it's definitely one of my personal favorites.",/review/rw2536848/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2012,gwnightscream,7," Terrific Thriller!
","Michael Douglas, Sean Penn and Deborah Kara Unger star in this 1997 thriller. A man is drawn into a mysterious game after his brother gives him a birthday present. Nicholas Van Orton (Douglas) is a bitter, wealthy businessman who lives in San Francisco. His brother, Conrad (Penn) gives him a birthday present involving a game that could change his life. Nicholas accepts and enrolls in the company, CRS (Consumer Recreation Services) providing the game and Nicholas becomes drawn into a devastating nightmare. He meets a woman, Christine (Unger) who helps him and could be part of the game. This is definitely one of Michael's best, he and Sean are great together and Howard Shore's score is also great. I recommend this terrific thriller.",/review/rw2536848/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2010,sddavis63,4," It's Completely Lacking In Credibility
","I like psychological suspense-thrillers. What makes them work really well is believability. No matter how outlandish the story may seem, there has to be at least a bit of your brain that's saying as you watch ""I could see that happening."" That's when you get drawn into the story. That's when suspense takes hold. That's when you begin to be able to feel the fear of the main characters. That's when a psychological suspense-thriller works really well. Unfortunately, ""The Game"" doesn't work really well. It doesn't do any of the above. It's simply not believable. Never once in the movie (or at least once we were introduced to the game that Nicholas Van Orten was playing) did I have the thought that ""I could see this happening."" Never. It was too outlandish. Think about it. In order for this game to work, pretty much the entire City of San Francisco would have had to have been onside. Van Orten could have done any number of things or (and here's the real problem) encountered any number of people who - not being in on the game - could have changed things completely. The game (to me at least) is unworkable; unplayable. Since that was my feeling right from the start, I didn't get pulled in by the story. I found it long and drawn out. The writers tried valiantly to keep me on my toes by throwing twists and turns and surprises - but I really didn't care, because I just didn't believe any of it. Too bad.",/review/rw2536848/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 1999,geiri,7," Impressive movie
","Nicholas Van Orton, a successful businessman lives a good life until an unexpected birthday gift from his brother destroys it all. Nicholas has been enrolled in a game - ""a profound life experience"" that begins quietly but soon erupts in a rush of devastating events. Van Orton has to win this deadly game or lose control of everything in his life. And this time money and power are meaningless. This is a suspense/thriller, that does manage to hold one's attention. The film stars Michael Douglas and Sean Penn. Deborah Kara Unger (David Cronenberg's ""Crash"") turns in a fine supporting roll as well. Davd Fincher, director of Seven and Aliens 3, continues to set high standards for motion picture making. This lastest entree of Fincher's does not lose a beat in delivering the maximum impact of the story. This movie will get into your head. It will keep you guessing the whole time. If you don't give this movie a chance you'll never know what you missed.",/review/rw2536848/?ref_=tt_urv

11 April 2003,MovieAddict2016,6," Hitchcock Would Be Proud--If it Didn't Have So Many Darn Plot Holes...
","Conspiracies. Films tend to be made about conspiracies and mysteries. Everyone has conspiracy theories that they put in movies (""JFK,"" ""Conspiracy Theory""). ""The Game"" is a different kind of conspiracy. It is about an entire organization holding something against one man. Only a few people know about this organization and what it does in the movie, it seems. But if only a handful of people know about the organization, how could it possibly get booming business? That's one of the many, many plot holes that ""The Game"" seems to have. It just has too many plot holes to save itself. It has a pretty good plot, good acting, good directing...even a good script...but the plot holes in the script cause the problems.",/review/rw2536848/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2018,silarpac,5," Good start, then the ending was bad.
","This film made sense up to about 3/4 of the way through. We had a suspense crime drama with exciting plot twists and a Scrooge-like protagonist getting his comeuppance, so far so good. But at the end the writers decide to throw a plot curve ball that misses the strike zone by a mile. It turns out that all the machine guns, explosions, attempted murder, and psychological terror was just a joke and it was all just good clean fun. Huh? Who would pay an organization to drive their client to the point of attempting suicide??? Why the client's brother of course! He did it because his brother was becoming ""such an asshole"" and he wanted to help him. ",/review/rw2536848/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2011,tavm,8," David Fincher's The Game gets another fine performance from star Michael Douglas
","Just watched this suspense thriller directed by David Fincher and starring Michael Douglas on HD DVD. Douglas is a broker in San Francisco who's about to have a birthday coming up. His brother Sean Penn gives him a present in the form of a possible membership in a company with the initials C.R.S. I'll stop there and just say that while things get unbelievably ridiculous, one gets curious anyway because of how one just wants see what they would do next. Fine supporting performances by Deborah Kara Unger as ""Christine"", Armin Mueller-Stahl, and James Rebhorn as someone connected with C.R.S. in more ways than one. Really, all I'll say now is I highly recommend The Game.",/review/rw2536848/?ref_=tt_urv
