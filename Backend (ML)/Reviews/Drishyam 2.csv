17 December 2013,gogoschka-1,10," In one word: perfection
","Needs to be seen to be believed; in one word: perfection. Every frame, every voice-over, every song - it all comes together at the exact right moment to create the perfect film experience. This film makes you really understand and feel what makes the American mafia so compelling; in the eyes of a kid, who was unfortunate enough to grow up in a tough neighborhood, those gangsters are rock stars. Live fast, die young - but when you die, it ain't gonna be of a glamorous suicide or drug overdose - the ending will be brutal, ugly and sad. And it may very well be one of your best friends that will blow your brains out.",/review/rw8186181/?ref_=tt_urv

18 November 2009,AlsExGal,10," The best mobster film ever made
","After you see this movie, all other mobster movies you see or ever have seen will seem like garbage. They and their cast of characters will all appear cartoonish in comparison. Of course, this is a movie about the mafia from the working man/gangster point of view, where ""The Godfather"" was a mafia movie filmed from the viewpoint of the executive suite, so there really is no valid comparison there. ""Goodfellas"" really does seem ahead of its time when you realize that the only artistic work about the mafia that compares to it in quality is the HBO series ""The Sopranos"", which debuted nine years after this movie was made.",/review/rw8186181/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10," A great director at the peak of his talents
","It is hard to describe the brilliance that is Goodfellas. As good as Raging Bull and Taxi Driver are, I think Goodfellas is Martin Scorsese's best film and is a textbook example of a great director at the peak of his talents. The film crackles with raw energy and enthusiasm, the film is superbly directed and the final sequence is nothing short of stunning. The script is also excellent with memorable quotes, the story is never less than compelling and the pop and rock soundtrack is winning. The cinematography and detail is immaculate, and the ensemble cast is one of film's finest. Joe Pesci won an Oscar for his performance, and as good as he was, he is perfectly matched by Robert DeNiro and Ray Liotta. All in all, it is a brilliant film and an instant classic no matter what time, day, week or year. 10/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw8186181/?ref_=tt_urv

11 April 2005,OriginalMovieBuff21,10," The greatest mob film still today
","Amazing is the one and only word to say for this film. I have always thought that Goodfellas was one of the greatest films ever made and set a landmark in the 90's or even in movie history. I bought Goodfellas last week and I got to watch the film a couple days ago. I really just couldn't lay my eyes off the film and everything about it was just simply worth watching. The acting was excellent, Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and other actors did great and almost all of the characters they portrayed were 100% accurate. The camera-work also was brilliant and Martin Scorsese does a beautiful job by putting excellent camera shots in his films and I give him high credit for that. The soundtrack too is one of the best soundtracks ever made and the song ""Layla,"" put chills down my spine of how great this song fitted the film. Overall, Martin Scorsese made his best film in my opinion and him and Nicholas Pileggi made an excellent and sharp script that made this, the greatest mob film still today.",/review/rw8186181/?ref_=tt_urv

21 July 2000,tfrizzell,," The Definitive Film of the 1990s
","""GoodFellas"" may be the most important film of the 1990s in the fact that its incredible success led to some of the other great movies of the decade. Films like ""The Silence of the Lambs"", ""The Crying Game"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""The Usual Suspects"", ""Fargo"", and ""L.A. Confidential"" would have likely never been made as well as they were without the influence of Scorsese's ""GoodFellas"".  The film is an intense study of a Mafia family over a 30-year stretch.  Ray Liotta plays the half-Irish, half-Sicilian kid from Brooklyn whose only dream is to be a gangster.  Although Liotta's story is at the heart of ""GoodFellas"", it is the supporting cast that is the film's calling card.  Robert DeNiro gives one of his greatest performances, Paul Sorvino is quietly effective, and Lorraine Bracco (in an Oscar-nominated role) does the best work of her career.  However, it is Joe Pesci (in his well-deserved Oscar-winning turn) who steals every scene as the one who does the ""dirty work"".  This is probably the definitive film in a decade that produced many film-noir styled classics.  5 stars out of 5.",/review/rw8186181/?ref_=tt_urv

17 March 2003,Infofreak,," Simply a masterpiece. Scorsese's last truly great movie (to date).
","'Goodfellas' is a masterpiece, pure and simple. While not my favourite Martin Scorsese movie it is a stunning achievement, and one of his very best movies. The film is stunning technically. The consistently fine acting by the large ensemble cast (both known and unknown), the cinematography, editing, dialogue, brilliant use of music, it's all breathtaking. But Scorsese and co-writer Mitch Pileggi never lose lose sight of their main goal - to tell a story. And in that it's really hard to beat this movie. As to the actors De Niro is on top form, Ray Liotta is the best he's ever been, and this is Joe Pesci's definitive performance. Plus you have Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino, Michael Imperioli, and lots of well known faces in small but important roles (Debi Mazar, Samuel L. Jackson, Illeana Douglas, Kevin Corrigan), plus dozens of unfamiliar actors (and non-actors) who are all so good it seems unfair just to single out the ""stars"". (Also keep an eye out for Vincent Gallo in a few scenes. He has no lines, but looks cool!). 'Goodfellas' is (to date) Scorsese's last Great Movie, and one of the very best films of the 1990s. Absolutely essential viewing for any movie fan, this tremendous film is not to be missed! Highly recommended!",/review/rw8186181/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2016,Leofwine_draca,10," Scorsese's masterpiece stands the test of time
","Martin Scorsese's unflinching portrayal of life in the mafia is a rightly acclaimed epic, at times funny, depressing but most of all frightening, all the more so because it's based on a true story. Basically it's the story of Ray Liotta's character's rise and fall in the mafia, and the way his relationships change with the various figures there as times come and go.",/review/rw8186181/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2004,arthurclay,," The Mob...Revealed
","The movie that dispelled the romantic myths about La Cosa Nostra and showed it as it really was.  ""The Godfather"" for the 90's minus the silly notions of love, honor, and family.  Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) is a half-Irish, half-Italian who rises to prominence in Paul Cicero's (Paul Sorvino) Lucchese Crime Family along with Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci).  This is his story of hi-jacking, stealing, cheating, killing and finally drug dealing.  He makes no excuses about what he does. Simply put he is just doing business and trying to survive on the mean streets of New York City.  He explains the trials and tribulations of being a mobster and what it's like to have to do these things and live with the consequences.  Cicero, an aging old-time underboss, heads a dangerous and powerful organization that enjoys free reign over the neighborhood in which Hill lives and recruits him when he is only a kid to work for them and learn to ""score"" more specifically, the art of committing crime.  Hill quickly hooks up with veteran criminal Jimmy ""The Gent"" and his protege Tommy to hi-jack trucks from the Idlewild Airport.  This makes these three rich and respected in the underworld but there is a new game in town.  Narcotics. They quickly undertake this highly profitable business even though they know it is against the expressed rules of Paulie.  This combined with another serious rule violation and the score of a lifetime sets them up for their own possible demise.  Lorraine Bracco co-stars as Henry's wife.  A marvelous true life story of one of the most violent and profitable street crews in the history of the American Mafia.  The best movie of 1990.",/review/rw8186181/?ref_=tt_urv
15 February 2007,bkoganbing,9," The Criminal Mindset
","The gangster film has been redefined so many times in cinema history it will be interesting to see how it is redefined once again. Goodfellas is a milestone film in that regard because just as Public Enemy and Little Caesar defined it in the Thirties, The Godfather trilogy in the seventies and eighties, Goodfellas set the standard that all other films including Martin Scorsese similar Casino try to meet. The interesting thing is that Martin Scorsese is young enough to redefine it again with another work.",/review/rw8186181/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 1999,baumer,10," Scorsese's best
","Goodfellas makes you feel like you are watching guys that you know or knew. To this day, I have a friend that still talks like Jimmy Two Times. He always says things like ""Nice Nice"" and that was just a background piece in Goodfellas. But that is the point, all that is background is just as important as the main players and locales. It all paints us a perfect picture of what mob life must be like. And with all due kudos to The Godfather, but there is no other film that has ever made mob life look so real and feel so tangible the way Goodfellas does.",/review/rw8186181/?ref_=tt_urv

29 May 2007,Robert_duder,6," As good as those fellas are...I just don't get it
","I have nothing against gangster films and I love Deniro, and Liotta and Pesci...in moderation...The Godfather were brilliant films and I finally made my way around to seeing the infamously talked about 'Goodfellas.' I don't get it. I'll take the heat from any fans and I know there are scores of them...Goodfellas was average at best and simply a trashy look at a mobster from childhood to his end in the mob with some decent but over the top performance, brutally gratuitous language and violence. I suppose in some circles that equivalents to a great film but I need far more. I mean even the story has little depth to it and it's more or less an extended episode of The Sopranos without the character depth. I suppose after having the film hyped for years and hearing about the 'classic' I had high expectations but for me it was run of the mill, annoyingly loud and abrasive but with some good direction. Scorsese knows how to make an epic from beginning to end starting the film in the 50's and 60's and taking it all the way to the mid 80's is a challenge and he does it flawlessly. The gritty underworld, the dark lighting, the facial expressions all very good but put to a pointless story and sub par characters unfortunately.",/review/rw8186181/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2005,shanfloyd,8," A classic mobster film.
","This is one hell of a film about the mobsters, based on a true story and coming from one of the great directors of all time. This is about Henry Hill, the narrator of the story, an Irish simple person who gets involved with the Mafia at a very young age and continues his life through it. There is no major plot in this film, just isolated incidents one of which was the turning point of Hill's life. Scorsese, as brilliant as he ever was, shows violence, sex and drugs etc in his own trademark style. And his actors helps him to make this film one of the classics.",/review/rw8186181/?ref_=tt_urv

","Goodfellas is a gem, never get tired watching it and it's very fun to watch. One of the best Scorcese films along with Casino ( I know there are other films). Love all the characters and Liotta stands out (RIP) - my absolute favorite scene is when he's joking around with Pesci and tells him he's a funny guy; I read that that scene was improvised.
