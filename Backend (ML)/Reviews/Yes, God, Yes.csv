4 April 2019,cardsrock,6," Sorely lacking heart
","You'd think a movie called Dumbo would be more about Dumbo. There are so many side plots and needless characters that it complicates a relatively straightforward story. There are a few moments of wonder, but they are far too few in between predictable tropes. Tim Burton was an odd choice to direct this film as well. The whole film is covered with his trademark murky aesthetic and it just doesn't fit. Danny DeVito is the only saving grace as far as actors. He is fantastic while Keaton hams it up and plays the over the top bad guy. Danny Elfman's score is decent. The film is just kind of boring though. It's so paint-by-numbers and lacking in imagination. Disney hopefully learns from this with any future live-action remakes of animated classics.",/review/rw4761586/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2019,ironhorse_iv,7," No! I'm not drunk & seeing pink elephants. I'm serious. I like this remake. It's a Guilty Pleasure.
","From all the recent Walt Disney live action remakes of their classic animation films as of this writing; this one directed by Tim Burton is perhaps my favorite. I really did enjoyed this motion picture loosely based upon the storyline written by Helen Aberson. This flick was not a shot for shot remake of the 1941 animation film of the same name at all. It gave us something new with the story. Instead of slow burn focusing only on Dumbo's conflict of being an outcast within the circus because of his big ears. This motion picture written by Ehren Kruger solve that quickly by tighten the pace revealing Dumbo ability to fly early in the first act. It's in the second part that the film's true conflicts center on cruel people trying to exploit Dumbo's talent. Because of that, it made watching this movie a unique and interesting watch. The plot wasn't simpleton. It had some complex subplots that I kinda dig such as World War I amputee & ex-equestrian performer Holt Farrier (Colin Farrell) having to deal with the loss of his circus job, his wife & his working arm, while managing a social family connection with his children, Milly (Nico Parker) and Joe (Finley Hobbins). Colin was fine actor in this. You really do see the depth and struggles his character has to go through. The kids not so much. They were a bit wooden and dull in their performances. Despite that I like how at least in this version, there is more genuinely kind circus workers like them. Nearly all the human characters in the original were awful avaricious antagonistic creatures. As for the villains in this remake. Rufus Sorghum played by Phil Zimmerman was somewhat stereotypical weak. However, I did like was the cryptic jab from Burton and Kruger on their employer. Like the clowns in the original movie representing the picketers during the 1941 animator strike. In this film, fictional theme park businessman V.A Vandevere (Michael Keaton) could be seen as the dark side of Walt Disney, a greedy cold entrepreneur who indifferent to the wellbeing of his workers. Keaton did a hell of a job showing that. By far, the sequences in Dreamland and him are the best thing about this movie. Eva Green as V.A's love interest, French trapeze Colette Marchant was not. The over the top snobby French accent was too much. Sadly, also Colin and Eva don't share much chemistry whenever they are put together nor with the kids. Because of that, the whole heel to face turn toward the end didn't seem believable. The love story between them felt kinda rushed. I also didn't like how her character treat Dumbo for most of the film by kicking and jumping on him kinda rough. There was barely any sign of care for the elephant. . I really wanted Colette to fall to her death. Such an unlikeable character. Despite that, I do like the social commentary about the issues of using wild animals in entertainment. Maybe they do belong in the wild. The new ending involving Dumbo going back to Asia is such a better climax than the original movie which had the elephant continue to work for people exploiting his talent. Nevertheless, one thing that this remake doesn't do a good job on is comedy. Jokes involving a circus monkey bothering supporting character, Max Medici (Danny DeVito) came across as frightening rather than funny. Regardless DeVito does do a good scrappy performance as the ringmaster. Much better than Michael Buffer appearing as the ringmaster at Dreamland. That cameo was jarring. Still, I would had rather have Timothy the mouse in this rather than that awful monkey. As for the CGI, it works even if some of the background atmospherically visuals are highly dark & creepy for younger audiences like the Pink Elephants on Parade. This movie still had enough cute and bright stuff to look at. I love how Dumbo's expressions are expressed through body language & facial. Without any talking animal dialogue, it still easy to pick up on Dumbo's emotions especially during putting out the fire scene. Another thing due to the elimination of original talking animal characters like the highly offensive controversial racially insensitive Sambo like black crows that taught Dumbo how to fly from the first movie; catchy songs like 'When I see an Elephant Fly' were omitted until the end of the closing credits. Regardless of that, I still like Arcade Fire & Sharon Rooney cover of 'Baby of Mine' throughout the film. Even Aurora's version from the trailer was fine as well. As for the other songs from the 1941 version like 'Casey Junior is back' and 'Look Out for Mr. Stork', they weren't really needed due to the realistic tone. In its place of, Danny Elfman's score was well done. It was magically. Overall: While live action Dumbo fails to reach the lofty heights of its animated predecessor. I still believe the film is watchable for those willing to shell the expensive high movie theater ticket price. For me, it pass with flying colors. So do yourself a favor and check it out. Hopefully, you will enjoy it as much as my family and I did.",/review/rw4761586/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2019,FrenchEddieFelson,7," Let's be kid again! Let's fly!!
","A must see. 80 years after the eponymous cartoon, Tim Burton appropriated pertinently this story, preserving the magic and the poetry but modernizing it, by adding new characters and encrusting spectacular computer-generated animals. In particular, Dumbo is such a cutie and his look is a total success: his eyes are extremely expressive and he is so adorable. This is otherwise not a surprise for a Burton: the atmosphere is darker compared to the cartoon. In three words: I loved it!",/review/rw4761586/?ref_=tt_urv

","Dumbo is the latest Disney remake this year and is directed by Tim Burton. It stars Danny DeVito,Micheal Keaton,Colin Farrell and Eva Green and tells the tale of a widowed father named Holt Farrier(Farrell) who just came back from World War I where he lost his left limb due to the war. When his kids witness an elephant giving birth to a baby elephant,they are both shocked that the baby was born with big ears,resulting in the elephant to be made fun of at the circus when he gets older. However when an evil businessman named V. A Vandervere(Keaton) wants to take over the circus,can Holt,Mike(DeVito) and Holt's kids save both Dumbo and his mother?",/review/rw4761586/?ref_=tt_urv

29 March 2019,robfollower,9," I'll be darned if it still doesn't pack a punch ... that is, if you believe.
","Tim Burton, the all-new grand live-action adventure ""Dumbo"" expands on the beloved classic story where differences are celebrated, family is cherished and dreams take flight. There are more than a few changes made to the beloved 1940 classic. This time out, the focus is more on how the title character's physics-defying abilities affect the humans around him. ""Dumbo"" also has a darker overtone . I rather enjoyed the twist. As you would expect from a Burton production, this is a visual knockout. Dumbo is about the cutest pixelated creature you're likely to see, and he's a wonder to behold. Yet it's the reaction of the marginalized characters to his amazing feats that are the key to the film. When Dumbo soars, they soar with him his success is their success as he defies everyone's preconceptions of him by simply believing in himself.",/review/rw4761586/?ref_=tt_urv

","Wow, talk about marketing deception, When i first saw the trailers for Dumbo I was wowed, the magic was there on the screen. However when I actually paid for a ticket to see this movie, I felt as though I had walked into another theater and was duped. This movie was a travesty from the get go. The kid actors were the absolute worst, they were SO ANNOYING. All the actors were miscast, you felt disconnected and there was no magic at all. By far one of the worst Disney remakes in history and one of the worst films of the year. AVOID AT ALL COST!",/review/rw4761586/?ref_=tt_urv

1 April 2019,jjones929,2," Remake it, don't rewrite it
","This was an embarrassing remake of Dumbo.
First, the hue or color tone of the movie was so unnatural, almost campy, like I had stumbled into a showing of Batman and Robin. It distracted me constantly reminding me that I was at the movies watching actors instead of being part of a story. Secondly, the young female actress did not help that situation at all. She presence was very distracting. Her acting was wooden and unbelievable. She was a carny's kid, living in a circus in 1919 but in every scene, she looked like she had just gotten out of the shower. It was hard to watch.
Finally, who is green lighting these Disney's screenplays? Fire all of them! This movie was called Dumbo but it was about so many other things the elephant and the real story that was told in the original was lost or buried. I was looking forward to these remakes but if they continue to rewrite them I will pass on the rest.",/review/rw4761586/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2019,CubsandCulture,3," ""This is a disaster"" Couldn't agree more character I have no idea why you are in the film...
","This is one of the few films I would describe as self-loathing. I honestly don't know what to make of some of the choices the creative team makes. What do you make of a Disney film in which the villain is a Walt Disney stand-in? Keaton's character is puzzling and needlessly complicates the plot. What to make of a film centered on a circus that seems to hate circuses? Burton has always had a lot of obsessions and (too) personal touches in his films. But the way the camera here lingers on certain sets is garish and obsessive to the point of being kitsch. Garish is a good word for this film. It's chock full of unneeded details, forced whimsy, and bizarre sidebars such that the film simply doesn't form a singular entity.",/review/rw4761586/?ref_=tt_urv

","...because this film is rather dull, and the direction is certainly dull, and 10 years ago I would not have called Tim Burton a boring director. He's certainly working with two of his ""regulars"" - DeVito, who has not lost a step in all these years and next to CGI Dumbo is the best thing about the film.
And then there is Burton's other ""regular"" - Michael Keaton, as the rich villain. How weird for Disney to make a film with a guy who could be Walt Disney as the villain! ""Dreamland"" is certainly an allegory for ""Disneyland"".",/review/rw4761586/?ref_=tt_urv
15 June 2019,michaelseither,7," Enjoyable family movie. Strong cast. Part remake, part new story. Different but enjoyable
","I had to write a review to add a sense of reality to many of the crazy 1 star reviews. Please, 1 star? Awful? Nonsense. Great cast, great production value, remake of a classic (as well as a new take on an old story). Didn't see any political correctness or bad acting or poor CGI. Nonsense. Full of great actors. Emotional story, well made. It's a good movie. I only gave it 7 stars because it's not a great movie but I didn't feel cheated at all and was glad I (we) saw it. If you liked the original at all, you'll want to see the remake. It is a little darker than Disney of old and Tim Burton's visions are unique but all in all I thought it was fun, unusual and worth our time. Don't pay attention to the 1 star reviews, they are nonsense.",/review/rw4761586/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2019,ZombieGirlORV,2," You know this story, and it isn't Dumbo
","They really managed to overcomplicate a sweet and simple storyline, causing the original message to get lost in an entirely different story, the same story which Hollywood has been shoving down our throats repeatedly the last ten or so years. It's getting old. This 'new' message of 'large corporations bad/underdogs good', followed the cliché that all successful businessmen are greedy, heartless, power-hungry monsters who'll do anything to get what they want. An overplayed roll at the best of times. Surprisingly the main character was no longer Dumbo, but a little girl, who fit the cookie cutter Hollywood standard: Little girl who overcomes the patriarchy, (represented in this instance by her father), to live her dream of being a scientist. Again, the same story we've had shoved down our throats in countless other movies has now taken over one of Disney's most classic stories of self-discovery. It was entirely disappointing. You see, at the theaters we have a unique opportunity to escape politics and everyday life to live in a world of fantasy for whatever brief period we've been allotted to go there. Disney believed that if you're only catering to children then you've already failed at entertaining. I'd like to add upon that by saying that if you only aim to tell the same story repeatedly, injecting it in to previous stories that were perfect good without it, then you've failed at story telling. Somewhere along the line Hollywood only managed to remember a single story in the vast empire of stories it's accumulated throughout the years, and that story is what was represented here. Not Dumbo, the story which Disney brought to life and inspired millions with over generations. But the same story you've seen in a hundred movies over the past few years. Why bother going to watch it at all? You already know the story, and it isn't Dumbo...
Okay that was harsh. Positive sides of this monstrosity now...The acting was good, despite the butchered storyline. The actors did an amazing job...AND special effects were pretty cool as well, so good on the special effect's artists, that could not have been easy...As that's 2 positive traits I was able to find, I think it's fair I give the movie at least 2 stars.",/review/rw4761586/?ref_=tt_urv

","The elephant is really cute and there are some scenes which are quite emotional, but after the initial flight, there's little amazement or awe to see. Visually it looks very good but overall, I found it a cold and dark experience, especially when it shifted from the family run circus to the corporation style theme park with its art deco design and stereotypical villains.

Great actors? This has that. An interesting story? Got it. Stunning visuals? Check. Drama? Sad moments? Happy moments? Nostalgia? Fantastic score? Elements from the original? A warm fuzzy ending? PINK ELEPHANTS?!! (It has all those things).
In this day of opinions and people depending on screens to LIVE...I think we've forgotten the magic of the ORIGINAL screen. What happened to just going to a movie, and enjoying it for what it is? What is so EXCITING about your life that you find this boring? Umm there are a couple circuses and a freaking flying elephant in this movie!! To me, that's interesting enough.
And the sweet sweet storyline between Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo. Perhaps only the moms out there can relate...but there is NOTHING like the bond between a mama and her baby, and I loved that the story had a great deal of that to offer.",/review/rw4761586/?ref_=tt_urv
21 July 2019,jessbir-23618,7," honestly not that bad
",After reading all the terrible reviews for Dumbo my expectations where very low going into the theatre and I came out genuinely surprised. the movie has very many flaws one of them being Nico Parker who plays Millie even though she is very charming her acting is pretty bad especially compared to the rest of the cast who all did a very good job. another flaw for me is the lack of colour almost every single scene has this dark murky texture to it that isn't very appealing. but I did very much enjoy this remake and I honestly don't think its that bad. for the most part the acting is very good especially from Eva Green who for me was the true stand out of the entire movie I found her acting the most believable and impressive. Dumbo is absolutely adorable and steals every single scene he is in and the flying parts of the movie are absolutely gorgeous and magical. the baby mine scene though not as emotional as it was in the animated movie is done beautifully here and it still made me tear up a little bit. the pink elephants on parade scene was absolutely brilliant and in my opinion was one of the better scenes in the entire movie. overall despite all the flaws I really enjoyed Dumbo and would watch it again.,/review/rw4761586/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2019,Troy_Campbell,4," Devoid of splendour.
","Spinning such a classic animated film into a live-action yarn is no easy feat. Stick too close to the source material and it becomes redundant, veer too far away and you risk losing the essence of what made the original a classic in the first place. Tim Burton takes on the unenviable job and, unfortunately, fails to deliver. This is not a bad movie by any means, in fact there are many positives to be found, but this remake commits one unforgivable sin that trumps all else: it's boring. There are the usual Burton eccentricities splashed across the screen - an old-school circus is ripe for his weirdness - yet even this seems to be well and truly on his safe side, the oddness of it all quickly becoming a pastiche of his previous work. One can't help and feel like of all the changes made from the 1941 masterpiece, and there are plenty, some dampen the fun more than others. Humans now fill out all of the supporting roles which has a double downside: first, there's no Timothy Q. Mouse as Dumbo's lovably rapscallion sidekick; second, the animals no longer talk, making it less about Dumbo and more about the rather bland kids who take him under their wing. The spectacle isn't what you would expect either. The CGI Dumbo is neither photorealistic enough to be convincing, nor exhilarating enough in full flight to get the pulse soaring. The big-bang finale only barely conjures up a slither of excitement. The familiar trappings put this squarely in the comfort zone of Burton fans, but this Dumbo retelling is plodding, bland and devoid of any memorable splendour.",/review/rw4761586/?ref_=tt_urv

","We went to watch it, the whole family. Me, my wife, my daughter, and my mother in law. I was kinda ready for a not so good movie, but boy did I overestimated this joke!
I almost fell asleep 3 times, my mother in law did, and my wife as well. My daughter played with the rest of the kids in the theater, playing hide and seek and tag.
There was no single person in the full room who enjoyed it. Many people were napping, some were on their phones. The rest were bored to death.
Nothing about this movie was enjoyable. The color palette was typical for Burton, washed down and bleak. The actors played like they had firing line pointed at them. Most of the characters were flat like an ironing board. No character development at all. Dany DeVito was really trying to have this circus going on, but the clowns were suicidal.
The CGI was kinda goodish only during Pink Elephants on parade, the rest was made with pocket money budget.
