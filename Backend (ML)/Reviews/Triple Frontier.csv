","After a steady start with Seasons 1 & 2, the 3rd has really excelled in my opinion.",/review/rw3646637/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2016,areatw,," The boys are back!
","At last - Clarkson, Hammond and May are back on our screens, and they're better than ever. Considering Amazon's budget dwarfs that of the BBC, you can imagine just how impressive their new show is.",/review/rw3646637/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2016,borislav-us,10," Classic
",The brand was not so much the name of the previous show... The brand is this lot here making the best motoring show ever. Well done for Amazon who quickly managed to get them on board. ,/review/rw3646637/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2016,Mr_Piggles,10," It's like MEGA BUDGET Top Gear.
",Imagine what would happen if the famous three were told by Amazon to do what they want and spend as much as you like - because clearly that's what happened here and the end result is AWESOME!,/review/rw3646637/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2016,Wentloog,8," Grand Tour has delivered the goods!
","So there was nothing to worry about after all! After the kerfuffle surrounding the end of the three presenting TG at the Beeb, I honestly thought that wherever they went nothing would be the same again in the motor show universe. ",/review/rw3646637/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2016,evimchine,4," (If you really are open to other viewsÂ…) The chemistry has been forced to death.
","If you really are open to other views: I watched Top Gear since the 2002 reboot, and the two most fun elements were the specials and the chemistry between the believable characters.",/review/rw3646637/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2019,srmarshall-204-112469,10," Season 3 Special Episode is the funniest show I have seen in years...
",Their connection with each other as they travelled across Mongolia was wonderful to watch. Hammond's attempts at driving were always great and perfectly timed. I have not laughed out loud during a TV show this much in a LONG time!,/review/rw3646637/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2016,digdog-785-717538,9," Like Top Gear, but fun
","Watching The Gran Tour, i see the same quality in the motoring sections as Top Gear had in their very best episodes; the visuals, editing, audio, are as good as if not better than before. The parts in between - comedy parts where the three leads chat and entertain the audience - are funnier than they used to be. The clear culprit here is the change of scenery for Hammond, Clarkson and May, who look refreshed and happy to be doing what they do. The fun is infectious and i feel like i'm having fun with them.",/review/rw3646637/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2016,BigZ_7337,10," They're Back!
","It's amazing how well the trio slips right back into top form in the first episode of the Grand Tour. I loved the first episode, and I wish I could watch the rest of the season right now. This show is funnier than most of the comedies on TV, and it has to be one of the most gorgeous shows on TV, as they really spared no expense on the production values. They even have some excellent CGI showing how each hybrid engine works.",/review/rw3646637/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2018,matias-reinikainen,9," Second season saves!
","Yeah, first season left me a bit dissapointed. The first episode in general was really good and there where signs of hope along the tour of season 1 but in the end it just felt too scripted. And it seems they heard it, just look at the episode unscripted, it seems they really took the criticsm to heart.",/review/rw3646637/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2016,somersetboy,10," Wow! Sublime! Perfect! Provocative!
","I just watched an impressive, thoughtful, provocative, memorable, perfect first episode of the first season. ",/review/rw3646637/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2016,mkools,7," Painfully awful...
","I already started to dislike the last BBC Top Gear episodes because of the increasing amount of scripted jokes but Amazon took it to a whole new level. This show is now 100% scripted, there is not one improvised joke. The dialog between the crew feels forced and uncomfortable. Not only that but the jokes are not funny at all, the car scenes take on for much too long to keep me interested, even the audience was super annoying, over the top American.",/review/rw3646637/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2017,matthijsalexander,5," The GRAND Rubbish
","I used to be a fan, I used to love this show and surely elements of it I still love. But, this show has been beat up, rolled through the mud and punched in the groin by Hollywood.",/review/rw3646637/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2016,n-middleton-117,5," Lost the plot
","Barely scraping through for a passing grade, the new series of The Grand Tour has not lived up to the hype. It seems to be running almost entirely on the popularity of the hosts and the blind following of the fans the accrued over at Top Gear.",/review/rw3646637/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2021,gianmarcoronconi,10," Wonderful
","Spiritual sequel to the BBC series, truly wonderful and hilarious. Here the three conductors are even freer and give the best of themselves in everything they do, giving us a pearl of rare beauty.",/review/rw3646637/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2016,saxbytim,10," The Grand Tour Is More Than What You Wanted!
","From the first trailer we knew this was going to be something worth watching. And it sure was. Clarkson, Hammond and May come back with this refreshing look and take on a car show. The backdrops to each episode look stunning and the guys are on a better form then they ever have been. I'm glad they left the BBC because it gave them time to create something new that was not going to dry out and become dull and also gave us time to get ready for something that will change the way TV is made. Thank you Grand Tour.Is this the same as Top Gear? No and yes. The shows format is altered but their is still a track and a racing driver, The American, who takes over from The Stig and The News is now Conversation Street. If you are hesitant about buying Amazon, you won't be disappointed.",/review/rw3646637/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2020,jonsefcik,10," On par with golden age Top Gear, except for two annoyances...
","Not long ago on a television network not far away called the BBC, Top Gear was revamped from its old informative editorial format into a weird comedy/talk show/reality/documentary. By season 2 the show settled on their starring lineup: Jeremy Clarkson, James May, and Richard Hammond, three very British and somewhat incompetent automotive journalists who reviewed the latest models, revisited classics, discussed automotive news, and interviewed celebrities in their own unique way, Most amusing of all were their challenges, road trips, and hair-brained schemes to apply their automotive knowledge and passion to make life easier and the world a better place (often with disastrous results).",/review/rw3646637/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2016,mumia-1,2," TG is dead and this can't fill the void
","I didn't want to write off the grand tour after the first episode, so I waited until the second one dropped at least. ",/review/rw3646637/?ref_=tt_urv

30 November 2016,anirog,1," Embarrassingly awful
","As a huge fan of the Clarkson, May and Hammond top gear, I was like many of us really looking forward to The Grand Tour, I'm afraid to say I am totally disappointed with this reincarnation. One of things I most enjoyed about TG was the specials the challenges and the guests, why didn't they spend the huge budget Amazon provided them with on producing these? instead we are untreated to overly long segments of what can only be described as filler television, in episode 2 they spend about 15 minutes basically just repeating the same not very funny joke in which James May gets killed trying to reach a get away car, it was like being in groundhog day, I actually felt embarrassed watching it. Terrible television.",/review/rw3646637/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2016,bannedguybe,1," Simply irritating
","I wont waste much time reviewing this crap... To start i loved Top Gear back in the days, i was looking forward to seeing the TGT, but it came out stupid, childish & irritating as hell!",/review/rw3646637/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2021,weir-15727,10," And on that bombshell
","Loved top gear and liked the grand tour but the last 2 (lochdown and carnage a trois)are just shocking think it's time for the boys to call it a day, GOODNIGHT!!!!",/review/rw3646637/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2016,bengtsson71,6," Not as good as Top Gear was
","As a big fan of the trio and the work they did on Top Gear I have been looking forward to this show for quite some time now. Matter of fact is Top Gear has always been my all time favorite TV show all categories, and my expectations for The Grand Tour was high.",/review/rw3646637/?ref_=tt_urv
23 July 2021,jochemunlimited,6," Entertaining... mostly...
","Meh... Too much budget, too much destroying things for no reason, too much throwing money around, feels too much scripted, that is making everything feel a bit lame.",/review/rw3646637/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2017,MiloSuperSpesh,9," Full season based review.
