20 May 2021,TheVictoriousV,8," Adult animation has been enriched and the network evidently knows it
","The landscape of comedic adult animation - often dominated by Simpsons duplicates, try-hard attempts at gross edginess that yearn to be the next South Park or Drawn Together, deliberately bad/ironic ones that try to mimic Xavier: Renegade Angel or Aqua Teen Hunger Force without the method to the madness, and whatever the f-ck Big Mouth is - has been enriched by Zach Hadel. You may know him by his YouTube/Newgrounds persona Psychicpebbles.",/review/rw7755082/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2020,Danoxmas,10," The Newgrounds Animators Have Finally Made It
","Following the production of the ""Hellbenders"" pilot and the brief history of Sleepy Cabin, its great to finally see some of the best internet funny bois get their vision on TV. It fully retains the spontaneity of Zach and Michael's unique internet animation styles and wastes no time at all with the jokes. The structure of the 12-min short is split into 2 plots which are equally fascinating and bizarre but not in the way a lot of ""edgy"" or subversive adult animated shows tend to be. The looseness of the drawing style helps the craziness never seem like its on rails, it truly feels like you're in the mind of 2 nutbag internet artists and I love it.",/review/rw7755082/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2020,trolliyama,8," Adult Swim should pick this
","This was actually funny, unlike a large portion of the shows from that block during the last few years.",/review/rw7755082/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2020,sagniknath,10," a Tour de force by guest actor Mike Stoklasa
",An amazing piece of animation that highlights the philosophical absurdities of life in the style of the great French philosopher Albert Camus.,/review/rw7755082/?ref_=tt_urv
11 May 2020,impssible-04553,10," My husband loves you
","Super funny show! My husband has made us watch it three times already lol, can't wait for another episode!",/review/rw7755082/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2020,jsmiemans-15452,8," Hilarious pilot! Keep 'em comin'!
","Stumbled onto this little show by accident, ended up laughing my ass off throughout the pilot episode.
And then when I recognized Mike Stoklasa's voice, that really sold it for me. (He's really great in this, please make Desmond a recurring character!)",/review/rw7755082/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2020,magicmcken,10," I loved it and want more!!!
",I loved it and I want more. Thats all I wanted to say. Also I can't wait for this show to get big.,/review/rw7755082/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2022,minutolo,10," Refreshing adult cartoon
","Never expected this to be this good. Adult Swim has been on a roll lately with shows like Tuca and Bertie, Rick And Morty, and their infamous infomercial parodies. This is definitely a show for the ages. üëç",/review/rw7755082/?ref_=tt_urv
1 March 2021,etherealtouch,10," Late review, but oh man, what a GEM
",I grew up on Newgrounds. I've always appreciated the type of community (along with its animators and productions) that the website spurned and still actively hosts to this day.,/review/rw7755082/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2020,jimmy-23965,10," I literally made an IMDB account to review this
","All I have to say is that Adult Swim needs to continue this. It was a shame that Hellbenders was never picked up, but now I see this as a great opportunity to make up for it. Both Zach Hadel and Michael Cusack are masterful animators and comedians. They both have a gift to implement moments in their craft that are eternally quotable. Denying this show a series would be a disservice to the world. I know that sounds weird, considering the absurdity of the content, but I honestly see this as a beacon of hope in these dark times.The creators deserve so much recognition and support.",/review/rw7755082/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2022,crazelord,9," It's random, insane, and full of heart
","I've been a fan of Zach Hadel for years, since psychicpebbles started. While Hellbenders never got off the ground, I'm glad he finally got a show on tv. Being 11 minutes an episode and on adult swim none of his idiosyncrasies have been smoothed out for a network, it's clearly his and Michael's humor.",/review/rw7755082/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2020,necromancyking,10," The Artist over the Manufacturer
",Smiling Friends is a testament to the creative landscape of what personal content creation can lead to and how it focuses on artist to consumer interactions that allow the creators of animation or anything of the sort to be more grounded and appreciative of the craft and their impact on it. The animation is not too large a departure from other familiar styles. The characters and personalities are by far the most driving factors of the show itself. The dry and absurdist humor as well as the range of which the show can strike your funny-bone is incredibly enjoyable. Coming from the platforms of Newgrounds and Youtube has allowed for some truly interesting and hilarious comedy from the likes of Zach Hadel and his constituents. I have no doubt in my mind that there is more to come from the minds behind Smiling Friends and I am left eagerly awaiting.,/review/rw7755082/?ref_=tt_urv
18 May 2020,shawnsharted,10," Zach is at it again
","What can I say, the man is hilarious and crazy and you can feel it in the show. It's up there with Rick and Morty so give it a watch if that's your thing.",/review/rw7755082/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2022,nasdagoodshepherd,9," This show just made me SMILE!
","In 2020, Adult Swim released an animated pilot called ""Smiling Friends"" featuring two guys named ""Charlie"" and ""Pim"" who have a job to make people happy. Everyone watched it and they all loved it so much, even I find it mildly enjoyable. After months of demands from fans all around Twitter and the Internet, Adult Swim finally greenlighted Smiling Friends and boy does that show looked even better than before. The writing in this show is very funny and there are tons of clever Internet references in it, the voice acting is really good by the way. Not to mention, the animation is great, I love how Smiling Friends has shown more of it's traditional hand-drawn animation than it's flash animation, that is pretty incredible. I have got to say that Smiling Friends is easily one of the best Adult Swim cartoons out there and I'm happy this show exists, yet I still want Adult Swim to revive Final Space and greenlight Pibby into a full series. Go watch Smiling Friends if you haven't already, it's a really fantastic show on Adult Swim. I give this show a 9.8/10.",/review/rw7755082/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2022,esteemedyams,10," A breath of fresh air in the world of animation
","To viewers who are not familiar with the twisted minds of creators Zach Hadel and Michael Cusack, Smiling Friends might be off-putting and much too ""in your face"" and grotesque at first. But to anyone who is willing to keep an open mind and/or is a connoisseur of absurd comedy, this show is a true gem.",/review/rw7755082/?ref_=tt_urv
12 May 2020,vansantcorey,10," This is show is holy. Absolutely holy
","I've watch this pilot a couple times and it is funny as hell every time. I just love how everything just comes together, there office building, their boss, especially Desmond's mom, and everything that plays out along the episode. I've been a fan of Zach and Michel for a while and this might just be some rose tinted glasses of their work But even without that feeling it's still is comedic genius",/review/rw7755082/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2022,Gleem247,7," Very reminiscent of Aqua Teen Hunger Force
","Really loved the vibe of this show. All the characters, especially Pim, are just adorable. Compared this to Aqua teen hunger force because of the simple situations each episode has that evolves into massive chaos. Jokes could have been a lot more funny but maybe its just me.",/review/rw7755082/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2020,coalcrafter-56355,10," Fantastic animation all around
",I hope adultswim picks this up. I'm a long time huge fan of Zach and Michael.,/review/rw7755082/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2020,excalibat,10," This is what breaking into the mainstream should look like
",Not much to say this is just a fantastic pilot and I hope we see more in the future,/review/rw7755082/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2022,AhmedDaReviewer,10," Now this is how you do adult animation right!
","Not gonna lie, when it comes to adult animation, I just kinda lost all hope in these types of shows, Don't get me wrong we still get that one great adult animation series ever now and then, but overall, It all just kinda blend in with each other, with the same boring character design and art style, the same boring overdone sitcom feel, the same old Family Guy-esque type of humor, It all felt very samey to me, you know..",/review/rw7755082/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2022,ArranJParkes,10," I didn't think a show could make me so gleefully happy!
","I haven't ever written a review before but I adore Smiling Friends so much I just have to rant and rave about how good it is. Such a great blend of chaos and realism all coated in a bright colourful exterior. The character designs make me laugh just thinking about them, the voices crack me up every time and the storylines are laced with so much cartoon stupidity you can't help but play them over and over in your head.",/review/rw7755082/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2020,cbthejenkins,10," Amazing and Brilliant!
",I love the creators behind the show! They are both absolute comedic geniuses and the pilot episode shows this in every way possible!,/review/rw7755082/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2020,parsa-kerg,10," Adult Swim please pick this up
","I've rewatched this short for about 20 times now. The more I watch it the more subtle jokes I find either happening in the background or sometimes even in the foreground.
I would be very disappointed if smiling friends is not picked up by adult swim, an opportunity for greatness like this only comes once in a lifetime. Make the right call adult swim, please.",/review/rw7755082/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2022,MamadNobari97,8," Fun Bingeable Little Show
","So I first heard about this show couple weeks ago on The Official Podcast and didn't know, and still don't know the creators.",/review/rw7755082/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2022,themanwhocamefromthesky,8," Better direction for adult swim
","The harken back to the super chaotic adult swim shows is great. I don't get why it's being hailed so well because look at the shows that were lost before given a chance at a crescendo like Superjail. It doesn't feel like a fair trade and I've started to avoid adult swim when it is really the only TV corporation I liked. This show and everything they put out lately has felt asexual, dull, lacking on the expression and more concerned about user experience and padding us for our own safety. The screaming and quick escalation is funny and has been since Bushworld adventures and it reminds me of Big Lez. There's also talented animation blending between dimension walls which deserves respect. I like this show but I'm not moved by it to any degree related ones have. I feel like adult swim is shamming us into raving about one little good thing they put out while running to the bank. At least there is enough out there already to satisfy one lifetime.",/review/rw7755082/?ref_=tt_urv
