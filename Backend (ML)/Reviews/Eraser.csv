30 August 2019,siderite,5," A real failure to capture any feeling of story
","The more I think about it, the least I think of this movie. A story about something that is not named merging with Jean Grey, aliens that are not named coming to take control over it - by using sheer number and physical strength, obviously, a government that goes from hailing the X-Men to mutant detention facilities in a day and characters that switch from love to murderous hate in seconds. Nothing makes any sense! The film connects to none of the previous films, has actors in it just for the sake of killing them off or doesn't have them at all, in some cases. It's just a standalone X-men-like film that just doesn't seem to be part of the same thing. It looks like someone tried to make a Mutant-X film and randomly got the rights for the X-Men in the process. Why was this done at all?",/review/rw4916253/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2019,mossow92,2," The best storyline in the X-men canon, and they crapped all over it.
","Don't know where to start with this. If you're going to dig up the greatest story in the X-men canon, you need to bring it. And this film brought nothing. It all felt so hollow. The characters didn't ring true. The story didn't ring true. It was all over the place with many nonsensical choices throughout. I was so excited for my favorite storyline and was disappointed more than I can put into words. This political and social propaganda piece missed the mark by miles.",/review/rw4916253/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2019,Cineanalyst,4," Time's Up for the X-Men Series as Charles Xavier Gets MeToo'd
","""Dark Phoenix"" is a listless conclusion to Fox's X-Men movie series that manages to fail to live up to even the previously-much-panned adaptation of The Dark Phoenix Saga comic-book arc, ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" (2006). Once again, Jean Grey comes in contact with some cosmic steroids that make her overly powerful and extremely unstable. ""My emotions make me strong,"" she contends, failing to mention that it makes her strong at killing and otherwise harming people on a whim. Once again, Professor X squares off against an antagonist over her soul--except, this time, that includes some underdeveloped and generic aliens (led by what's-her-name devil on Jean's shoulder as portrayed by a wasted Jessica Chastain) in addition to a briefer confrontation this time around with Magneto.",/review/rw4916253/?ref_=tt_urv

5 June 2019,sagniknath,7," A decent enjoyable X-Men romp that doesn't deserve the ridiculously low ratings
","As of the writing of this review, Dark Phoenix holds a bewilderingly low rating of 22% on Rotten Tomatoes. Even on Imdb, I see some disparagingly negative reviews that do not even specify what they particularly disliked about the film. Frankly, I do not intend to sugarcoat my review so as to counterbalance the low score derived from these reviews. Rather I hope to give the movie a fair chance and undermine the undeserved hate it has received from so many outlets so that interested potential viewers do not unjustly miss out on an otherwise OK film.",/review/rw4916253/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2019,joshbarton15,4," Totally flat.
","And so here we are, at the end of the road for the X-Men franchise produced by Fox. I don't think this was supposed to be the case however, with Disney spending megabucks to buy 21st Century Fox, I can only see the next appearance from the famous mutant team being within the MCU, whenever that may come. Simon Kinberg has been on board the franchise for a while now, having multiple writing and producing duties throughout, and he makes the step up to directorial duties with Dark Phoenix.",/review/rw4916253/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2019,cricketbat,4," Like a cold, bland meal served by an angry cook
","Dark Phoenix is like a cold, bland meal served by an angry cook. I think the only people enjoying this movie less than the people watching it is the people who made it. It's a joyless, flat string of clichés with only a handful of cool visual moments. It seems as if the animated X-Men series is the only one who can get The Dark Phoenix Saga right. It's sad that this rebooted franchise fizzled out.",/review/rw4916253/?ref_=tt_urv

7 September 2019,tristanostara,1," Totally ruins the xmen timeline and story line not happy at all
","First thing about this movie that pissed me off was the lack of continuity firstly jean is 8 in 1975, then fast forward to her at approximately 18 years old so it should be set in the mid 80s the tech in the film is all over the place from the cars to the tvs to the telephones to the clothing to the 2019 dance club sound track in one of the scenes??? Wtf then only to kill off mistique one of the main characters not to bring her back some how considering she is a main character in movies set in the future is really dumb!! Quicksilver was under utilised and then handicapped for the rest of the film also pretty dumb!!! Then to introduce an alien race never before talked about in the xmen genre is again really dumb, storm now although it looks like the same character as xmen apocalypse now has a totally different accent total wtf",/review/rw4916253/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2019,CinemaClown,," As Dull, Disappointing & Redundant As Any Sequel Can Get
","Tackling the story arc of Jean Grey for the second time yet ending up with the same disappointing results, Dark Phoenix concludes the 20th Century Fox's X-Men saga on an underwhelming note and is one of the blandest entries in the franchise. Dull, predictable & utterly forgettable, it is as redundant as a sequel can get, and happens to be terrible on most levels if not all.",/review/rw4916253/?ref_=tt_urv

",If superhero fatigue has set in then 20th Century Fox has borne the brunt of it. Their reboot of The Fantastic 4 flopped. Dark Phoenix was a disaster at the box office and critically maligned. It brought nothing to the X-Men saga and the merger of the film studio with Disney seems to be in the nick of time. The X-Men future lie with the MCU and this film hints at it as when the are forcibly on the train by the Mutant Containment Unit (MCU!),/review/rw4916253/?ref_=tt_urv

7 June 2019,theromanempire-1,1," just ignore this film ever existed
","If u are a die hard X-Men fan like me then u can ignore this terrible film and stick to the previous X-Men filns.
this is terrible. everything was wrong in this film.
the plot...the dialogue....the costumes.....it looked like a cheap made film.
also main characters looked much different than they supposed to look as this film takes place a few years before the X-Men movie events.
we have been blessed with great X-Men movies so one bad film we can forgive.
just ignore this ever existed and start watching the whole X-Men franchise from the beginning and when u finish X-Men apocalypse don't watch this film but instead move on to logan the last film in the franchise.",/review/rw4916253/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2020,djjimmisgr,8," So much hate for nothing
",I was avoiding watching this movie with all the bad things I was hearing from friends or seeing how bad reviews it had everywhere. To my surprise the movie was very good. Sure it could be better if they did some things differently and more close to the original story or if they gave us more action but it was good enough for me. I hope that the next movie keeps the cast they are awesome.,/review/rw4916253/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2019,rachelgallit,4," A Burning Wreck
","This movie was clearly designed to be a vignette set in the world of X-Men, showcasing the intensely powerful misunderstood damsel who saves her own day. In reality, this was a mess of unredeemable behavior, crime (which is never righted), and glorification of completely dysfunctional personal relationships. Jean Grey is a telekinetic mutant who is raised by Xavier at his Academy, but flees when her newly heightened and uncontrolled powers result in the death of an important member of the group. The actors are highly praised for other works, and rightly so, but this is a smudge on their records. The dialogue is flat and the supposed deep connections between Jean and Xavier, and Cyclops isn't shown in any capacity, and it told to the audience rather than actually presenting examples. The most infuriating part of the film is the climax, when Jean sacrifices herself and dies for her companions. This is supposed to be a penance for her sins, but in reality it is unclear the outcome. The threat was caused by her, she still killed her friend, and she did defect and destroyed a city and yet: they rename the X men Academy after her. It is unclear if she even dies, as a phenix like bird is shown in the sky after, making the whole thing seem moot. In short, the talented actors, established franchise, high tech set and effects budget, and the clearly written characters cannot manage to save this film from bursting into flames.",/review/rw4916253/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2019,RforFilm,2," Along with repeating more of the same ""Whose team are you one?"" plot, Dark Phoenix is a dull, boring slog that makes for a terrible ending to the X-Men saga
","When Disney purchased 20th Century Fox, a lot of people had questions about their properties, but most of them were about the X-Men. Where would the series go? Can it continue? Should it continue? Can it be incorporated into the Marvel Cinematic Universe? In a way, I think the officials at Fox are still trying to figure that out. I can't be easy to not only be told that you have new owners, but also that the series may not last longer regardless of the fans want. I would not want to be anyone working on those movies and I really have a lot of empathy for their situation.",/review/rw4916253/?ref_=tt_urv

","Not sure why the rating so low. Maybe people are spoiled by the epic galaxy class interweaving of stories with Avengers, Thor, Aquaman, Defenders of the Galaxy, Dr Strange?

","I only got about 20 minutes into this crap acting show and when Mystique tells the professor that ""all the women in this house keep saving all the men so maybe we should change the name to X-Women,"" I turned this garbage off. How easily she forgot the times she's been saved by MEN?! I've had more than enough of Hollywood and their sexist toward men attitude! How is it the same actors who have acted well in the previous movies now act like complete garbage in this one?
