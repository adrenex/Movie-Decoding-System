6 February 2012,Red_Identity,," Fantastic... the perfect mix of satire, drama, and dark comedy.
","I started Enlightened around a week ago, mostly because the Golden Globes put it on the spot. As far as first seasons go, this was an excellent one. It balances comedy and drama extremely well. Some episodes are more dramatic, some more comedic, but it always remains top notch. ",/review/rw7552504/?ref_=tt_urv

17 February 2014,zetes,," The first season is just okay, but the payoff in the second season is extremely moving
","The A.V. Club named this the best series of 2013, beating out popular favorite Breaking Bad and angering many readers who had never even heard of this obscure HBO series. It aired its first, 10 episode season in late 2011. Its second, 8 episode season aired at the beginning of 2013. A third season was planned, but HBO canceled it. Watching the first season, I was a little perplexed at where the praise had come from. Laura Dern is good in the lead, playing Amy Jellicoe, a woman working at a high position at a pharmaceutical company who gets fired after having an emotional breakdown. She goes to a New Age-y treatment facility in Hawaii and, six months later, returns to the company in a much lower position. She is a bit of a hippie, harping on her company's lack of ethics, which immediately gets her in trouble. I must say, the first season seems all like set-up with no pay off. If I were watching it on TV, especially if I had to wait the whole year for it to air its second season, I probably wouldn't have continued with it. But I bought both seasons at once, so eight more episodes weren't much of a commitment. And, man, that second season. It goes from a series that was decent but fairly unnotable to something truly special, something remarkably potent. Here is the pay-off in spades. The second season is so emotionally involving, so insightful into the human condition. Amy Jellicoe is a bit of a pill, but you really understand her and I really appreciated a character like her, one who is far less than perfect. The two best episodes of the series have at their center a secondary character. ""Higher Power"" focuses on Amy's ex-husband, Luke Wilson, as he himself goes to Amy's treatment facility and tries to get clean. Wilson has always been an undervalued actor who is often misused, and he's never been better than in this television episode. In ""The Ghost Is Seen,"" series creator and head writer Mike White (whose directorial debut, Year of the Dog, explored similar themes to this series), who co-stars as Amy's lonely best friend at work, falls in love with Molly Shannon (who starred in Year of the Dog), while he simultaneously betrays her trust. Diane Ladd also co-stars as Amy's mother, and I loved her relationship with her daughter. It was unique in that she's severely disappointed with her daughter and kind of distrusts her.",/review/rw7552504/?ref_=tt_urv

24 October 2011,blanbrn,8," A series that looks good at anger, doubt, uncertainty, and the fight for love and spiritual meaning.
","Just been watching this new HBO series ""Enlightened"" and I must say it's an interesting and raw work from Mike White he shows how life can be depressing and dark with rage and anger. It's clear that most people can relate to this thru their jobs and paying bills, and dealing with relationships as all of this brings stress and uncertainty to most. All of this is showcased thru the life of one middle aged lady Amy(the wonderful Laura Dern(who shares a birthday the same day as me!)she's a woman who's had a nervous and spiritual breakdown.",/review/rw7552504/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2012,caiged,7," A frustrating experience that does have its rewards...somewhere
","I wanted to see this series solely for Laura Dern. The first episode seemed okay. A woman has a meltdown at work after finding out that the boss she was having an affair with was transferring her out of her department. So she goes away to a retreat, fixes herself, and comes back to find that her old job has been filled, and she's got a new job...in the basement of the company working with computers.",/review/rw7552504/?ref_=tt_urv

15 December 2012,LeonLouisRicci,9," Amy's Angst
",While watching you will probably feel as frustrated and angry as Amy (Laura Dern) in this made for cable series. Because she is not the easiest character to warm up to and you may feel like shaking some sense into her overbearing and neurotic behavior. That is the point in this rather risky show.,/review/rw7552504/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2011,jimpowellsf,7," Strangely addicting
","I read somewhere that this show was one of the best new shows of the year, so I started watching it on demand. I find it to be a very interesting mix of humor, drama, and intrigue. Laura Dern is great as an almost completely unpredictable person. It's almost scary to say that her character is like more than a few people I've met in my life.",/review/rw7552504/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2011,smirish,," Watch it!
","The show is about one very flawed woman's struggle to become a better and healthier person. She's clearly lost, but dedicated and passionate in a way which makes you admire her and be annoyed by her at the same time. The show does a neat trick of manipulating the viewer into alternatively mocking her because of her naivete and flakiness, and cheering for her out of empathy, both back and forth within single episodes. You come to expect her to crash and burn in a tragic and comedic fashion. Yet in the end, she claims small victories of enlightenment that put all of us in touch with our humanity and teach us a little bit about growth. The show is not preachy, yet makes its points poignantly and powerfully. ",/review/rw7552504/?ref_=tt_urv

","'Enlightened' is not particularly easy to get into, which may be the reason for it not being discussed more often as a great show. I felt it flew a bit under the radar, but as I watched both of its seasons I realised that's not due to its quality.",/review/rw7552504/?ref_=tt_urv

","I'm hoping I'm not the only one out here who loves HBO's Enlightened.

8 January 2020,palacerevolution2000,9," wonderful
","Great show. Very well acted; all characters are explored, digging much deeper than the shallow treatment, that most TV actors receive. It was believable, and what I liked is that the people are all flawed.
The inter office dynamics are done right. Loved Amy's boss. And the relationship between Amy and Jeff was handled well IMO. I liked that it wasn't some huge heartbreak scene where she discovers that she means nothing to him.
Season 2 was a touch different, I thought. I saw the mother becoming maybe a little too caricature-like. But what I really, LOVED in Season 2 were the voice overs; the story teller of each episode. The writing of those was brilliant. That opening of Season 2 was epic; about the kingdoms.",/review/rw7552504/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2011,dryan-14,8," Accept what you cannot change and change what you can
","Enlightened is about a woman who was unable to cope with a series of accumulated stresses in her life and decided to seek treatment. She returns to her life with a new awareness and feels compelled to share and engage people in that awareness to effect positive change around her, but she finds herself running up against resistance due to fear of change. The people around her are all coping with stress in their lives in various other ways. It's about confronting the loneliness and isolation that you can feel when your perspective differs from those around you, and how that loneliness is at odds with your desire to connect, help, and heal those around you. At the end of the day it's about the serenity prayer, about Amy learning the wisdom to know the difference between what she can change, and what she can't. A lot of mistakes are made in the process, but her heart is in the right place, and any introspective viewer will be able to relate to the struggle. I highly recommend it.",/review/rw7552504/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2019,laurieteter,10," How did I not know about this???
","I just recently came across Enlightened in a search for a high quality TV Series airing on Amazon Prime. When I saw that the fabulous Laura Dern (as well as her mother Diane Ladd) were starring, it didn't take long for me to begin viewing... and then I couldn't stop; I literally tore through both seasons. THANK YOU Mike White and Laura Dern!!! Thank you for recognizing that there are viewers like us with good taste who desire and crave great writing, producing, and acting. This is a truly outstanding series that is funny, engaging, authentic, emotional, uplifting, and deeply touching. Please consider producing a 3rd season! Or at least work together again, your collaboration is pure magic!",/review/rw7552504/?ref_=tt_urv

12 July 2021,avisdolphin,8," Brilliant
","It's too bad this was cancelled after only 2 seasons. I think it is Laura Dern's best work. The series is fully loaded...it's about mental health, addiction, toxic corporations, grief, loneliness, authenticity or rather, the lack of in most people, especially in ""enlightened"" individuals. I stumbled across this series and was surprised it was cancelled. Perhaps too dark and revealing? My guess is that it makes viewers very uncomfortable as they see themselves in one or more of the characters.",/review/rw7552504/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2011,plex,," I Cant tell where this is going....
","I cant tell whether they are making fun of people who become enlightened or if they feel they can enlighten the world stemming from what seems to be a fairly vapid self-help seminar. ""They"" in this review refers to Mike White and Laura Dern who have their hands all over this new comedy/drama in fields of creation, production, directing, writing and performing. Maybe with less cooks in the kitchen the show has more focus and self-control, but that focus isn't apparent to this reviewer yet. Maybe they are pointing out the futility of change or perhaps how jaded and impersonal the world around them has become. The message is unclear, as I have no idea whether to root for our leading lady or hit some sense into her with a polo mallet. The show is fresh and unique, and its great to see Dern on the screen, aging but still looking good, I guess the mid 40's IS the new mid-30's as her hair and clothing style reflect the latter. I have always appreciated her skills, and its good to see her stretch out in this one,but by the end of this 30 minute episode I was already getting both bored and annoyed as the show is already getting a bit preachy and a lot pretentious. Once again, the men are written as jerks as one is a numb corporate type who cheats and the other a drug addict.Even with that, I will watch more episodes to see if the show manages to gain focus, entertain, and cease the self- important message.",/review/rw7552504/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2011,delightful-life,," This show IS different. Finally :-)................
","Its about a 40yr old woman. She is not very smart, but she thinks she is, she wants to do great things, but she can't because she can't really understand why things are repeatedly going wrong around her (though we the audience can see). And most of the time its because of her dumb actions, and she just can't see it right then.",/review/rw7552504/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2019,siobhanharper16,9," Surprisingly Good TV
","This show left me asking what an ""enlightened"" person might really look like. At first, Laura Derm's lead character, Amy, seems to be a caricature of the word, which would have made the whole show a sardonic slap at the long-legged, blonde, New Age Californians that the title calls to mind. But very quickly, Amy and the other characters become genuinely three-dimensional people, all very different from each other but each searching in an authentic way to find their own reasons for hope in a world that's at best average and at worst, cruel. Nobody is all good or all bad, like most of us. The show's impressive cast is a big hint that ""Enlightened"" isn't just an amateurish attempt to psychoanalyze life. In addition to Laura Dern, we have Diane Ladd, Dermot Mulroney, James Rebhorn, Luke Wilson, and Mike White (also of Survivor Season 37 fame). They all do a great job inhabiting their characters, helped along by some excellent writing. Only two seasons long, the story follows a logical arc, even though I found myself sorry that it ended. I highly recommend it.",/review/rw7552504/?ref_=tt_urv
