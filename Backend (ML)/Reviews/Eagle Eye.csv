27 October 2011,blanche-2,9," Closure comes in many forms
","Jason Isaacs stars as detective Jackson Brodie in ""Case Histories,"" which is a miniseries filmed in Edinburgh. Brodie works on several cases at once. This episode concerned a child who disappeared 30 years earlier, a young woman who was murdered years earlier, a woman engaged to be married attempting to find her niece, plus he's helping a paranoid old woman who never pays him. And her nephew is after him to stop. Divorced, Brodie often takes his daughter on cases when he has visitations, and she's quick to tell her mother, ""Dad beat up a man,"" and things of that nature when she gets home.",/review/rw5666260/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2011,robert-temple-1,," A fabulous mini-series, makes totally riveting viewing
","Jason Isaacs says he hates detective series, and yet he has proved in this BBC mini-series that he is one of the best detectives ever cast in a film. He has all the human qualities that so many of them lack, and his well-rounded portrayal is a triumph, in lifting detective stories onto a higher plane. It is impossible to praise Isaacs highly enough for his superb realisation of this sympathetic character who just happens, as a disgraced ex-policeman, to have taken up work as a detective. The setting is the beautiful city of Edinburgh, exploited visually to the full. Edinburgh is above all the British city with the most magnificent vistas of them all, surpassing even Bath in that respect. The mini-series is based on some novels by a prize-winning Edinburgh-based writer named Kate Atkinson. This explains the fantastically complex and interweaving plots of the films, which go far beyond the normal intricacies of even the most elaborate scripts. The rich tapestry which is thus woven is satisfying in a way that so much of television is not. This mini-series is thus an exemplar of what those of us concerned with quality should all hope for. Three different directors (Marc Jobst, Bill Anderson, and Dan Zeff) helm the three double-episodes, and are uniformly excellent. The series was 'devised for television by Ashley Pharoah', who although he seemingly can't spell 'pharaoh' properly, is a well-known figure in British and American television. The supporting performances in these tangled tales are all excellent. Two of the most charming are by the child actress Millie Innes, who is as winsome as they come and plays the daughter of Isaacs, and the teenager Gwyneth Keyworth, who plays a fascinating waif in the final story. Fenella Woolgar is, as usual, compulsively watchable in a harrowing character role, and Natasha Little as her glamorous sister manages to add extra twinkle and sparkle to a character who might have been flat in the script but got proper three dimensions in her portrayal. Amanda Abbington is excellent as the police woman with a love/hate relationship with Isaacs, and once again a part which might have been hackneyed comes alive as a rounded individual at her hands.",/review/rw5666260/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2012,bbewnylorac,10," Another superb Ashley Pharoah production
","I have just finished watching Case Histories on DVD and I can't fault it. It's just superb television. I have read all the Kate Atkinson books and Jason Isaacs is perfect to play Jackson Brodie, and all the other actors and characterisations are offbeat without being too wacky - i.e. they have real depth to them. It's amazing that the series portrays so much violence and bleakness and yet you still love it and cheer on the good guys. And the good guys aren't perfect. I might have known that Ashley Pharoah was the screenwriter: Life on Mars which he co-created is one of my all time favourite TV series. Edinburgh and rural Scotland makes for a fantastic backdrop, and Atkinson's intricate plots are executed with superb clarity and yet not losing their great heart. Congratulations to everyone behind the series: bring on season 2!",/review/rw5666260/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2017,barryrd,9," Jackson Brodie character at the heart of this show
","This series is one I highly recommend for those who like the style of a modern British mystery. The character of Jackson Brodie, played by Jason Isaacs, gives the series a tenacious detective scarred by a troubled past. Brodie's past comes out in a series of flashbacks that drive him to jump into ice cold water hoping to save a life or make that final push when finishing a run. Family deaths, divorce and his love for daughter Marlee keep him well-grounded and not lacking in compassion. Brodie is spurred by a strong desire to help people as well as bring wrongdoers to heel. He doesn't talk much but listens carefully. He is smart and is quick to make shrewd observations and deductions. His cases range from finding the truth behind a long-cold case to repeatedly hunting down the beloved cat of an elderly pet lover who never pays her bills. It's hard not to like him but his ex-wife, former boss and secretary are all too eager to point out his faults. His impulses result from a soft heart and an impatience to help, putting him in hard luck situations. Daughter Marlee is his real love and spending time with her is his main satisfaction in life. He and Marlee practise French together or drive off to a convent where he investigates one of the nuns. Amanda Abbington plays his former boss with a soft spot for him and one can sense the two might become a couple. I guess we can only imagine. The series ran for nine episodes and one can see that the Brodie character might have worn thin if the story continued and never came to grips with the issues that defined his life. No matter. The series is still great viewing for the nine episodes that are on tap.",/review/rw5666260/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2013,Rupert17,9," Clever series about fate and coincidence based on the books of Kate Atkinson

23 June 2011,batmancox,9," Great new series
",Another great new British detective mystery series. Isaacs is an excellent lead figure - though it took me awhile to realise that he was Lucius Malfoy.It's not the type of series that explains every detail in case you missed it but lures you into guessing what will happen next.,/review/rw5666260/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2011,Tweekums,7," Reasonable new crime drama
","As I enjoy crime dramas and think Jason Isaacs is a pretty good actor I had to check this series out. Sadly it wasn't as good as I'd hoped; that isn't to say it was terrible; just rather averageÂ… although I think it improved as the series progressed. Jason Isaacs did a good job as ex-cop private investigator Jackson Brodie who, as well as solving cases, has to deal with the fact that his ex-wife is about to emigrate to New Zealand with their daughter Marlee. This was rather unfortunate as it provided an unnecessary distraction and the scenes with Jackson and Marlee in the opening story were some of the most entertaining; every time he took her out he ended up doing something to do with his case which Marlee enjoyed but her mother did not approve of. Each story started with him investigating fairly trivial crimes such as looking for a missing cat or trying to find out if a man's wife was unfaithful but ended up with him investigating murders. He was always at just the wrong place; nobody can be as unlucky as Jackson; he goes for a jog by the sea and finds a body in the water; he breaks down and while walking along the road in nearly hit by an old woman who then crashes onto a railway line only to by hit by a train which puts him in hospital!

2 November 2011,leafy-2,10," We loved this, will there be more? Please? More?
","This is a beyond good series. I had not read her books, but will now. The stories are edge of the seat as well as being sad and funny. The settings are beautiful or interesting and the characters are complex. I don't agree with any of the criticism,my husband and I were mesmerized. We turned on the closed captioning so as not to miss a word of dialogue. I am now motivated to see the Harry Potter movies, just for Jason Isaacs. I never fail to be amazed at the over the top talent of the British ,it is so refreshing to watch actors that are not Hollywood, and look like real people. This is as good as Luther. Seriously.",/review/rw5666260/?ref_=tt_urv

2 May 2020,pnpete9,10," A Scottish Gem
",Simply can't fault this excellent crime drama. As is often the case it's strength lies with a very strong cast of fine Scottish actors who give it their all. Along with good script and credible stories this really is a gem of a series. Sadly nothing is produced of this calibre by the BBC any longer.,/review/rw5666260/?ref_=tt_urv

13 March 2021,jcravens42,10," Good mix of drama, crime story & character study, all with an awesome soundtrack
","Jackson Brodie is a very good detective and a not so great boss or father. Loves his daughter, obviously, but put so much into his work his marriage fell apart. Says yes to cases he should say no to. And is haunted by a childhood memory. I fell in love with this show when it was on Masterpiece, and have yet to find anyone who has seen it. Wonderfully atmospheric, stories you really don't know where they are going to go, and always with a song or two playing in the background or over the credits that's perfect for the moment, making you want to settle down in the dark with a whiskey and try to sort things out...",/review/rw5666260/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2015,pensman,," Dark, Depressing, and Interesting
","John Isaacs is excellent as Jackson Brodie an Edinburgh copper tossed off his patch and now works as a successful private detective if not a financial competent one. If money followed him as does trouble; he'd own the Bank of Scotland. He has an ex-wife who is angry with him, a twelve year old daughter who loves him, an ex colleague DC Louise Munroe (Amanda Abbinington) who both loves him and hates him, and a somewhat shady clientele. There are three two hour and three 90 minute episodes that follow in chronological order; but even so you might feel that you missed something along the way. The stories are good but convoluted at times. Generally two stories run concurrently in each episode along with some subplots. This is not an uplifting series and while some clients survive, none survive unscathed, ",/review/rw5666260/?ref_=tt_urv
24 October 2011,CineNutty,," Case Histories and Jackson Brodie
","There is a bit of realism about bureaucracies and police work which comes through loud and clear. The real why Jackson Brodie is a ""good copper"" is because he cares about people and cares about his work. At the same time, he has a deep underlying motivation based on a tragedy in his own life as he was growing up. It is analogous to what motivates some psychologists in going into psychology in the first place. Thus, there is a relevant dose of human nature and human motivation that is lacking in many crime dramas from the standpoint of what pushes the investigator.",/review/rw5666260/?ref_=tt_urv

30 October 2011,bshantinorth,," Fabulous
","In a word:fabulous. Compelling, not to miss a word of dialog. The story line evolves from a loosely woven beginning to a tight ending. Enticed one wonders where it will go in the end. The acting brings you into the heart and soul of the characters, who have lives and emotions that inter connect and create a richness not found in the usual mystery genre. If you are pining for a who done it go to Sherlock or Perot. Jackson Brodie is superbly acted, a romantic,wounded hero who knows life has its price and he is not afraid of it. He rescues and restores justice for his clients,he is an admirable, and often suffering hero. Suffering humanizes him and we all can identify with his pain. The theme of father figure and the need to protect are strong motivations for the character. Sophisticated and refreshing for this genre. I want more. This is the new school, old school mystery is predictable and tiresome. We want sexy guys, with real life stories, love and lust thrown in the mix, the Victorian thing is over.",/review/rw5666260/?ref_=tt_urv

17 October 2011,markfranh,," Watch if you're into being depressed
","Not quite as depressing as watching a Wallander, but near enough. A mixture of depressing stories populated with depressing people with depressing endings, investigated by a detective with a very good reason for being depressed. So many images of cars being driven across stunning landscapes with the sky featuring prominently in shot that you're sure the director studied Wallander before filming. Ditto the flashbacks in not quite black and white.",/review/rw5666260/?ref_=tt_urv
