26 December 2002,llihilloh,," It's still one of the best shows on TV.
","'The Amazing Race' is without a doubt the best reality show on television right now.  It's way better than 'Survivor', which seems to get all of the attention every year leaving 'Race' in dire need of viewers.",/review/rw6256111/?ref_=tt_urv

","You can skip all the other dopey reality shows that have come along recently, The Amazing Race has GOT to be right up there with the orginal.. Survivor!  This show offers adventure (which is the name of the game) fun, excitement and entertainment!",/review/rw6256111/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2018,gregr-76475,," No longer a fan of The Amazing Race
","Once upon a time I really enjoyed the Amazing Race. It was fun, exciting, and sometimes heartbreaking. The contestants were people you could cheer for... or against. Of late, though, I have lost interest because of a decision by the executives to move away from what made the show appealing. At one time the racers were common people, just like you and I. A couple of coal miners from Kentucky. Two cowboys who were brothers. The list is too long to continue. This made the race fun. You could sit down and compare yourself to your peers. Now, however, the executives have decided to feature teams made up of ex professional athletes. models, stars from other reality TV shows and YouTube stars. In short, people who are not like the average American. I watched a couple of episodes this year and realized I just did not enjoy the show anymore. If the producers decided to go back to the original format, maybe they get my viewership back.. Until they do consider me an ex-fan.",/review/rw6256111/?ref_=tt_urv

15 October 2001,fritz2525,," just amazing!
","WOW! This tv show is good enough to beat Survivor but they belong in the same network so... Anyway, I like how they put it together--[11 teams with 2 people in each team]. The one that really gives colour to the show is the contestants and their personality. The editing was really great & I think they should win an Emmy for this. There's alot of action in it and great games. After watching an episode you just can't wait for the next one. Right now I heard its the second best reality show next to Survivor so again GOOD JOB CBS! One thing I love about this show is the places, every episode they go to different country. >",/review/rw6256111/?ref_=tt_urv
14 July 2020,planktonrules,7," Generally enjoyable...but....
","I am generally NOT the sort of person to watch and enjoy reality television shows. However, I have enjoyed watching ""The Amazing Race""....at least some times. When I say that it's because how much I enjoy the show is highly dependent upon the contestants. Many you really like. A few, however, are human garbage....nasty, smack-talking jerks who take away from the audience's enjoyment of the show. Some of these contestants have been so nasty and awful that my daughter and I have now taken to only watching the show AFTER it's completed and we read up to find out what sort of contestants a particular season has. After all, life is too short to spend our time watching ugly, nasty people. So, consider doing this and just skipping a few seasons where the participants seem more interested in drama and chaos than anything else.",/review/rw6256111/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2012,Critter1223,10," Just an amazing show
","Last December, Survivor South Pacific ended and I had to find something to watch while the 3 months passed until Survivor came back. So I decided to try out this show, Amazing Race. I was hooked after 1 episode and watched an entire season in 1 night. By the end of the 3 months I had watched all 19 seasons of the show. It became my new obsession. Easily the best show on TV, even the duller seasons such as 4, 8, or 13 are still awesome and entertaining. I know this show is definitely not for everyone, you need to like reality shows to enjoy this (obviously), but if you are a fan of survivor, big brother, or even fear factor, I would definitely suggest giving this amazing show a chance.",/review/rw6256111/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2005,Jonger_2002,10," Good season with a horrible ending
","I just finished watching season three on GSN. Overall, I enjoyed it, but I absolutely hated seeing Zach and Flo cross the finish line first. Every dime of that money should go to Zach for keeping his cool and not smothering Flo in her sleep. That girl has to be the whiniest, most annoying person that I've ever seen on TV. She threatened to quit nearly a dozen times! I was hoping that Zach would knock her upside the head with one of the paddles during the water challenge in the second to last episode. Maybe that would get her to shut the hell up.",/review/rw6256111/?ref_=tt_urv

15 July 2009,johnnymacbest,9," Best reality TV show I've seen.
","I gotta say I hate reality TV. Sure ""Survivor"" had it's moments, but it got tiresome after awhile. The Amazing Race? Now HERE's a show with variety and personality to match the frantic, fast-paced action with such ingenious use of game set-pieces I couldn't help but dig this show. I watched this series for nine years and it still never fails to entertain me. That's something that can't be said for most reality TV programs; well at least for ""American Idol"". One of the most moving moments of the show was when they had one of the contestants was a female dwarf but despite her physical limits, she managed to get far near the end of the race. I can vividly recall the the emotions of the host who greeted them at the pit stop; however coming in last place eliminated them from the race. Sorry if that sounded a little poetic but I couldn't help but be touched by his reaction. Still, it's a great show, filled with a surprising amount of suspense. Yes, SUSPENSE. In a reality show; a rarity. Never in the history of TV has a series been this gripping, this entertaining, heartwarming and exciting, and above all, original as The Amazing Race.",/review/rw6256111/?ref_=tt_urv

","What more can you say about this series that hasn't already been said. It's great entertainment for viewers of all ages young and old, it's filled with different twists, very unusual and familiar characters but above all, it's always unpredictable.",/review/rw6256111/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2005,musicman85,," It's Amazing!
","WOW! This season is definitely as good as the previous seasons. This cast is considered to be more ""real"" than last seasons models, and actors. The final 4 teams left are married grandparents Meredith/Gretchen who have continued to beat the odds, Uchenna/Joyce married parents who continue to run a strong race, Rob/Amber survivors who have been at the top fora long time, and finally Ron/Kelly the dysfunctional team of the season.While most people don't like them, I can see why. They have changed the way the game is played. Overall the cast is better than last season. Ijust wish that the interesting people would have stayed longer. The locations have been nothing but exotic. So far they've been to South America, Africa, India, and next looks like Turkey in the coming episode. After that they'll probably start the journey back to the US. All and all this season will be one to remember, and has changed the way of the game forever.",/review/rw6256111/?ref_=tt_urv

15 October 2005,marugorlero2,," Good..
","Even though it is still going on I am enjoying this season of The Amazing Race... So far my favorite season was number 5. The reason for this is that they really went all over the world, Brazil, Argentina, Egypt, Dubai... The family edition is a really good idea, since most of the people that watch the show are families. The only thing that I think they should start doing is to SEND THEM AROUND THE WORLD!! so far it has been only inside the united states, the purpose of the show is for the teams to race around the world. It makes it more interesting! So even though I am enjoying the season I just wish that they would hurry up and go somewhere else other than the States... Really good show though, probably one of the best reality shows ever.",/review/rw6256111/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2005,FloatingOpera7,," Exciting Sixth Season...Season 7 On Its Way
","Season 6 of The Amazing Race ended tonight (February 8, 2005). It was a wonderful race, with the most interesting couples to date. Once again sent to various spots of the world, they must face difficult challenges. For the elderly couple Don and Mary, some of the stunts were a bit too much. This is definitely a young person's reality show, and requires a fit physical body and young active mind to really make it. I knew that this couple wasn't going to make it, but they did survive various parts of the race and were eliminated by mid-season. They were quite good for elderly folks. The couple most people kept their eye on was Jonathan and Victoria who were constantly fighting. Jonathan treated Victoria very badly, insulting her, belittling her and it was evident their relationship was going downhill. They are said to appear in an episode of Doctor Phil to fix their messy and precarious relationship. Jonathan was quite a jerk on the show. Even when Victoria was injured, he showed no compassion and he blamed her for losing the race.",/review/rw6256111/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2005,FloatingOpera7,," The Best Season
","The Amazing Race is a very popular and highly rated ""reality show"". In 2000, the phenomenon began. Contestants must race around the world and go through a variety of ordeals and challenges along the way. Season 5 is largely considered the best. Kim and Chip won, proving to be the strongest couple in the race. Colin and Christie were close though. Other colorful contestants included Charla and Mirna and ""Bowling"" moms and Linda and Karen. The long season lasted throughout most of 2004. The contestants made trips to Egypt, Brazil, Dubai, and Canada. The show is still going strong. Most of the attraction lies in the chemistry between the contestants, the heat of competition and the various exotic locales. Those challenges are also very interesting.",/review/rw6256111/?ref_=tt_urv

14 January 2005,monsieurbond,10," 'The BEST season of The Amazing Race'
","'The Amazing Race 5' is the BEST of all six complete seasons to date. If you've never seen the show, I recommend this season over all others. Why? Season 5 had a combination of interesting and amiable teams as well as original locations, only 2 of which had already been visited in previous seasons. The 'Bowling Moms', Linda and Karen, added a lot of fun to the show - they were almost always lively and seeing them go so far on the race (to 4th place) was a highlight. Although I liked Colin and Christie, seeing Chip and Kim win was great - it was unexpected - and this is what added to this season's success. What I particularly liked about the locations visited was that producers for the most part avoided Europe (save for Russia, which was interesting) and visited other places, more interesting places, like South America and the Middle East. I'm just hoping that CBS releases the seasons on DVD - if they do, choose this one! 5 Star Entertainment - so much more refreshing than Seasons 6 and 7.",/review/rw6256111/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2009,christhjian,8," That's a real reality show
","Though I find most of US reality TV-series quite boring I must admit that's the one I really love. Mainly because it's so global, mixture of different cultures and traditions. You can see difference between developing countries and developed countries and so on. It's fun to watch teams pushing themselves over the top with some rather weird quests and having an arguments over nothing. The tasks are usually tied with the country they're competing and that's very cool too.",/review/rw6256111/?ref_=tt_urv

19 October 2005,SuperNoob3000,," The Amazing Race So Far??
","So far, this years addition of the amazing race family edition, has been satisfactory. I think that it is a great idea to get the kids involved, but I really think that the families should start going into different countries. Even if their are little kids, countries like Canada and Mexico should be fine. I cannot wait until the end of this years addition. I don't know about you, but my bet is on the Linz family. They seem very strong and competitive. After watching tonight's episode (Shroeder family eliminated), I think they might start to bring the families into Canada. So far, I have liked the idea of all challenges being fit for all ages. Even if some are a little bit to easy, their good for the kids!!I cannot wait until the end....peace out!",/review/rw6256111/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2011,Blackace,9," Best Reality Show On Television - Period
","There are hundreds of reality shows on television now, all over the world, but only one captures the excitement. fun, drama, exhilaration, competition and intelligence of a great show. That show is The Amazing Race. Eleven paired contestants travel all over the world completing objectives and challenges on their way to the final ""Pit Stop"" of the day. Not only are these challenges physical, but all mental and frustrating. Players have to keep it together with themselves and their partner if they are to make it to the end ahead of everyone else. The last couple who makes it to the ""Pit-Stop"" is usually eliminated. The show is so fun to watch not only for the incredible locations and exciting race on foot, in car, by plane and train through each city, but also because of all the drama between contestants and their partners. Many partners are so competitive, that they get frustrated with their partner or themselves and it shows on camera in many different ways. Every episode is a blast to watch. you never know what's going to happen next or what location they will travel to. It's fun seeing the world and culture of other people. It's even more fun watching the couples navigate though an unfamiliar environment. One wrong turn or flat tire could push them into last place. There are other great reality shows like American Idol, So You Think You Can Dance. Top Chef, Chopped, America's Got Talent, but none of them are as creative or interesting as The Amazing Race. No wonder it's already on it's 18th season, as they've decided to do 2 seasons a year now. The show is so popular. Definitely check this show out.",/review/rw6256111/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2020,teebear817,1," This isnt reality
","The editing on this show is absolutely disgusting. I took a stopwatch and timed it every 30 seconds... they had 23 scene changes in 30 seconds ...46 scene changes every 60 Seconds. Thats 2760 scene changes in one hour. it's Kaleidoscope directing...you can't even focus on anybody you're looking at for more than one second . Thats absolutely revolting. And i Know there is cheating by the producers. Many events such as season 8 where two families with small children had to row across the Delaware. Both boats drifted far downstream. The kids had no strength to row. Suddenly, as i predicted to my wife would happen....suddenly both boats appeared on the shore. No way!!! They were helped off camera. Thats cheating. Have you noticed that EVERY airport in EVERY country has their airport ticket counter wide open for contestants? Always. No people in front of them. Ever been to an airport? Did you ever go up to the desk and have nobody anywhere near it? always you're like 10th or 15th in line. Obviously, producers are keeping it wide open for contestants. That's not reality, its dishonesty. Same with any place they go to. Cabs waiting for them often , etc. One of the worst examples is the Weaver family, when they had to go to the stadium and find a black box on the back of one of the tens of thousands of chairs, they looked and looked for hours and couldn't find it..they finally said...we give up, we are quitting. Then 10 minutes later all of a sudden all four family members are up on the very top row and they happen to find it . Impossible. All four family members would be in different sections looking for it if they were legitimately looking for it. Clearly The Producers told them where it was. they were exhausted and refused to go back up there and they never showed us them finding it. clearly it was rigged to keep them in the game. could go on and on but why bother. Its fake.",/review/rw6256111/?ref_=tt_urv
