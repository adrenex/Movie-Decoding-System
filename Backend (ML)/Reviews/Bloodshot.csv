","""Brad's Status"" begins like a coming-of-age film about a young man interviewing colleges as he embarks upon adulthood. But the coming-of-age experience is more applicable to the boy's father, who is experiencing a peculiar mid-life crisis about ""status.""",/review/rw6384269/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2017,Jithindurden,8," Mind's Status
","Brad is the type of guy who doesn't belong in any kind of social circle really. For some he is too low for their class, for others he is too high. While his problems are laughable compared to problems that are solved by the funds he raises, that doesn't make his problem mom existent. People generally tries to classify this type of films as futile attempts by privileged people. But human mind is always in a fight with itself to achieve more in life and whatever the world around is going about ultimately it's your mind that decides if you have failed yourself or not. Even though the film deals with familiar themes the script is powerful enough to keep you uncomfortable throughout the film. Ben Stiller again proves his best characters are dramatic roles with a light touch of comedy.",/review/rw6384269/?ref_=tt_urv

6 October 2017,inkblot11,8," Wonderful quirky film; almost a monologue with interludes
","Brad (Ben Stiller) has lately been fretting about his ""status"" in the world of middle-agers. As he and his son Troy (Austin Abrams), a gifted musician and composer, are about to embark from Sacramento to a Boston tour of colleges, Bradley is in a funk. This is because he has been pondering the so-called more successful lives of his college pals. Jason (Luke Wilson) is a jet-setting, rich hedge-fund manager while Billy (Jemaine Clement) made a tech fortune and retired, at 40, on Maui. Worst of all, Craig (Michael Sheen) is a best-selling pundit on political issues and teaches at Harvard. What has he, Brad, done? For wife Melanie (Jenna Fischer) and himself, its strictly the mundane bourgeousie. Brad manages a non-profit that finds funds for other non-profits while Mel works for the California government. So, while Troy and his dad go to Harvard and Tufts for interviews, Brad upsets the apple cart by embarrassing Troy in front of friends and administrators. This is doubly so when Brad actually needs Craig's help to gain a 2nd interview with a dean! But, in truth, is Brad's status beyond lame? This wonderful, quirky film is almost a monologue as the viewer gets a running commentary by Brad of each and every situation. Yes, there are interludes of actual conversations and happenings and Abrams, Wilson, Clement, Sheen, Fischer and all of the rest do good work. But, its up to Stiller to carry the film with his wry, self- deprecating analysis of life and he does so beautifully. We bow to you, Ben! Scenery, costumes, illuminating script and deft direction all bring the film satisfying results. Most importantly, the movie truly gets it ""right"" on what makes a life well-lived. Go, go to Brad, film lovers! Hollywood rarely bestows gems like this anymore.",/review/rw6384269/?ref_=tt_urv
4 November 2017,smetin,7," Great story but a bit slow
","I hadn't seen a Ben Stiller movie in a while and this one kind of came out of nowhere. Very little marketing and promotion meant that when I saw it was released I was surprised, but it is reflected in its low budget. The movie follows Brad (Ben Stiller) who is disappointed with his life, since all of his friends became very rich and successful in life. The plot revolves around him going to Harvard with his son, who is trying to get into the university. ",/review/rw6384269/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2017,hiyangbo,10," so real. flawless performance
","So real. Flawless performance. One of the best movie this year so far. It's not a movie for everyone. I understand why some people could fall asleep while watching it. Its depth could be understood only if one have had several years fighting and climbing in the society and have a family and children to cherish and thankful for. I felt the echos in my soul and could foresee what I would look like in Brad's age. Everyone is relatively poor; the circle can be one percent, or one millionth or one billionth. And vice verse everyone is relatively happier and richer compared to the rest. And the ""real pains"" come from those meaningless comparisons and competitions that we impose on ourselves. Everyone have a choice of how to live their lives and how to plan and realize their futures. It's just a bunch of unique decisions that we have made and are making for ourselves. When you are jealous about someone's success in career or something, you don't know how much they sacrifice on their life balance or health or something else that you weigh way more over the former. There's no better or worse life. There is always shadow behind sunshine. It's just a matter whether you like it or not, grateful or regretful. And if you like your life and are grateful, you already win the competition if you really want such a comparison.",/review/rw6384269/?ref_=tt_urv

","Nice film and very thought provoking. It is a slow paced film but necessary with the narrative. Ben is such a versatile actor and this is evident in this film. In a world of money grabbing Hollywood Avenger-type franchises, this was a nice find. I often find these days that the lower the budget the stronger the narrative. Worth a watch for sure and I really enjoyed it.",/review/rw6384269/?ref_=tt_urv

","Mike White the writer and the director gets a little credit and all the blame for this one. The lead character is so shallow and difficult to be around. If that isn't bad enough he is constantly revealing his thoughts and feelings in voice over dialogue. It's a perfect movie for a blind audience.

4 October 2017,howard.schumann,9," That little voice in the back of your head
","Have you noticed that little voice in the back of your head that keeps chattering all the time? You know, the one that just asked, ""What voice?"" Only a short time ago, my own voice was telling me about all the people in my life that I had let down and how I had failed to live up to my own expectations. When I was able to quiet that voice, however, I could look and see how the love with which I was surrounded was more meaningful than any perceived failures. In Mike White's (""Enlightened"" TV series) comedy/drama Brad's Status, 47-year-old Brad Sloan, played to perfection by Ben Stiller (""While We're Young""), is in the midst of a mid-life crisis, constantly listening to his inner monologue telling him he is a failure because he has fallen short of the material success of his old friends from college.",/review/rw6384269/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2017,mannacio,5," Over wrought
","Most people, even successful ones,have doubts about themselves but Brad really needs a psychiatrist for his feelings of inadequacy and this movie lays it on so thick viewers may feel they have been recruited to the position. There are a few moments when some dim realization begins to set in that material success may not be everything but not enough to provide any kind of balance. If this was intended as a comedy it is too dour. If it was intended as a slice of life it is not a slice I would want to see.",/review/rw6384269/?ref_=tt_urv

20 October 2017,banhei,6," Interesting but too incidental
","Gore Vidal notoriously said, ""Whenever a friend succeeds, a little something in me dies,"" which could be this movie's subtitle. Interesting subject matter I think, but this movie could have used more of an outright plot. Whether I'm right or not, this movie had the feel of having been written with a vague direction in mind but no structured outline set down beforehand. (The long bar conversation with the big-brown-eyed girl kind of came out of nowhere and I suspect did, to the writer as he sat at his laptop.) Ben Stiller was okay, but I felt his regular (facial) expressions of resentment could have used more variety and nuance. Knowing both ends of: not thrilling at running into people as I puttered along with nothing to brag about, to suddenly being put in charge of huge projects covered in the international press that suddenly made me the star of dinner parties, I found this an interesting movie, but wanted more of a story than a collection of vignettes. (For those who liked them, this movie I felt could almost go together as a sort loose trilogy with Stiller's GREENBERG and PERMANENT MIDNIGHT.)",/review/rw6384269/?ref_=tt_urv

During his predictable journey he learns that his friends all have problems worse than his. He bonds with his kid. In the end he concludes that his like is a-okay.

21 September 2017,ferguson-6,7," growing up
","Greetings again from the darkness. Mid-life crisis has long been a popular movie topic. A list of the best would include: Fellini's 8 ½, Blake Edwards' 10, American BEAUTY, CRAZY STUPID LOVE, SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE, THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY, THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH, and THELMA & LOUISE. Some of these are outright comedies, while others are turbulent dramas. With the label 'white male privilege' being applied so broadly these days, it's impressive how writer/director Mike White (THE GOOD GIRL, SCHOOL OF ROCK, creator of TV's ""Enlightened"") so expertly and gracefully takes on the familiar topic.",/review/rw6384269/?ref_=tt_urv

20 December 2020,Pjtaylor-96-138044,7," First-world problems.
","'Brad's Status (2017)' is, essentially, an exploration of first-world problems, the sort of issues that seem trivial in the grand scheme of things yet also hold great importance for those experiencing them. The movie balances both sides of this equation remarkably well, never feeling as though it looks down on those like its protagonist but also keeping their problems in perspective. It's a very insular sort of experience; we're firmly inside the head of our hero throughout. He narrates his ruminative inner thoughts, struggling to come to terms with his place in life. It's often somewhat downbeat but always manages to avoid feeling 'depressing', for want of a better word. The experience is often rather funny and it renders its characters in a realistically multi-faceted way. Its central father-son dynamic is believable and, even, affecting on occasion. It's really what holds the film together, alongside an excellently grounded lead performance from Stiller. In the end, the affair is engaging and enjoyable, despite being a little deflating. 7/10",/review/rw6384269/?ref_=tt_urv
