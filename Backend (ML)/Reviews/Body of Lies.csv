","...because it represents more than a biopic. Because it gives a bitter - poetic portrait of familiar things. From friendship to bitter choices, from love to discover of vocation, from war to the most significant small things defining you. Because it is real well acted and has inspired script and propose a version of Tolkien ' s life more touching and precise than I expect. A film about war and passion and friendship and love , seductive for the game of nuances and for a sort of...magic. And, sure, Nicholas Hould seems the most wise option for the roles of real, real special writers.",/review/rw4824872/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2020,jrarichards,9," Inevitably insufficient, but offers the milieu in which JRR found himself well enough
","Given the extraordinary power, popularity and (literally) ""magic"" of both books and movies, we are obviously in need of explorations of Tolkien's life and creativity, even as we know that you can't make a film out of a biographical book (of which there are several in this case - each of 300-400 pages), and even as we know that a person of brilliance and imagination flowing through the pen does not necessarily (though may) have a brilliant and imaginative life.",/review/rw4824872/?ref_=tt_urv

6 May 2019,Pairic,8," Engaging Biopic
","Tolkien: Not quite the romantic warrior professor but certainly all three of the preceding in part. Tolkien had a tough early life, falling into impecunity, his mother had to move with J.R.R. (Harry Gilby as the young Tolkien) and his brother from a rural idyll to the satanic mills and factories of Birmingham, an early model for Mordor no doubt. Then getting excessively MisLit, his mother (Laura Donnelly) dies and he is fostered by an elderly rich lady and along with his brother gets scholarships to an exclusive school. His family's benefactor, always working behind the scenes, is Father Morgan (Colm Meaney), benevelovent but steely in his determination when Tolkien's romance with Edith threatens his chances of getting an Oxford scholarship. Morgan may have been the inspiration for Gandalf.",/review/rw4824872/?ref_=tt_urv

11 May 2019,CubsandCulture,6," The film is aimless...
","The film's main problem is it doesn't want to be about what it is about. The film is largely a series of episodes of how various things (events, people, other works etc.) influenced the Middle Earth texts. But the film resists trying to draw 1 to 1 parallels between Tolkien's life and his fictional world.The film goes out of its way to avoid allegory. This is somewhat admirable given Tolkien's famous distaste for allegory but at the same time there's too much of the Middle Earth texts in the film to avoid making the connections. And the film clearly wants you to make those connections. This split aim makes the film have no real narrative drive. I do like how sometimes the narrative unspecified symbolism allows you to read several aspects of Tolkien's mythology into a scene. There was 2-3 times an ambiguous reference to either Sauron or Morgoth.",/review/rw4824872/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2019,alever-46823,9," A beautiful and moving film
","I am a huge Tolkien fan and after reading some of the critics reviews I was a bit wary of seeing this film. I do not know which film the ""critics"" have seen but from their conclusions I do not recognise this film. I have literally just left the cinema, I found it so moving that I found myself in floods of tears. Beautifully acted, and set against the backdrop of WW1 the sense of loss and the harrowing reality of what war is came across in such depth. I loved the focus on language and the weight it can carry, It made me feel that words are in their own right living creatures. This is one of the few films that has not just entered my brain but is also in my heart. Please go and see this film whether you are a Tolkien fan or not, it is truly captivating.",/review/rw4824872/?ref_=tt_urv

24 May 2019,Hitchcoc,9," The Writer: His Soul and HIs Work
","This is a film which is steeped in British reserve. J. R. R. Tolkien had the roots of fantasy in his blood, put forth by his mother who dies when he is young. She was the master storyteller, so ingrained in his psyche. There were dragons and supernatural beings, some from opera, some from folklore. But the movie is about his efforts to be true to himself and follow the path laid out for him. He wanted to be at Oxford, but his social status made him quite vulnerable. It was his creativity and linguistic skills that bought him a reprieve. We forget that historically, he is not just a popular author but an academic genius, one of history's greatest linguists. This is a gentle movie but it is punctuated with flashback while he fought in the Somme, one of the bloodiest incidents in the history of warfare. This is a very good film.",/review/rw4824872/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2019,classicsoncall,8," ""I let myself believe that there were happy endings for people like us.""
","I'm always leery of movie biopics because of what they add and what they leave out. I don't know much about J.R.R. Tolkien's real life, so if this one accurately recounts his early, formative years, then it was quite well done. Particularly effective are the film's references to familiar aspects of Tolkien's work as exemplified by 'The Hobbit' and 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy. Many of those are recreated as Tolkien's fever dreams suffered in the trenches of The Somme during World War I. Even before seeing this picture, I have always been amazed by Tolkien's vast grasp of 'invented' languages, i.e., the lyric poetry and dialog that he created for the elven characters in his novels. His mind worked on so many different levels that it seems almost incomprehensible. The story here identifies in some ways the manner in which he developed that style, supported to a large degree by his mentor, Professor Wright (Derek Jacobi) at Oxford, along with his future wife Edith Bratt (Lily Collins). Much of his writing was also influenced by the fellowship of his school chums, forming their own secret society going by the T.C.B.S. - the Tea Club and Borrovian Society. Lest anyone miss the significance of the soldier Sam who successfully nursed Tolkien through his ordeal in the wartime trenches, it appears he was honored in The Trilogy by the presence of Frodo Baggins' loyal sidekick Sam Gamgee. Just one of the many references one will pick up by watching this effective treatment of J.R.R. Tolkien's early years.",/review/rw4824872/?ref_=tt_urv

7 August 2019,nogodnomasters,10," It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door.
","This is a biopic of J.R.R. Tolkien ( Nicholas Hoult ). It ends in 1937 when he starts to pen the Hobbit. It begins with his time in the trenches of WWI using his flashbacks to maintain sanity. It is a story of love and imagination. Of Sadness and the Horrors of war. We get to see how his life was shaped and ideas were formed with the two biggest influences on his life being his mother (Laura Donnelly) and wife (Mimi Keene). Not an action film, but a slow drama.",/review/rw4824872/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Tolkien"" (2019 release from the UK; 111 min.) is a biopic of writer J. R. R. Tolkien. As the movie opens, we are told it is ""The Somme, France, World War I"", and Tolkien is in the trenches and in bad shape. We then go back in time to ""Sarehole Mill, England"", where the young Tolkien lives with his mum and brother. Mum tells the boys that they are moving to Birmingham, much to young Tolkien's chagrin. At school, young Tolkien has trouble fitting in, until one day he befriends 3 other boys and they decide to form a ""fellowship""... At this point we're less than 15 min. Into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.",/review/rw4824872/?ref_=tt_urv

15 October 2020,Leofwine_draca,5," Typical
","TOLKIEN is a typical biopic of the kind that's familiar from the outset. Drama is added to the otherwise sedate story of the scholar turned world-famous fantasy author by playing up and focusing on Tolkien's brief time in the trenches in WW1, an experience he would have shared with millions of other young men of the period. These scenes are well handled, but the rest is perfectly ordinary, from the moments of tragedy and loss to the sensitive romance and upper-class upbringing which most of us will have no familiarity of whatsoever. Nicholas Hoult has always been an engaging actor but he can do little with his role in this one, and the same can be said of the rest of the cast. Like most other recent biopics of the last five years, I'd much rather read a biography.",/review/rw4824872/?ref_=tt_urv
