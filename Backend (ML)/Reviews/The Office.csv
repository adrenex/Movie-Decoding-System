7 August 2019,masonsaul,8," Great fun
","Despite a predictable plot The Angry Birds Movie 2 is great fun. Jason Sudeikis, Danny McBride, Josh Gad, Bill Hader and Sterling K. Brown all give great performances. The animation is really good, it's fast paced and consistently really funny. The soundtrack is also surprisingly great.",/review/rw5047424/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2019,ymuyuseda,10," Best Comedy & Family movie.

4 August 2019,QuirkyQueerGuy,8," Actually better than one would expect
","It's 2019, mobile games have evolved and Angry Birds is apparently still a thing. As shocking as this might sound, the sequel to the critically divisive 2016 CGI adventure actually improves on the first.",/review/rw5047424/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2019,arishsankar,8," I think SOME of the hate was unnecessary.

3 August 2019,thesupernoob,8," good movie
",Its good because most video game movies are quiet bad and most sequals are usually bad but this one is better than the original,/review/rw5047424/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2019,madden-brad,10," Absurdly funny. Kids loved it.
","I took my babies to Angry Birds 2 today and laughed to the point of tears MULTIPLE times. My daughter, who is 5 was laughing constantly as was the the rest of the theater. Even my 2 and half year old sat the whole time and was giggling. TAKE YOUR KIDS!",/review/rw5047424/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2019,rgkarim,8," Can't Be Angry With This Sequel
","Sequels to animated films are seldom as good as the first movie. Many times the story was not needed, or the masterpiece is diluted for a gimmick that just doesn't work. Fortunately, there are some that have paved the way for the potential to add to the story, continuing the world we love, but at the same time making a movie stand on its own. Tonight, Sony Pictures continues to try the luck with their surprise success of Angry Birds and see if they can get another round of bills to line the pockets. And for reviewers like me, we are back in the trenches to see how it fairs and do our best to highlight the observations. So let's get in there and review once more as I take o:",/review/rw5047424/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2019,muamba_eats_toast,8," Surprisingly good
",The first was ok but this was surprisingly good I found myself guiltily chuckling away to myself for large portions of the movie despite expecting it to be terrible. Well and truly fun for the whole family.,/review/rw5047424/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2019,jaylenej,10," Great movie for all Angry Birds fans
","After waiting 3 years for this, it was worth the wait. This movie has great new characters along with the original cast. This hilarious film is great for all ages and can't wait to see it again.",/review/rw5047424/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2019,TheCartoonCritic,8," Better than the first Movie
","This movie is about how the pigs and birds team up to fight the enemy together.
In my opinion the first angry birds movie was just ok while this movie was very good. The animation was much better than the first movie and looked amazing. It was also alot funnier than the first movie. I love the angry birds games but most video game movies are not that good, so i didn't think that this movie would be good so i was surprised.",/review/rw5047424/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2019,coombsstephen,7," Good laugh for smaller children and adults alike, just silly fun all the way through
","I didn't have high expectations going into this movie but happily it turned out to be a lot better than expected, after about the first 15 minutes.",/review/rw5047424/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2019,gollumofimdb,9," Super fun to watch
",The movie contains funny moments all the time and the characters are enjoyable for all the family. It is by far more fun than other cartoon and kids movies released this year. You won't be disappointed! Forget about the game and take it as a fun movie to watch. Highly recommended!,/review/rw5047424/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2019,kwenchow,1," Worse than the previous chapter! Not intense, too many overuse scene! Bored to freaking death!
","This film start with Bird Island having war with Pig Island, Pig Island attack by a massive icy cannonball, ""Red"" receive a truce letter from ""Leonard"" scene! As turnout, this film is about Red team up with Leonard to stop ""Zeta"" from Eagle Island launching the volcano weapon to destroy both of their Island! Entire film full of overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the song singing at the background scene! Overuse of the tripping scene! Overuse of ""red"" having anxiety scene! Bored to freaking death! Barely funny scene is, Chuck, Bomb and Leonard disguise as a bird robot, stealing an access card from a guard at the toilet scene! At the end, Mighty Eagle arrive and persuade Zeta to stop her evil plan! Mighty Eagle and Zeta get married! Red and Silver drinking wine in the statue! At the very end, the hatchling birds return a bag full of baby snakes to the baby snakes' mother! The baby snakes' mother return the baby birds to the hatchling birds! The baby birds run away! That's it! A boring animation film! Not recommended!",/review/rw5047424/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2019,sanchezrodrigomez,9," Nice movie
","I watched the preview on the movie (here, in Spain) and it's a movie you can't lose the chance to watch. You will laught during the entire movie. I've been waiting the producers to release another one, and boy, it's worth it.",/review/rw5047424/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2019,nick9838,1," Bird Brained
","Ok, so my review would be biased, I'm a dad taking her daughter to the movie, and I will be totally honest, I really wasn't excited about watching it, however my daughter was, so off we went to see it.
Halfway through my daughter wakes me up and says, Dad, I'm bored with this movie can I go home. Enough said if she even found it to be a waste of time.",/review/rw5047424/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2019,UniqueParticle,8," I don't wanna be ""All by myself""
","So much cuteness and hilarious moments! I'm so glad I saw this in the theater and the only one in the auditorium, well worth seeing although I have Regal unlimited now so it was 53 cents for me still though such a blast. Lots of emotions to experience, most of all though reminiscent of happier times before having to grow up, this seriously the perfect kids movie with a heroic story! Also Jason Sudeikis is amazing in most anything.",/review/rw5047424/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2019,Deadpool2016,," Better Than The First, A Okay And Funny Product Placement
",PROS:,/review/rw5047424/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2019,zac_g12,8," Funny and easy to follow
",Even though it has an awkward added short that should have been used in between the first and this film. It is very much the same great voice acting and pausing humor. Josh Gad however is still trying to push his opera singing once again. The best part has to be the third act. There is a hilarious dance off just like the commercials. I enjoyed it and I guarantee the targeted audience will too.,/review/rw5047424/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2019,SnoopyStyle,5," don't like Red
",Red is now the popular hero of Bird Island. The pigs are still their constant nemesis. An ice ball crashes near the pigs. It had been launched from an icy new island. The pigs proposes a truce. Red is initially against peace fearing a lost in his own personal prestige. He then sees an opportunity for more heroic adulation from a new quest.,/review/rw5047424/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2019,crescendo_1,2," Waste if time...
","Apart from a few jokes that were actually funny & the animation which one should expect to be good anyway, the rest of the movie was actually really boring with unnecessary plot twists and illogical scenes... Anybody who says that this is better than the first one (which was a passable hit) are just stupid...",/review/rw5047424/?ref_=tt_urv
23 August 2019,ShelbyTMItchell,7," Predictable but Fun
",It is predictable as Red and his friends as the birds that are without any kind of wings to fly take on their nemesis at the beginning of the first film the green pigs.,/review/rw5047424/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2021,007Waffles,1," Garbage!!
",The first movie was okay. It had its funny moments.,/review/rw5047424/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2020,Golightly678,4," Cute and utterly nauseating
",The First I watched at least 10 times. It never gets old. Loooooove how they translated the game into a movie.,/review/rw5047424/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2019,georgianick,9," OH MY GOSH!!!!! (Referring to that silly bird that was always saying that... You sure know who I'm talking about, don't you?! ðŸ˜…)
