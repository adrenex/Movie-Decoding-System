14 December 2022,trimblecali,8," Zoey Deutch = modern rom-com queen
","This movie wouldn't have been half as good with our Zoey Deutch. She's so great in rom-coms. She's so charismatic and magnetic. This movie started off iffy. The dialogue is not the best. I was definitely expecting a Hallmark channel type of film. But it picks up after the first act and I ended up really enjoying it. It's not too corny and doesn't fall into an obscene amount of cliches. It was a very tame, safe rom-com that you can definitely watch with the whole family. It's also a movie that just so happens to be set around Christmas but it's barely mentioned at all so you can watch any time of the year.",/review/rw8757369/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2022,TxMike,," Pleasant New York City romance story.
","Frankly the trailer gives a bit too much away, but still ... Zoey Deutch (Lea Thompson's daughter) is Executive Producer and also stars as Rachel Meyer. She co-owns a bakery in New York City and has a boyfriend. One evening leading up to Christmas he is shopping at Tiffany's for an appropriate gift, he selects some nice but ""affordable"" earrings. He leaves the store with the gift in a nice blue Tiffany's bag.",/review/rw8757369/?ref_=tt_urv

","There is a car accident in front of Tiffany. There is a mix up with two blue boxes. There are marriage proposals and non-marriage proposals. It's bad relationships and one budding sweet one. Rachel Meyer (Zoey Deutch) is a New York baker with a bad boyfriend. In Tiffany, Ethan Greene (Kendrick Sampson) is picking a ring with his daughter.",/review/rw8757369/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2022,danieljfarthing,3," A dumb predictable Christmas turkey of a rom-com that should def'ly be returned
","Zoey Deutch CAN be great, but also mediocre, as well sadly as crap... and in blah Christmas rom-com ""Something From Tiffany's"" she's the over-cooked latter. When her modest Tiffany's Xmas gift from douche bf Ray Nicholson gets switched with the stellar diamond ring Kendrick Sampson (in what was supposed to be his break-out role) got for his mismatched intended-fianc√©e Shay Mitchell, a slew of superficial, dumb, predictable slush ensues - with obnoxious over-confident child (Leah Jeffries) thrown in for bad measure. Whoever hired writer Tamara Chestna & director Daryl Wein hopefully kept their receipt, cos this Xmas turkey should DEF'LY be returned.",/review/rw8757369/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2022,kevin_robbins,7," This isn't perfect but it is a worthwhile addition to the holiday genre with a nice modern feel to it
",Something from Tiffany's (2022) is a movie my wife and I watched last week on Amazon Prime. The storyline follows a young man with a daughter who plans to get engaged to his girlfriend for Christmas and heads to Tiffany's to get an engagement ring. As he's leaving he bumps into a man buying earrings for his girlfriend for Christmas. The man buying earrings is hit by a car and the guy with the engagement ring rushes to his aid and calls an ambulance. Of course their gifts are swapped in the process and the ability to get the gifts back is more challenging than the guy planning to get married hopes.,/review/rw8757369/?ref_=tt_urv

",Nothing makes sense in this movie. Characters act in the weirdest ways. I found myself making a confused face the whole time because nothing anyone did was reasonable.,/review/rw8757369/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2022,rogerstoryteller,8," More like afternoon tea than breakfast at Tiffsnys

","Love isn't always perfect, like a Tiffany's diamond. Rachel Meyer's (Zoey Deutch) life suddenly changes on Christmas day when she receives a surprising gift from her boyfriend, Gary (Ray Nicholson), and he is just as surprised as she. That same morning Ethan Greene (Kendrick Sampson) watches his future fiance Vanessa (Shay Mitchell) open a gift box only to discover the engagement ring he purchased has turned into earrings. This unintentional gift exchange sets off a series of humorous and heartfelt events encouraging Rachel and Ethan to find their true happiness and love.",/review/rw8757369/?ref_=tt_urv

9 December 2022,williamsjaquana,8," Super Cute Rom Com
",This movie is so adorable. Of course there are always some inconsistencies in rom coms but for the most part it is amazing. The two leads have great chemistry. I love that the cast was very diverse. It just gave me a warm feeling inside. It makes me want to read the book asap. This was exactly what I needed for the holidays. I wish there were more scenes with them together but I guess that's the point since they hardly knew one another. The ending was perfect. I love when movies give you closure for the characters. If you're looking for a cute romantic holiday film definitely check this one out! You won't be disappointed!!,/review/rw8757369/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2022,geoffreyspears,1," Well, that was unexpectedly unpleasant
","Even by fluffy romcom standards this one stood out as dismal. The characters were poorly written and clumsily realized, the chemistry between and among them was literally nonexistent and the story lacked coherence, logic and direction. It was impossible to suspend disbelief enough to believe any of it and as bad as the past few films Zoey has chosen to do have been, another one like this and she might find herself forced to do exclusively do Hallmark romances. Just stream ""The Setup"" if you're having trouble remembering Zoey's once promising potential - it was her last movie worth the price of admission.",/review/rw8757369/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2022,Muvilava,1," Tiffany doesn't sell low quality
","Tiffany's should sue the people behind this crazy lazily written movie. It's so predictable, it hurts. Apparently it's based on a book. I find it hard to believe. Either the book is good and the movie people just took the title only and not the story. Or maybe the book is as bad as the movie, it got published by some sheer miracle.",/review/rw8757369/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2022,bzxkvjvw,10," Loved it!
",Wow something from Tiffany's! This was a such an amazing movie! Hello's sunshine and Amazon prime also Reese Witherspoon and Zoey Deutch they did such a great job with this one. I loved the whole story. The film location New York at Christmas I mean it's such a beautiful place! The cast was great. Amazing rom com and Christmas movie for Christmas time. I can't wait to rewatch this movie! I hope it will come to 4k and Blu-ray so I can have a physical copy to watch. So I would say if you like a good rom com Christmas movie with a great story and cast then watch this movie! You won't be disappointed!,/review/rw8757369/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2022,ssksks30,9," Zoey shines as per usual
","If I were not a fan of Zoey Deutch, this film probably wouldn't have been on my radar due to the small amount of marketing, but I'm glad I am!!! It was a cute holiday movie; predictable, sweet, funny, and well executed. I loved the friendships and bonds between characters and the sense of family, it was all so enjoyable and heartwarming. It was obvious from the beginning that neither of the leads were with the right romantic partner, so how nice it was to see them end up with one another. Would recommend to anyone who loves a feel-good, somewhat cheesy romance. Once again, Zoey can do no wrong!",/review/rw8757369/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2022,rogerflores-41611,3," Zooey Deutsch can't save Absurd Plot line
","This movie has such a glaring plot hole its un-watchable. The entire movie could have ended 7 minutes in if the lead character just showed Zooey Deutsch the receipt for the ring that he bought for his fiance on his credit card. Apparently this movie takes place in a world where no one gets a credit card bill. He bought a diamond engagement ring vs the cheap earrings the other guy bought. Pretty simple solution ends this stupid movie. Instead, we're supposed to believe that he never considers this option. He apparently lives in a Universe where he is forced to try to convince the other guy to admit he took his gift or convince Zooey Deutsch that the other guy is lying. Um, receipt much! Show the credit card statement and this movie ends like it should've-- 5 minutes in. Add the terrible acting by the romantic lead male and everyone's dialogue and this movie is painfully amateur and non-sensical.",/review/rw8757369/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2022,itmeansflower,10," Well done! One of the better Xmas romances!
","I just finished watching this, and I was just so pleasantly surprised! The story, the performances, the locations... It all comes together seamlessly. Sure it's a bit predictable, as so many of these types of movies are. But there's something about it, maybe it's the performances from the actors, I don't know, but there's something about it that feels fresh. There is a lot about it that makes it very relevant, not just with the biracial romance, but also the main character's best friend being in a gay marriage. None of it feels like you're being hit over the head with these things, and it felt very realistic. I could easily watch this one again! If you want some light enjoyable seasonal fun, watch this!",/review/rw8757369/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2022,klwalthour,6," Anti climactic
","Fine movie, but anti-climactic and predictable. The last part was fine with me, as it is just a simple holiday movie. Throughout it, nothing made me feel anything-no excitement, no happiness, not even any anger. I feel Shay Mitchell's character bore the brunt of both lead character's development and journeys but alas...Zooey Deutch was fine as usual, quirky and compelling in her own ways. At the end of the day, it's a simple film about nothing that is enjoyable to watch and fun too. The daughter's age is confusing: she looks 18, acts 5 and sometimes 30, but is...13?? That's the only thing that annoyed me.",/review/rw8757369/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2022,Lejink,6," Tiffany Twisted
","This modern-day Amazon Prime Christmas love story will never usurp Audrey in claiming Tiffany's of New York's most famous movie attribution but as a seasonal, light-hearted rom-com it passes an agreeable 90 minutes or so viewing time.",/review/rw8757369/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2023,krpdimitra,5," Not thrilled
","Let's clarify first that I consider anyone who chooses to see this movie aware of the fact that it's a rom com. So, cliches and a predictable ending are totally on the schedule and they're not a reason to rate this movie low. And I particularly enjoy those things, so I am usually more than happy to watch a movie again and again, but the thing is I won't be seeing this one again. I'm sorry to say there was not much chemistry between the leads and the storyline was kinda boring. There was nothing really special about it, that is. The acting was just fine, Zoey was Zoey, yadda yadda yadda. But that's all there was to it, hence the five stars.",/review/rw8757369/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2022,ylopez-23794,10," Zoey Deutsch was awesome!
","I just saw this movie and it was adorable!! I loved the female actress Zoey Deutsch, she was so refreshing to watch, she was bubbly and fresh faced and had great chemistry with the male lead(Ethan). And I gotta say his little daughter in the movie is sooooooooo cuuute!",/review/rw8757369/?ref_=tt_urv
13 December 2022,fgkrjgpdp,8," Great RomCom
","I absolutely loved this movie. It is equally romantic as it is funny! It has PHENOMENAL acting - and the setting (New York) helps sell the unfathomable story and you really believe this wild scenario brought these two people together and put them on this journey. Overall this movie stands FAR ahead of the competition. If you're looking for a date night movie or just a new good film to watch you should definitely consider this one! Don't be quick to write of Soemthing from Tiffany's because ""Amazon doesn't make good originals"" or because ""I'll find something better on Netflix"" you can bet this will keep you smiling and laughing while wanting to possible find love yourself.",/review/rw8757369/?ref_=tt_urv

26 December 2022,steveowalk,1," Something from Cheaters
","""Something from Tiffany's"" - a movie that should have been a heartwarming holiday rom-com, but ended up being a hot mess of infidelity and questionable morals. Seriously, what were Rachel and Ethan thinking? They both had perfectly fine relationships with Gary and Vanessa, but decided to throw it all away for a cheap fling? And don't even get me started on Rachel's painfully cookie-cutter manic pixie dream girl persona. Ugh.",/review/rw8757369/?ref_=tt_urv
