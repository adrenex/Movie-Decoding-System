7 October 2017,benjaminburt,8," Not the Best Movie Ever, but My Favorite Nonetheless
","Big Fish is nowhere near a perfect movie. Sometimes the dialogue is awkward, the pacing drags at times, and Steve Buscemi is, as always, a weirdo. There are bizarre and fantastical ideas that can take you out of the movie. For all its flaws, I can't give it more than an 8. That being said, this is my favorite movie of all time.",/review/rw4660525/?ref_=tt_urv

","The whole story of a man's life is something large, but this movie managed to be entertaining and comical telling a story by dividing it into many stages so well told it feels like it's a little fairy tale, so many aspects and many temporal lines in 2 hours that feels like just a single hour.",/review/rw4660525/?ref_=tt_urv

24 December 2003,write_mich,8," How to create your own legacy...
","I often find that in order to be captivating, a film these days needs to be stressfully suspenseful or have a complicated story line. This film had neither, and yet I found myself hoping it wouldn't end while at the same time, anxiously awaiting its conclusion. I have to admit, I was distrustful of Burton as many of his more recent films have had less-than-satisfying conclusions. Nonetheless, I went to see Big Fish (3 days before its release in Canada) with no expectations and was astounded. This movie is an absolute treat for our hearts, ears and especially our eyes with each cartoon/fantasy-like scene painted with Tim Burton's reliable brilliance and magical touch. Ewan McGregor is pure sunshine and Albert Finney gives one of the greatest performances of the year- he *is* Big Fish. But I suppose that when you strip away the beauty, the doll-house sets and all the abracadabra of cinematography and modern day technology, all you have is a very simple story, and therein lies the heart of this film; that one can create their own legacy, ""the story of my life."" Not through either extreme of extraordinary adventure or unbelievable lies, but through the art of storytelling- and THAT is what this film is about. It is through our *stories* that we are immortal.",/review/rw4660525/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2004,PlanecrazyIkarus,," Movie Magic
","Every other year you get a movie that oozes magic and charm. Think ""Chocolat"". Think ""Amelie"". Think ""What dreams may come"". Perhaps even, ""Being John Malkovich"". And this year, it's time to think big... ""Big Fish"", to be precise. All four of these movies have some things in common. Merely describing the premise is not nearly enough to do justice to the mood of the film. And the mood, the emotional reaction of the audience, is in many ways much more important than the actual content. Still, there's no way around it in a proper review: We meet a disillusioned young man and his father, a charming old guy who knows exactly how to tell stories to fascinate first-time listeners and children. Unfortunately, there's barely any of those left, as he retold his magical stories once too often. When his health and life are beginning to fade away, his son wants to finally learn the truth about his father. Meanwhile, we hear his life story, as he tells it... Tim Burton is probably best-known for visual eye candy movies. Few directors can compete with the imagination he's shown in movies like Batman, Nightmare before Christmas and Sleepy Hollow. Outside the realm of darker, more gothic visuals, Tim Burton has so far been somewhat less prolific. Planet of the Apes was an expensive embarrassment, and Ed Wood is a decidedly acquired taste. Big Fish, then, is a new direction for him. Yes, it is eye candy, or perhaps even eye H""agen Dazs. But this time, the movie has much more of a soul than his monkeyplanet. This soul is achieved by two means: a great story (or collection of stories) and great acting. If you don't believe that the story is great, watch the audience. At key moments, everyone was chuckling or laughing, at others, I heard dozens of sniffs and tissues being unpacked around me. Yes, this is heartwarming stuff that a colder, more cynical soul would call cheese. Finally, Burton has found a story worthy of his talents again. And, better yet, he did not forget to encourage his cast to act. For a case study of such failure, see Christina Ricci's completely flat performance in Sleepy Hollow. In Big Fish, the cast is so carefully selected that failure is simply not an option. Ewan McGregor (playing the father in his youth) may not have much more to do than smile, be charming and sustain a Southern US accent, but he does it brilliantly. Much more important are the performances of Albert Finney and Jessica Lange, playing the aged father and mother, respectively. And they both deliver character performances worthy of prizes.",/review/rw4660525/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2004,MovieAddict2016,," Tim Burton's career equivalent of ""Forrest Gump"" is an ultimately rewarding adult fable with some beautiful cinematography and memorable ideas...
","It was either ""Cheaper by the Dozen,"" ""The Haunted Mansion"" or this. I didn't exactly feel like watching my favorite comedian run around with a horde of little kids cracking bad poopy jokes behind them, and I didn't want to see Eddie Murphy do this either (it was bad enough in last year's ""Daddy Day Care""), so I chose to see the more adult-oriented of these three films, and I'm glad I did, because Tim Burton's ""Big Fish"" is a marvelous film--full of wit and imagination and eerie vibes that sometimes don't fit into Burton's films the way he wants them to--but actually have a purpose here.",/review/rw4660525/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2013,Crizmkodo,9," This movie reminds me story of me and my father, before he died on cancer
","My father was a brilliant sculptor and a great visionary. When I was a kid, I never could explain what he was doing. I got it a month before his death when i was 26. This film filled my eyes with tears, because it reminded me him. he had a lot of ideas and brilliant and original ideas for improving the world, but for all his life he could not sell it to anyone, because those ideas filled his whole day. Literally. His whole apartment was filled with papers. Thank you for this movie. Thank you for the message. I would add a note that when we dream, we are escaping from the world of facts and truths. When my father said that if you think of anything in life, you have to write it down because what comes to your mind it never comes again it changed my life. Now I'm writing a book - a novel from environment of Mesopotamia and that just because my father was someone who believed in imagination and creative values​​.",/review/rw4660525/?ref_=tt_urv

Now there's Big Fish, a film loaded with visual spectacle, and it shows Burton working an adaptation to his own advantage for the first time in years.  Here he tells a story about storytelling, using both make-up, sets, and CGI at his disposal, and it's about one man's own imagination and how he carried it on to others, whether they were delighted by the tall tales or not.",/review/rw4660525/?ref_=tt_urv

27 December 2003,blademalfoy,," Cohesive and a feast for the eyes
","I've had high hopes for this movie since I first heard about it some time ago.  After all, most of the Tim Burton movies I've seen (barring Planet of the Apes) have been really wonderful.  To say the least, Big Fish did not disappoint me.  The story - by no means complex or suspenseful - was simple enough to allow the viewer to really take in the fantasy and mythology in Edward Bloom's tales.  One didn't need a surprise ending or secret identities to make this film enjoyable.  Rather, it was the simplicity and universal nature of the story that made it interesting. While some reviews have mentioned that the film can seem choppy at times, I didn't see this at all.  The transition seemed smooth and logical, and while sometimes I found myself wishing for more scenes of younger Edward Bloom, I never felt bored by any of the movie.  Nothing seemed to 'drag'. I was also quite impressed with the quality of acting in nearly the entire cast.  Billy Crudup didn't really hit his stride until the end, but he was tolerable through the first three-quarters of the movie.  Albert Finney did a great job of portraying a lion on his last legs, bigger than his body but unable to show it.  Jessica Lange was amazing and added the emotional oomph that Billy Crudup often failed to provide.  And while Ewan McGregor's role was not particularly difficult, at no point did he overplay the character, and his accent (to my ear anyway) never slipped. Though this wasn't as dark as Sleepy Hollow or as bizarre as Edward Scissorhands and Beetlejuice, Big Fish definitely had the Tim Burton touch in its scenery.  The colors - whether dull for Elder Bloom's time or bright for Younger Bloom - matched the mood perfectly, and everywhere you looked (especially in Bloom the Younger's timeframe) there was something else to marvel at.  Tim Burton fans will not be disappointed.",/review/rw4660525/?ref_=tt_urv

7 March 2006,Hitchcoc,7," There Are Lots of Big Fish in the Sea
","I had the advantage of having read the novel before the movie. The book works a little better. Others have talked about the specifics of the movie. I want to talk about the premise of the lie. My father was a liar (often in the most positive sense of the word). My sister and I grew up with so much misinformation, that we have spent the last 30 years after his death trying to rake through the BS. We often heard tales like the ones in the book (not quite as dramatic but creative nevertheless). It was mostly things he had done. That he had accomplished. Why we were so darned poor after all this always confused me. If someone had met all those people and had all those experiences, why hadn't he parlayed them into something incredible. Once we got through it, we realized he wasn't a liar. He was an entertainer. And what he did was to pump life into a world that often doesn't have life. And while we would groan at him and tell him to stop, we would listen as if everything he said was gospel. The Albert Finney character was the same way. To be metaphorically taken away by his fantasies was the greatest gift he could give. The only gift he had. And every one was a harmless, benevolent yarn that would live on after him. There are still times when one of my father's stories pops into my head and I have to regroup and rethink before I realized what a fabrication it was.",/review/rw4660525/?ref_=tt_urv

Venturesome as though he may be, Ed Bloom leaves his Mayberry, joins the circus, and decides to fall in love...True love comes along less than once in a lifetime...The intuition for true love in this movie is succinctly illustrated through a dark angled idealism, and suddenly, problems with falling in love are romanticized by a myriad of quirky determination patterns, as well as utterly human shortcomings!!. Married, having a son, a house, etc, etc, etc and so on and so on and so on and so forth and so forth and so forth, pans out to whereby his emeritus years become those of expounding dissertation about his exciting dare devil nefarious life as an impervious adolescent.. Spinning Yarns? We know better!!...Try telling his son that...Too incredible!! Too spectacular!! Too heroic!!...Ed Bloom's blindly motivational love and devotion towards the woman he cherishes, makes Romeo and Juliet's relationship seem platonic...

17 April 2010,TheLittleSongbird,9," Sweet, imaginative and moving
","I will admit I like Tim Burton, and have enjoyed a vast majority of his films, Edward Scissorhands, Beetle Juice, Batman and Ed Wood. Big Fish is I think one of Burton's better movies in my personal opinion, maybe not his very best, but it is a very sweet, imaginative and moving film. Here Burton delves into familiar territory, a strange place between reality and fantasy, dream and nightmare. The story is really sweet, and while slow at times, does have a poignant ending. The visuals as pretty much always in a Tim Burton film are gorgeous, not Gothic here like in Sleepy Hollow and Edward Scissorhands but evergreen and picturesque. The scenery was beautiful and so was the cinematography, and Danny Elfman's score is stunning. His score for Edward Scissorhands blew me away, but the lyrical, sensitive and hypnotic themes used here make it a score that is truly special. The screenplay is well crafted, and has a bittersweet feel to it. Sentimental yes, but also bittersweet. The acting is remarkably good, with Ewan McGregor making for a handsome yet somewhat charming young Edward Bloom, and the wonderful Albert Finney a revelation as his older self. Billy Crudup is excellent as the son who is intent on exposing his father, and sets out to learn the truth, and Danny DeVito is great as the shape-changing circus ringmaster. Jessica Lange is beautiful and alluring as Sandra and Helena Bonham Carter is almost unrecognisable as the Witch. Then there is Alison Lohman, Marion Cottilard, Robert Guillaume and Matthew McGory(as Karl the Giant) and they are very good as well. Overall, I loved this film, it is moving and very imaginative. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw4660525/?ref_=tt_urv
