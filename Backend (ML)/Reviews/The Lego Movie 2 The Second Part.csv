1 July 2020,Fella_shibby,8," Date Night part two. Funny n entertaining with lovely performances by Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani.
","An argumentative couple on the brink of ending their relationship, hits a cyclist with their car who doesn't get injured. Later they r approached by a cop who uses their car to pursue the same cyclist n rather than arresting the cyclist, the cop kills him with the couple's car. The couple flee the scene aft witnessing the murder. The husband wants them to turn themselves in, but the wife argues that their unbelievable story and racial profiling will ensure they are blamed for the crime. They try to pursue the matter n solve the mystery to clear their names.
Well this may seem very similar to Date Night but this film has enuff funny moments, good pacing n lovely chemistry n acting.
Coincidentally this is the second Kumail Nanjiani film aft Stuber I saw within a short period n both r very funny n light films to check out during this lockdown.",/review/rw5764680/?ref_=tt_urv

","I understand if you watch this and don't like it. Tastes differ and that is more than ok. What I don't get is, calling this boring. You can call this a full range of things, but boring? Interesting choice to describe, but ultimately you'll lose my respect and your opinion may be void to me. The movie starts off like a romantic comedy and it really looked like it for some time. If it continued like that, I'd understand if you thought or felt this was boring. But it didn't ... it changes pace and goes places I didn't expect it to go.",/review/rw5764680/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2020,Neon_Gold,6," Funny at Times
",This film is very hit or miss. At times it can be really funny. For example one of the first scenes of the leads as a couple in their apartment is great. I think it really gets how couples are and how they argue about trivial things and they make it really funny.,/review/rw5764680/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2020,deloudelouvain,7," Funny enough for me to keep me entertained.
","When I saw Kumail Nanjianis name in the cast I knew I would have a good time watching this comedy. I don't know if I can see him in anything else than a comedy and that's fine. He just has that kind of funny face. Stuber was the last movie I enjoyed from him and now it will be The Lovebirds. Don't expect anything too serious though, it's just a mild rom-com with a little crime investigation to spice it up, but there are enough funny moments to keep you entertained. The two main characters are played by Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani, and it works good. The Lovebirds isn't great cinema, but it doesn't pretend to be, it's just a good moment of easy comedy, a genre that we all need at some point.",/review/rw5764680/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2020,Eggoreluckadman,7," Much funnier than I expected
","I thought the trailer was kind of bad so I was pleasantly surprised by how funny the movie was. Gotta give credit to Kumail Nanjiani and Issa Rae. I was a fan of Kumail from Silicon Valley and The Big Sick, but I had yet to see anything Issa Rae is in. Now I really want to watch Insecure. The film is also self aware, it's only around 90 minutes so it doesn't waste any time. Overall, solid comedy but I'm glad I watched it on Netflix rather than in a theater.",/review/rw5764680/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2020,tilokaudaman,8," Fun and delughtful
",The best thing about this film is the witty dialogue and the repore between the two leads. It reminded me a bit of the old Thin Man films. It's a pleasant escape from these dark times and offers some much needed laughter.,/review/rw5764680/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2020,agibson-97396,10," A 6??? The funniest movie I've seen in a LONG time
","What movie were the people who reviewed this watching? This movie is absolutely HILARIOUS. I usually only do reviews for horrible movies, but I haven't seen a movie this funny is a LONG time, so I felt a review was necessary. The chemistry between the main characters was unreal - like I felt like they were actually a couple in real life. Loved loved loved it.",/review/rw5764680/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2020,Jared_Andrews,6," Not Exactly Original, but still Fun
","Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani make for an instantly believable couple. The first moments of ""The Lovebirds"" establish that these two have obvious chemistry, they seem like a real couple (maybe even one that you know), and most importantly, they're undeniably likable. The entire success of the movie hinges upon the actors' ability to be charming and witty and enjoyable as a duo. If they do not play off each other in a fun and funny way, no viewer is going to want to hang out with them for 90 minutes.",/review/rw5764680/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2020,efd-10467,8," Funny
","A funny comedy, a very refreshing light hearted film, the two leads are perfect and the writing is quick and snappy.",/review/rw5764680/?ref_=tt_urv

22 May 2020,ops-52535,7," have a look at this
","Because this is a good mixture of genre interception, with a whole lot of the new verbal comedy, with a good stroke of blimping good old fashion coincidental kick and run fun, mixed with some coldblooded murders that send shivers through the unlucky couple, and where the black comedy are almost not excisting.",/review/rw5764680/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2020,moosh2004,4," has its moments, but...
","The endless chatter between the leads is too much
its like they had 40 minutes spare time in the script in order to make it a full movie so they just went on with unnecessary and forced dialogue",/review/rw5764680/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2020,RosanaBotafogo,8," Delicious to watch...
","How cute, I fell in love, perfect chemistry between an unlikely couple, all the awkward scenes became extremely funny, and the more bizarre and absurd, the more fun it became... Delicious to watch...",/review/rw5764680/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2020,paralleltripper,10," One of the better rom coms
","Really enjoyed this rom com action film. It flowed well with cool twist and silly turns. One of the funnier rom coms for me and not as cringey as some others that put me off. Loved the dress changes too, go unicorn!",/review/rw5764680/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2020,Calicodreamin,8," Great chemistry & good laughs
","Some serious laugh out loud moments, the main characters have great chemistry and banter.. The storyline was fairly well developed, though the ending felt a bit unresolved with a few loose ends. But for the most part the jokes landed and the laughs were there. I won't ask for more.",/review/rw5764680/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2020,joiningjt,1," R u kidding? Terrible!! Worst movie this year
","Bad all around I've never given a comedy a 1!! This one was bad, the plot was stupid, the lead actors didnt pull it off, their chemistry was non existent, the jokes were bad and seemed like they just said their lines without any comedic form at all!! No emotion, so glad this didnt hit the theater but was released on Netflix because technically it was free.",/review/rw5764680/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2020,Edvis-1997,4," 4
","The best part of the movie was song at the ending. This film is way too overrated. It was boring and lame comedy. Compared two films: this one and ""The wrong Missy"" this film is totally less valuable, the plot is different but as comedy it just sucks,actors were not as good as in ""The wrong Missy"" but somehow this movie has better rating on imdb, that's just ridiculous.I was thinking to give it 5 but compared films I've seen in 2020 and also seeing it has 6/10imdb I can't give more than 4. In my opinion, this movie is overrated by Indian watchers. I wouldn't recommend to watch this film.",/review/rw5764680/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2020,mouldypeach,4," Ultimately just boring
","I was hopeful, going in to The Lovebirds, because I'd read reviews praising the chemistry and likeability of the leads. That they are likeable is true enough, and there are a couple of jokes in there somewhere too but the plot is weak and, for a short feature film, it dragged like hell. I thought it was about 25 minutes longer than it was.
The best bits are when they couple are just talking about their problems. They could have made a modern Before Sunrise, but instead they made a bellow average murder mystery.
Shame.",/review/rw5764680/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2020,Sir_AmirSyarif,5," Kumail Nanjiani needs to work on his on-screen kisses
","Kumail Nanjiani and Issa Rae are both good and have decent chemistry - though Nanjiani seriously needs to work on his on-screen kisses - but the film lets them down with its poor, bland, and lazily-written script. There are few minutes with genuine laughs but, ultimately, 'The Lovebirds' just felt tired by the end of its actually short run.",/review/rw5764680/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2020,cruise01,4," Kind of boring and the leads were not as funny.

25 May 2020,jsetherickson,1," I can't believe they were going to release this in theatres
",The best way to describe this would be two talented actors were give a plot that sounded good in theory but was utterly destroyed by a terrible script and veeeery poor editing.,/review/rw5764680/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2020,SnoopyStyle,6," some potential for comedic duo
","Leilani (Issa Rae) and Jibran (Kumail Nanjiani) are new lovebirds in New Orleans. Four years later, they're fighting about everything from marriage to The Amazing Race. They agree to break up when suddenly Jibran drives over a bicyclist. It's the start of a ridiculous murder mystery while they go on the run from the cops.",/review/rw5764680/?ref_=tt_urv
25 May 2020,krunalpatel11127,1," Trash
","I just see no chemistry at all especially they look more like friends then couple I mean casting n screenplay direction needed lot of work.
Disappointed with the end result.",/review/rw5764680/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2020,julie-130-418956,10," Funny and entertaining
","Not sure what the bad reviews are about, I thought this show was really funny. Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani have great chemistry and the banteer was awesome. Worth watching for sure.",/review/rw5764680/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2020,joshbarton15,3," Way too try hard for my liking.
","The Lovebirds starts promisingly with its two leads bouncing off each other well however, it soon falls into the trap of being an unfunny comedy that tries way too hard to be funny by making almost every line awkward or weird. The sex club scene was by far the funniest moment and earns half a star by itself but even that is not enough to save this trainwreck. Shame as I really liked The Big Sick.",/review/rw5764680/?ref_=tt_urv
