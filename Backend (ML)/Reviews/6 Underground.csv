1 January 2016,lesleyharris30,9," Filled with Whimiscal Characters and Heartwarming Stories,
","Love Actually is a great movie with several well developed story lines that all come together nicely and a terrific cast that can be both comedic and dramatic. It certainly wasn't an easy film to make and I'm sure the studio must have considered it a huge risk, telling stories from several characters in the space of two hours, with all of them having little to no connection with the others, but it worked, Richard Curtis clearly put hard work in to this script and gathered a very impressive cast to make it a hit. Of course, with the amount of stories there are, some of them felt underdeveloped, I found Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson's to be one of the most compelling, but in the great their story dosen't get any proper closure, Colin Firth's story felt very tight, I would like to have seen more of him with Sienna Guillory, but with a film as crowded as this you are going to feel underwhelmed with certain parts. The films cast really is terrific and is the main reason why a story as complicated and messy as this really works, Liam Neeson shines as a step dad hoping to cheer up the son of his deceased wife, Emma Thompson is delightful as a wife questioning her own decisions, Alan Rickman astounds as a confused husband, Hugh Grant is terrific as a prime minister who discovers love for the first time, every actor puts all their heart in to these roles and they are all a delight to watch. However, the best performance for me would have to be Bill Nighy, who shines in every scene as Billy Mack, playing a character in no way similar to any role he has done previously, he plays a straight up pompous musician, and he does it ridiculously well. Always a fun film to watch at Christmas time, Love Actually is funny, emotional and very sweet, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy or romance film.

6 April 2004,milareppa,9," Surprisingly Enjoyable
","I hate romantic comedies. I detest them. You can list the actors I avoid watching: Hugh Grant, Sandra Bullock, Richard Gere, Julia Roberts. Romantic comedies make me cringe and I avoid them like the plague so you can imagine the foul mood I was in when I was forced to watch this film.",/review/rw3735028/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have lost count of how many times I have watched this wonderfully written and acted Christmas romance themed classic film. At least once a year so that would be at least seventeen (17) times now. Great songs, a superb cast from top to bottom, heartwarming romances, and of course a must see ""FEEL GOOD"" ending.",/review/rw3735028/?ref_=tt_urv

16 September 2015,anaconda-40658,8," Actually, Bill Nighy Gets All the Love Here.
","Love Actually (2003): Dir: Richard Curtis / Cast: Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Laura Linney, Bill Nighy, Keira Knightley: Supposedly a portrait of love featuring husbands, wives, grandparents, children, and various friends and relatives embracing in love. That is a fine picture except that it regards broken relationships and a false sense of love within infidelity. So it isn't love actually. Yet the film works due to detailed characters and circumstances. Director Richard Curtis barely holds the dozen or so subplots together but they flow with great detail. Ensemble cast includes Hugh Grant as the new Prime Minister of Britain who is overpowered with feelings towards his coffee steward. Liam Neeson plays a recent widow helping his son cope with love. Laura Linney plays a secretary trying to attract a co-worker but her cell phone is constantly ringing due to her brother being in an institution. Bill Nighy plays an ageing rock star who knows just how bad he is. Colin Firth plays a writer who falls for his Portuguese maid. Keira Knightley plays a newly wed who discovers that her husband's best man secretly had a crush on her. Great ensemble cast help keep the subplots interesting along with numerous superb locations that present different feeling. It doesn't always work due too delusional views of relationships that are the work of fiction if anything. Score: 8 / 10",/review/rw3735028/?ref_=tt_urv

","Love Actually is a phenomenal Christmas movie. My family and I watch it every year several weeks before Christmas and then on Christmas Eve.

","I don't know what it is about this movie. I love the cast and the incredible acting. I just for some reason need to watch it a few times a year. I love how the pornstar characters are still so nervous about kissing each other even though they have had a visual relationship.and still are so nervous to kiss for t
he first time. And the absolute respect he gives her even though they have seen each other nude,and how he doesn't assume anything about her and sees her for who she is not assuming she is just some girl who gets naked for anyone.",/review/rw3735028/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2009,TheLittleSongbird,9," Unshamedly sentimental, but a very well-done film!
","Some parts of the movie are very sentimental, but Love Actually is a well-directed and well-acted film. The script is intelligent and funny, and while the story is a little confusing, as there are so many characters, I highly recommend this. The direction by Richard Curtis is very good and well paced. I think the film's main strengths are the acting and the well-developed characters. The standout is Bill Nighy, in an unlikely but actually hilarious role. Though Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are very good as well, in one of the more interesting stories. There is also Laura Linney and Liam Neeson, two talented actors, if you see the two of them in Kinsey you'll know what I mean. Keira Knightly, Hugh Grant and Kris Marshall also delight. In conclusion, look out for this film. I was annoyed a bit by Rowan Atkinson, but I really like this. 9/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw3735028/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2004,jackburden,," A Holiday Fantasy Classic (Yes, Fantasy - Negative Reviewers Get Over It ;-)
","This movie does come off as a bit shallow, and it contains characters who are one- dimensional caricatures of themselves. But guess what -- this movie is clearly in the romantic, holiday fantasy genre -- just like It's a Wonderful Life and A Christmas Story are. And most people love those movies, so I don't get all the negative reviewing of this film. To me, this movie is clearly a fantasy piece, and as such it should not be subject to all the driveling negativity that would better be directed toward something terrible that masquerades as serious dramatic work. Would the British PM ever go knocking door to door with just one bodyguard? No Way! Do Londoners actually care what song is ""number one for Christmas"" more than Americans do?? (I'm seriously doubting it -- who other than a few teenagers and record promoters actually cares about charts?) This is clearly a work that's not to be taken as a ""serious"" movie, though it's seriously fun if you'll take it for the fantasy that it is. ",/review/rw3735028/?ref_=tt_urv

","Of course this rates a 10. It's been gaining in popularity for 20 years and is now universally accepted as a classic. If you can watch those closing credits without tearing up, you are more hard-hearted than Scrooge himself. It begins the holiday season for so many people and for me, anytime I see that it is available, I'm waiting on the couch. As soon as I finish this review, I will be tuning in to Peacock to see it for about the 15th time. My daughter even bought me the screenplay as a Christmas gift one year.",/review/rw3735028/?ref_=tt_urv

","My deserted heart will always love you. Maybe now you have a person by your side, or today we are still alone for Christmas, don't be sentimental. There are always a lot of unsatisfactory people in life. I can't love the person I want to love. I miss important people every year. These regrets all seem like a test given by God. Even in the days of empty windows, there are traces of love. My deserted heart has always planted grass for you. After breaking through the iron shoes and looking forward to it, I believe true love will come.
10 groups of CPs, 10 pairs of lovers, 10 paths of happiness, from civilians to prime ministers, from childhood to old age, there are always miracles on the road of love people who have watched Mordern Love will love this one too.
Festivals are not unique, because there are people who love each day full of hope. This is probably also the most touching part of this story-there are thousands of kinds of love, and life with each other is happy.
I couldn't help crying several times, cheering for the protagonist, for myself, for every kind of life. Especially worth chewing carefully ~

15 December 2015,NateWatchesCoolMovies,9," Charming Christmas classic
","Who doesn't love Love Actually? I know I do. It's such a sentimental, goofy, overblown pile of mush and I love it even more for all those reasons. Not to sound sappy, but a lot of the situations and character interactions it entails are blunt, awkward truths made even more hilarious by an even more awkward cast, and encapsulate the true meaning of Christmas. Not all the couples work out, not all of the individual stories end well or in satisfaction for themselves or the audience. But you know what? That's life, and they make the best out of what they have at this special time of year, which is what it's really about. To balance it out, not all of them end like that; some turn out splendidly for the characters, leaving them beaming. Some learn tough lessons that are necessary for growth, some find love in storybook fashion and others are simply there for coming relief. And what comedy we get, tearful drama as well, delivered by an astoundingly massive cast of British legends, speckled by a few familiar Yankee faces as well. Liam Neeson plays a grieving father whose son (Thomas Bodie Sangster) is sick with love. Neeson's sister (Emma Watson, grounded, real, heartbreaking) deals with her irresponsible husband (Alan Rickman, incapable of a false note). The newly elected Prime Minister (Hugh Grant in flustered, fumbling glory) is attracted to his cute secretary (Martine Mcutcheon) and aloof writer Colin Firth feels pangs for his Portuguese housekeeper who speaks not a word of English. Laura Linney has a steamy office romance with Rodrigo Santoro whilst dealing with an ill sibling, Bill Nighy is hysterical as a cynical pop star learning what old age means, Keira Knightely, Chiwetel Efjor and Andrew Lincoln are involved in a subtle love triangle, and there's all kinds of interwoven people including Martin Freeman, Desmond Askew, Elisha Cuthbert, Ivana Milicevic, January Jones, Claudia Schiffer, Shannon Elizabeth, Denise Richards, Sienna Guillory, Billy Bob Thornton as the sleazy US President and a priceless Rowan Atkinson as the world's weirdest jewelry salesman. It's a big old circus of Christmas spirit with all kinds of different motivations, desires and relationships, which reach a festive fever pitch of a finale as all the stories escalate into giddy yuletide melodrama and cathartic god times that are impossible to not smile at. An annual watch for me.",/review/rw3735028/?ref_=tt_urv

","What a charming movie this is. It's not perfect or anything, and probably gets a little too syrupy towards the end, but it's romantic, funny, and the star-studded cast is outstanding. Weaving through so many story lines could have left the viewer confused and unsatisfied with any of them, but director Richard Curtis pulls the right strings and keeps us entertained from beginning to end. There are just so many wonderful scenes and lines. Andrew Lincoln's card scene with Keira Knightley. Colin Firth watching Lúcia Moniz walk out of his life, and then later both of them learning each other's language. Thomas Sangster, the little boy, talking to Liam Neeson about the ""total agony of being in love"". Hugh Grant the Prime Minister going door to door to find the sweet and sometimes foul- mouthed Martine McCutcheon. And on and on.",/review/rw3735028/?ref_=tt_urv
