27 April 2010,TheLittleSongbird,10," Can I be honest? I think Futurama is better than the Simpsons!
","Now that is not to say the Simpsons is bad or anything, I really like it, but it has jumped the shark for a few years now. Futurama is everything I love an animated series to be, funny, original and witty. I seriously don't know where to begin praising the show. Well for one thing the animation is amazing. The characters are really well drawn, the backgrounds are audacious and the visual effects are eye-popping. And the music is brilliant, it is cleverly composed with some funky songs featuring such as ""Conga"" and ""Sunshine of Your Love"" and the theme tune is definitely memorable. The writing is outstanding, the comedy works brilliantly and the more touching and subtle parts work just as well. The episode ideas springing from a brilliant concept are really original and fun, and the pacing is great. And the characters with the help of a truly talented voice cast are really unique and endearing, especially Fry, Bender and Zoidberg, and Leela is a feisty and headstrong character that I related to immediately. Overall, a truly wonderful show, with all the fun and originality that are lacking in the later episodes of the Simpsons. 10/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw1078138/?ref_=tt_urv

10 March 2003,Aaron1375,," I actually like it better than The Simpsons
","Don't get me wrong, I like the Simpsons, but there is just something about Futurama that I like more.  It irks me to see people who hate this show and are glad it is cancelled.  If you don't like a show just don't watch it...to many shows have gotten a premature axe these days mainly cause television networks haven't realized no show is going to have the ratings of shows from the past.  I am sure to all those who hated the show, there have been shows you liked that have been cancelled as well.  This one about a pizza boy frozen and waking up in the future was for me quite enjoyable.  Which is the kiss of death right there, because if I like a show, it usually does get cancelled and it usually does have a pretty good following, but for some reason the networks still somehow think all shows should average 20 or more million viewers or its a failure.",/review/rw1078138/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2004,Baldrick44,," The best cartoon series on TV ever
","I loved Futurama when it was TV and I always find myself watching it on my DVD player ( I have all 4 series ). I think the thing that carries it above other cartoons ( and it's not like I don't like the Simpsons or Family Guy ) is the wonderful mix of characters. Dimwitted Phillip J. Fry, who has trouble constructing a coherent sentence and whenever he attempts to say something profound it invariably ends up flying back in his face. Turanga Leela, a outcast amongst outcasts, who when not brushing off Fry is captaining the ship between planets while wondering about her own origins. Bender, a wisecracking, gambling chain-smoking robot that is on the crew of the ship for no apparent reason apart from bumming around. Dr Zoidberg, a penniless joke of a medical practionioner that has no friends and seems to ignite hostility for just being him. Hermes Conrad, a Rastafarian bureaucrat who when not limboing for his nation is filing and shredding with an obsessive fever. Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth, whose wonderous inventions are perhaps only eclipsed by his seemingly growing amorality towards almost all living things. Amy Wong, the daughter of the rich Wong family and as such finds herself slightly naive about things that are deeper than hair gel and nail polish. Add to this the military hijinks of Zapp Brannigan and his long-suffering lieutenant Kif Croker as well as thespian robot Calculon, Warlord alien Lur and President Nixon as well as others and I think you have a group of characters that all have their own quirks and flaws to add to a very funny show.",/review/rw1078138/?ref_=tt_urv

8 November 2004,lakenstein,," ""Now Zoidberg is the popular one!""
","man, this show was freaking awesome, so of course it got canned. it was funny, had great characters, wonderful dialouge and was way too good for TV. In fact, at times I find myself enjoying this show more then the simpsons. I find myself enjoying the antics of the characters more. so if i had to choose i would say this is more entertaining then the simpsons. although the simpsons had more better side characters (although zapp brannagin and his alien sidekick are friggin hilarious) in the end, i would advise anyone looking for a laugh to catch reruns whenever you can or buy the dvds. I don't think you'll be disappointed. a wonderful show canned way too soon.",/review/rw1078138/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2004,mamamiasweetpeaches,," FUTURAMA is a great show that might come back...and should!
","I am a huge fan of THE SIMPSONS, the funniest show to ever be on television. When I heard Matt Groening was behind FUTURAMA I was excited...but not TOO excited because I didn't think it would be as good as THE SIMPSONS (I mean...what COULD be?) The first episode of FUTURAMA I was not all that impressed. But by the fourth episode (LOVES LABOURS LOST IN SPACE where Leela sleeps with Zap Brannigan) they had me: I was hooked.",/review/rw1078138/?ref_=tt_urv
19 May 2007,atomius,10," Thanks, Mr. Groening!
","This marvelous animation, from the creator of my all time favourite motion picture, The Simpsons, uses a subtle integration of cgi graphics with a more flashy version of Groenings style of animation to produce half hours of non stop gags (quite intelligent in some cases) and fun adventure. The pop culture references so great in The Simpsons only go farther and wider here in this story of Fry, a pizza delivery boy sent through suspended animation to the year 3000 from the year 1999.",/review/rw1078138/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2004,grimdodger,," Can be watched till the end of time..
","Futurama is the second series by Matt Groening. Now when I was watching The Simpsons one idea was that why we can't see this guy more, why he is only behind a widely known TV series while poking some other people. But with Futurama I say he is (OK, was) unleashed.",/review/rw1078138/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is the best science fiction show I have seen. It combines all sorts of science fiction settings, technologies and tropes with a cast of lovable characters. The stories are all memorable and often get quite emotional. Futurama combines comedic satire with heartfelt plots and is overall a great series.",/review/rw1078138/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2007,dobbin-4,10," Futurama is the best animated show behind The Simpsons.
",Well 2 days ago making a review for the Futurama movie I realized I have not put a review down for the show that started it all. The show is about Fry a 21 year old pizza delivery boy who always wanted to be an astronaut and when he accidentally gets himself chrogenically frozen and wakes up in the year 3000. The show is hilarious from the start of the first episode till the end of the last. I think that if you love The Simpsons then you will definitely like Futurama as Matt Groening has done a brilliant job changing from series to series which is a very difficult thing to do. Overall the show is a must watch for everyone and despite the fact the idiots a Fox canceled it after 72 episodes. I rate this 97%.,/review/rw1078138/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2022,pavlomir,10," How you won't give it 10/10!
","One of kind anime show. I don't feel ashamed to say I have watched it about 5 times already and I will keep watching it, because there is no modern day match for the enjoyment and the quality of the fun stories of the world of tomorrow- Futurama! Shows like Rick &Morty are mere shadows of the popular culture, while Futurama is popular culture of itself, is original in it's majority.",/review/rw1078138/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Futurama "" was a excellent show from the same creator of ""The Simpsons"" .Like that show ""Futurama "" had a brilliant and satirical sense of humor ,and also many references to sci-fi shows that work very well . The characters are very funny and original , And while the story advances we learn more about them .The animation is very much like ""The Simpsons "" ,but it doesn't matter ,because the stories are hilarious and unpredictable . Many of the stories work very much fro the parallels between modern events ,so the sci-fi is just a element used to make satire of contemporary events . And even if you aren't a sci -fi fan , the show still have many interesting elements that make recommend it to anybody . This was a excellent show .I can't believe that it was canceled .",/review/rw1078138/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2004,justinprime,," A Misunderstood Series
","Futurama is the whipping boy of modern prime time cartoons. Since it was made by the creator of the Simpsons it was expected to be exactly like it. Futurama had its own brand of comedic flair, which is absolutely hilarious. Bender, Fry, Leela, Hermes, Zoidberg, all of these characters are well thought out and work incredibly well together, on top of the fact that situations and anecdotes from previous episodes are brought up all the time, adding continuity to an already excellent series. I'll admit that I too was among the people crying foul when Futurama first came out, I didn't grow to truly appreciate it until it was put in syndication on adult swim, and more so later as I bought all the episodes on DVD. I don't think the world was ready for what futurama had to offer when it first came out, and everyone should give it another shot through adult swim or by DVD rental. It has solid entertainment value, and a unique comedic style.",/review/rw1078138/?ref_=tt_urv

13 February 2014,FistOfNoRemorse,10," One of the best animated series EVER
","Futurama is an absolutely hilarious show. The jokes are great and the characters are unique. Fry's stupidity is hilarious. Bender is great. The professor says some really funny stuff, especially the insults he comes up with. The whole show is an entertaining, comic masterpiece. I was actually pretty surprised at how good the last season was. My girlfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm deeply saddened that this show is canceled.. Again!! It's better than a couple of the adult animated series that are still running on Sunday nights. The last season was so funny that it made us even more confused that it's being canceled. How is this happening when some other terrible junk is still on the air?? It's a brilliant show. The creators did an excellent job and I'd love to thank them for this. It's worth watching again and again! I will miss seeing new episodes.",/review/rw1078138/?ref_=tt_urv

19 December 1999,bat-5,," Keeps getting better.
","Futurama had a shaky start, but after that first episode, things are getting better on the show.  The exploits of Fry, Leela, Bender and the rest make for some of the funniest things I've ever seen in a TV show.  Pop culture references abound and if you're quick, you'll catch them all. The most recent episode with Richard M. Nixon coming back to take control of the world was a hoot.  The episode where Bender is captured on the robot world is great and the entire Titanic knock off with Zap Brannigan was priceless.  Another great show from the twisted, but very gifted Matt Groening.",/review/rw1078138/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2015,lesleyharris30,9," One of the Cleverest and Most Well Written Animated Series There is,I'm Gonna Miss it,
","Futurama is an outstanding television series that is extremely well written and developed,with an absolutely stellar voice cast.I have my doubts that any one reading this hasn't watched it yet,but if you haven't then I would highly recommend you start.It is from the same people who brought you the Simpsons,but it is very different,the humour is quite similar but the characters and the concept is certainly not similar.I grew up watching this show as a child,Fry,Bender,Leela and the rest of the gang are like family members to me and it would go high up on my list of favourite animated series.The show has been cancelled before and I'm sad to see it leave again,they had such a wide variety of fantastic episodes,ones that are hilarious,and even emotional,it can be very versatile.The final episode dosen't end in a way that it has to be the final time we ever see these characters,I could easily imagine the show coming back,or at least doing a movie to finish it off once and for all,I just hope to see the Planet Express crew again soon.A classic series that kids and adults will love,I would highly recommend Futurama to anyone looking for a good comedy or animated series.

11 May 2005,jboothmillard,10," Futurama
","After the long success of The Simpsons, Matt Groening and his cartoon creators decided to make another successful series, and they did. Some pizza delivery guy named Philip J. ""Fry"" (Bill West) accidentally freezes himself for 1000 years and wakes up in the 30th century. In this new world he befriends his great, great, great (you get the idea) nephew, clever Prof. Hubert J. Farnsworth (West), the weird and funny Dr. Zoidberg (West), the cyclops Turanga Leela (Katey Sagal), Amy Wong (Lauren Tom), Hermes Conrad (Phil LaMarr) and of course, the best character, similar to Homer Simpson, Bender the robot (John DiMaggio). Throughout the show they have many weird and wonderful adventures of futuristic and funny proportions. Guests included Frank Welker, Leonard Nimoy, Pamela Anderson, Nancy Cartwright, Dan Castellaneta, John Goodman, Conan O'Brien, Parker Posey, Al Gore, Stephen Hawking, Hank Azaria, Lucy Liu, William Shatner, Jonathan Frakes and Roseanne Barr. Groening has done a very good job of creating another watchable cartoon. It won the Emmys for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming Less Than One Hour) (also nominated 4 times) and twice for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation, and it was nominated for Outstanding Music and Lyrics. It was number 26 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Outstanding!",/review/rw1078138/?ref_=tt_urv
