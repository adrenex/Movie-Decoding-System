4 November 2016,TouchTheGarlicProduction,8," Slick and well executed, the Crown is drama at its finest.
","The Crown boasts no action sequences or big movie stars, and yet it is one of the most expensive shows of all time. Why? Because of the sheer attention to detail. Aside from the fully historically accurate costumes and locations, the show is just gorgeous to look at. The lighting, the cinematography, and everything else visual about it is on point. It's quite apparent none of that money went to waste.",/review/rw8678471/?ref_=tt_urv

",The Crown is simply a brilliant piece of television. It's one of the most expensive shows ever made and you can tell because the production and attention to detail is amazing. I originally put off watching this because I thought it was a show aimed from women but I couldn't have been more wrong. It is for everyone! Even when they changed the main characters in Season 3 because of the time jump it didn't lose a beat. Both Claire Foy and Olivia Colman both lead amazing casts who all deserve all the praise this show gets!,/review/rw8678471/?ref_=tt_urv

","What can I say about The Crown that hasn't already been said? It's incredible! There are some that don't like it because they take some liberties with the story but overall it's pretty accurate, especially the first few seasons. You can tell the amount of effort they put into this show from everything from the writing, acting, cinematography, production, etc. All being as good as it gets for a television show. It chronicles the life of Queen Elizabeth II and the royal family from the 1940's to modern times. It gives you an inside look at the personal lives of the royal family including their romances and political rivalries. There's a reason this show has won so many awards and that's because it's brilliant!",/review/rw8678471/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have to be honest. I had refused to watch this show from the moment it was released. Being no fan of monarchies in general, or of the House of Windsor in particular, I wrongly failed to see the potential.",/review/rw8678471/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2016,lisacarlson,10," A Visual Stunner
","Regardless of what you may think of the Royals Netflix has poured a ton of money into this exquisite production about the life of Queen Elizabeth. It is a show which requires fixed attention as things progress at a unhurried pace. The opening musical evolution is enchanting and never grows old. Actress Claire Foy is beautifully riveting in the role of Elizabeth; someone who wants to have a normal life and yet is made to feel her duty as Queen should be the highest priority. It has been suggested the Queen is warm, has a sense of humor, is compassionate and this portrayal conveys it. She is wise enough to realize she's going to have to forge her own way as those around her are stymied in their own limitations or ignorance. John Lithgow transforms into Winston Churchill and is equally stellar. Their scenes together are superb. If Peter Morgan's research is accurate I can fully appreciate how Princess Diana must have felt. The show is rounded out by a wonderful supporting cast. This show is my favorite Netflix production so far.",/review/rw8678471/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2022,magnoliacream,9," Engrossing summary of Queen Elizabeth II's reign
","The crown depicts the highlights of Elizabeth II's life from just before she became queen through the vicissitudes of being the symbolic head of one of the world's most powerful nations. Just a young married mother when she ascended the throne at age 25 in 1952, she survived one prime minister after another, family scandals that rocked the world and tragedies both national and personal. Her marriage with Phillip of Mountbatten, while rocky at first, became one of the pillars of strength which she leaned on.",/review/rw8678471/?ref_=tt_urv

16 November 2016,linnet100,10," This is simply Outstanding
","Every so often a drama comes along that takes away your breath. Sometimes that's subjective, other times objective. Dramas such as The Jewel in the Crown, The West Wing, Game of Thrones, House of Cards, Downton Abbey, House M.D. have all stood at the pinnacle of television drama.",/review/rw8678471/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2019,moviemom23,7," Season 3 Ep. 6 still not used to Colman
","I almost didn't watch S. 3 at all when I heard Foy was out and Colman was in. Frankly, it's a different show. Colman is completely miscast. In a major way, it's her appearance but it's also her acting. You get the feeling there's a soulfulness she's fighting down deep, but with Foy you didn't have that and it was just more Right for a queen. I can't explain it she's just not good in this role. Foy had that royal stoicness was about her, Colman is too clunky. The overwrought Ep. 3, which could have been so powerful if not for Colman's performance. The beginning was excellent then the Queen appears and it's ruined. The ending of that episode was just plain bad- predictable and fake.",/review/rw8678471/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2019,hyacintoblack,7," S3. Good but... what were they thinking
","Olivia Colman as Queen Elizabeth, Helena Bonham Carter as Margaret? Such bad casting. Olivia has a rough face and looks angry most of the time throughout the episodes. Helena Bonham Carter, although a great actress, doesn't do Margaret any justice at all (she doesn't look anything like Margaret)
The first two series were much better because of the actors. Series 3 has great topics but the actors were cast wrongly except the nun princess Alice and prince Charles. They were excellent.",/review/rw8678471/?ref_=tt_urv

2 December 2019,cala3,5," Season 3 is a huge disappointment
",Claire Foy was absolutely on point as the Queen in Season 1 and 2. Why mess with that? They totally could have altered her appearance to age her. I love HBC but I don't see her as Princess Margaret.... This season is so dreadfully slow and lacking in any momentum.,/review/rw8678471/?ref_=tt_urv

20 November 2019,mccann3010,10," Wow! Tremendous series and the period details are painstaking and luscious
","I watched with bated breath as Olivia Coleman took over from Claire Foy. Coleman embodies a mature Elizabeth, one who is calcified into a Royal with a stoic countenance, dowdy wardrobe, and a hint of what the crown has given and cost her.",/review/rw8678471/?ref_=tt_urv

","Why, why, why did they think they needed to change the whole staff?! I was very invested in the actors from 1&2 and then everyone is gone!

15 November 2020,koofasa,7," Like every other decent show...
","This show was highjacked by that group of Hollywood ideologues that insists on rewriting history. Queen Elizabeth was never an activist and I don't think she hated Margaret Thatcher the way the show portrays in season 4. I really enjoyed the first 3 seasons of the show because it was so well presented in a more-or-less honest way. Delicate issues were handled carefully and much was left to our imagination. Not so in Season 4. Here QEII is a full on leftist activist. It is uncomfortable because it is so false. If the producers had to show us their contempt for Thatcher, there were so many honest ways to do that. Thrusting this belief system on the queen with no proof is like the fake news we see on BBC. So sad but definitely predictable. In the late 1970's the world was in a deep recession with inflation. We called it stagflation. Interest rates and unemployment were very high. There were long lines for gas in the US. That's when the world turned right and elected Reagan and Thatcher who pulled the western world out of the economic doldrums. The Crown is rewriting history for 2020 political purposes. I was there and this show is misrepresenting history.",/review/rw8678471/?ref_=tt_urv

20 November 2022,punchup,6," Season 5 Letdown
","I loved every minute of the series until season five came along. The actor playing Prince Charles looks nothing like him physically, in demeanor, as well as body language, speech and movement. The woman playing Princess Diana is mugging in the worst possible way by straining her neck downward and pushing her eyes upward constantly. It is painful to watch! She also towers over all the other actors in every scene to a distracting level. How could such a fine show have such terrible casting choices? I've watched the first three episodes, and they all have stories that really go nowhere and seem to addresses side issues that barely pertain to the royal family at all as in past episodes. Previous seasons, placed the activities of the royal family in the context of larger historical movements in this season, seems to have a little interest in that. I'm sorry to say this series has ""jumped the shark"" as they say.",/review/rw8678471/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2019,lucasbuenofm,10," Elegant, extraordinarily written and acted
","Probably one of the finest series currently streaming, with breathtaking cinematography, well developed stories and character arcs, with an astonishing cast. Olivia Colman replaced the great Claire Foy with brilliance, and the whole cast does an excellent job at portraying the characters, both in seasons 1/2 and the newly cast season 3. The amazing thing about the show is that, at the same time, the stories and people are portrayed as epic and down to earth. Nuanced and extravagant. I loved every single minute of it and I hope it continues for a very long time.",/review/rw8678471/?ref_=tt_urv
