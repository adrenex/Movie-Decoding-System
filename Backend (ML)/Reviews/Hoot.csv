",I was much moved by Charlie St. Cloud and by Zac Efron in the title role. It looks like the young man is going out way beyond being a Walt Disney bubblegum poster boy for pubescent young ladies. ,/review/rw4836936/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2010,gradyharp,6," 'The Death and Life of Charlie St. Cloud'
","Ben Sherwood's Novel THE DEATH AND LIFE OF CHARLIE ST. CLOUD pretty much describes this Hallmarky love and spiritualism showcase for teen idol Zac Efron. Craig Pearce and Lewis Colick adapted the book for the screen and director Burr Sherwood (known for his other films that are of this genre) stirs the whipped cream. It is a pretty story with pretty people filmed in a pretty location (British Columbia) and the results are pretty predictable, yet when compared to the types of stories on film that flood the theaters at least this film has gentle heart and a lack of terror and horror and for that we should be pleased.",/review/rw4836936/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have to admit, that I never gave much thought of the phenomenon that was surrounding Zac Efron. The ladies seemed to love him and no one could have blamed him, if he just kept making the simple romantic movies, that would please his fan base.",/review/rw4836936/?ref_=tt_urv

14 October 2010,neil-476,7," Pleasing drama which doesn't go entirely according to expectations
","Charlie St Cloud (Zac Efron) has won a sailing scholarship to university, but promises baseball mad younger brother Sam that he will join him for baseball practice for an hour every evening during the last summer holiday. When Sam is killed in a car crash, Charlie is still turning up for the evening's baseball practice with his brother's ghost five years later, having effectively put his life on hold. Then he encounters Tess (Amanda Crew) - they were at high school together and she is scheduled for a solo trans-world sailing contest - and, when it seems that she might be the one to shake Charlie away from his stagnation, it appears that maybe Sam isn't happy with the possibility.",/review/rw4836936/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2011,perkypops,7," Enjoyable whimsy despite its bigger flaws
","There are many parallels to other twisty, turning, ""are they alive or dead?"" films of this genre that probably do it at lot better but Burr Steers effort is undeniably entertaining. He has some great acting from Charlie Tahan in particular to raise the rating a notch or two too.",/review/rw4836936/?ref_=tt_urv

31 July 2010,kaylenns,8," Engaging and heartfelt, if a bit pretty at times
","I enjoyed this movie, for what it tries to do. It's not trying to be an art-house Oscar-bait film. It's basically a story about a good man who loses himself to grief and how he recovers. The core message of letting go and moving on is a good one.",/review/rw4836936/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2010,rizzy9999,7," It's not 'The Sixth Sense' but Zac Efron delivers...
","Charlie St Cloud is the type of movie many people will love to hate. The plot is simply contrived and the script is somewhat identical to Shyamalan's film ""The Sixth Sense"" yet I was very much moved by the story of Charlie St. Cloud and by Zac Efron in the title role. It looks like Zac is going out of his way to shred that teenage 'High School Musical' image that he is now known for.",/review/rw4836936/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2010,bluepolkadotsxo,10," Cliché-free, simple but beautiful, well-acted film
","I really enjoyed this movie. It didn't disappoint me at all because I didn't expect much more than a beautiful love story, pretty scenery, very good acting, and thought-provoking ideas. I got exactly what I came for and maybe even a little more. The script is pretty dull, but the way the movie was filmed and acted made it absolutely amazing the way I saw it. Absolutely gorgeous scenery and cinematography, original ideas and scenes (I loved the graveyard scene when Tess and Charlie are chasing each other around with candle lights and pretty music, there was nothing at all about it that I'd seen before), very good acting, and a very beautiful story is what made this movie so great in my eyes.

","Saw 'The Death and Life of Charlie St Cloud' as somebody who really liked the idea, has found that Zac Efron has grown as an actor and wanted to see how he would fare in one of the first roles to break from his 'High School Musical' image.

25 September 2010,DICK STEEL,6," A Nutshell Review: Charlie St. Cloud
","The legion of female teenage fans who turn up in droves for this preview screening is probably testament to the drawing power of Zac Efron, probably Hollywood's latest heartthrob who's standing his ground with his alpha male status from the High School Musical series, to films like Hairspray and 17 Again where he plays a star basketballer who's life didn't turn out as he thinks. In Charlie St. Coud, a romance flick with its title named after his character (which tells a lot about his ability to marquee a film), he too plays a star sportsman (here it's sailing) whose championship potential got cut short by tragedy, which turned him into someone who can see and communicate with dead people.",/review/rw4836936/?ref_=tt_urv

22 May 2011,MLDinTN,7," supernatural tear jerker
","This movie was better than expected since I didn't even know whom Zac Efron was. I thought he did a good job as the title role and not to mention he has a really cute face. Charlie is involved in an accident the summer before starting college. He actually deadlines, before his heart beat comes back, which is the explanation as to why he has a sixth sense ability. He is very tormented as he lost someone close. Skip ahead 5 years, and we learn Charlie never went to college and is instead working at a graveyard. He lives an isolated life since it revolves around these cannons going off and time he can spend with his brother. He meets Tess and she has a love for sailing as he once did. Something happens to Tess and it's easy to figure out what is going on when Charlie sees her again. He uses these messages as a sign that he was given a second chance in order to save her.",/review/rw4836936/?ref_=tt_urv

2 February 2011,priyantha-bandara,5," Oh Charlie !!
","My rating 2.5/5  "" I see dead people"" has become a famous line after the 'Sixth Sense'  came on to the theater back in 1999 and oh yes it gave me the creeps  the first time I saw it. 'Charlie St. Cloud' tries to do some what same  formulae with a big LOVE in the middle but fail miserably.   Charlie St. Cloud (Zac Efron- High School Musical, Hairspray) is a  talented young man who is overrun by grief after his kid brother Sam  dies in a car accident. Taking the job as the caretaker of the cemetery  where his brother is buried, he forget his usual life before the  accident and starts to live a somewhat lonesome life. Charlie seems to  be blaming himself for his brother's death and starts to see illusions  of him in his mind and speak to his brother every day. This  relationship with his brother after his death change Charlie  completely. And when he meets Tess (Amanda Crew-She's the man, John  Tuker must die) he have to face reality and choose his dead brother or  the girl when circumstances starts to feel heavy. Amidst all this  Charlie starts to feel that some of the things what happens around him  are a little mysterious and they are similar to the connection with his  dead brother.   I prefer the cast and the cinematography of the movie. They both are  not boring or painful to look at. Especially girls would love staring  at Zac Efron and might truly forget what really the movie is about.  What really bother me is the script. 'Charlie St. Cloud' tries hard to  connect the living and the dead. Making a super natural bond is not  hard but making it looks like it really matter or feel is the hard  part. Here I don't really feel like it worked. It works somewhat OK  with the brothers. But when it comes to other characters that actually  don't make much sense. With that you feel like you're watching at some  Disney movie which is not really rated for your age!  There is a load of romance in 'Charlie St. Cloud'. The director wants  us to believe that it's a bond so strong but some things doesn't really  grip that way. Maybe there is a lack of character development in some  areas and the viewer is also left out without a clear direction just  like the poor Charlie himself.   Thank God I don't see dead people and they don't make me do things  which I don't want to do!!",/review/rw4836936/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2019,PennyReviews,3," Not Good Enough
","I guess if it centred more on the main character and his struggles to overcome his brother's death, the movie would have been better. But the romance kind of ruined it. Not that Efron wasn't good in it. He was actually decent. However, the romance was odd. Not to mention the ending was just way too off.",/review/rw4836936/?ref_=tt_urv
