2 March 2006,ccthemovieman-1,9," Revenge or Justice?
","I really didn't appreciate this film until the second viewing. Afterwards, I thought, ""Wow, that was really a satisfying, great film to watch."" Satisfying, of course, to see the typical good guy-gets-revenge tale but also a film which provided some beautiful scenery and photography all the way through: a real treat for the eyes and must-see on a widescreen DVD.",/review/rw2241912/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2015,SnoopyStyle,8," well made old fashion adventure with a great cast
","It's 1815. Edmond Dantès (Jim Caviezel) tries to save his captain and seeks help on the isle of Elba. The imprisoned Napoleon Bonaparte exchanges his help with a letter secret delivery. The captain dies nevertheless. Dantès returns and gets promoted to captain. He proposes to Mercedès Iguanada (Dagmara Dominczyk). Dantès' competitive jealous best friend Fernand Mondego (Guy Pearce) gets him arrested. Chief magistrate J.F. Villefort (James Frain) covers up his father's part in Napoleon's escape plan by sending Dantès to prison. Armand Dorleac (Michael Wincott) is the sadistic warden of the island prison of Château d'If. Dantès befriends prisoner Abbé Faria (Richard Harris) who educates the illiterate Dantès. Faria was in Napoleon's army who refuses to reveal the location of Count Spada's fortune. When Napoleon escapes, Villefort schemes with Mondego to keep Dantès in prison and lie to Mercedès about his execution. Faria is killed in a cave-in. Dantès escapes. He spares Jacopo (Luis Guzmán)'s life who pledges his eternal loyalty to him. They set off to find the hidden treasure and seek revenge on all who have wronged him. He schemes to bankrupt Mondego and befriend Albert (Henry Cavill) the son of Mondego and Mercedès.",/review/rw2241912/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2007,chi-cerca-trova,8," Great, but good if you've read the book
","I'll come right out and say that I enjoyed this movie. The acting was well done, the action sequences brilliantly plotted and enacted and the story was well written.",/review/rw2241912/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2003,sweetrupturedlight,10," Excellent!
","I hired this one on a whim, remembering that i had seen the trailer and had been vaguely intrigued.  I have to admit, having gone in with little expectation, i was flawed!  This was one of the better movies that i have seen in a long time.  Jim Caviezel's performance is slightly whiny to begin with, but in the context of the whole story, the reason therefore is appreciated and makes his transition and growth as a character that much more riveting to watch.  I absolutely loved him as Edmund Dantes then the dynamic Count of Monte Cristo and cannot have imagined a better choice.  He was definitely not bad on the eyes either.  Every scene had him looking more dashing and more handsome than the one before.",/review/rw2241912/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2007,planktonrules,8," Very romantic and enjoyable
","I think I am a bit spoiled when it came to this film, as I have seen the made for TV version of this story starring Richard Chamberlain. This and Chamberlain's other Dumas tale (THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK) were made so perfectly that I can't help but immediately compare other versions to these nearly perfect films. In light of this, I am surprised that I actually liked this new version so much. While it's hard to say which film I liked better (the Chamberlain or 2002 version), it's easy to agree that they both are wonderful films. Much of the reason I liked this newer version so much is that it was a very romantic film--much more so than the other one. In addition, it was quite polished and beautiful. In fact, for once, I have nothing to really complain about, as it's a good retelling of the story.",/review/rw2241912/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2004,barnabyrudge,7," Satisfying revenge story from a famous book.
","One of the most famous revenge stories, The Count of Monte Cristo is here turned into a dashing, old-fashioned swashbuckler. The plot is riddled with unconvincing coincidences and occurences (as indeed was the book), but other than that this is a well-made, enjoyable film, with some literate dialogue and believable action sequences. It is the fact that the action is believable that makes the film memorable, because in too many 2002 releases the action was so overblown and unrealistic (not to mention physically impossible) that the credibility of such films was destroyed.",/review/rw2241912/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2002,=G=,8," The Count rides again.
","""The Count of Monte Cristo"" (2002), a contempo back-to-basics  treatment of the famous Dumas novel for new generations, spins its tale of passion and revenge with all the glory and melodrama of Hollywood's golden years. Full of lavish costuming, sumptuous sets, beautiful locations, dashing men, a gorgeous damsel, dank dungeons, the ever popular swashbuckling (whatever that is) etc., all supported with a classic story makes for 2+ hours of solid entertainment. Who could ask for more? Kick back and enjoy this fun adventure flick worth a trip to the video store. (A-)",/review/rw2241912/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2003,sarawoah,," Good movie, if you haven't read the book
","""The Count of Monte Cristo"" by Dumas is one of my favorite books, it keeps you on your toes the whole time, guessing what will happen next.  The movie doesn't accomplish this as well.  While the book is subtle with the Count's revenge, the movie screams for all to hear. ""The Count of Monte Cristo, formerly Edmund Dantes is going to get revenge on his friends!!!"" They left out 3 main characters, and DRASTICALLY changed the ending, they had to, the end involves those 3 characters they left out.  But I did like the movie and if you enjoy it too I encourage you to read the book!",/review/rw2241912/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2003,rbverhoef,9," A nice one

7 March 2010,thinker1691,9," "" I swear on all my dead relatives, . . . I am your man ""
","Alexander Dumas wrote this inspiring story in 1844 and has since become a mainstay of classical literature, stage plays and films. The story as he penned it, tells the tale of a young and naive sailor named Edmond Dantes (James Caviezel) living during the Nepolonic era. His fortunes are set. He is to be the new ship's Captain, marry his betrothed Mercedes (Dagmara Dominczyk) and live a good and long life. However greedy, envious and jealous men Lt. Fernand Mondego, (Guy Pearce) James Frain as Prosecuter Villefort and Danglars (Albie Woodington) betray him and further conspire to have him arrested and imprisoned. Suffering years of lonely despair in the Château D'if, he is befriended by another prisoner an Italian priest named Abbe Faria (Richard Harris). The kindly old man educates Edmond in return for companionship. Upon the old man's death, Edmond is bequeathed a fabulous treasure map. With his good friend Jacopo (played adroitly by Luis Guzmán) he prepares to return from the grave and exact revenge. This movie is definitely more exciting than most and despite it's having dark dramatic scenes which promises more than is delivered, the result becomes an excellent companion to the original Dumas novel. ****",/review/rw2241912/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2002,baumer,9," I love this film!!
","It's kind of strange, my wife and I just recently rented Rob Roy.  I remember hearing that it was quite good when it was released in the 90's. And although I can't say it was a bad film, I can't really say it was all that satisfying.  It had it's moments but it is not one that will linger with any real distinction in my mind.  Usually films in that time frame intrigue me and it was a little disappointing to see such an average film with a pretty good cast.  On the other end of the rainbow, you have this film.  Now even though this is not exactly the same time frame, it is that ""type of film"".  You know, old England, old France, old whatever.  It is pre-1900's.  I put all kinds of films into this category.  Anything from Braveheart to Man In The Iron Mask to Quills all falls neatly into this type of category.  Just like you would say anything from Nosferatu to Nightmare On Elm Street is horror, anything pre-1900 is in this ""type of film"" category.",/review/rw2241912/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2010,VideoGameHollywood,8," I really enjoyed it!
","The Count of Monte Cristo was a film my girlfriend recommended to me, and to be honest, I wasn't looking forward to it. Seeing that it was a recent film and was not well known by my friends or colleagues, I was skeptical. After the first 10 minutes, I was hooked. I've never read the book, but I can see why it is such an important piece of literature. The story was riveting and had me at full attention all the way through. This movie was a bit more ""Hollywood"" then I usually like, but it moved at a fast pace so that even a simpleton would enjoy. After seeing this film I am adding this to my books I need to read before I die. Anyone who's looking for a good evening movie, this is it. The film isn't amazing directed, but the story is so strong it keeps you on the edge of your seat.",/review/rw2241912/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2003,T-MACK,10," Box Office does not equal greatness in this case
","The Count of Monte Cristo is such an under-rated gem.  Great performances, exciting story, and a fun wit, this film has everything that was terrific in Dumas' original novel and then twists it all up to adapt perfectly to the screen but doesn't stray to far.",/review/rw2241912/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2019,gufi-04429,6," ""I'm a priest, not a saint.""
","I agree that the movie doesn't have to be the same as the book. But I have read the book and I know that the story can be better than what's portrayed here in this film. So that's why I give 6-6.5. If I didn't know the original plot, my rate would be higher. The main things that I didn't like were the revenge part (awfully lazy made) and the end (kinda Disney-cheesy). For me, the actual storyline is was more enjoyable and entertaining.",/review/rw2241912/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2005,mOVIemAN56,9," Just Plain good - Nothing Like the Book However
","All right, I know the book is a classic and I liked it but this adaption of the book was so much better. Edmund Dantes and his good friend Fernand Mondego (Guy Pierce) are to shipmates on board a French traders ship. After making a unexpected stop and disobeying orders from the First-mate, the two take their wounded captain on shore only to find that it is Elba, the Island that Napoleon Bonaparte is being held prisoner.",/review/rw2241912/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2004,dbborroughs,9," An Unexpected Classic
","Before this film had come out I had little hope that it would be anything special. Recent Hollywood remakes of classic Dumas tales such as The Three Musketeers and Man in the Iron Mask were interesting failures, they seemed not to have a reason to exist.",/review/rw2241912/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2003,BatStarIndyFreak,10," Unfaithful, but carried by INCREDIBLE performances.
","OK, if you're looking for a faithful adaptation, you're in for disappointment.  But given that the book can stack well next to a phone book, it would take six hours to do the whole story justice.  I saw a 'faithful' attempt in the Richard Chamberlain version and that was sad crunching of scenes that left little room for meaning to be taken of them. Consider also, a faithful climax would call for at least another half hour to set it in motion.",/review/rw2241912/?ref_=tt_urv
15 January 2002,DocRedfield,10," Excellent - Dramatic and Powerful. Revenge served Cold.
","Seeing an advance Screening of 'The Count of Monte Cristo', and having only seen one advertising TV spot before hand, I really did not know what I was going into this time.  I vaguely recalled it being an Alexander Dumas book, and former film/TV versions featuring rather depressing prison scenes with men tunneling to the freedom of the Sea.  Indeed, despite its wonderful locations and details, once the afore-mentioned prison scenes of this version presented themselves I was set to be depressed again and wondered where the story was going.  And then several wonderful things happened; A whole new group of characters were introduced to our rather whiney protagonist - some good, some very bad.  And by the time said Protagonist had escaped the Prison, he too had become wonderfully evoked and dynamic, and I wanted to see him get everything he wanted and deserved: REVENGE. From then on this film was a barrage of wonderful scripting (the adaption being perfect in its pacing and wit), characters, acting, events, costumes, action, suspense and romance.  The audience laughed with genuine awe as each new moment or detail was revealed to us in the plans of the main character's (played perfectly, from his innocent beginnings to his scheming later years)steps towards that end.  This movie was amazing, with very cool performances from Guy Pearce and the rest of the supporting cast, each figure getting his or her share of good lines.  The tale of vengeance is well-balanced with tales of friendship, questing and plotting, and romance, and all of the implications each relationship holds, be it good or bad.  At times the theater openly applauded twists or returning characters.  It is perfectly timed and written, with powerful moments and style, and I would recommend it to ANYONE.",/review/rw2241912/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2007,Umar Mansoor Bajwa,10," Intriguing Revenge Splendidly Unfolded

12 July 2003,Luigi Di Pilla,8," I am surprised
","It was better than I expected. The story offers all: adventure, revenge, pain, love, nice pictures and suspense. The photography was very fine. I discovered this movie in the US Box Office when it was launched and I was surprised by the high cumulative gross amounts. I find that this is the best remake ever made and I recommend it to everyone who likes films of Napoleon Bonaparte´s time. The film is very clear directed. Congratulation to Kevin Reynolds and to the actors Jim Caviezel and Guy Pierce who did a very great job. The act of revenge was similar to the one of ""Gladiator""; another masterpiece to not miss. I will add this one no doubt in my best of dvd collection. 8/10.",/review/rw2241912/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2007,blanche-2,8," Different from the book but vastly entertaining
","James Caviezel is ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" in this stunning 2002 film also starring Guy Pearce, Richard Harris and Dagmara Dominczyk. It's a familiar enough story with some major changes from the book; nevertheless, this is a spirited, splendid production that holds one's interest from beginning to end. The story takes place in France where Edmond Dantes (Caviezel) is set up by his best friend Fernan (Pearce) to appear as a conspirator who joins in a plot to help Napoleon escape from Elba. Dantes is arrested and sent to a horrible island prison. The reason? Fernan wants Dantes' beautiful fiancé, Mercedes. While in prison, he meets an elderly man, Abbe Faria (Harris) who is burrowing an escape tunnel. With a way to sneak into each other's cell, he gives Dantes the education he never had, and also gives him a map to a treasure. Dantes escapes and vows to extract his revenge and all who tried to destroy him. He finds the treasure and becomes ""The Count of Monte Cristo."" Visually stunning, this version of the story has marvelous performances by the very handsome Caviezel, who makes a compelling Dantes, and Guy Pearce, excellent as the evil Fernan. The standout role, of course, is that of Abbe Faria, brilliantly portrayed by Richard Harris.",/review/rw2241912/?ref_=tt_urv
