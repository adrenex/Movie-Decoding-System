2 December 2022,A_Different_Drummer,2," Record breaking, but not in a good way ...
","First and foremost, movies are a business. Which means that seasonal movies (Halloween, X-Mas) are a staple for many production companies because they know in advance there will be demand. Which is why, even though the IMDb database lists 100's of X-Mas movies, only a small handful are worth watching. Or re-watching. That said, I wanted to give 'Christmas with the Campbells' a go because the casting of Snow and Long held promise. A promise, unfortunately, which was not kept. Within the first 5 minutes, we have possibly the most awkward and cringe-worthy breakup scene in the history of film. Followed by one of the most illogical and dissonant story arcs in the history of film -- after the humiliating breakup, the heroine (Snow) decides to go and celebrate X-Mas with her Ex's family, even though he will not be there, and they are no longer a couple. Whaa? Just when you think things can't get any worse, they do. Almost every line of dialog seems extracted from a bad TV sitcom you saw when you were twelve. There is a running joke (not kidding!) about vagina hygiene. Snow looks lost for most of the film, and Long's character was deliberately written to be rugged and manly, with 5 o'clock shadow. Not his brand at all. All in all, one of the most awkward and uncomfortable films ever, worthy of being taught in film class. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

19 December 2022,Short_and_to_the_point,3," I wouldn't say don't watch it...
","I get that it's trying to be funny and there are a few (very few) funny moments, but it's mostly rubbish. This could have been a good and funny movie (the idea is there) had they hired a better jokes writer or something. Justin Long's voice annoys me the entire time. Why did they decide that should be a thing and how did they let it go on for the entire movie??",/review/rw8710682/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2022,chicagosummerstories,10," It's a Satire, folks
",After sitting and watching so many Hallmark movies with my wife I'm glad someone actually followed through on the dare to make a satire- well done.,/review/rw8710682/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2022,crazyonyou-02466,3," Awkward
","I'm maybe 30 minutes into this film right now and I'm regretting my decision to watch it. Justin Long is usually a good actor but what the hell is this?? The accent and attempt to sound more ""manly"" is embarrassing. He's trying so hard that it is over shadowing any chemistry he could have had with Brittany Snow. Even his interactions with the dog are awkward and forced. I don't know if I can actually finish this movie. Its only saving grace is the side characters. I like the mom and Joanna Swisher. I actually really like all these actors which is why it's so disappointing that this movie isn't good.",/review/rw8710682/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2022,AuVid,2," Not Good - at all! (worse than Hallmark's)
","Summary:
A waste of everybody's time and money. Avoid it if you can (even if you love Brittany Snow). So many better options out there.",/review/rw8710682/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2022,tessa4ouch,10," ""its weird"" ""so strange"" ""I wouldnt do these things"" no duh!!
","People are reviewing this movie as if its supposed to be taken as a run of the mill hallmark-type movie; it obviously is not that. Its meant to be a ridiculous commentary on that genre of movie, not an actual addition to the ~christmas in california~s of the world!",/review/rw8710682/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2022,crimsonterrace,10," The bad reviews are making me love this movie even more
","I hate to insult peoples' intelligence, but it seems more than obvious that the people who hate this movie are so clearly not getting what it's going for that it is actually a compliment to the filmmakers.",/review/rw8710682/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2022,azalea-63595,10," New movie 4 my Christmas rotation
","I'm not a romance movie kinda gal and these types of movies are always like torture.. but my mum wanted a Christmas movie n this came up so I put it on with dread.... absolutely loved it... laughed the whole way through. The reviews of 2/10 etc are clearly the same people that don't get satire and take life 2 seriously. Makes me understand how they almost cancelled Family Guy.. its not a family movie! Far to many crude interactions but so worth. Its a ,""what am I watching"" kinda movie at 1st. As u expect the usual but its cute.. bizarre.. breath of fresh air for a romantic comedy ðŸ‘Œ bloody loved it!",/review/rw8710682/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's like ""guy who bought a boat"" got his own SNL movie. There are so many many bizarre choices, too many bizarre choices to not be on purpose.",/review/rw8710682/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2022,roosviews-42316,2," Would be better with subtitles
","I signed up for AMC+ just so I could watch this movie. Augh. I truly thought it would be funny...but as soon as Justin opened his mouth with that annoying, god awful accent, it was ruined.",/review/rw8710682/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2022,ron-26241,1," It's not satire, it's just terrible
","I love Vince Vaughn and was hoping this would be a great movie. Vince, my man, you really need to evolve. As a Navy veteran I've heard my share of profanity, but profanity just for the sake of it is just pointless and disrupts any point trying to be made. The plot? What plot? As if a girl who just got dumped would actually visit the family of the guy who just dumped her. Please. Brittany Snow is great, but even she couldn't carry this terrible attempt at ""entertainment"". Big swing and a miss here. What's sad here is there really is an opportunity for something like this to be good. Best of luck to Vince and Pete going forward. You simply failed here.",/review/rw8710682/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2022,octoberopal28,3," Disappointed
","I thought this would be cute because I like Justin Long and Julia Duffy. The story line was interesting but the sexual references were over the top. I found them to be rather disgusting. I am not prudish, the comments were just downright absurd and ruined what could have been a cute holiday movie.",/review/rw8710682/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2022,solojere,10," Cute, Funny, Weird, And Brittany Snow makes Christmas Magic
","Christmas with the Campbells is a hard movie to describe. It's Cute, Funny, and Weird, and with Brittany Snow, it creates a different type of Christmas magic. The film is a parody of your typical Hallmark/ Lifetime Christmas movie. The movie follows Jesse. After being dumped by her boyfriend, Jesse decides to spend Christmas with her ex's parents, where she meets her ex's handsome cousin. Sounds familiar, right? The only real difference is that this film is more of a parody, and the language is definitely crude. The idea is that in this movie, everyone says what they are thinking, no matter what.",/review/rw8710682/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2022,ninaostadijanovic,1," Shocked
","Did Justin Long do this on a dare????? This is so cringy! U loveJustin,but this fake deep voice and accent are terrible...Brittany Snow and him have zero chemistry. I'm actually writing this in the middle of watching this.",/review/rw8710682/?ref_=tt_urv
23 December 2022,grim2005,4," Not Was I Was Hoping For

19 December 2022,susan-317,6," SO DARNED ODD!
","You might recall Brittany Snow from the Pitch Perfect movies. This movie had that same odd dialogue where characters say really odd, inappropriate or absolutely crazy things.",/review/rw8710682/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2022,tsdennison-63370,1," Forced F
","They tried to make a raunchy Hallmark Christmas movie, but the language was so pathetically forced it was just sad. Dropping F bombs just for the sake of having them in the movie does not work. They went for shock and awe and failed miserably. Add to that the absolutely horrific high school play acting and you have a completely unwatchable, boring piece of crap. This movie doesn't deserve any more words, but according to the required characters counter in order to submit a review I have to keep going. Therefore, in conclusion, Christmas with the Campbells really, really, really,really, really sucks.",/review/rw8710682/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2022,corie-82655,1," Even the dog didn't want to be in the movie.
",If you are looking for horrible innuendos and even worse cowboy accents this is the movie for you. It was so terrible even the dog didn't want to be a part of the cast and kept running away!,/review/rw8710682/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2022,Avidviewer-02847,2," Another dud !
","Watched over half of the movie expecting it to improve, but it never did. I like Brittany Snow and she's been good in other productions as a blonde, red hair isn't really her.",/review/rw8710682/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2022,parduet77,4," It's not Raunchy, Satirical or Funny. It's just Bad
","Sorry but this film was terrible. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! I was not expecting Oscar worthy performances but this try hard film just wasn't funny. If you are expecting Four Christmases, Christmas VACATION, or even Bad Santa, put those to rest because it's just cringey and forced. The writing is nonsensical, the dialog is horrendous (worse than any Hallmark or GAC movie I've seen) . I just don't understand how this is getting any positive reviews, everything about it is wrong. The actors have no chemistry, no one and nothing is even remotely relatable. This movie is just straight up trash. I turned it off after an hour it never got better.",/review/rw8710682/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2022,lisataylorcowart,1," First IMDB review in my life because this movie was SOOOO awful!
","Save yourselves! Do not watch this movie. I am a Hallmark, cheesy Christmas fan. It has become a holiday tradition with me and my husband. This movie was sooooo bad, I thought he was pranking me. I did not believe it was a ""real"" holiday movie. I thought it was his payback for asking him to watch these with me every December. He even made peppermint bark white Russians (and I drank 2 of them) and this was by far, the worst holiday movie I have ever suffered through. Ladies...just schedule your annual mammogram for December rather than watch this movie.",/review/rw8710682/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2022,jaketporter,2," More awkward than faring at a funeral.
","This film was very lucky to be rated a 2/10, however it did kill a couple of hours while hungover.",/review/rw8710682/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2022,adamstevenhummel,1," Ho Ho Oh No!
","If this movie is an attempt at a Hallmark Christmas satire or spoof, it fails miserably. Actual Hallmark movies are far more ridiculous and sincere and that's what makes them somewhat charming and, often, stupidly hilarious. It seems like it might have been an attempt at a Hallmark movie, and then Vince Vaughn injected his ""humor"" into the script with absolutely awkward scenes between Julia Duffy and George Wendt, a bizarre vocal affectation by Justin Long, lazy sexual innuendo, moments of tonal whiplash and a weird fart sound effect thrown in to a scene that still baffles me. Fa la la la Farrelly brothers this is not.",/review/rw8710682/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2022,becdom,4," Oh dear!
","In short, this is a very strange movie. Gratuitous swearing and sex talk with incestuous overtones.",/review/rw8710682/?ref_=tt_urv
3 December 2022,alinelunardy,3," Not good at all
",I really really really wanted to like this movie cause I'm a fan of Brittany Snow and Justin Long but woowww it's very very bad. First of all idk why but Snow looked like she'd rather be anywhere than in that movie and Justin character is so not suited for him at all. The storyline is so weird too like who does that?? Accepting ur ex family invite to go to their town and celebrate the holidays with them? Even if u love Christmas that much and u dont know where else to go (umm maybe just ask ur friends to crash their Christmas?? Don't u have friends??) and even tho ur ticket isn't transferable and u don't have money etc etc but still again who does this? I stopped watching after 30 minutes cause I really hoped it would turned out good but ugh. I feel so bad for Snow and Long they deserve a better Christmas movie story. Would love to watch them in one with a good storyline.,/review/rw8710682/?ref_=tt_urv
