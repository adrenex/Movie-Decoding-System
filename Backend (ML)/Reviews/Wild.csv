13 March 2015,s3276169,8," A slowly unfolding ice bound drama
","Fortitude is not your typical drama. It moves slowly, like the ice locked landscape in which it is set. ",/review/rw4502540/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2016,ToddWebb,9," IMDb promises Drama, Horror, Mystery, and Fortitude delivers
","The best summary I saw here said, ""Superb show not for faint hearts or the lazy."" That about sums it up. I'm shocked at all the negative reviews here.",/review/rw4502540/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2018,rainysnows,5," Very Disappointing ending .
",Season 1 was good .Season 2 was far fetched and Season 3 was ridiculous .I felt like I did when LOST ended - all that for nothing .Started off well and then seemed to lose direction .Nice shots of the snow though !,/review/rw4502540/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2019,martinlucas-469-207968,," Torn to shreds
","I'd love to know the story behind the debacle of series three. The first series was reasonably well constructed, lovely vistas. The second series tried to move the original themes forward and failed. The third series looked like somebody got the viewing figures and said, "" right, that's enough, this has descended into melodramatic gory crap. Let's cut our losses now!"".",/review/rw4502540/?ref_=tt_urv
25 March 2015,silmarieni,9," A great show
","Fortitude is a great show: exotic, thrilling, well played, with an outstanding story.",/review/rw4502540/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2020,PaxD75,7," Amazing 1st season, horrible season 2, mediocre season 3
","I watched the entire series and thought the first season was an amazing, drama/mystery driven by Sci-Fi. Few series have been so well-written: it had me looking in many different directions - spending as much time trying to figure out the mystery as I did getting to know each character, the environment and the hard science (coupled with fictional science). The first season is easily a 10.",/review/rw4502540/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2015,BeneCumb,8," An intense suspense series - with harsh nature in a supporting role

29 December 2018,winniepooh2028,8," Disappointed with season 3
","First and second season were fantastic and really enjoyed watching, I was so looking forward to the final season but was very disappointied. I agree with other comments writers did not put much effort into tying up the whole story or characters stories.",/review/rw4502540/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2015,patbradley435,9," Don't believe the negative reviews
","I don't believe IMDb anymore. This is a really interesting show, intriguing and enigmatic. It's probably too complicated for many on here who cannot connect the dots because of its complicated story-line. Brilliantly acted and beautifully filmed. I am totally hooked and cannot wait for the next episode. By no stretch can this be called boring. I am slowly learning that there are many on here who cannot discern good TV or movies. I was shocked to the core recently that most people liked 'I Saw the Devil,' A ridiculous South Korean movie and gave it high ratings, when it is the biggest pile of drivel ever committed to film. Watch it and see. My goodness, it is bad, but Fortitude has my backing for sure. I realise that we all have different tastes, but in a court of law, Fortitude would be vindicated as good but I Saw the Devil would be laughed out of court for the pile of dross that it is.",/review/rw4502540/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2017,stephen-lambe,6," Bonkers roller-coaster of a series that requires serious suspension of disbelief
","I've just binge-watched Season 2 after - almost - not returning after season 1. Both seasons are a bit of a mess, to be honest, but the ride through both of them is not without a lot of fun.",/review/rw4502540/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2015,Robin_clarke41,10," Fantastic, edgy new drama
","I've just seen the first episode and wow I'm hooked already! The beautiful scenery and landscape shots are as big a star as the amazing cast. Every character is mysterious and mesmerising and the plot is deep, dark and luscious. The director does a great job of setting the feel of the place. You really soak up the hostile environment and I even started to feel cold at points. Characters all behave realistically in the unforgiving environment and all have very believable interactions and traits. Believe me when I say this is not the usual dross churned out by the big production companies these days. Anyone who enjoys gritty, suspenseful and intelligent TV will enjoy this immensely.",/review/rw4502540/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2021,editing_budgie,2," Season 2 - what the actual f??
","Season 2 is a confusing $hit$how. Unbelievable bad. It's like someone dropped the final scripts, and when they picked them up, they put the pages in the wrong order.",/review/rw4502540/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2017,AmigaWolf,5," First season is great, second season is not so great

27 May 2019,marquesmunoz,1," Writers should be fired.
","The first season was great. The second season theu want to write about an animal being possessed, why? Like just stop it. Like really stop. What were these writers thinking? They should be fired.",/review/rw4502540/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2015,druberwolf,6," Not quite the state of Norway
","I wish the producers had bothered to learn just a smidgeon about winters and Norway when making such a series. A) Even those who should be Norwegian rarely had Norwegian names B) The police had more weapons than the complete Norwegian police force (well, not quite, but you get the drift), but CHILDREN cycling around with hunting rifles in town? Did they think it was Texas, just colder? C) Reindeer and polar bears together? Not in Norway, not on Svalbard. D) When it is VERY cold (30 C below) the snow makes a certain sound, and it does not turn to slush. E) Except for a few instances the people mumbling in Norwegian did not sound very Norwegian, even the chef in the Muppets was better. F) Wasps do how well in the cold, hm? G) Norwegians do not wear their shoes indoors, especially when it is cold and wet outside. It makes everything dirty, you see, and we do not like dirt in our houses. H) When it is cold, seriously cold, people usually cover their ears and button up their jackets. And they seldom wear gloves, but mittens.",/review/rw4502540/?ref_=tt_urv
19 April 2015,AngCha,5," Interesting at first, got tiring and disturbing at the end
","Having completed the entire first season, I must admit I was disappointed. I don't know if I was falsely expecting a different kind of show or it was Fortitude producers' blame to having created totally different expectations to its viewers, but the show gradually ruined every positive characteristic it had when it started. Although there were all the necessary ingredients to make a dark, Hitchcock-styled crime & mystery series, the decision of the producers to turn Fortitude into a Supernatural-kind of show totally destroyed it. The amazing landscaping, the cold and intriguing ambiance of a closed, isolated society, the mysterious people living in the city, from so many different backgrounds, gave Fortitude a great beginning and made us believe it would keep the pace up until the end, offering us a modern, North-Pole alternative of Twin Peaks. Instead, we were given a disappointing metaphysical turn of the plot, some really disturbing and violent images and characters gradually becoming less and less interesting. By the end of the show, I caught myself looking forward to the finale, tired of the swallow plot. A total disappointment, unfortunately...",/review/rw4502540/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2015,stephen7272,9," Cold But Charismatic
",The first two scenes of Fortitude tells you where this is heading. A recollection of man's death whilst being attacked by a polar bear and the discovery of an ancient mammoth corpse. Fortitude is about unravelling what happened in the past from the current evidence. The truth hides itself behind the character's attempts to keep their own past a secret from one another. That's why they have all ended up in a town on the edge of the Arctic - to hide their pasts in the snow and ice.,/review/rw4502540/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2015,mike_brunton,5," Had some good moments, but also many negatives
","Fortitude was a mixed bag for me. I did finish watching the whole of Season One, but frankly found it a bit of an effort. I won't really say, what the whole storyline was, but I guess it was interesting enough a premise for me to continue to the end. I honestly found it, a hard slog at times. I don't know if it was the editing, acting, directing, or writing but Fortitude just didn't gel for me. There were frequent moments when I thought ' what is going on?' Someone described this as a psychological thriller. I didn't see any real psychology, I didn't see any thriller elements. Ultimately I just didn't get it. I can see from other reviews, that some people loved this. And they must be keenly awaiting Season Two. I felt Season One was dragged out to the hilt. And honestly, what other big interesting secrets can be waiting in Season Two? Ultimately the location was one of the best things about this series. Acting, writing, editing ,and directing were I felt very average.",/review/rw4502540/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2020,lotheravanti,6," Could have been great
","First season was great. Great characters, very interesting and complex characters, very gray. Although it was a slow burn, it kept you engaged.",/review/rw4502540/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2015,LouieInLove,3," Over-Stylised & Poorly Construscted
","Fortitude has a wonderful cast & the location is beautiful. However the show is a writer's bin full of poorly constructed storyline & unbelievable characters. Basically it's the inhabitants of an English town dumped in Denmark, all of whom are on a paranoid acid trip.",/review/rw4502540/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2018,AB-Crawford,8," Hilarious

","The first series was interesting so I started by giving it 7/10, the second was weird so changed my marks to 6/10 and the third is just rubbish, so I'm now down to 5/10. I don't know if I'll be able finish series 3! Stop now before we all turn off!",/review/rw4502540/?ref_=tt_urv

29 April 2017,sanjin_9632,7," Should've been a mini-series.
",Let me start by saying that the first season of Fortitude was very good. Very reminiscent of the Scandinavian cop shows/crime stories from the last decade. I liked most of the characters and the fact that prehistoric wasps turned out to be the deadly threat was a nice twist at the end.,/review/rw4502540/?ref_=tt_urv
9 December 2018,wayneprice-39650,6," Starts well, ends poorly
","First two seasons were really good and me and my partner loved the show. Third season was short and rushed and disappointing. There was enough going on in the storyline to make it a full 10-12 episode season, but they hurried and crammed it all into the fourth episode",/review/rw4502540/?ref_=tt_urv
