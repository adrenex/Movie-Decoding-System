3 August 2022,JabezGill,7," A new spin on an old story, with a fun twist.
",Ignore the negative reviews and give this movie a chance.,/review/rw8403014/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2022,jonwoodh,8," Angourie Rice is perfect in the lead role
","Not another teen movie with young adults playing high school students? Yes, but this one's a winner. It's clever, witty, engaging, has heart and is knocked out of the park by a star winning performance by Angourie Rice. I enjoyed how the tone shifted from Machiavellian to honesty and truth, though the counselor/student sub plot is a little creepy. Should appeal to all ages and I'm an old dude.",/review/rw8403014/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2022,Perspicuity1,7," With a different ending, this could have been a much more enjoyable film.
","For the most part, Honor Society is an extremely enjoyable film; it's only in the climax where it falls apart. It seems the director has some kind of bitterness towards men, because of the way every single one of them, especially the male lead, has been portrayed. Honor wasn't exactly trying to be angel to her classmates, she was trying to create a distraction that would affect their studies, so much so that they fall behind in the race to be the best in the class. What happened to them as a result of that was great, and it showed how thoughtful a girl Honor was; but that wasn't her only intention, was it? Wasn't she also trying to sabotage the academic plans of her classmates? Just like our male protagonist, Michael, Honor too had a selfish interest behind making friends with Travis, Kennedy and Gary. So how is it that when Honor does it, she is a hero and we are supposed to rally behind her, but Michael is declared villain, a 'bad person' for doing the same?",/review/rw8403014/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2022,bmasdhs,9," It was a pretty good movie
",The story was decent. The ending was kinda surprising. There are some pretty funny jokes. Great casting. A good feature film debut for Gaten Matarazzo.,/review/rw8403014/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2022,Hammer-Rocks,8," Mean Girls with heart
","I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. It's a teenage/high school movie with the typical student types associated with high school. You have the popular girls/boys, jocks, nerds/geeks. Bullies, & uber smart students. But what's surprising is they (student types) do not play your stereotype roles normally associated with the tag. Not sure if this is more representative of todays high schoolers, or simply the writers' wishes of what high school should be.",/review/rw8403014/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2022,Eggoreluckadman,7," Good movie, but I would never rewatch it
","The tone is inconsistent but the performances from Angourie Rice and Gaten Matarazzo and style from director Oran Zegman make this an enjoyable, but singular watch.",/review/rw8403014/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2022,JazzCat64,9," Pleasantly Surprised!!
","I was pleasantly surprised. Ms. Rice who played honor was calculative, self-absorbed, a minor ""b"" but knew how to mask it. At least this is what she thought she was in the beginning. Since she never made the effort to genuinely like anyone, she had nothing to go on. She finds out that she is a good person and wants what's best for individuals that eventually become her friends. The bad part is that she learns that men, regardless of geek or athlete is an ""AH"" but she deserved that lesson since she initially had demon thoughts in destroying people's future for the sake of hers. I like these kind-of movies, John Hughes like from the 80s and 90s and i wish they would do more of them but i know the current generation prefer to shoot them up and bang, bang.",/review/rw8403014/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2022,trapp_33,8," It let me feel good
","First, I didn't expected that it will be good and I just wanted anything to see turs out it is good. The plot was pleasent but not in a bad way, there is things I didn't thought that it would happen. The comedy part in the show was delightful not to make you laugh out loud but to make you smile, and I was smiling through the whole movie. Also my reactions to any evnt in the film was so interactive. If you were free and you don't have anything to watch you should watch this absolutly.",/review/rw8403014/?ref_=tt_urv

","Tsunami of high school chatter, a film narrated in 1st person period, the anchor role tells and plays the role of honor supposedly the brightest girl at school. Being set up by her principal telling her that she is one outta 4 brightest at the school makes her panic and press every button there are to make the others fail at the midterms.

31 July 2022,rogerflores-41611,6," Woke Ending ruins otherwise good rom-com/coming of age story
","The first 2 acts of this movie are a 10, featuring a great romantic rapport between the two leads as well as a nice coming of age story. In the final act, just as the audience is rooting for this couple to overcome the deception they played on each other, the movie takes a hard left turn into some woke pride fest. The story subsequently abandons the romantic element, essentially dismissing Gaten Matarazzo's character arc, leaving the audience who was rooting for this couple hanging out to dry. The ending is such an unwanted turn that I dropped this all the way to a 6. I could've given it a 5, just because of how disappointing this plot twist was.",/review/rw8403014/?ref_=tt_urv
29 August 2022,noahcarmicheal,3," It's okay to manipulate the emotions and hardships of others if you're a woman
","To summarize this movie; A high school girl manipulates everyone around her so she can go to Harvard. In the end she's cheered as a hero for it. Meanwhile, all the men in the show (Besides the two gay guys. Who make a great couple.) also manipulate people around them but are viewed as villains. Even the romantic love interest, who only lies about where he lives, is viewed as a villain even though he wanted the same thing as the protagonist. The protagonist knows everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, at the beginning of the movie. She does not grow at all.",/review/rw8403014/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2022,roshxz,10," perfection
","Honor Society (2022) : This movie takes all the YA cliches, & somehow subverts & delivers on them to perfection. Like this is an absolute beat for beat wholesome movie, until the exact moment it becomes a mirror of itself and turns every trope on its head. Just go watch it dude.",/review/rw8403014/?ref_=tt_urv

","HONOR SOCIETY follows Honor (Angourie Rice), an ambitious high school senior whose sole focus is getting into Harvard, assuming she can first earn the coveted recommendation of her advisor, Mr. Calvin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). Willing to do whatever it takes, Honor hatches a Machiavellian plan to take down her top three competitors, until things change when she unexpectedly falls in love with her biggest competition, Michael (Gaten Matarazzo).",/review/rw8403014/?ref_=tt_urv

30 July 2022,lauriskairo,3," Just bad
","First of all, trailer in this movie I think is really misleading... It shows only moments with main actress and a boy from stranger things. And actually they showed every moment between the two in the trailer.. And this movie was about something else. Ending felt wierd, rushed... This movie is for 13-15 year olds.. If you want 90-2000s rom-com this is not it. Looking at the trailer, like me, some people may think that this is a rom com.. It's NOT. 3 is max what i can give...",/review/rw8403014/?ref_=tt_urv

","They attempt to make a comedy ""movie"" with a plot point being let's have a 17 year student ""seduce"" an adult. Then when the adult tries to move in on the seduction, he's shot down. But it's supposed to be funny? Or empowering for the young lady? It just felt all wrong and really made me dislike the film.",/review/rw8403014/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2022,exlana,7," it's good, until it doesn't
","The premise of Honor Society is an overachiever student taking down her competitors to get into Harvard. It's not groundbreaking, but for the most of part, it's fun. It's witty, well paced, well acted by the main actor, and strangely, there is little to none cringe lines and no excessively annoying characters, considering it's a teen drama film.",/review/rw8403014/?ref_=tt_urv

5 August 2022,geister_faust,8," Breakfast Club meets Cry Wolf
","This movie is seriously under appreciated and without a serious promo it risks to stay under the radar. Shame, because leads are great and age-appropriate, story is solid and camerawork is interesting, especially with Angouire Rice character breaking the fourth wall. Her character, Honor Rose suspiciously resembles the one of Lindy Botth's Dodger from 2005 movie ""Cry wolf"" not only in style, but in cold-blooded calculated moves aimed only to achieve her goal. Gaten Matarazzo is a nice addition with his experience in Stranger Things, but he fails to become second lead as other characters are equally interesting. There's a distinct Breakfast Club vibe going on in this movie and if you're looking for more of the same, this one will do you great. Nicely paced with a fluent edits, this movie is a hidden germ of 2022.",/review/rw8403014/?ref_=tt_urv
