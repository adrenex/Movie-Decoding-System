16 December 2011,ron-fernandez-pittsburgh,7," Very good
","Why is the movie getting such a bad rap?? It's really a very charming film with wonderful acting by Hanks and Roberts as well as a very good support cast. While the plot itself is no great shakes, it's very interesting, especially in these times of disheavelment. I know a lot of people as well as critics don't like it. Amazed. It's a 'feel good' kind of movie with no villains. Maybe that's why it doesn't sell to the average movie goer who likes foul language, violence, special effects and fast paced editing with hand held cameras yet. This is an old fashioned movie that was made in the 50-60's, so it's not relevant today? Too bad. See this one and you won't be disappointed. AND DON'T READ THOSE UNKIND COMMENTS.",/review/rw4589123/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2013,inkblot11,8," Larry and his Merry Mentality win the day,don't believe the critics on this one!
","Larry Crowne (Tom Hanks) has worked for U-Mart for ages and has won numerous ""employee of the month"" awards. But, things can change. Fast. One day, the U-Mart upper managers decide that, because Larry doesn't have a college diploma, he has no future in the company. Say what? Yes! Thus, he's kicked out of the biz. Being a very likable and capable guy, he tries to find another job, but, when that fails, he goes down a slow spiral. First, the bank wants their mortgage payments or else. The smarmy bank exec (Rita Wilson, Hanks wife) says ""let's talk over complimentary coffee"" but then lowers the boom. Desperate, Larry decides to have a huge garage sale but this upsets his neighbors (Cedric the Entertainer and Tarij P. Henson) because they operate a resale business out of their home. Thus, Larry sells his car and buys some time with a small scooter for transportation. Not knowing what else to do, he enrolls in the local community college. In an econ course, he meets the formidable Dr. Ed (George Takei) who teaches the class from the textbook he wrote himself. Worse, in an communications course, Larry comes up against a jaded, unhappily married prof, Dr. Mercedes (Julia Roberts) who would rather be teaching Shakespeare, if enough students had selected the course. But, they didn't, so she's stuck with a motley crew of speech pupils. At home, her ""sit-on-my laurels"" author hubby (Bryan Cranston) surfs porn all day, which makes her even more unhappy. Thus, Dr. M takes it out by being grouchy and unapproachable in class. Nevertheless, despite his age, Larry wins the affections of his young classmates, who offer him haircuts, community bike rides, and free interior decoration. Alas, Larry may still lose the house. But, with his smarts, he may succeed well in his classes AND turn Dr. Mercedies head in his direction! This is a sweet, funny movie that will please fans of light comedy and the great cast. Why it was torpedoed by the critics is a complete mystery. After all, it has a terrific cast, especially the young adults who play Larry's classmates, an intelligent script, great costumes, and a vibrant direction. What's not to love, I say!",/review/rw4589123/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2015,BoomerDT,7," Predictable, But Enjoyable
","This is, at least for me, a perfect type of HBO movie, where I just viewed it. It isn't loaded with special effects and non-stop ridiculous violence, which may be why some of the reviewers hate it. Actually, not a whole lot happens in this story of Larry Crowne, a 50 yr old ex-Navy vet who has been laid off from his retail job and decides to go attend community college. (It is hard to believe he couldn't find another retail job, but we've got to get Tom Hanks in college) Larry does seem to really find himself in college and falls in love with with his speech teacher, Julia Roberts, who is in the process of splitting with her hubby,a frustrated writer who is obsessed with ladies with large boobs. That's about it, but it's only 98 minutes of time spent, Hanks and Roberts are pleasant to watch in the type of role they can do in their sleep. As I said, not a whole lot happens but that's somewhat similar to life most the time.",/review/rw4589123/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2017,alfredsmith,8," Wonderful comedy
","I believe this movie to be very underrated and cannot understand why. I loved the story and characters. They were all so real and very funny. Hanks and Roberts were simply great but the whole cast did an impressive job and George Takei as the economics lecturer, Dr. Matsutani, was absolutely hilarious. OK the story is predicable and so was the ending, but I didn't care. It's a fun ride that's not to be taken seriously, so just sit back and enjoy this wonderful comedy.",/review/rw4589123/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2015,tub51461,8," Connects easily with the public
","This movie is simply a movie in which Tom Hanks wrote, directed, and acted in, not for pure entertainment value. There's some humor in it, but the ultimate goal is that it's strictly written as a means to connect with anyone who has ever been cut from a job which paid the bills, paid the mortgage, paid the student loans, paid any car loans, etc. then nothing, no job, credit is overdrawn, house, car, & lucky if they don't lose their shirt. It's the way of the world for the last 10 years and that's Tom Hanks' message to the audience: How can we adjust to this sudden hole in our lives? Well, the movie subtly gives you a lot of answers. If you ever been out of your element, then you'll enjoy this film.",/review/rw4589123/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2011,ferguson-6,5," This French Toast needs some Spice!
","Greetings again from the darkness. I view Tom Hanks as one of the all-time giants among movie actors. He is true Hollywood royalty. When I heard he was producing, directing, co-writing and starring in a new film, I assumed it was his first step in becoming the new Clint Eastwood. Sadly, Mr. Hanks broke the number rule of movie-making: have a point to make or a story to tell. What we get is a 1980's flashback when mainstream movies could be successful just by putting nice people on screen.",/review/rw4589123/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2011,DarkVulcan29,9," It has the likableness that is Tom Hanks
","I'm amazed that critics give a thumbs up to the incredible stupid film Bad Teacher, but give a thumbs down to the funny charming film Larry Crowne, go figure.",/review/rw4589123/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2011,bkoganbing,8," Pretty Woman Comes Into A Life
","I thoroughly enjoyed Larry Crowne which starred a pair of veterans in the leads. Julia Roberts, a little older since she played in Pretty Woman, is still one thank you very much and she comes into the life of Tom Hanks who is in her speech class. Double, no triple dose of kudos go to Hanks who wrote, directed, and played the lead the title role of Larry Crowne.",/review/rw4589123/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2016,davispittman,10," Rom Com Gold!
","Larry Crowne is one of the cutest, well made romantic comedy films I've ever seen! This movie is just rip roaring fun all the way through. I laughed so unbelievably hard several times, mostly at Julia Roberts and her hilarious lines. Julia Roberts really did reach hilarity here at several moments, especially during the drunken scene, I laughed till I was to the point of tears. Tom Hanks is awesome here too as the lead character, Larry Crowne. The chemistry between Roberts and Hanks is so real and authentic seeming. The writing and dialogue here is well written, touching when it needs to be, and hilarious when it needs to be. I thoroughly got invested in both Julia and Tom's characters and was able to get plenty of development and background of their characters, when then in turn caused me to care more about where their storyline and their romance goes by the time the film wraps up at the end. Overall, Larry Crowne is a very well made feel good type of movie that is championed by an A-list cast. 10/10 for Larry Crowne :).",/review/rw4589123/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2011,chenghonglim,8," Larry Crowne is like organic wholemeal ciabatta.
","While I was scrolling through the different titles available this weekend, I chanced upon ""Larry Crowne"". Looked it up on IMDb; not so good - an average of 5/10. Scroll down further and voil√†! Written by Tom Hanks himself, gotta see it. And I'm glad I did.",/review/rw4589123/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2011,jerrywilson,9," I left the theater feeling good about it
","I love Tom Hanks and I love his directing style. That Thing You Do remains one of my favorite movies ever and this film, Larry Crowne, has the same feel about it, though the subject matter is completely different. ",/review/rw4589123/?ref_=tt_urv

17 November 2012,wingedheartart,8," Subtle Optimism
","I disagree with this needing spice. It wasn't written to be action packed, full of CGI etc. It was to show what a man of about 50 does when he is downsized, through no fault of his own. If you are over 30 and have gone back to school, possibly at a local community college or ANY college really, when J. Roberts is dragging her chalk across the board with a lack of enthusiasm...I felt like I sat through her class more than once. The subtle humor of the students and teachers, LOVE GEORGE T. IN THIS... is fantastic. When Julia's character is talking to her husband about Porn and he says, ""I'm a guy, being a guy, being a guy..."" It stays with you. Not all guys act that way... So, if you aren't 12 or 18 and have gone through a few difficulties in life, check our Larry Crowne. It will fill you with a warm optimism, that you might be able to make it through the next crisis with a little bit of humor. ",/review/rw4589123/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2011,Jake_III,7," An enjoyable way to spend an hour & a half.....
","To begin, I'm not sure what some of the other reviewers expected to see in this film. Larry Crowne is not a sizzling drama, a fast paced action movie, or an over-the-top comedy, & it's not likely to win a bunch of Oscars for acting, screenplay or anything else for that matter. What is is, however, is a well written, fun movie that is fairly well acted & very enjoyable. ",/review/rw4589123/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2012,mattkratz,9," good movie
","This is a decent movie featuring two of my favorite actors-Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts-and a decent supporting cast. It is a story about a man who loses his job after it is discovered that he never went to college, and he decides to remedy that by enrolling at a local community college. He enrolls in a couple classes and winds up falling for one of his professors.",/review/rw4589123/?ref_=tt_urv

23 October 2011,phd_travel,," What a yawn - don't bother with this one
","Why they bothered to make this movie beats me. 2 of the biggest stars in Hollywood Julia & Tom couldn't rescue it. It was boring uninteresting totally unfunny. There are actually no laughs, romance, or drama. None of the characters were involving or sympathetic. The basic premise is depressing without any silver lining - a middle aged man gets retrenched, faces foreclosure, goes back to school and then finds love with his teacher. Julia Roberts looks prettier than of late. The color of her hair and her makeup somehow made her look quite lovely and young again. She is not suited to the cranky role. Tom Hanks is too old and puffy looking. You can barely make out the expressions on his face anymore. The supporting cast has such lame and silly roles from Wilmer Valderrama to George Takei. Overall - skip this one even if you are a huge fan of the 2 leads.",/review/rw4589123/?ref_=tt_urv
30 June 2011,jdesando,," The King
","Larry Crowne is the king of summer romances, a sweet story about the titular middle-aged nice guy (Tom Hanks), who gets a new life after being let go from a Wal-Mart-like retail store. His renaissance comes in the form of a community college education starting with a speech course taught by the attractive but dour Mercedes Tainot (Julia Roberts).",/review/rw4589123/?ref_=tt_urv
10 September 2011,chicagopoetry,10," Absolutely Charming
","What's not to love about Larry Crowne? I almost didn't bother because of the not so flattering trailer and the mediocre reviews, but when I finally got the chance to sit back and watch Larry Crowne I found myself engaged in it, laughed out loud at least eight times, cared about the characters, really felt good about how refreshing it was to see a good natured film for once instead of a bunch of nasty sex and violence, was in awe of the acting and screen writing, really, really cared about not exactly Larry Crowne the character but the film as a whole. Yeah, it seemed like a big budget all star version of the TV show Community, but so what? It's entertaining as hell.",/review/rw4589123/?ref_=tt_urv
10 June 2011,AccessCardRequired,8," not a bad movie but somewhat slow
","Saw it at European premiere. Overall it is a nice comedy. Not for hard laughs, but a somewhat sentimental story about an excellent salesman who is fired, because he doesn't have a college degree. Hence he goes back to community college and ends up falling in love.",/review/rw4589123/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2011,jonmccann,2," Eh?!
","What is this film about?!? OK, a bloke loses his job and he is in the latter years of life....And er, he goes to school and thats it, oh wait, he meets an alcoholic teacher and they sort of get it on! There is no chemistry in this film because the script doesn't require it. I can imagine when the original idea was pitched, it made sense, but on screen, it has nothing. I was bored at 30 minutes, at an hour it was starting to get to a point, but of course its only 1hr 40, so i rightly figured the remaining 40 mins would be boring!! I love Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts, in fact I also respect Bryan Cranston who has a bit part that he should regret, but simply put, if you don't have a decent story, don't stand up on set, this is the absolute example of that!!! Watch it on telly when it appears, but don't pay to see it, that would be a waste.",/review/rw4589123/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2012,anoceanroars,6," Not great, but not horrible either
","i love Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts films and had hoped that the two together would be awesome, but i was a little disappointed. i cannot exactly put my finger on it, but it felt a little off. Larry (Tom Hanks) loses his job from a Walmart-type store because he did not go to college. It seems far-fetched, but i let it slide. So, what does he do? He goes to college. Who is his teacher? Mercedes Tainot played by Julia Roberts. So you can fill in the puzzle from there. It is a typical chick flick, but with a little quirkiness. Unfortunately the quirkiness was the character Talia, which was a little to strange and never played out or explained fully. One good point for the film, it was a throw back to a more wholesome time before every filmed had sex and foal language in every other scene. i hope both Hanks and Roberts find a better vehicle for their talent next time.",/review/rw4589123/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2014,lmpd51,8," I laughed and laughed
","This movie was lighthearted and just what I needed to brighten my evening! There was no raunchiness which was very refreshing. Tom Hanks was is usual wonderful self. Julia Roberts' character could have been developed a bit better but overall this movie was hysterical and my grandkids loved it also. Of course, it was a bit far fetched in some parts but then you have a comedy, that's the way you make people laugh!! My daughter let me borrow it for the evening and I wish she had given it to me. I may buy it. Yes, I liked it that well. And even though a comedy, it was very relevant to today's problems facing our nation.",/review/rw4589123/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2019,tabuno,8," A Feel Good Movie For Our Age and Time
","4 July 2011. This feel good movie captures the emotional stress of our maturing working population and our economic doldrums. The authentic everyman and everywoman portrait has a sensitive touch for the mainstream over 35 generation and avoids all over selling and over dramatizing through its restrained script, yet touching relevant points of experience and malaise that is infecting our society and living experience. Cedric the Entertainer entertains without his wacky, acidic style while both Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts capture their roles and relationships well and without any of the typical melodramatics and over the top stunts found in almost all other romantic comedies. This is a solid movie that doesn't need additional thrills, subplots along with some captivating soundtracks. The weakest part of the film is the final speech that didn't catch on fire, a non-memorable two minutes that didn't capture the depth of emotion. Tom Hanks has some great facial scenes, particularly in the beginning and else where his character speaks millions without saying anything. Well worth the money for those who are now experiencing the pits of despair as Larry Crowne to escape the harsh reality of now and issue forth some modicum of entertaining hope which is exactly what the movie was likely supposed to do.",/review/rw4589123/?ref_=tt_urv
