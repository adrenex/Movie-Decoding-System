8 September 2016,ninjawaiter,2," 5 full seasons, nothing really worth watching
","I found this show on Amazon Prime and decided to give it a watch because I have a huge crush on Kristen Bell. Yeah, I know. Sue me. Anyway, I binged all 5 seasons in about a week, so I'm reviewing the entire show, pilot to finale. All my commentary will remain general, so no spoilers ahead.",/review/rw2554533/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2016,boner-59726,5," Started strong but lost its way
","What started out as a scathing, hilarious indictment of the management consulting racket within just a few episodes has unfortunately turned into a heart-warming/-wrenching story about dysfunctional family life and damaged people.",/review/rw2554533/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2012,hannah-uzelac,9," Clever and funny. Extremely enjoyable.
","I just read a review in which someone complained about the amount of ""slurs"" and basically equated the show to pornography. They couldn't be more wrong.",/review/rw2554533/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2017,foghorn_clj,3," Totally misses the mark
",This show had so much potential. With Don Cheadle and the always delightful Kristen Bell it should've been a slam dunk. But it's not. Here's why:,/review/rw2554533/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2012,blkpearl22,9," Great ADULT show
","Whom ever suggested that porn is better must not watch porn at all. As an adult I am tired of having television shows watered down to please those who are afraid of adult content. I love the savvy business talk,the fact that the consultants do what they have to do to get what they want. We all know that that's not the real world but it's a TV show. The banter is brilliant and the humor is memorable. Don Cheadel's character is so unapologetically ruthless that you can't help but like him. A welcome break from mindless reality shows. This now my favorite Showtime Series. The only reason I gave it a 9 and not a 10 is because I wish it were an hour long.",/review/rw2554533/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2012,SirBurgh,10," Love it - I can't wait for Sunday night!
","First off, I have to say I don't watch a lot of ""TV"". But by TV I mean regular shows or sitcom type material (if they still call it that). I watch movies or sports, news, etc...",/review/rw2554533/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2016,fredmelden-1,1," Infantile
","The main characters have a smidgen of depth; the rest are cardboard cutouts. The situations the pod addresses are occasionally realistic, but the 'sell' itself is almost always simplistic. The ease with which the clients succumb to the various 'sells' is ridiculously easy, as if the heads of large corporations don't simply make mistakes (they often do) but make stupid ones on a regular basis. And, of course, the characters all have 'issues' - daddy issues, mommy issues, inferiority issues - a pretense to cover up the shallowness of the characters. It's rather like putting on a layer of icing on a cow pie. Everyone habitually talks about sex, sex, and more sex; the ""mine is bigger than yours"" mentality pervades every scene, except the ones where actual sex occurs. The depicted snark and chest thumping has become a cultural infection that is today reflected in our politics (I will leave specific names unmentioned). The good life is not depicted not as one of stability and contentment, of family and community, but of fast living, fancy cars, and $1000 sushi bars, and waltzing through life one-upping the next guy.",/review/rw2554533/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2012,kunmercenario,8," Showtime
","People say this show has a lot of sex, slurs ... who cares? This show is pure Showtime, so, if you like Californication, you will like House of Lies. If you like Downtown Abbey, maybe you will not. Another reason to watch this show is the cast. Don Cheadle is a great actor, and having the possibility of watching him in this kind of show is awesome. No more ""Hotel for Dogs"", Don. And Kristen Bell. Everyone loves Kristen Bell. Natural beauty and great actress. Can't wait to see if both characters end up having some kind of relationship ( aka sex ) We'll see how the plot resumes, but the groundwork is done. Showtime is back. The sex, the slurs are back. Who cares?",/review/rw2554533/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2013,CineCritic2517,1," Obvious and unintelligent
",Cheadle plays a management consultant in a plain and obvious 'comedy' trying to excavate the general bad reputation of the craft. The failing of the show lies obviously in the uninspired writing and complimentary glib nudity that somehow still inspires people to keep watching dross of this particular level. ,/review/rw2554533/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2012,gary89436,9," Cutting-edge comedy, not for the faint of heart
","I almost never write movie reviews, but feel I need to weigh in on this show after seeing it panned by the 1-star prude. I watched the first episode of 'House of Lies' twice after it was highly recommended by a trusted friend. I loved the show, and agree with hanna uzelac on virtually every point.",/review/rw2554533/?ref_=tt_urv
22 April 2020,UniqueParticle,9," Awesome adult comedy/drama series
","Incredible fun all around, surprised I didn't watch sooner! Delightful cast throughout that do business stuff, fool around, and get things done. I love the dialogue quite well written and the parts Don Cheadle breaks the 4th are greatness! I'm gonna enjoy binging House of Lies.",/review/rw2554533/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2012,Slug-3,5," I really want to like this show
","The previews for House of Lies had me excited. It seemed like an interesting topic and it had two actors I enjoy in it (Cheadle and Bell). Unfortunately, it just comes across as a jumbled/jangled mess of unlikable egos, attitudes and greed.",/review/rw2554533/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2012,izmcoolu,10," OK so why is this rated so low?
","I never ever write reviews and honestly this will be my first ever review for a movie or TV show in my entire life lol, that being said I can't even begin to understand why this show is rated so low. This show is the most entertaining show I have seen since ""office"", plus it has all the adult themes that you wished was displayed in ""Office"". No its not a work of art of some yuppy's view of how great television is supposed to be but wow this is just that perfect show for the normal person who still has some sort of pulse left in his veins. I can understand how the older generation would not enjoy this show but it truly is just great mindless fun to watch and enjoy. Once again I never wrote a review before in my life but I just had to after seeing such low ratings, I really hope they don't cancel this show like all the other great shows that was low rated because people are just too uptight in their ideas of proper television. IDK maybe because I don't have grey hair yet or don't pretend to be sitting in a directors chair that I don't understand such low rating. Anyway if you take a regular guys advice, try this show cause it really is the most under rated comedy out there.",/review/rw2554533/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2012,bunnybraids,10," Great show
","House of Lies (stylized as Hou$e of Lie$) is a great new Showtime comedy television series created by Matthew Carnahan. The show is based on the book, House of Lies: How Management Consultants Steal Your Watch and Then Tell You the Time, written by Martin Kihn, a former consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton. It's about a group of management consultants (Cheadle, Bell, Schwartz, Lawson) who stop at nothing to get business deals done, even if it calls for extremes. It's an interesting mix about work and the racy private lives and shenanigans of the characters. The non-PG pilot looks at Cheadle's complicated love life (sex with the ex and, incidentally, also the mother of his gender-neutral son and his professional competition) and self-loathing behaviour (sex with strippers, hurray! and sex with the mother of his son's 'friend' in the school play), while he tries to close a deal with MetroCapital, a bank looking for a plan to unscrupulously justify their year-end bonuses as the financial world around them burns.",/review/rw2554533/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2016,grnhair2001,2," Simply wrong
","I cannot believe that this show puts me in a position where I am going to sound like an apologist for big business. But here I am. I worked as support staff in a management consulting firm . No big management consulting firm has only four people in it... But that's just the first of a thousand factual errors. They do provide a good service. And management consulting professionals are as geeky as any computer geek. They stare at spreadsheets a lot. They actually analyze business financials and use standard accounting principles, and often come up with interesting insights. I worked with a team that help launched the first debit card. Like your ATM card? Thank management consultants. After they understand what is happening by running a bunch of numbers, they create a presentation , and they interact with clients. They do this professionally . Drunkenness and hookers were not a part of this plan, ever. ",/review/rw2554533/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2014,internetuser1655,3," The Ugly Side of Humanity
","My nomination goes to House of Lies for the ugliest cast of characters ever assembled for a television series. Normally I like Don Cheadle but he's totally miscast here as some sort of stud who no woman can resist. On top of that he plays a ruthless scumbag who will lie, cheat, and manipulate everyone around him in order to advance his career. We are too used to him playing good decent people to buy into this Kaan character.",/review/rw2554533/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2013,mailjohnw,4," Looz the two guys and you got show
","Three stars deducted for the very poor ""implementation"" of the two males in the ""team"". Poor writing, and concomitently poor acting, for and by these two superfluousities, drag down the otherwise clever and hip show. Not to forget, various gratuitous, and studiously, uh, inserted, sex scenes. Cheadle is great, as always. But he has to manage to push thru some contrived, manipulative script. They're really gotta milk the kid-is-a-tranny thing. Speaking of, the kid is a very good little actor. He got aplomb. But you know. Characters, generally, must drive a plot, and not be mere mouthpieces for the s o-called jokes, gimmiks, and gags, and that ain't enufly going on here.",/review/rw2554533/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2014,enzopert,5," Nothing special!
",Just finished watching the first season and must admit was pretty glad it was over. For many reasons I just could not really get into this as each episode has the same clichés and over the top acting from the last episodes and far too many stops/lectures along the way. I believe the writers have tried to add too many layers of story to this but unfortunately most of them do not get developed to make the show more appealing. ,/review/rw2554533/?ref_=tt_urv
19 January 2012,politicon2003,1," House of Banal Truth About a Load of Bovine
","House of Lies? Well I have given up after watching one and a half episodes. Funny? In what way. The only funny thing is to wonder why the producers came up with this bovine load! Don't misunderstand me I have nothing per se against sex, nudity and foul language on screen when it's put together in a clever way but this show just hangs on those three features while adding nothing extra. The only thing that might have been worse is that the studio refrained from adding canned laughter, though that is a small mercy. Thanks but no thanks. I think I shall stick with Mad Men and the Good Wife, shows that at least present some intelligent material and plot development. I am not one who insists on empathy with the characters; after all I enjoyed watching the Untergang movie with zero empathy for Adolf Hitler. That is not the point; what is on offer in this show for half an hour a week? We all know that business consultants are full of it in real life and most often they are hired at great expense either to substantiate plans that a firm has already made or to destroy a plan if there is an executive level rivalry going on. In the 1 1/2 episodes I have seen nothing of that cut and thrust action one would expect, As a comedy it sucks, one would do better for laughs with Frazier or even 2 ½ Men. Are we supposed to laugh at the scene of an ex-wife being goosed by her ex-husband in a washroom or at loutish behaviour in a restaurant? Fawlty Towers where art thou? Where are the witty exchanges? Okay some of the reviewers love the show. So be it, live and let live, each to their own taste. For me this is off the list.",/review/rw2554533/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2012,LTSmash14,4," Like Watching an auto tuned song
","I think that the concept behind this show was to give them the old Razzle Dazzle. Every moment raises your heat rate, rushes your blood, And holds your eyes wide open. The up looking angles, the slow motion walking timed to high bass tracks, boobs, the cross marital and sexuality banging, fast cars and D list stars... The cast Is even an averagely funny, pseudo attractive bunch, including an Internet star and an Oscar winner. That said, I have absolutely no idea what this show is about. I think we are just being beaded and feathered. I think the only target audience must be the consultants of the world who want to be motivated back into feelings of bad-assery, but we know that none of them have time for TV, and would be as insulted as I was by the explanation of the word ""Deck."" I just hope that Kristen Bell's strong female character isn't immediately written into a delicate romantic looking for a way to juggle work and motherhood. Oh wait...",/review/rw2554533/?ref_=tt_urv

11 March 2013,hemril,7," Disappointing 2nd season.
","This show was going so well in the first season. It had my votes. But this second season is not worth my time. The writing is all over the place, Marty's wife is nowhere near as spicy as she used to be. And... oh well, the writers messed it up and it is going the way of the dodos. We no longer know what the show is about. I have seen enough. I will not return and this show shouldn't either. Too bad. It had started very well. The characters are supposed to have this interaction, you know, this sexual tension between Marty and and the Jeanny, they keep on reminding us about it at the beginning of every episode that something is going on, but we never get to it. Spit it out! Too much useless stuff around all this. Inspiration has ran out.",/review/rw2554533/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2012,ano-272-401408,8," My new favourite TV show
","This has to be one of the most lewd and rude shows I have ever seen. Push that aside for a tick and discount the machine gun humour that's leaving gaping holes across the corporate back drop in which this is set. Move to the foreground to where I want to dwell. The great mix of self absorbed characters with more hang ups than a normal closet. A dollop of kid dealing with coming out of a closet, or is that his dad and dad's dad that are dealing with it? Those two generations of fathers are definitely not sure how to do the job. Only seen two episodes but I am hooked, line and sinker. Sprinkle the whole thing with a reasonably good support cast. Greg Germann was so good in Episode one, good to see a reprise in next weeks. Kristen Bell is OK as is Ben Swatz & Josh Lawson in full geek mode.",/review/rw2554533/?ref_=tt_urv
17 February 2014,sramv,10," Sharp, biting, fun
","This is a fantastic show. It's caustic but it also has heart. The cast is excellent - Don Cheadle is amazing and the rest of the cast plays off him really well. DC is able to project so much just with a look or a gesture at times. The show is also refreshingly NOT dumbed down. They don't feel the need to explain everything - the viewer is treated as a reasonably intelligent person who is able to put two and two together. Hope the show never loses that! If you are new to it I suggest you start with the excellent pilot and watch through the series sequentially. It really is a serialized dramedy in my opinion, so you get to watch the plots and relationships evolve over time. This has become one of my favourite shows of all time.",/review/rw2554533/?ref_=tt_urv
