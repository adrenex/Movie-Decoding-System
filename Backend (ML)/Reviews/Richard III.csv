5 November 2015,gogoschka-1,7," Not a comedy - but a crazy, violent, suspenseful ride peppered with a healthy dose of black humor
","OK, the first thing you need to know about this film is that it is NOT a stoner comedy; in fact, I wouldn't even call it a comedy. I'm glad I had already read some reviews about this film complaining that the film's marketing campaign was very misleading, so I didn't watch it with the wrong expectations. After the lukewarm reviews, I actually didn't expect anything from American Ultra and I was more or less prepared not to like it â€“ imagine my surprise when I enjoyed it from start to finish.

12 May 2016,brando647,8," A Fun, Flawed, Underrated Action Film with Unlikely Heroes
","American ULTRA is not only one of the most underrated films of 2015 but one of the most unjustifiably detested as well. It was far from perfect, but was it bad enough to warrant a meager 43% score on Rotten Tomatoes? I don't think so. Some of the dialogue landed with a thud and Walton Goggins could've toned it down a bit, but otherwise American ULTRA was a pretty slick little action film. In a year full of spy films, most will forget this little tale of the CIA and experiments gone wrong. Mike Howell (Jesse Eisenberg) is a pothead living in rural West Virginia with his longtime girlfriend Phoebe (Kristen Stewart). He enjoys a peaceful life of smoking weed and working nights at the local general store and his only concerns are the occasional harassment from the local sheriff and crippling panic attacks whenever he tries to leave town. What Mike doesn't know (or, more accurately, doesn't remember) is that he was once part of an experiment with the CIA where he was trained to be the perfect assassin. When the program started showing adverse mental effects on the subjects, the project was closed and Mike, the most successful of the test subjects, had his memory wiped and was given his new life. But now a young CIA upstart (Topher Grace) sees his chance to make a name for himself in the agency and begins a new operation using his own trained killers to eliminate the remnants of the old program.including Mike. It'd be an easy enough mission, if someone hadn't activated Mike's programming to give him a fighting chance.",/review/rw3367947/?ref_=tt_urv

5 January 2020,Tweekums,7," Silly but entertaining, full on action
","Mike Howell is a stoner living in a small West Virginia town with his girlfriend Phoebe Larson. He is hoping to propose to her during a holiday in Hawaii but has a panic attack at the airport... as he does every time he tries to leave town. After this incident he starts to wonder why Phoebe stays with him. We soon learn that he isn't an ordinary young man; he is part of a CIA programme known as 'Wiseman'... he doesn't know it but he is a highly trained super-soldier! Back at CIA headquarters Agent Victoria Lasseter, who headed the programme, is warned that all Wiseman agents are being eliminated by similar 'Tough Guy' agents run by rival agent Adrian Yates. She heads to West Virginia and meets Mike and gives him his activation code... he has no ideas what the words mean but shortly afterwards when he is attacked by two Tough Guys he dispatches them with a spoon! He still has no memory but he knows he must fight for his life to save himself and Phoebe as more agents come to kill him.",/review/rw3367947/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2015,matthewssilverhammer,4," Tonal Mess
","If the new movie American Ultra was half as clever as it seems to think it is, it would be a bawdy treat. The design is extremely stylish and even nobly unique, but underneath those flairs of fun is one of the most identity-confused films ever, a true mess of genres and tones that never quite finds its footing. The cool premise and individual moments of fun can't overcome how poorly executed the final product is. Ultimately, AU is proof that a mash-up of good scenes without a cohesive center does not a good movie make. Eisenberg and Stewart play a pot-loving couple who learn that their lives may be more than they seem as they run into trouble with the CIA. It's Pineapple Express meets Bourne, but can't decide which one it more wants to emulate. At both times absurdly funny and oddly sincere, all the performers seem to be in different movies. On the villain side, we've got Goggins giving a Joker-like performance as a darkly hilarious, mentally disturbed madman, while Grace seems to think he's still on a sitcom, delivering lines with off-putting snark. On the other end, Stewart and Eisenberg fumble between broad comedy and indie drama with little clarity or success blending the two. Not that it's devoid of laughs; it manages some humor when it focuses on the identity crisis of a slacker-turned-trained-killer. Unfortunately, our hero wasn't the only one trying to awkwardly discover himself; so was the movie. What could've been an inventive little comedy ala Scott Pilgrim or Zombieland is an ultra-mess.",/review/rw3367947/?ref_=tt_urv

20 August 2015,Amari-Sali,8," American Ultra may appear like a simple Stoner Action/ Comedy film, but it does progressive get complex as time wears on.
","This movie honestly was surprisingly good. To the point that most of the hate I usually have for Eisenberg, since he seems so pompous in 90% of his roles, has temporarily disappeared. For, like Stewart, we get showed that we cannot fully judge their talents by past characters, and their off-camera persona. But what really drove me to firmly place this in the ""Worth Seeing"" batch is that it hits all the things needed in a film. It is funny, without trying too hard; can get you emotionally invested, because it has lovable characters you want to root for; has a twist or two, which some may or may not guess; and it has a satisfying ending which leaves everything in a nice, neat little bow. Making it so that Adrian, as a character, might be the only true negative about the film since he sucks as a villain.",/review/rw3367947/?ref_=tt_urv

","""American Ultra"" is a thoroughly unpleasant film, cruelly loud, unbearably obnoxious, and convoluted to the point where it breeds indifference amongst its audience. It's marketed as the romantic ""Pineapple Express"" of sorts, boasting the amiable and easily relatable chemistry of Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart, but cacophonous action sequences and a downright stupid plot prevent any kind of humor or remnants of wit to seep through such a lackluster story. For once, a stoner film, and potentially its actors and crew, have gotten so taken by their chemical reinforcement that they forgot to say, create, or do anything funny or insightful.",/review/rw3367947/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2015,anaconda-40658,9," American Ultra-Good.
","American Ultra (2015): Dir: Nima Nourizadeh / Cast: Jesse Eisenberg, Kristen Stewart, Topher Grace, Connie Britton, John Leguizamo: Bizarre and whacked out action comedy that is graphic in its presentation of violence. Jesse Eisenberg plays Mike Howell, a convenient store clerk hoping to propose to his girlfriend. She is Phoebe Larson, played by Kristen Stewart. She is concerned with Mike's panics attacks and constant trips to the police station. Central plot regards the fact that Mike is a special agent whose memory was erased, which plays into his attacks. Connie Britton plays a CIA agent out to warn Howell that he is being targeted for death by her rival, played by Topher Grace who dispatches a group of sleeper agents to terminate Howell. Nima Nourizadeh previously made the mediocre and unfunny Project X. Here he creates just as much chaos but much more originality, particularly during a climax that involves super agents, fireworks, tasers, and a most unusual proposal. Eisenberg plays off the confusion of Mike who, in self defence kills two men using ordinary items. Stewart as Phoebe represents many things to Mike whether it be girlfriend or caretaker but ultimately she proves resourceful. Grace plays the snide and corrupt young CIA agent who authorized this faulty mission. Britton as agent Lasseter unleashes Mike's inner trauma in order to counter Grace's attack. John Leguizamo plays Rose, a tattoo covered drug dealer paranoia friend of Mike's. The violence is extreme and over the top but its theme of government and identity drive this visually innovative catastrophe to a smokey finish. Score: 9 / 10",/review/rw3367947/?ref_=tt_urv

13 January 2019,tabuno,9," A Couragous Blend of Dramatic Action and Comedy
","28 August 2015. There are black comedies (The Whole Nine Yards, 2000; The Matador, 2005, You Kill Me, 2007; Red, 2010) and then there are black comedies (Pulp Fiction, 1994; Daisy & Violet, 2011; and Miss Meadows, 2014). American Ultra is one of the few that directly dare to put insidious murder and light hearted comedy together. Jesse Eisenberg and Kirsten Stewart are given the arduous task of displaying witty humor in the most serious of dramatic obliterations of people. What some audience members might believe to be distasteful making light of the sinister cold-blooded destruction and mayhem on the screen, others might consider to be a bold and risky effort on film to find comedy in the most dire of situations. Taking the movie title (American Ultra) to task which isn't the most marketable of movie titles and which may have been a poor effort to refer to some mysterious, secret American program such as the top secret British Ultra Program during World War II that sought to decode cyphers during the war. Some might debate whether or not some of the fighting scenes might have been better choreographed around Bourne Identity (2002) action, yet for others the more obscure, less precise fighting scenes might also reflect a more real life experience instead. But the end result of American Ultra hopefully for some is a movie that courageously takes a sinister, psychotic but oddly enough narcissistic buffoon villain along with a serious dramatic action plot and laid over the light-hearted romantic yearnings of a small town couple, the male character who is living unbeknownst to him with a very draconian but amazing unique secret. New director Nima Nourizadeh is able to hold the dark drama together with the comedy in creating a most difficult but exhilarating move experience.",/review/rw3367947/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2015,zardoz-13,8," Spies Versus Stoners
","Imagine crisscrossing the amnesia, espionage thriller ""The Bourne Identity"" with the stoner saga ""The Pineapple Express,"" and you've got the nitty-gritty of ""Project X"" director Nima Nourizadeh's ""American Ultra,"" starring Jesse Eisenberg, Kirsten Stewart, John Leguizamo, and Bill Pullman. Although it remains far from original with its formulaic content, this violent, offbeat, 96-minute, R-rated epic delivers one startling surprise after another, not the least of which is the unusual casting of the loquacious, sissified Eisenberg as a weaponized lethal hero. At the same time, ""American Ultra"" reunites Eisenberg with his ""Adventureland"" co-star Kristen Stewart of the ""Twilight"" franchise. Just as Eisenberg plays rough and tumble with blood on his hands, Stewart isn't far behind as an action heroine, too. While Eisenberg kills in self-defense with considerable qualms, he conducts himself at times as if he were imitating Richard Dean Anderson's Angus MacGuyer, wielding everyday objects with devastating ferocity, when he isn't pondering his mysterious memory lapses like Matt Damon's Jason Bourne. Action thrillers don't make the grade unless the heroes and heroines tangle with challenging adversaries. Bad guys Topher Grace and Walton Goggins are appropriately villainous, and ""Independence Day"" actor Bill Pullman shows up briefly as their CIA superior. Director Nima Nourizadeh doesn't let the action slacken for a second. Incidentally, the Eisenberg hero doesn't discover his true identity until about halfway through his nimbly staged thriller. Eisenberg has never pulled off anything as physically assertive as ""American Ultra"" because he lacks the debonair looks of a romantic leading man. Ironically, the fact he doesn't think of himself as an action hero until he finds himself dispatching one heavily armed thug after another makes his performance happily believable. Moviegoers that prefer the indie-styled comedies Eisenberg makes may abhor ""American Ultra,"" while moviegoers who crave melodramatic massacres may loathe Eisenberg's casting.",/review/rw3367947/?ref_=tt_urv

",If I have to be honest I was slightly disappointed by this movie. After reading some reviews I expected a lot more from American Ultra. It's not that it is a bad movie but it for sure is not a movie I will remember. There are too much questions unanswered and too many things that are not very credible. Okay sometimes it doesn't have to be but in this movie I thought it should have and it just wasn't. Apart from Topher Grace all the other actors were good or okay in their roles. But Topher Grace I just can't see him playing anything else then in his That 70's Show. To me he's just not good enough to play anything else.
