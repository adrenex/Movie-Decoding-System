30 August 2006,jessmcrae76,10," Premiership quality
","More plot per episode than can be imagined. Higher cliffs to hang from, thicker glossier makeup, higher heels and hair, flasher cars, brighter clothes. Not much soccer, but you didn't tune in for that purpose presumably. As Tanya Turner Zoe Lucker found a role of enormous power and variety. She lights up the screen in every scene she's in, especially when Jase, both true partner and nemesis, was around. Dragging Joan Collins in for an episode or two was true to the genre but not to the show. You enjoy the gesture only for its trueness to type, not its product.",/review/rw0946552/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2020,MVictorPjinsiste,6," Dazzling Eurotrash
","I just saw a couple of episodes - and I couldn't look away. The actors (All women are scheming vixens while all men are moneymaking lummoxes) aggressively ham it up in their outrageous clothing amidst pricey environments with a background of screaming fans - a cynical, psychotronic critique of our era.",/review/rw0946552/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2004,seannk3,10," Best tv drama EVER!
",Footballers Wives is one of the best television drams to come out of the UK. It started its third series last night and it is still as racey and raunchy as the previous series'. Tanya is still incredible as a Footballers Wife. New arrivals Conrad and Amber Gates keep the show glamorous. Although alot of the original characters have departed to do other things the show is still great with its replacements. No one can beat Tanya and Hazel though. They make the show what it is. Absolutely amazing. I hope this programme goes on for more and more series'. I just love it.,/review/rw0946552/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2006,Paul_A_C,8," The best we've got!
","Sex, glamour, fame, top notch story lines yet so unreal but we can't help loving it. The show has it all. Footballers wives is by far England's most successful, addictive TV drama show. The show is evolved around the lives of several footballers and their wives changing characters and story lines throughout the series.",/review/rw0946552/?ref_=tt_urv

","I love this show like I did when I first watched it when it came out in 02.
It's got everything you want in a show. Good story lines , great characters which the actors chosen portray very well, love, drugs, betrayal, deceit and murder !",/review/rw0946552/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2006,ShadeGrenade,1," A Load Of Old Balls
","Without a doubt the worst decade for British television was the Noughties. We got 'Big Brother', 'Little Britain', 'Celebrity Love Island', 'I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here', 'Celebrity Wrestling', 'Pop Idol', 'Fame Academy', I.T.V.'s ill-fated 'Crossroads' revival, 'Strictly Come Dancing', and 'Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway'. Dreadful shows every one of them. In his novel '1984', George Orwell envisioned a future in which a totalitarian regime brainwashed citizens with trashy novels designed to destroy intelligent thought. He was almost right: for trashy novels read trashy T.V., and there was no better an example of this than 'Footballers' Wives', a train wreck of a series that made 'Neighbours' look like Shakespeare. It centred round a group of...well, footballers' wives who drank, took drugs and slept with every man who crossed their paths. It was surprising that the feminists failed to invade the studio where it was made to pelt the cast with eggs and flour bombs. Perhaps having women in key positions of power on British T.V. nowadays has blinded them to this? 'Footballers' Wives' flopped originally, and it was only when the tabloids came galloping to its rescue with a blitz of coverage did it secure a second season. So now you know who to blame for this cynically-motivated crap. There was even an American version, mercifully brief. On May 3rd 2006, common sense prevailed finally, and it was axed, hopefully never to return.",/review/rw0946552/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2007,judy_floyd,9," Footballers' Wives clearly tops over Footballers' Wives, Overtime
","Footballers' Wives clearly tops over Footballers' Wives, Overtime. The series that captured the audience and kept it was clearly the series that included the Tanya and Jason Turner characters and the entire ensemble during that period which includes the actors as well as the directors. They were all bigger than life. Immediately with the onset of Footballers's Wives, Overtime, something was lost. It just became substandard when compared with the original series. It was predictable and lost it's special edge that kept it exciting but quality. Lost a desire to watch it after the first season of Overtime. Tried, but the spark is not there.",/review/rw0946552/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2004,alanmryan100,," So much fun!
","This is one of the best shows to watch, you don't need to know everything that has happened beforehand to watch and the storyline's aren't very taxing after a long day at work.",/review/rw0946552/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2020,acnlds,6," The nostalgia I need in 2020.
",I was quite young when this was out and I wasn't allowed to watch it however I was obsessed with Bad Girls growing up (even though I shouldn't of been watching that at my age then either lol!) 24 now I decided to give Footballers Wives a go seeing as it's made by the same people as Bad Girls and Tanya even crossed over into the Bad Girls world.,/review/rw0946552/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2005,walfordqueen,," Very good drama
","This show gives a new meaning to the word sensationalism but it's fabulous. The show is so bad that it's funny at the same time with it's colourful characters. The show is bad but in a good way, it certainly provides me with a form of escapism. Tanya Turner played by Zoe Lucker is a super mad bitch who behaves very desperate housewife-esquire and she's just great. She left the series last time though but let's hope that she'll appear in the next one. I think the show isn't as good without the original cast that made it so great but hopefully they'll be able to create a few more characters who prove to be just as successful.",/review/rw0946552/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2004,wombat_1,," Tania (of the players) : ""They are the studs, we are the slags"".
","Yes, Tania, that is indeed what we think. And in all honesty could you blame us? American women in soapies generally look like Barbie dolls; but yes, you and your fellow tarts (men AND women) do indeed look, talk and behave like slags. I had the misfortune of sitting through about half an hour of this crap, and didn't have the stomach for any more.",/review/rw0946552/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2002,stephen2203,," An entertaining drama
","This is an entertaining drama, which is not really going to tax your brain to much. It features the wives of a group of footballers in a fictional Premiership football team.  Story-lines include attempted murder, drug abuse, adoption, adultery and a nurse who has a bit of a fetish for her comatose patients. All slightly far-fetched but so what?? US soap operas like Sunset Beach thrived on this. Real life footballer's wives such as Posh Spice (Mrs David Beckham) have criticized the program for being unrealistic but it does not claim to be a documentary.",/review/rw0946552/?ref_=tt_urv

2 March 2003,GlamourRock,," So unbelievably camp... and that's the appeal!
","I absolutley LOVE footballer's wives!! It may have over the top characters and story lines, but that's why everyone loves it. Unfortunatley series 2 has now finished with a wicked cliffhanger of an ending, but i know that most of the UK can't wait for the third series to start. The guys are all gorgeous and the girl's outfits simply divine... I kinda of have a love- hate relationship with Tanya Turner, but she is definently the most interesting character in the show...",/review/rw0946552/?ref_=tt_urv

5 February 2002,Goldie7662,," Rubbish on a grand scale!
","As this came out of the same stable as the excellent ""Bad Girls"" I was really looking forward to this, their second project. What I expected and what has actually been produced are two entirely different things. As butt clenching bad story-lines go, this has them all. Every tabloid cliche you can think of and some very bad acting which you cannot really blame the actors for as the material they are working with is so awful. It is so bad it will be probably gain cult status in the same way ""Eldorado"" did for the BBC. I should think most footballers wives are either laughing their heads off at this or are mortally offended depending on their ability to take a joke...stick to women behind bars shed not boots!!!!!",/review/rw0946552/?ref_=tt_urv

13 October 2004,adamr-hinchliffe,," filth
","One has to question the mentality of the British people when so many of them tune in daily to the kind of filth we see so often on our screens. Footballers Wives is a classic example of this. It glorifies every aspect of human greed, selfishness and immorality and does not in any way portray the real lives of our sporting heroes (or their spouses) in an accurate or favourable way. Instead it shows these people as nothing more than shallow headed imbeciles who believe wealth and fame is the ticket to eternal happiness. Of course, the real objective of Footballers Wives is not to idolise the lifestyles of the cast, quite the opposite, it is to demonstrate that what they are doing is slowly destroying themselves. Abusing their bodies through excessive drinking and drug-taking and indulging in practically every sexual vice going, will in the end be the destruction of everything they cherish. It is probably worth remembering that most of the people we consider 'celebrities' are no different to ordinary people. They just have a talent to do something good. Either they can sing, dance, act or play sport. But besides this, they are just human like the rest of us. The real heroes and celebrities in this world are the ones who don't seek publicity or wealth. They don't aspire to the vain trappings of a materialistic lifestyle either. Instead, they just live their lives as ordinary decent hard working individuals trying to achieve what is best for themselves and their neighbors.",/review/rw0946552/?ref_=tt_urv
