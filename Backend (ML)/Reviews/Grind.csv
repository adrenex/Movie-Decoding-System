","Take a handsome young ex-hockey star who could never do much other than skate, a prima-donna figure-skater who finds fault with every world-class partner thrown her way and laughs at said ex-hockey star, and an obligatory crazy-genius Soviet expatriate, send them all after Olympic glory, and you have The Cutting Edge.",/review/rw5578790/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2014,A_Different_Drummer,10," Often Imitated, Never Duplicated, PERFECT love story..
","I have lost count of the number of times I have seen this. It is extraordinary in every way, and that is IN SPITE OF the fact that it appears to have been done as a B-movie on a limited budget and with limited expectations. First the story. A bratty young girl raised by her domineering father to win a medal in skating. Nothing new there. But add to the mix the idea that she needs a last-minute partner because she has burned through all the ready talent, and the best candidate appears to be an ex-hockey skater who can no longer play .. and now it starts to get interesting. Then factor in some of the best on-screen chemistry in recent memory ... and presto, before you can say JACK ROBINSON, we are suddenly in the big leagues in spite of the small budget. One of the tightest scripts ever, with a double climax at the end. (To this day, every skating teacher and skating student will break out laughing when you say ""toepick"" with that certain special intonation.) Moira Kelly and D. B. Sweeny give the performances of their lives yet, ASTONISHINGLY, don't even seem to realize it. (They were young and probably thought that bigger and better parts were ahead of them -- but history will show that, unfortunately, did not happen). Succeeds on so many levels -- as a sports story, as story of personal redemption, and absolutely kills as a love story. More recently the Disney people, realizing that they had overlooked this gem, tried to monetize it with some belated sequels, but lightening seldom strikes twice. A one of a kind guilty pleasure, iconic, capable of being watched over and over, a film that never gets old, and never fails to capture the imagination or steal your heart. A perfect ""10."" ------------------------------------------------------------",/review/rw5578790/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2013,SnoopyStyle,7," Good chemistry for a solid rom-com
","It's the 1988 Winter Olympics at Calgary. Doug Dorsey (D.B. Sweeney) is a promising hockey player, but his career is cut short by an eye injury. Kate Moseley (Moira Kelly) is a spoiled temperamental pairs figure skater who goes through every partner. Then 2 years later, Moseley still can't find a partner, and Dorsey can't find a team. Her coach Anton Pamchenko decides to put them together despite their combative relationship.",/review/rw5578790/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2003,MichaelMovieLoft,8," Funny sports film/romantic comedy
","I like this movie. First off, you have underrated actors DB Sweeney and Moira Kelly showing their stuff. It is probably their best film they have made. The chemistry is great between the two. You can tell that when they fly insults at each other. The whole cast does a good job and the scenery is nice. I usually don't like films that use Canada as a backdrop for a US city, but in this case, It does a good job as a replacement for Minnesota and suburban New England.",/review/rw5578790/?ref_=tt_urv

",The Cutting Edge is a classic movie and one which I never get tired of watching.,/review/rw5578790/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2001,moviegal-6,," A great story for all ages
","I was twelve years old when I saw this film.  Then, I thought it was great. Now, at twenty-one, I think it's awesome.  Some may criticize the ""inaccuracies"" of the skating, but if one looks closely at the credits, world renowned skater Robin Cousins is the technical advisor and skating scene coordinator.  Also, the pairs skaters they compete against are also, as far as I can tell, are real skaters.  While they probably wouldn't jump into major competitions right away, they did it this way most likely for timesake.  It's a sweet love story that is refreshingly free of violence (save the occasional slapshot), gratutious sex, and vulgar language.  It is a delight for young and old combining chemestry, believability, and awesome skating sequences.  I give it a nine and a half out of ten; if for nothing else, then for the warm fuzzies you get from watching it.",/review/rw5578790/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2018,joppanLive,9," Must watch Romantic Movie
","I never said a romantic movie ""must watch"" before. But this one is really something special. ""The Cutting Edge"" may not have an interesting story or plot twist offered by movies of the same genre. It has a very simple story which was portrayed in a very simple manner. Still this movie succeeds in winning the my heart. Thanks to Moira Kelly for it. The character ""Kate Mosley"" was safe with Moira and she immersed into it with extreme perfection. The chemistry between Kate and Doug was heart-warming and it uplifts this movie into a different level. I would recommend this movie to everyone and promise you from my heart that it never disappoints.",/review/rw5578790/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 1999,ivana-7,10," a classic
",This is one of those movies that show that you don't have to have special effects or lots of money for a movie to be great. This is like a movie from 1940s in which acting is the main factor.,/review/rw5578790/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2002,gouge_away,10," Most underrated film of all time.
","To those who may not have had the pleasure of viewing this film yet, here is a warning: it is addictive.  As others have commented, the Cutting Edge has a rare quality of becoming more watchable with each additional session. The word session as just used is appropriate because this movie is pure therapy. One can only hope that actors Kelly and Sweeney can be brought together again to forge another hit.",/review/rw5578790/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2006,holygallery,9," I thought I was alone
","WOW, I always thought I was strange for watching this movie 14 times in one day when I was 16. I have a feeling most of you are women, I'm a man and I think this movie is one of the best Rom/Com I've EVER seen. Never mind the fact that it's pretty much an adaptation of Shakespeare's""Taming of the Shrew"" The chemistry is spot on between the cast. There was a girl like Kate's character that I was madly in love with at the age of 16. We bickered just like the two leads of this film. This film was my ""light and the end of the tunnel"". Alas, it was not to be. When I finally confessed, my best friend told me ""Never..."" Why can't life be like the movies.....",/review/rw5578790/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2009,imdb-21622,7," Surprisingly good for a formula movie
","OK, so the plot is formulaic. There is nothing new here, really. Or is there? I have seen this movie a few times, and always liked it. I think it's the acting and dialog.",/review/rw5578790/?ref_=tt_urv
3 March 2005,PBakerTX,10," Excellent Coming of Age Romantic Comedy
","I found this movie very enjoyable to watch. The chemistry between Moira Kelly and D.B. Sweeney is very realistic. Even their arguments with one another appears genuine. Each of them wounded from previous experiences, not willing to open up to one another. All of this taking place in a point in their lives where they are each struggling to find something more out of life and end up discovering themselves and one another. Eventually, taking both of them beyond the quest of a gold medal.",/review/rw5578790/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2010,jasarthur,10," A beautiful film with Sweeney & Kelly's best work of their careers
","First off, for all those critics who claim this is a chick flick, I'm a guy and I love this movie. I watched the VHS with my kids when it was newly released, and just watched the DVD a couple days ago, getting a lot out of the special features. Especially enlightening are the commentaries by the main actors done in 2006. The overall rating of 6.5 on IMDb is sadly warped by the careless railings of a few hacks who gave it unfairly negative reviews. It deserves much better. Fighting Amish (not his real username) gave it a 1/10 but his comments lacked any substantial critique, focusing only on how much his girlfriend liked it...and then he wonders why he's no longer with her! A movie made with so much care and artistry should not be casually trashed by someone with emotional issues.",/review/rw5578790/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2004,Letyezaoblaka,," Favorite Film of All Time
","As a figure skater, my movie choices of my profession are rather limited. If you take out Ronin, in which Katarina Witt is shot, Ice Castle, which I hated, the Cutting Edge is practically the only one left. I loved it. Sure the movie wasn't realistic, but it was good none the less. Wholesome and the skating sequences weren't bad. I loved the Pamchenko. My parter and I even attempted it a few times. Overall, definitely watch this if you are a fan of skating or just have an afternoon to watch a movie. I've seen it more than 20 times...this movie is timeless. My coach plays clips from this movie to us when we are waiting for our turn to compete and even at the celebration parties. I love it.",/review/rw5578790/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2006,medic249a2,9," One of the best....
","This makes great watching even 14 years after it was made! The story is well written and the characters are at least believable. I can't imagine what the logistics of making this must have been like, since camera angles would have been used not only to 'disguise' the skating doubles but also show the footwork that led to complicated moves such as the jumps, lifts & throws.",/review/rw5578790/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2020,Calicodreamin,10," Amazing
","One of my all time favorites, the cutting edge is the perfect rom com. The plot itself is simple enough, the acting pretty good, and the chemistry between Sweeney and Kelly is unmistakable. The banter throughout is funny and makes this movie. The romcom ending is picture perfect.",/review/rw5578790/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2005,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,10," Sweet, charming, hilarious, touching, and heartwarming romantic comedy
","THE CUTTING EDGE, in my opinion, is a sweet, charming, hilarious, touching, and heartwarming romantic comedy. As far as I could see, Kate (Moira Kelly) was an absolute b**** most of the time! This was because of her attitude and the way she treated Doug (D.B. Sweeney) most of the time. Still, if you ask me, they made a really cute couple. I especially loved it when they were going out on their dates together with each other and getting along. Before I wrap this up, I must say that everyone involved in this movie did an excellent job. Now, in conclusion, to all you D.B. Sweeney or Moira Kelly fans who have not seen this sweet, charming, hilarious, touching, and heartwarming romantic comedy, I highly recommend it!",/review/rw5578790/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2006,Shirin-3,9," Leaves one feeling good
","I first saw this movie as a teen at the movies, and although it follows the tried and true formula of a romantic comedy, the charisma and chemistry between the two lead actors is what sets apart this movie and makes it memorable. Such a movie only works when you start caring about the characters and are rooting for their happy ending - and in that feat, this movie succeeds. The basic premise is of a promising hockey player who is paired with a partner-needing figure skater. The film works on their ""repressed"" tensions and relationship conflicts both on and off the ice - which they eventually succeed in melting. For those too elitist in their taste in intellectual occupation, you don't have to admit you enjoyed this flick - but I don't think you'll regret the interlude. Have fun - the actors looked like they did.",/review/rw5578790/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2013,lisafordeay,7," Saw this on MGM a month ago very good.
","I didn't catch the very beginning of it but I seen most of this movie. The story is about this guy played by DB Sweeney (who was in that 2000 animated film Dinosaur as the voice of that dinosaur in that movie)who's a former hockey player who had some sort of accident meaning he can't play Hockey anymore. So he decides to try something else which is(yup) Ice skating,where he meets and later falls for a girl played by Moira Kelly(who was in One Tree Hill and The Lion King). Problem is she's getting married so there's a will they won't they scenario going on.",/review/rw5578790/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2005,jcdavis33,10," It touches me even now.
",I watch this movie over and over again. It drives my daughter crazy but she just laughs and walks away from me. The setting is great due to my love of skating which I have done in small measure my whole life. The father and coach seemed so real to me and very much a part of the support system for the two younger actors in the movie.To me the movie is well constructed and acted. The characters appear real to me and take me on their journey of life as well. I did fall in love with Doug Dorsey and I do hope he is doing well now. I wish to thank and creator of this movie and the director for bringing out the best in the members of the cast. It is a classic to me.,/review/rw5578790/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2006,martini1421,10," Passionate
","I think Moira Kelly is astounding in this movie. I believe she is one of the most underrated actress's of our time. Her chemistry and emotion with D.B. Sweeney is incredibly passionate. They act with such intensity you start to believe it's really happening.At the beginning you see how ""icey"" Kate is. But as the movie progresses and her relationship with Doug starts to bloom she starts showing more emotion. You start to see the real Kate Mosley, not an uptight ice queen. Doug brings out the best and worst in her. And he's right, ""Don't say we're not right for each other because the way i see it we may not be right for anyone else."" I think this movie is so romantic and it's like it's a reality t.v. show. To me it just seems that real. Their Passion and love seems that real.",/review/rw5578790/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2004,imbunny2,10," Loved it, loved it..
","I thought this was the cutest movie I've seen in a long time. I had heard about it before, but never seen it until this week. Boy was I missing a good time. I enjoyed the playful banter between the two main characters. I especially enjoyed the scene where they were playing hockey. What a hoot. His continual baiting of her was adorable. Of course I think that these two actors have been seriously over looked for some good roles. I believe that both D.B. Sweeney and Moira Kelly could have played the romantic leads in several films that went to other actors. We have such a shortage of romantic comedies, we need more of the electricity you could feel between these two. If that was acting it was GREAT. I also think that Paul Michael Glaser showed promise as a director. He made me feel very connected to the characters in the movie and very much wrapped up in their struggles.",/review/rw5578790/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2020,ricklb-43546,10," The perfect love skate relationship!
","I love to skate but I hate to fall down, kind of like the romance that builds the entire movie. Such good casting D.B. and Moira are perfect fits. It's romantic, playful, competitive, nostalgic, funny and a movie I'll watch again and again!",/review/rw5578790/?ref_=tt_urv
