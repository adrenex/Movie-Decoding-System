19 November 2006,dfranzen70,8," Feets don't fail me now!
","Happy Feet, directed by the man who gave us both Babe: Pig in the City and Mad Max, is just the kind of feel-good animated film that works on a few different levels; it'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry, and it'll inevitably, unquestionably, make you tap your toes or bounce your leg, right there in the theater. It's charming and exquisitely detailed, and it succeeds where it really counts: It makes you really feel for the lovable lead penguin, Mumble (voiced by Elijah Wood).",/review/rw2006747/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2006,jdesando,," Happy Film
",Tap-dancing penguins could never have been pitched if the mega-hit doc Marching Penguins (2005) had not caught the imagination of every breathing human. Only this time around Happy Feet is not a doc but a high-class animation (from the director of the very humane Babe) and much more anthropomorphic than Marching Penguins because these are tap-dancing penguins.,/review/rw2006747/?ref_=tt_urv

10 November 2006,BigMez,7," A Mythic Penguin Tale
","I saw this last weekend at a special screening and was suitably impressed. Although I'm a big fan of George Miller's films, I was very hesitant to see this one. I'm not a big fan of animated films, much less musicals. The trailers looked awful and indicated nothing about the story. Until the screening came up, I had no intention of seeing this on the big screen. After the opening musical number, the movie quickly won me over. The way it's made is incredibly cinematic, and, at its heart, tells a great mythic story: an outcast leaves his community and journeys to the edge of the world to find a way to end the famine that's plaguing his species. Along this quest, our hero, Mumble, learns to live with his outsider status (he can't sing) and makes use of his own particular gift (tap dancing). It's a simple story that's told in a very creative way with a lot of heart. ",/review/rw2006747/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2008,vip_ebriega,10," A beautifully charming, yet also surprisingly smart animated entertainment.

21 December 2006,Flagrant-Baronessa,7," A well-translated 'individual vs. society' romp
","Animated comedies have become what Mike Tyson was to the boxing scene in the 1980's: a safe bet. This begs an upsurge in quality for the market and the otherwise forgettable family fluff films have begun to interweave deeper, more salient issues in their stories. Political messages about environmental problems was perhaps the last thing I expected to find rotating around in a happy, tappy romp like 'Happy Feet' but the fact is they are there, and they are superbly handled, as is much of the film.",/review/rw2006747/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2007,pgear83,10," A Joyful Masterpiece
","George Miller's Happy Feet is an exuberant, beautifully animated film and, by a wide margin, the best CG film ever made. The photo-realistic characters and Antarctic landscapes provide the backdrop for a story of brilliant originality. The film's plot is somewhat based in reality - but with a surreal twist. The movie is a spectacular jukebox musical in which Emperor penguins serenade each other with songs from some of the royalty of music (Queen, Prince, ""The King"" Elvis Presley) in order to find a mate. One penguin, Mumble, cannot sing but expresses himself through tap-dancing. For this abnormality, he is ostracized by his fellows, blamed for the misfortune of famine and eventually banished from his home. He then goes on a perilous quest to find answers that are not otherwise forthcoming.",/review/rw2006747/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2013,Stompgal_87,8," A realistic and stunning film with a valuable environmental message
","I first saw this film with a staff member from my former care home when it came out in 2006 and we both enjoyed it. I watched this again today when I rented it after having already rented 'Happy Feet Two,' which is just as good with some parts better than others.",/review/rw2006747/?ref_=tt_urv

23 November 2006,joesgirljeri,1," most bizarre children's movie I've ever seen
",I gave this movie a 2 because it was interesting to look at; one of the most spectacular CGI films I've ever seen. That was worth about 5 minutes of my time. The rest of the film was a complete waste.,/review/rw2006747/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2006,yegdad,7," A visual masterpiece.
","This movie set the bar at a new level for animation. This is a great companion piece to ""March of the Penguins"". (In fact, you should see ""March of the Penguins"" before seeing this one.) While the stock animated movie script still seems be 'cute-yet-quirky animals on quest', this one pulls it off better than most.",/review/rw2006747/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 2007,onionhead101,10," Baby uh-huh, it DOES work
","I am 44 years old, and I am actually looking forward to this film's upcoming DVD release more than my children. As a victim of childhood taunts due to birth defects, I side with Mumble and his pain as the other young birds mock his differences. When Gloria's heart song Boogie Wonderland is finally answered by Mumble's feet song, the rest of his young Emperor sisters and brothers break into dance with him, embracing him, chanting his name in joyful unison--simply stirring. To anyone who has been ridiculed or spat upon, it is a moment of sheer triumph. I can't remember feeling this good about any other film in recent years. Beautifully animated and acted, this is a joy.",/review/rw2006747/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2006,ela-heyn,6," First half is much better than the second
","Overall, I enjoyed this movie and don't regret having gone to see it. I feel like the animators, actors doing voices and Savion Glover (hope I spelled that right!) wasted some of their efforts on an inferior-quality script.",/review/rw2006747/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2009,TheLittleSongbird,8," Boy can that penguin tap!
","Ever since I was a little girl I had an obsession with penguins. I couldn't help it, I thought they were so fascinating and cute. And you know what, I still do. Happy Feet was a film I really wanted to see, and after finally seeing it, I really liked it. It is a shame though that the plot is as thin as a block of ice and the ending is too abrupt and preachy. Other than that, contrary to some of the negative comments, it is a good film. The animation is dazzling; the backgrounds are colourful and the character movements are excellent. The music by John Powell was memorable and fun. Sometimes it brought a sense of fun, sometimes it even enhanced the drama. The characters are endearing. Mumble when he was a child was adorable, and Gloria is a beautiful penguin with a lovely voice. The dancing is a wonder, boy can Mumble tap. I didn't care that Mumble was different from the others, he had a talent of his own and made good use of it. The voice acting is impressive. I don't care for Elijah Wood but he does a good job as Mumble, and Robin Williams is especially funny as Ramon and Lovelace. Brittany Murphy is sweet as Gloria, but I was shocked that Nicole Kidman voiced Norma Jean. All in all, good film, nice premise, lovely animation and music. Shame it crashes down in the final twenty minutes. 8/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw2006747/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2006,I_amindeed,10," This was a great film for all ages
",Finally saw this on Sunday when it previewed in the UK (out on full release Friday). The cinema was packed with kids ranging from babies to teenagers. Our group had kids from 3-15 in it as well as the parents. We all absolutely loved it; what I thought was so good was that the kids in the party all reacted according to their ages. The little ones just thought the penguins were cute and the chase scenes etc were thrilling. But the older ones thought the film had a deeper message and really enjoyed it.,/review/rw2006747/?ref_=tt_urv
6 December 2006,silalus,10," Breathtaking and Beautiful
","Happy Feet begins by introducing us to an achingly beautiful world and then takes us on an extraordinary hero's journey filled with laughter, tears, and unconditional love. It is a rare modern epic that goes far beyond the scope of most recent movies, family or otherwise, with amazing visuals, wonderful music, and simple but meaningful themes. Be warned: you might actually find yourself responding to this film on an emotional level that could be a little embarrassing. You might leave dancing- or simply breathless.",/review/rw2006747/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2006,LawrenceOfAlabama,9," March of the Penguins, err... PIXELS
","Happy Feet, the newest in the CGI rendered films, features the voice talents of Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman, and Robin Williams. (Seems Williams is in every other animated fare thats released) Billed talent aside, it's the music that makes Happy Feet a visually stunning/tap your feet spectacle.",/review/rw2006747/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2006,crowhawk60,9," Impressive, Expressive and Delightful for all ages
","Rarely do I enjoy animated films these days: I find the animation (mostly computer generated) to be colorful but banal, and the action angles are selected by the programmer's eye, not the way a natural observer would have seen the shot (like we saw in classic cell animation of years past). ""Happy Feet"" is different. The combination of rotoscoping (now advanced motion capture), intense attention to detail and organic POV make this film extraordinarily enjoyable to watch. The sound quality was top-notch, and the music loads of fun for anyone with a pulse. The character voices from Robin Williams, Elijah Wood, Hugh Jackman, and others was perfectly matched to their characterizations. Savion Glover's performance as Mumble's ecstatic feet was not only good as a an animated fanciful Emperor Penguin, but also valid as a fine, skilled tap dancer; one of the finest. The continuity was good, impressive editing, and the message clear: celebrate our differences, adapt to change when necessary, and don't be afraid to take on challenges, even when they seems insurmountable. That's a great message for anyone at any age.",/review/rw2006747/?ref_=tt_urv

1 September 2018,nairtejas,7," One-Line Review: Happy Feet (7 Stars)
","Other than the flippity-flappity of the lead lovable character it is the subtle references to the ignorant human intervention in nature's food cycle that elevates George Miller's Happy Feet into a superior film, way above the other similar films in its genre, ultimately making you tear up regardless of your eating/entertainment choices.

21 May 2007,leighabc123,1," This Was Not A Good Movie!
","Yes. There was a lot of singing and great 3D animation. But the entire plot of this movie was horrible! A father penguin drops his egg son. The son cannot sing like the other penguins. But he can dance. The son penguin loves another female penguin who can sing well. They end up together. But before this happens, he gets advice and helps out a know it all bird named Lovelace. There is so much going on in this movie and too many serious messages for a child's movie. But if you get the DVD, you can see the entire 1936 cartoon, I Love To Singa. There are actually clips of this shown during the movie ""Looney Tunes. Back In Action."" Now I give that cartoon 10 stars!",/review/rw2006747/?ref_=tt_urv
5 April 2019,punch_p,10," The visuals in Happy Feet are absolutely amazing.
","Parables about xenophobia, tolerance, religion and ecological responsibility are played to cuddly conclusions. Balletic underwater sequences and a jukebox-musical soundtrack spanning Chicago to Grandmaster Flash are spoonfuls of sugar for the medicine.",/review/rw2006747/?ref_=tt_urv

3 May 2019,Hitchcoc,8," Cute
","Lacking the heartsong, the little guy must find a way to find true love. When one is an outsider, it is often part of the blame game to pick on that one, even if the charges are irrational. But the early short that introduced us to these dancing penguins, set up a full-length story, and here we are. The animation is excellent and the snappy song and dance is very nice.",/review/rw2006747/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2009,Chrysanthepop,," Bad Vocals But Happy Feet
","Happy Feet' is a delightfully cheerful little movie about an emperor penguin who has an unappreciated gift of tap dancing and his inability to sing causes others to look down upon him. While the penguins suffer from food shortage, he aims to rescue the fish that serves as their daily meal. The animation is excellent. Very few such CGI animated films have looked so real to me but in 'Happy Feet' it is almost hard to tell. The characters are fun (though a little out of place and unnecessary at times). The voice-casting is great with Robin Williams and the Hispanic adelaides stealing the show. Nicole Kidman lends her beautiful voice as the loving mother while Hugh Jackman's dad character is a little clichÃ©d. Elijah Wood and Brittany Murphy are annoying but you get used to it. The story could have been better developed as there are a few plot holes now and then and the ending is a little too optimistic, too unrealistic and too abrupt. 'Happy Feet' is meant to be a family film but it could have been a stronger movie and at the same time remains enjoyable to the family had the story been given a little more focus. There are a range of songs, most of which are popular numbers. Even though the visualizations were fun to watch, they were at times distracting and deviating from the main plot. Yet, 'Happy Feet' was still an entertaining flick and it had that adventurous feel. There was not one boring moment and the viewers wonder how Mumble will rescue the fish from being stolen (I just wished that the conclusion was done differently).",/review/rw2006747/?ref_=tt_urv
