7 August 2011,MovieAddict2016,8," Against all odds, this must be the best ""blockbuster"" I've seen all summer.
","Summer 2011 will go down in history as one of the more disappointing seasons in many years when it comes to movies. This is the time of year that people rush out in masses to see the latest action extravaganza, and to be fair, some films have delivered on that promise -- ""Harry Potter,"" ""Captain America"" (though I have yet to see either of them and am simply relying on general reactions) -- but there's been a whole lot of disappointments, too, and the worst part is that people still seem to be flocking to them, almost out of necessity than wont (""Transformers 3"" and ""Pirates 4"" both made over $1 bil worldwide, which is amazing, because they both sucked).",/review/rw3226606/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2011,Movie_Muse_Reviews,8," These apes rise not only in style, but also in substance
","The one thing that always made the ""Planet of the Apes"" a bit campy was actors in make up and monkey suits. So in one instance, here's where technology, specifically the use motion- capture technology as seen in ""Avatar,"" can almost single-handedly justify revisiting an old franchise. But the apes of ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" don't just look amazing — they have souls. So does this script, which delivers one of the summer's biggest surprises in terms of pure entertainment and depth of storytelling.",/review/rw3226606/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2011,Dragonsouls,9," The most emotional Planet of the Apes film.
","To sum it up, a very powerful film falling just short of being a masterpiece. However, the only flaw in the film is that the film could have been just a bit longer! I am really hoping for a director's cut because there should have been a few more character development scenes between father and son, boyfriend and girlfriend, and even Ape and Human. I felt the movie was paced a bit too quickly but nevertheless, still contains very fleshed out characters driven by excellent performances throughout, from Lithgow, to Franco, to Cox and especially by Andy Serkis.",/review/rw3226606/?ref_=tt_urv
11 August 2011,CinemaPat,9," Apes Will Rise!!
","Disaster movies are a dime a dozen now a days. We have seen an influx of Alien takeovers recently and it is getting a bit stale I must admit. Don't get me wrong, I love films about ET's taking over, but Hollywood has beaten that horse to death. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is a welcome change to this trend pitting us measly humans against our closest ancestors, Great Apes. Directed by Rupert Wyatt (""The Escapist"") and supported by the unbelievable WETA Digital (""King Kong"", ""Lord of the Rings"", ""Avatar"") for special effects. ""Apes"" is a wonder of motion capture, an intelligent heart felt script with great direction. Unfortunately, the human actors left a lot to be desired. But this film isn't about the humans, it's all about the Simians.",/review/rw3226606/?ref_=tt_urv
2 August 2011,Loving_Silence,8," Wow It's actually a great movie!
","I had extremely low expectations for Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011). I loved the original 1968 classic, but every sequel/remake after it sucked. I was surprised they were going to make a prequel of the classic and I thought it was a good idea. But still after so many bad sequels and remakes, I still had my big doubts. Also I didn't like how the monkeys were made by CGI/Special Effects, why not use a robotic monkey or a real one, it would look more real.",/review/rw3226606/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2011,blackmambamark,9," Hands down, the best summer movie of 2011
","Of all the movies that can possibly be re-booted......why reboot another movie that's already been re-booted? And of all the projects that the Weta team can possibly tackle, why this one? Well it must be the script, because everyone that's come across it has wanted to be somewhat involved. Hopefully it lives up to the expectations that are already in place, because i don't think i could handle another stink bomb like Burton's version.",/review/rw3226606/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2011,FanPerspective,," Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a thought provoking and emotionally driven thrill ride!
","If you're like me, you will be completely fascinated by the story of this film. I'm a big fan of Planet of the Apes and to get to see its origins is really great. Out of the entire series of movies, I think this one truly is the best. It was just absolutely spectacular! The actors delivered fine performances for their well developed characters; the writers, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, didn't miss a beat with their fantastic and intelligent script; and the story was compelling, exciting and emotionally touching.",/review/rw3226606/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2011,Lodewickus,8," More than expected
","There are so many things right about this movie, the little things that are wrong are easily forgiven. Some slight plot holes, but the film and characters make up for it. The chemistry between Franco and Pinto is weak, however Franco plays his part. Lithgow is always a great asset to any production, and does a great job here.",/review/rw3226606/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2012,ma-cortes,7," Intense and exciting film great visual effects by means of Motion Capture technology
","Dramatic as well as spectacular film in which simians undergo a rebellion against humans and winding up at a climatic final . 7th movie in the series based on Pierre Boulle novel initiated by ¨Planet of Apes¨ that at time of its release regarded as the most extraordinary Scifi in years. It deals with Caesar (Andy Serkis , this is the second film in which Andy Serkis plays an ape, having previously portrayed 2005's version of King Kong and he was also the motion capture actor for Gollum in Lord of the Rings), a Chimpanzee raised like a child by the drug's creator, Will Rodman (James Franco ,Tobey Maguire was considered for the role) and a Primatologist Caroline Aranha (Freida Pinto) . Will is desperately looking for a cure for Alzheimer's disease that suffers his father (John Lightow). Rodman gives a substance Caesar, designed to help the brain repair itself , as Evolution Becomes Revolution . The chimpanzee gains human-like intelligence and emotions from an experimental drug that gives rise to a super-intelligent chimp who leads an ape uprising . Later on , Caesar is locked at a zoo and seeking justice for his fellow primates , as they carry out a riot in which simians turn the tables . Meantime , lots of simians , Chimpanzees , gorillas murder violently every human in sight . At the ending happens a spectacular , fierce confrontation between a human army and the simians commanded by Caesar . Caesar leads an animal revolt against his human captors and mankind in which humans battle the apes led by the intelligent ape.",/review/rw3226606/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2011,cuppa_tetleys,9," Summer 2011: A season blessed with brilliant prequels
","To begin on a tangent before evaluating the film, before summer 2011, I had not seen a decent prequel film. Prequels to films are often made when there is either a rich back story behind the originals or the producers are wanting a little more money from a particular franchise (see the Star Wars prequels). The problem they present is that film- makers have to construct their work, with the knowledge that the audience knows how it ends. One of the greatest things about seeing a film for the first time is the surprise and anticipation, to removing that can detract a lot from the overall impact of the film. But this summer I have had the pleasure of seeing X-men First Class, and now Rise of the Planet of the Apes - two excellent prequels to series that I didn't care for previously.",/review/rw3226606/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2011,michael-colan,8," The Best Planet of the Apes film since the original
",There was a lot of hype going into this film. I was very excited to finally see another Planet of the Apes film. I am a big fan of the original and had fun with the sequels and even after Tim Burton's remake I was still excited for this film and I got to say this is the best Planet of the Apes picture since the original.,/review/rw3226606/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2015,williampsamuel,7," ""Rise"" is surprisingly good summer entertainment
","When Rise of the Planet of the Apes was announced, expectations were not high. As a prequel to an awful remake of a movie that wasn't exactly an all time classic, its pedigree was sketchy to say the least. Thus came as a shock to nearly everyone when it became one of the biggest summer hits of the. Rise wasn't just watchable, or even pretty good; it's one of the best ""B"" movies of recent, entertaining and surprisingly human.",/review/rw3226606/?ref_=tt_urv

19 July 2014,Theo Robertson,5," Give Enough Chimps Enough Typewriters And They Could Write A Better Screenplay
",I've no idea how I managed to miss RISE . It came out three years ago and I recall it going on my watch it when it comes out on DVD list but never got round to it for some reason . Now that the sequel DAWN has opened to almost universal praise it's very timely that Channel 4 decided to give it its British TV network broadcast . I saw the trailers on channel 4 last week and made sure I wasn't going to miss it and if I enjoyed this film I might just go out of my way and spend money watching the sequel in the cinema . Hmmmm . After seeing RISE it looks like I've just saved myself the price of a bus ride and a cinema ticket ,/review/rw3226606/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2014,ironhorse_iv,8," All Hail Caesar! Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a good movie!
","It's pretty hard to beat the original 1968's Planet of the Apes, but Rise of the Planet of Apes was just as entertaining as the original. Directed by Rupert Wyatt, its story is similar to the fourth film in the original series, 1972's Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, but it is not a direct remake in that it does not fit into that series' continuity. This movie was intended to act as an origin story for a new series of films. Anybody looking for armor men in ape make up capturing astronauts might want to look somewhere else. The movie is about Will Rodman (James Franco) a scientist at biotechnology lab testing viral-based drug on chimpanzees to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease. Will's boss Steven Jacobs (David Oyelowo) terminates the project when things don't go right, and orders the chimps euthanize. Will unable to kill a baby chimp life, save the baby by taking him home; calling him Caesar (Andy Serkis). At the same time, Will's father Charles (John Lithgow), is suffering Alzheimer's disease. After seeing, that Caesar (Andy Serkis) has inherited his mother's high intelligence due to the years of drug testing, Will thinks that his father Charles might be restored to better-than-original cognitive ability if he tested a new drug on him. Things go horrible wrong for Will, as the new drug take a negative effect on the humans. Mid while, Caesar grow smarter every day, questioning the horrible mistreated of apes as test subjects. Seeing the drug as a way out of their caged environment, Caesar use it to raise an army against humanity and on their quest to freedom. Unlike the original movie, in this movie, you have no choice, but to root for the apes. The way they presented it, remind me more of another Charlton Henson movie, 1956's The Ten Commandments. You really go through the mind of Caesar in this film. He is loosely based on the Caesar AKA Milo character from 1971's Escape from the Planet of the Apes, Conquest of the Planet of the Apes and 1973's Battle for the Planet of the Apes of the original series. Not only is Andy Serkis, one of the best CGI model motion capture actors of all times, he gives one hell of a performance as Caesar with his use of body language. The scene where Caesar is pressed against his draw up window wall at the primate shelter is heart breaking. In particular, Caesar's treatment at the primate sanctuary parallels Taylor's treatment as a captive in the original film to the point, you root him as the hero. You slowly see him as a sympathy character that is treated cruelly by the other chimps and the chief guard, Dodge (Tom Felton) because of his intelligent to a commanding alpha male looking for united the apes on their march to freedom. The visuals and special effects are great. The CGI apes truly look like apes, but some of their body actions during the action scenes can be bit questionable. Also the speed of the intelligent effects of the drugs on apes seem to be too quick at times. In a few hours, some of them master the art of modern warfare despite none of the apes being expose to that. It's a bit odd that the zoo animals know what even going on, when they haven't been expose to the gas yet. There are lot of Easter eggs or hints to the original movie in the names of the ape and the human characters. Maurice (Karin Konoval), Rocket and Bright Eyes (both play by Terry Notary), and Buck (Richard Ridings), are names of people that work on the film. Also look for the Charlton Henson's cameo in this movie. For the original film fans, look out for the Icarus mission in the background and listen to all the one-liners, as some are coming from the original film. The human characters acting are good, but blended. Even David Oyelowo's character seem more like a stereotype caricature of a greedy CEO than a real person. Does it have animal rights anti-animal testing message that PETA would love? Yes, but it also show why animal testing is very important to us, as well. If not, by testing animals first, we could unleashed negative effects on human like the film shows. There is a lot of symbolism in this film. Example is like Caesar uses a bundle of sticks to explain to Maurice how an ape alone is weak but apes together are strong. There is a great shot that represented this. The 4 leaders of the ape rebellion are shown standing upright on the roof of a trolley car. Their upright posture and the ascent give metaphoric connotation to the film's title as all of them representation of the 4 different dominant ape species (Chimpanzee, Orangutan, Gorilla, and Bonobo) united. Thus the bundle of sticks, or fasces, was a symbol of authority in ancient Rome, the origin of Caesar's name. It's a fascism statement that get even more chilling when you think of the Coba character. Coba is often known as the code word for Joseph Stalin. This movie mirrors a lot of George Orwell's Animal Farm with its allegoric politic message. The ending was a bit disappointing as there is no big twist like the original. It was pretty predictable. If you saw the trailer, you saw the picture. Nothing new by the end. At less, its post credit set up the sequel 2014's Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. Overall: there is some minor mistakes, but it's a good film. I would gladly pay to see its sequel.",/review/rw3226606/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2012,Smells_Like_Cheese,10," Time to shock the monkey!
","Planet of the Apes is a classic film that a lot of people at least know about if they haven't seen it, you know the lines and certain scenes. It was a terrific sci-fi movie that made a break through for twist endings. Tim Burton remade the movie with Mark Wahlberg and it was just horrible, you would think that it was the closing chapter in the Planet of the Apes series. But then Rise of the Planet of the Apes came along and when I saw the trailer, I was just like ""here we go again"". Thinking that it was going to be a horrible movie and that they just wouldn't let the series rest in peace. But instead I have to say that I was one hundred percent wrong, I watched this movie last night and was just totally blown away. It's a prequel not trying to up the original by any means and the special effects are actually done very well. Not only that but the actors are all great who bring a lot of character to the film and gave us a reason to almost vote for the apes to take over the planet.",/review/rw3226606/?ref_=tt_urv

12 September 2011,tomgillespie2002,7," As much as you could hope from a blockbuster
","Back in 2001, everything was in place to re-launch a much-loved, yet dated franchise, that was first kicked off way back in 1968 with Planet of the Apes. The mythology was already laid out, and was ripe to be adjusted, experimented with, and ultimately improved upon. The re-make had an interesting (if overrated) director in Tim Burton, who had made a bona fide classic with Edward Scissorhands and the fantastic and lovingly-rendered Ed Wood. In came up-and-coming A-lister Mark Wahlberg who had impressed in Boogie Nights and Three Kings, and great support in Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter. Then the film came out. And it was s**t. And worst of all it didn't make sense. It took ten years to recover, and thankfully another attempt has been made to kick this franchise up the arse. Only this time it seems like they've put some thought into it.",/review/rw3226606/?ref_=tt_urv

","Hollywood is losing ideas. We already know that. Now we are stuck having remakes, reboots, & prequels. And what's worse, most of these prequels are hardly connected to the original film & sometimes they say it's a reboot. The film? It can be entertaining in some parts, but mostly it's a wooden & clichéd sci-fi story. Convoluted from the original Planet of the Apes series but like they say, This could be a reboot.
