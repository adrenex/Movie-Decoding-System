15 May 2021,julianrosser-440-787839,7," A good film
",Way better than it's current 5.8 rating. It's an intriguing story and Noomi and Joel play the leads really well.,/review/rw6941356/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2020,dnw-37,5," Watch ""Death and the Maiden"" instead
","Death and the Maiden has a very similar story but keeps the viewer guessing for longer whose side to take. The Secrets We Keep is nowhere near as well scripted, or emotionally, as engaging. And although I like Noomi, Sigourney Weaver is just incomparable. Acting, directing, writing - D&M is superior in all aspects. Skip this one and watch ""Death and the Maiden"" instead!",/review/rw6941356/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2020,paul-allaer,4," The remake of ""Death and the Maiden"" nobody asked for or was waiting on
","""The Secrets We Keep"" (2020 release; 97 min.) brings the story of Maja. As the movie opens, Maja is in a park with her son. Suddenly she recognizes a man's voice nearby, but he takes off before she can confront him. We get to know Maja, who is originally from Romania and met her now-husband (a doctor) just after WWII somewhere in Europe. Later on, she runs into the guy at a store and she follows him as he walks home. This time she is sure: this is the guy who in WWII raped and abused her and her sister. She decides to take the law into her own hands... At this point we are less that 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.",/review/rw6941356/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2020,STEVE24BUS,7," Good Slow Paced Enjoyable Thriller.
","This is an enjoyable thriller. Fairly original storyline and good performances from the three leads who take around 80% of the screen time. Slow paced, and it has to be for the story to unfold, some unpleasant scenes, which again are needed. I would have marked the film 8 if not for the very predictable last scene before the epilogue, still a good thriller though.",/review/rw6941356/?ref_=tt_urv

",This is an engaging drama. The story is captivating and very touching. I think it's pretty good.,/review/rw6941356/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2021,Just-A-Girl-14,8," A well made powerful movie
","I really enjoyed this film. It is very well acted and directed. The cast is great. Noomi Rapace's performance is absolutely phenomenal. The story is both interesting and engaging. Keeps you wondering and thinking about the effects of the war. A lot of people who weren't affected moved on with their lives but those who were, couldn't just forget and leave the past behind (even after trying their best).",/review/rw6941356/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2021,spookyrat1,4," A Shadow Cast Across Pleasantville!
","One professional critic summed it up in a perfect analogy, when suggesting The Secrets We Keep is a hybrid meeting of Death and the Maiden and Leave It to Beaver.",/review/rw6941356/?ref_=tt_urv
25 April 2021,jmvscotland,7," MUCH BETTER THAN THE 5.8 IMDb RATING SUGGESTS
","Because of the over all rating of 5.8 on IMDb, I wasn't expecting too much from this movie, ""The Secrets We Keep"", but I came to it with an open mind and thoroughly enjoyed it.",/review/rw6941356/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2020,jamactechnical,6," If you like actress Noomi Rapace...
","...and period dramas set in the 50's, I recommend it. If you don't expect too much and just enjoy it for what it is...nothing special but I still enjoyed it even though I have seen better films like it. A decent 6 stars but 7 for the actress.",/review/rw6941356/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2021,Jim_Screechy,7," Good film, Rapace is on fire
","Lots of twits on here recommending Death of the Maiden, as an alternative to this, which is quite frankly ridiculous. Since when does an idea have to be completely original or uncharted to be given a screen rendition.",/review/rw6941356/?ref_=tt_urv
20 September 2020,El_Guapo_Caballo,," The very thin line between inspiration and plagiarism
","Having watched THE SECRETS WE KEEP, almost inmediatly I googled film critics opinion about this movie hoping to not be the only viewer surprised by the obvious plot similarities between the movie in question and DEATH AND THE MAIDEN. I didnt have to search much, several film critics allude directly to both movies blatant parallelisms.
Here´s a direct quote from THE WRAP´S film critic Alonso Duralde;",/review/rw6941356/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2022,stevedudesp,7," Hard hitting BUT I'd do the same.
","The SS did some atrocious things in WW2, and having excuses like, ""i was just following orders and I'd been on amphetamines and had been up for five nights, is a weak peurile excuse, he deserved all he got.",/review/rw6941356/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2021,GIJoel6,8," Noomi is riveting
","The best thing about this film is the relatively short runtime --too many films fill two hours these days that do not need to or benefit from it. The script is so-so. The editing is spotty. But the second best thing is strong performances from all three leads, Rapace, Kinnaman and Messina. They manage to maintain the taut suspenseful drama all the way through. Rapace has another go at her somewhat typecast vengeful victim characters, and I could not take my eyes off her, as usual. The players earned all 8 of the 10 possible stars for me, and I was ultimately glad I accidentally found this on Hulu though I had never heard of it.",/review/rw6941356/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2020,ops-52535,4," very generic substance without a twist ...
","Is my first thought, and the way this story is told are less than average good, its a zombie like production over the ghosts from the past. the plotspeend goes from turtlish to rabbit speed and there are large plotholes, there are too many questionable and incoherent transitions, and as a result of bad directing the actors are never given a chance to surprise or flourish.i felt that the whole line of cast seemed utterly uninspired in their acting, and if this was in a upper middleclass neighbourhood in the late 50's, the general view on life in usa were a lot brighter than this film illustrates.",/review/rw6941356/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2020,cruise01,6," Decent thriller about a survivor from WWII coming across someone in the past that haunts them.
",3 out of 5 stars.,/review/rw6941356/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2020,jtindahouse,8," A well acted mystery/thriller that will leave you thinking
","I like movies that put you in the shoes of the characters, or even just one particular character, and makes you question what you would do in their situation. 'The Secrets We Keep' was very much one of those films for me. Revenge is a beautiful thing, but at what cost? The person I watched this with and I had a long discussion after the movie about what we would have done and ultimately came out on separate sides of the ledger. Any film that creates discussion has something going for it.",/review/rw6941356/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2021,nincubura,9," Another extraordinary performance by Noomi Rapace
","Noomi Rapace is a very underrated performer, who is an emotional chameleon. Consider how she played 7 different characters in ""What Happened to Monday."" She outshines her co-stars, to the point of imbalance in casting. I think that many directors are at a loss for how to best utilize her unbelievable skillset.",/review/rw6941356/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2021,gabby-1234,10," Noomie did it again
","Noomie is the one of best actress nowadays! I don't know why she is not a ""big star"". Maybe because she is Not American. But every single movie that she does we can see that she does everything. Well sorry y'all about the movie. I liked the thriller a little slow but was more than I expected. Good acting , amazing costume designer. You will be entertaining for a while.",/review/rw6941356/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2021,SnoopyStyle,6," not as good as others
","Maja (Noomi Rapace) and Lewis (Chris Messina) are a small town couple with a young son. It's some 15 years after WWII. She had kept much of her war experiences in Romania a secret from her husband. One day, she sees a fearsome figure from her past. She kidnaps the man (Joel Kinnaman). He claims to be Swiss immigrant Thomas married to an American girl. She sees him as Karl who was one of the German soldiers who raped her and murdered her sister.",/review/rw6941356/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2021,pridgeondesigngroup,8," Much better film than the reviews indicate.
","As a rule I hate hostage and kidnapping movies. I'm not sure why, except that it's seems lazy and trite to me. This film works on many levels. It's a beautiful looking film. Very interesting framing. Every shot looks great. The acting is top notch. I will watch Naomi in anything she does. It's a thriller and it had me on the edge of my seat. I do wonder if it was any other actress playing the lead if it would have worked though, but she is so good I was hooked from the start.",/review/rw6941356/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2021,guy-366,6," Rapace saves the day
","It is not a remake of Death and the Maiden nor is it flagrant plagiarism. Let's call it ""inspired by"" the Polanski film, with an added spoonful of Holocaust sauce. The locations and the era in which the film is set (1959) are a good backdrop to some excellent acting by Noomi Rapace.",/review/rw6941356/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2021,horvath-06991,9," We are not forgotten
","Despite some of the reviews I have read here and regardless of plot similarities to other scripts- the fact remains that in this film the main character is Roma, (gypsy). There are very few films that acknowledge us, and most Americans don't even know our history or our plight.
If you watch this film with an open mind, the acting is excellent, as is the cinematography and directing. The story is moderately paced- a slow burn and the plot resolves itself well. The plot is not entirely original- but in Hollywood- what is? There are countless films about the brutality of the Nazis, but this film centers on my people- and for that I appreciate it.",/review/rw6941356/?ref_=tt_urv
