5 November 2022,donrule,," Can't stand the laugh track
","The canned laughter happens even when nothing funny happens, which is most of the show. I might watch another few episodes if it were not for the laugh track. When will the networks realize we don't need or want canned laughter. Film in front of a studio audience or just leave the laughter for us at home.",/review/rw8662211/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2022,NullUnit,2," Horrible.
",This is pretty much the EXACT same show George Lopez keeps doing over and over and over and over. How does he get away with having essentially the SAME sitcom produced under different names??,/review/rw8662211/?ref_=tt_urv
14 December 2022,spreadeagle17-1,7," LAUGH TRACKS SUCK
","Why in the world do sitcom producers still insist on adding laugh tracks? Are they afraid their shows just aren't funny, that audiences can't judge for themselves? In the case of this particular show, yep. These producers need to check out Abbott Elementary and Young Sheldon, shows that are huge hits that don't need laugh tracks. (A big mystery there is why Chuck Lorre continues to produce other sitcoms that are still plastered with those dreaded tracks).",/review/rw8662211/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2022,landonlandonlandon-92845,1," The jokes miss the mark
","I sat down in the evening and watched it with my family, looking for a laugh. I don't think anyone of us laughed during the 22 minutes of the show. Jokes missed the mark almost every time and the acting was brutal from George Lopez. His character is this unlikable obnoxious, rude older man he always is. His jokes are just blah. I don't see how this was a comedy even. The daughter is not much better in jokes and came off as annoying. Honestly I didn't find it humorous and couldn't get into it. Wouldn't watch it again. I really wanted to like it but I found no characters lovable or anything to sympathize or relate to in this sitcom.",/review/rw8662211/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2022,Mehki_Girl,6," I Actually laughed
","A lot of this was cringy (get rid of that canned laughter!), but there were some jokes that landed - the ones in the trailers and especially the Tiktok one with Lopez and his ex. I thought that was really funny.",/review/rw8662211/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2022,fabscott-18338,1," Awful all the way around
","This show has everything: bad premise, bad writing, bad acting, bad laugh track, bad music (borrowed from another sitcom?). But even then, I was determined to watch the entire episode to see if it would come anywhere near to redeeming itself. Unfortunately, it never even came close and only became more cringeworthy as it proceeded. It felt like someone unearthed an old unfunny sitcom and assumed it could be fast-forwarded to the 2022 audience. What an unfortunate waste of effort and money for everyone involved and really an embarrassment for the network.",/review/rw8662211/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2022,romoviv,2," Awful
","I didn't expect Lopez to depict an older man who's broke living with his daughter due to cheating, drinking and poor money habits. I don't like the image he shows about Latinos. I only watched 2 episodes and I couldn't stand it anymore.",/review/rw8662211/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2022,TeeJay1992,5," Surprised by the language
","I was looking forward to watching this show for a few weeks now. Then it finally came out on Peacock, so I got to watch it. I didn't like Brookie, the co-worker at the vet office because she is also on the iCarly reboot and she's just so annoying as an actress. I do like George's daughter's husband in the episode. I've always liked him as an actor in everything I've seen him in, especially Paranormal Activity 4.",/review/rw8662211/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2022,jsosaaa,1," It's a no for me
","I wanted to love it soooo bad. I miss the early 2000s George Lopez show. This missed the mark soooo bad for me. I almost want to cry. The language surprised me. I often re watch the old show with my kiddos and they love it & expected to love this just as much. But I didn't expect for him to call his daughter a b**ch. He comes off very rude, he's a drunk, a pothead & his attitude is not likable at all. His voice is kinda different too. Seems like he slurs a bit or something. Maybe he really is high while recording ? Not funny, not a good storyline & the canned laughter is so cringy... I'm so sad. Mayan seems likable but unfortunately her acting missed the mark as well. I will keep re watching the old George Lopez show. Will not watch another episode.",/review/rw8662211/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2022,chrio1-2,3," Not that good
","I've been watching George Lopez show reruns and loved them. When I heard that he had a new show I thought great. Loved George. The plot sounded good. I've watched the first two episodes and I don't care for it. I love his daughter and the actor who plays her husband. Those are the only two likable characters. I don't like George and he was the reason I watched. The George that is portrayed is more like the George Lopez the tabloids used to talk about. Alcoholism, etc .Which is sad. They have included an annoying laughter track probably because the show isn't funny. Sadly to say I really don't see myself watching anymore episodes.",/review/rw8662211/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2022,sheepdater,3," You Can't Win a Race When You Shoot Yourself in the Foot at the Gate
","I think the general concept of this sitcom is truly a great idea and one that is relatable to many Americans. Although the show focuses on Latinx culture, America is the great melting pot, and which of our cultures doesn't have ""dads who drink too much beer""? If we haven't lived it ourselves, we all know people touched by the infidelities of their parents or felt the sting of our generation not being understood by our parents. All this stuff sounds great on paper, with a semi-bankable star such as George Lopez involved, it's clear to see why the network execs gave it the green light. Now those execs, and America, are cringing at what was produced given such a promising concept.",/review/rw8662211/?ref_=tt_urv
19 November 2022,chuckienoland,1," Can't fix stupid...
",This guy isn't funny. He has been and never will be. He's a terrible golfer too and tries so hard. It's cute he is trying to parle his weak acting career to boost his equally terrible acting daughter. Is she the spawn of the woman he stole a kidney from and divorced? I think so.,/review/rw8662211/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2022,kengregory-05400,3," Not a good theme here
",I was really hoping for more from GL but I'm not feeling like it was entertaining. The same junk comedy with almost sad looking cast. Jokes weren't laughing out loud funny and bunk writing. George Lopez is actually really funny so I will give him another chance to bring the bombs. Maybe I am caught up in his older shows but I wasn't blown away like I hoped it would be. Maybe they should have rebooted with some of the cast from back in the day.,/review/rw8662211/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2022,trippandreessen,1," Derivative and Uncomfortable
","As a Hispanic-American/European, George Lopez's new show makes me feel embarrassed of my heritage. Lopez vs. Lopez feels more like a corporate shove at the 1 yard line rather than an organically-merited television show like we've come to love in years past. The themes and meme-stock value of this show are a blanket for current culture, instead of a comedic vision for the future. Sadly, this show will go sour in a short period of time. Compared to previous NBC evening weekly programming, this is a certified bust. The conservative, teenage humor is an uncomfortable, friction-ridden experience that makes me worry about what's coming next. Not because of tone and affect, but because it makes me cringe to the core.",/review/rw8662211/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2022,robnielsen-64791,1," George Lopez Not Funny
","George Lopez and this show is so unfunny that it actually brings me anger. Do you want to get laugh reactions from people? Or do you just want people to want to punch him in the face? The writing is terrible, his acting is terrible, the fake laughter is terrible. What's with his hair? You go out in public with that hair???? Let alone do a television show with it? BARF. I am shocked this made it past the pilot. No way in hell this gets a 2nd season, and thank God for that. Just absolutely awful all around. I hate this show so much I just had to write a review. This is only my 2nd review ever. I can't take it anymore.",/review/rw8662211/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2022,apontekj,3," Please just cancel this show!
","When will this guy write new content? Did I go back in time and am I watching the same old jokes for way long ago? Sorry George, I seen you live and so many of your shows but your content has not changed. Hope the show gets more creative because at this point it's not worth anyone's time. The stereotypes are so overdone, and funny 20 years ago.",/review/rw8662211/?ref_=tt_urv

","Omgad! Have never been much of a george lopez fan before, but this show is freekin funny lololololol! The banter between the characters and quick whips are so side splitting hilarious, akin to ""Will & Grace"" lolz. I've never laughed so many times and so hard, especially episode three.",/review/rw8662211/?ref_=tt_urv

6 November 2022,bshopezilla-36680,10," Off to a good start but.
","Off to a good start but could be better wish Angie Carmen and max were in this though. George is still funny though ahahah. But hopefully maybe they can bring Angie, and max, and Carmen in for some episodes. But it's pretty good so far. Hopefully they bring back some old characters again ernie would be a good one as well to bring back.",/review/rw8662211/?ref_=tt_urv

8 December 2022,jesxie,7," Has potential
",I like it but the daughter is annoying and her lines are always cringey I missed George Lopez kinda wished they had brought back his old show but I enjoy him in this I would prefer if they changed the actress for the daughter as I think her acting isn't that good this show has potential but it's not there yet,/review/rw8662211/?ref_=tt_urv

5 November 2022,smithtorren,9," Okay
","It was An okay Episode Not as Good as American Auto but it was still a very good show or at least episode. I've only seen episode 1 and I have high hopes for the rest of the season but I mostly waiting for it night Court and American Auto season 2. This is not contain spoilers because I barely actually saw the episode of Lopez versus Lopez but I like that NBC was giving it a chance, but I wish that there were more NBC shows that are comedies. It took more than 7 months to get another comedy and that's way too long. Other networks have comedies airing but NBC did not, but it's finally back. I wish that the lineup was better. That's all. Thank you.",/review/rw8662211/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2022,savvysprite,7," Not bad, not great, just good enough for me
","I grew up with GL as a half Mexican kid growing up as a military brat. He was one of many comedians that gave me a harsher understanding of Mexicans. Honestly, comedy shows with laugh tracks just aren't IT anymore even with laughter recording or live show audience laughter. I also vibe with the idea that Tiktok is involved with it to make it modern.",/review/rw8662211/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2022,sarahschwa,10," I want more But not a comment made om season 1 episode 7
","I don't care care about the white comments but saying we're responsible for it to is the thing...
His daughter needs more acting lessons but I'm sorry we can tell ugh I love you though
love George Lopez please keep making this show!!! I hope this show makes it!! If not I still want to watch George Lopez anyway I can!! It made me laugh the same way as is older show..if he could act more like the old George it might make it but it may need another cast member like the lady who played his mother in his older show..the show needs that I think a lot of people would agree...I just want to see this show make it because a lot of the older shows are still considered the best because it had something that no show has today and I feel like the Creator's try to hard and over think and it doesn't need all that..just like the new movies now a days...if you guys can take a leap of faith I think it will be worth it..or at least consider it..",/review/rw8662211/?ref_=tt_urv
