",I may be in the minority on this (as usual) but this series is my sixth favorite in the franchise and the second one I really like in the Disney years. This is a show that sort of ran under the radar.,/review/rw5871756/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2011,burntofferings-139-547945,10," Fury of the Jungle
","Let me start by saying this, yes this series follows a basic guide that all shows in the power rangers saga have; evil monster wants to take over earth, a team of brightly colored spandex wearing teenagers must stop that evil, and with each monster of the episode they defeat they keep the bad guys at bay. What makes this series stand out is a lineup of actors that keep the predictable dialogue upbeat and enjoyable. And the writing isn't as horrible as one seems to expect from this franchise. Jungle Fury is a show that your kids should enjoy, and most adults should appreciate the morals that are involved in the story lines, ones that aren't necessarily jammed down your throat. At the time this review is being written the series is over, but thankfully nicktoons is replaying it, so please give this series another look. The only downside is if you do start to enjoy Jungle Fury is that there were only two dvds released in the US, but maybe that might change. Hopefully. Overall, this show is worth checking out.",/review/rw5871756/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2020,debsouvik-30510,10," Awesome!!
","One of the best Power Rangers series of all-time. The show is so cool. You have a great team of rangers, great character development throughout the series, awesome villains, cool-looking megazords, and martial arts too.",/review/rw5871756/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2015,liz_loves_cats,3," barely watchable...
","This season is at least one of the worst if not THE worst. Although the first episode was promising and cool the season turned out to be a complete failure.The suits were terrible especially the shoes that looked like slippers!It was like they were fighting with their pajamas, not to mention the sunglasses morphers! The plot was just dull and there were too many fillers, there was no purpose in this season. Plus, why make Casey leader of the team since he hasn't trained not as much as Theo and Lilly?Wasn't it a bit of unfair for them?As for the couples, I would prefer Casey and Lilly and I would love to forget the episode Dominic likes another girl.",/review/rw5871756/?ref_=tt_urv

3 June 2020,FinisherDude,7," Not bad as I thought
","Back then when this season came out, I used to hate it but I did watch it as well (didn't really think much of it). I like the story, writing and the acting is good. It's an improvement from Operation Overdrive I'll admit but I think the season is overrated. To me, this season is trying to follow some elements from Dino Thunder which isn't needed in this season but it's still good overall",/review/rw5871756/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2020,kchevywho,1," Worst season ever!
","This is the worst power rangers season I have ever seen even for megaforce/super megaforce.with cheap outfits, terrible story, kinda terrible characters in the show like their mentor rj and terrible zords and megazord as well.This season would have been better with a crossover but nope so don't ever watch this season at all!",/review/rw5871756/?ref_=tt_urv
