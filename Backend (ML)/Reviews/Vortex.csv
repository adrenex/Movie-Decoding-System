29 April 2022,K2nsl3r,7," Almost great
","Unlike Noe's previous films, Vortex is an understated, slow-paced, intimate character piece. Who knew that Dario Argento could give such a brilliant performance? And Francoise Lebrun... just wow. The rest of the cast are fine in their roles as well, but this is a movie about two characters, and they were cast perfectly. Where the movie really struggles, however, is in its pacing and editing. It is simply 30-40 minutes too long. Scenes drag on endlessly. There can be a hypnotic quality to some of the mundane scenes, but not enough to justify the drag. A tighter edit would have made a difference. Perhaps one of these days we will get a director's cut that re-edits the movie and makes it a bit tighter overall. However, there is a lot to appreciate in the film. It is worth seeing for the acting performances alone. It takes on an important topic and handles it gracefully. It shows that the director is a versatile craftsman who is not afraid of breaking the mold and taking risks that mostly pay off.",/review/rw8387068/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2022,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,9," A whole new kind of masterpiece from one of modern film's finest
","Well, I've been thinking about this one for a week or so. It's an incredibly special film and, to my knowledge, a very singular one. I've never seen such a realistic death-focused movie in my life. Though it has Gaspar Noe's signature bleakness, it is completely unlike everything else he's made, and feels much more humble. Though he's mentioned the correlation in interviews, it feels very clear that his own near-death experience (brain hemorrhaging a couple years back) shifted his heart in a sense. This is easily Noe's most heartfelt film.",/review/rw8387068/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2021,Scotlord,6," ""La mort n'ouvre aucune porte""
","I had the opportunity of seeing Gaspar's newest film at the 74th Cannes Film Festival this year. Being an admirer of his entire filmmography as well as one of my favorite working directors, I was very much excited to see this premiere. I knew close to nothing about it, but the poster and title seemed to offer somerthing both different and promising.",/review/rw8387068/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2021,ckline-32361,8," ""Dedicated to those whose brains decompose before their hearts do""
","I knew nothing at all about this film going in, and you should know nothing as well. This gift of a film screened and my local film festival (FNC 2021) followed by a late night screening of ""LVX ÆTERNA"", and ""VORTEX"" was definitely my favorite of the two. My friend who told me the festival also said that Gaspar Noé's last film would be screening and it triggered a ""Vietnam flashback"" to my first experience watching ""CLIMAX"", with psychedelic visual and a killer soundtrack, and I'm not going to lie that was what I was expecting from VORTEX. However, Gaspar presented us with a quiet, contemplative piece of cinema that I believe is nothing less than a love-letter to cinema and filmmaking itself. Bravo Gaspar!",/review/rw8387068/?ref_=tt_urv
7 May 2022,stylss,6," ""To all those whose brains will decompose before their hearts.""
","Intimate, haunting, quiet, and sad with very raw and incredible performances by the two main characters. It's very slow but the unique transitions paired with the split screen keeps your eyes constantly darting around trying to take in everything which at times isn't much at all. I have to admit this was uncomfortably long and it didn't completely sink in until the very final scene. Getting old is so scary.",/review/rw8387068/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2022,yeqks,8," Gaspar Noe proves he is one of the most exciting filmmakers working today.
","A slow moving, disturbing, and emotionally powerful cinematic experience. Gaspar really doesn't disappoint, as this film packs some of the most potent performances in any of his previous films, Dario Argento, François Lebrun and Alex Lutz do a surprisingly amazing job performing. The split screen used in the film's visuals are wonderfully implemented with a clear artistic purpose, the film is incredibly well shot and though the pacing is very slow it never feels dull whatsoever. The disturbing moments are much more subtle and quiet when compared to Noe's previous works, though their subtlety doesn't hinder these moments whatsoever. The dialogue is wonderful, every bit of human drama between these characters feels like it was ripped right out of reality with how raw every second is, at points it feels like I'm watching a documentary rather than a drama.",/review/rw8387068/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2022,christopher-underwood,7," stages of dementia
","The Vortex presumably is partly inspired by Gaspar Noe's almost fatal brain haemorrhage in 2020 and maybe in his earlier films have their own vortex. An old couple struggling with the stages of dementia and death and the two, actor Francoise Lebrun and famous director, Dario Argento are both amazing. Although it is Argento, who doesn't really even speak French, gives a stunning performance. The film is rather long but very well done with split screens the two much on their own in their own world. We see the couple and gradually we really think just how terrible it is and we see what is coming.",/review/rw8387068/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2022,Jeremy_Urquhart,8," Absorbing and hard-hitting
","Even by Noe's standards, Vortex is truly unflinching and horrifically brutal, and does so without showing the sorts of extreme sexual and/or violent content that can often be found in his other films.",/review/rw8387068/?ref_=tt_urv
13 June 2022,cschmidt-43444,5," Unfortunately too long
","I really wanted to like this movie. As a big Gaspar Noé fan I looked forward to watch this movie but it suffers from one of Gaspar's biggest flaws: Almost no story but loooots of running time. At least 1 hour could've been cut. Most of the time the characters don't seem to do anything. The subject is important but the way the story was handled makes it seem ""uninteresting"". There are very few conflicts and when they appear they are too subtle and almost non-existing. Maybe I'm blinded by the fact that Gaspar is a very scadalous director but he missed with this one.",/review/rw8387068/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2022,H1DEK1,8," A Must See
",An amazing experience. A movie which is full of emotinal intensity. Gaspar Noe tells a heartbreaking story with a very original and clever style. Definitely worth a watch. Some viewer may have hard time to get in the movie. But it kept me interested all the way from beginning to end. I can already sense that it will become a cult movie.,/review/rw8387068/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2022,sarahbasak,7," Not your average Gaspar Noe movie

4 January 2023,garethcrook,9," Devastating.
","Gaspar Noé doesn't do light hearted. I'm preparing to strap in and have my senses bludgeoned. I mean we start with a slate that states 'To all those whose brains will decompose before their hearts'. This isn't an assault though. It's stark. Shot on something digital, but framed in 4:3. Elle (Françoise Lebrun) and Lui (Dario Argento) are an old couple, who drift apart, literally into their own split screen frames. It's inventive, making the screen feel as claustrophobic as their Parisian apartment. They're often doing different things as they go about the days, meaning the viewer has a lot to take in. I suspect you could watch this a few times and see something slightly different each time. Lui is fearful of the city and fearful that Elle's onset dementia is going to get her into trouble. Really though, he just wants to get on with writing his book. For all the mundanity, there's a lot going on. Elle's face alone conveys a magnitude of emotion with barely a word spoken. She's aimless and restless. Lui doesn't see this. He has focus and people to engage with. A visit from their son Stéphane (Alex Lutz) though reveals how lost Elle is. It's heartbreaking. For Stéphane, for Elle and for Lui who's ill prepared and frustrated. Elle struggles with the clutter and feels the need to clean and tidy. Organise her home, to help her mind. Lui though embraces it, feels he needs it to fuel his thoughts as they continue to drift apart. Choices are to be made, of how they see their lives and what it looks like going forward, before life makes their choices for them. The fly on the wall feel puts you right at the heart of all this intimacy unravelling and it's quite hard to watch. Like we're intruding. It's wonderful though. I've struggled with some Noé films in the past, but this is brilliant. Devastating, but brilliant. I'd go so far to say it's his best film yet. It does that thing of drawing you in, investing in its characters as a piece of film, but also feeling important. Art capturing life to a degree that you hope it reaches as wide an audience as possible. Many of Noé's films have been pretty brutal, but this really does hit hard.",/review/rw8387068/?ref_=tt_urv
13 May 2022,Horst_In_Translation,6," Sobering and frequently pretty depressing movie
","""Vortex"" is a co-production between France, Belgium and Monaco from 2021 and it got released here not too long ago, so still a pretty new movie and outside of Europe it may even take a little longer until this film can finally be seen. The language is almost exclusively French. The film comes relatively close to the 2.5-hour mark, which means it is very long. The director and writer of this drama is Gaspar Noé, who was born in Argentina, but has focused on French-language films for a long time now. I like some of his older stuff, so I got curious about this one here as well. But it was also the subject that made me more curious. I will get to that later. The two lead actors are Dario Argento and Françoise Lebrun. The latter started appearing in films in the early 1970s, so this is kind of her 50th anniversary and Argento has been part of the industry for many, many decades too, also as a filmmaker himself obviously, both writer and director, and not just an actor, so it is interesting to see him in front of the camera exclusively this time with Noé in charge. Noé by the way will turn 60 soon as well and I somehow thought he was still younger. But you can read his year of birth very early on. Just like you are shown the year of birth of the two aforementioned lead actors. This was absolutely intentional. Their ages are a key factor in this film, or I should say the characters' ages, so Noé also wanted to show us that the people working in key positions on this movie were not young anymore either. The credits also feel very Noé, the style of them pretty much and how they are not really easy to read because of that. Also of course that these credits were shown before the film. Not at the end or so as it is usually the case. The end is the end. Nothing follows there anymore and it totally makes sense as a creative decision.",/review/rw8387068/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2022,cruelworldfilms,8," Beautifully Devestating...
","The title says it all really. It's a bit slow paced, but that's what makes ""Vortex"" such a heartbreaking, meditative take on the frailty of life and the cruelty of mortality. Inevitable, but shocking when it hits.",/review/rw8387068/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2023,I_Ailurophile,10," A heartfelt, quietly searing drama - this is Noé's masterpiece
","""If at first you don't succeed, try, try again."" That's how the saying goes, right? Does it or should it also apply to watching films from the same director? Heretofore I've seen four other pictures that Gaspar Noé has made, and I specifically liked one of them. (Well, maybe like 70-80% of one, if we're being honest.) And still I come back for more, in hopes that I'll find a movie that will change my mind about the filmmaker. That persistence has finally paid off, for in my experience so far, this is surely the best thing Noé has done. It might actually be the best thing Dario Argento has been involved with, for that matter. There was maybe still room for improvement; I think there are a few points where some dialogue, or seconds or even minutes of the length, could have been left on the cutting room floor without diminishing the end product. Yet ultimately such subjective faults are decidedly minor in light of what this otherwise represents. Even more to the point: where some of the man's other features have felt self-indulgent ('Enter the void'), or ""daring"" or ""artistic"" but emptily so to one degree or another ('Irreversible,' 'Lux Aeterna'), 'Vortex' readily comes across as deeply, painfully honest, and personal, and therefore immediately comes from a place of far greater strength and power than his other works. This isn't exactly an easy watch, but it's nonetheless lovely even as it's excruciating, and at last Noé may have made that film that will be his most enduring legacy.",/review/rw8387068/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2022,Xstal,7," The Dangers of Dementia...
","Françoise Lebrun delivers an outstanding and unforgettable portrayal as Elle, a lady in her senior years struck down with dementia and living in a world that's alien, confusing, bewildering and extremely dangerous. So convincing is her presentation that you spend most of the film half believing that she must genuinely be suffering, that this is a documentary, a fly on the wall observation. Similarly, Dario Argento fulfils the role of the loving but ever so slightly irritated grumpy old man, wishing to get on with his life while more often than not, turning a blind eye to his wife's descent, knowing only too well the consequences once others take control of the situation.",/review/rw8387068/?ref_=tt_urv

23 September 2022,hannabtr,9," Truly amazing, but a bit too long.
","Unlike Noés other films, Vortex was not filled with visually disturbing scenes. It was a raw portrayal of life, or the end of life. Françoise Lebrun portrayed dementia incredibly well. She made a truly believable performance, and I've worked with people with dementia. She really captured that empty-eyed look. The other actors did really well too. It was long, and maybe a bit too long, but it was still an amazing movie. He could have cut some scenes shorter, but overall this was truly amazing. I've seen most of his other films, and this is the best one in my opinion. The split screen was brilliant, and it might sound like it makes it hard to watch, but the film is very slow and there is not much that's actually happening, so it's not a problem. The film is not for everyone, it's slow and it's set in same apartment for more than half of the the whole 2 hours and 22 minutes. But it's a really great film, and If you can watch slow movies I would absolutely recommend it.",/review/rw8387068/?ref_=tt_urv
