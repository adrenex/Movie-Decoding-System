30 November 2022,paul-allaer,8," Outstanding reassessment of New York's burgeoning rock sene in the early 00's
","As ""Meet Me In the Bathroom"" (2022 release; 105 min.) opens, it is ""1999"" and we are introduced to Adam Green (of the Moldy Peaches) and their very humble beginnings at an open mike night. Karen O (of later the Yeah Yeah Yeahs) also moves in those circles. One day they run into Julian Casablancas of the just formed Strokes at a party... At this point we are less than 10 min. Into the documentary.",/review/rw8828168/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2022,rachbruno,5," I really wanted to love this
","I have been anxiously awaiting this film, and it really let me down. I wanted to feel the excitement of this time and place and as soon as I would start to, it walked it back and jumped subjects, losing any momentum. These bands defined my early adulthood, at a time when things were really chaotic. But this film was chaotic in a different and uninspired way. I couldn't tap into the nostalgia I was hoping for, and it left me really sad and almost angry because there was so much potential and it could have been so much more.",/review/rw8828168/?ref_=tt_urv
29 November 2022,jimdbs,7," 7/10
","From the mid 90s to early 2010s, NYC, particularly north Brooklyn, was known as the city to be in for people into indie music. This film tries to connect that with coverage of some key bands from the 2000 to 2005 portion of that era. It's mostly about those bands and less about the scenes in which those bands were a part.",/review/rw8828168/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2022,koriramos,6," Maybe with 1 hour long and more Karen O it would be a 10
","I grew up watching those bands and I remember what the media used to say about them, that they were going to save rock music.",/review/rw8828168/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2022,levedad-49344,8," Rockstars are human
","An exciting and well documented journey through the New York music scene that emerged in the 2000s, which has The Strokes at its center but includes various artists such as Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Interpol, The Rapture, The Moldy Peaches and LCD Soundsystem to complete the context and show us a bigger picture.",/review/rw8828168/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2022,njmace,1," This is sooo not accurate
",These bands that they are talking about were all little bands that no one really knew until after 2010 yea they were around but hadn't made it yet nd compared to other bands of this time they still havnt made it lol,/review/rw8828168/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2023,beckydobro,4," Should've been so much better
","I was obsessed with this era of rock as a teenager and I still love it all these years later, so I was expecting to love this, but I just didn't.",/review/rw8828168/?ref_=tt_urv
