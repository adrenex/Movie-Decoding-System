10 March 2020,Muhammad_Rafeeq,10," ""A masterwork in action filmmaking"" Extraordinary ( Chines A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10
","I really enjoyed this movie it's so much more than an marital art film it centers around Li's character who is a young & arrogant marital art master, until a tragic event takes place leaving his life meaningless as he begins to find meaning he learns a lot & changes completey, he realises he was wrong & makes amends with his past actions to become a man of great understanding & wisdom. A lot of life lessons can be learned from this one.",/review/rw1275806/?ref_=tt_urv

13 April 2006,rmj1971,8," Jet Li's paean to martial arts
","Make no mistake about it, Fearless is the best straight-ahead martial arts film since Jackie Chan's seminal Drunken Master 2. Director Ronny Yu crams more bone-jarring, well crafted fight scenes into the first forty minutes of this movie than most films can match in their entire runtime. This is a canny move, as it pulls in the viewer via the blurring action before beginning to develop the film's narrative in the middle third. While the story is a well used one (kung-fu bully comes to realise his skills can be used to educate rather than brutalise), it's a perfect structure on which to hang the film's many excellent confrontations. It's obvious that this film is Li's love letter to his Wu Shu background and martial arts in general. In dramatic terms, Fearless never reaches the heights of recent wuxia movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon or Hero and so is unable to feel truly fulfilling as a great movie per se. It is however up there with Jet Li's very best work in the genre, OUATIC & Fist of Legend for example, and if it is (sadly) true that it is to be his last period martial arts picture, it's a hell of a bang to go out on.",/review/rw1275806/?ref_=tt_urv
26 April 2006,drqu1981,10," Jet Li in a Masterpiece
","I've always been a fan of Jet Li since his early days, and frankly his movies and performances in them have been terrible in the last few years mainly due to his attempts to be a profitable and a more mainstream actor in the US. As a result, we were treated to ""nice"" movies like The One and Cradle to the Grave. This movie though makes up them. This was truly a gem. Not only were the action sequences spectacular, and I iterate spectacular, but the story line and acting as well as screen play was very tastefully done. Gone were the traditional comedic side plot, and welcomed was a sense of respect not only for the Chinese but also for some of the foreign countries that are often portrayed poorly in the movies. In the end, I can't help but feel like I've not only seen a great movie but felt the humanity and pride that the movie released. See it!",/review/rw1275806/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2006,brentsoffcenter,9," Jet Li's finest martial arts film
","Almost flawless, this new release improves on the style and genre in a significant way. The film is presented in a way that the viewer can appreciate it from several perspectives without heavily relying on the genre's standard formulas. We don't have to wade through the typical love triangle, the maniacal drug lord contracting a hit, or the beloved school's instructor being tortured and murdered before the ultimate revenge takes place. This film has a legitimate story line, skillfully presented in a clear and well edited manner.",/review/rw1275806/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2006,samuelding85,8," Indeed, it is a Fearless hit !
","Fearless marks Jet Li's last martial art production, where i am glad to say, he did not let anyone down in his martial art swan song.",/review/rw1275806/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2006,DICK STEEL,9," A Nutshell Review: Fearless
","The first Jet Li movie which I watched as a little boy, was his Shaolin Temple. Jet next shot to fame and prominence with the various Chinese folk heroes that he played in the late 80s and 90s, like Wong Fei Hong, Fong Sai Yuk, Zhang San Feng, and even taking on Bruce Lee's Chen Zhen role in a Fist of Fury remake called Fist of Legend. In Fearless, he plays martial arts master Huo Yuanjia / Fok Yuen Gaap, whom I presume most who are familiar with Fist of Fury, will know who this chap is.",/review/rw1275806/?ref_=tt_urv
17 April 2007,classicsoncall,8," ""There is no knot that cannot be untangled.""
","It seems that most of the reviews of martial arts films I read on this forum are posted by devotees of the genre. In my case, I'm not particularly a martial arts movie fan, but do enjoy a picture with an effective story and a reasonable amount of action. In that regard, ""Jet Li's Fearless"" is acceptable on both points, even though the plot itself is reminiscent of movies going all the way back to the kung fu glut of the 1970's. It has a much harder edge to it than the lyrical beauty of a movie like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", and it doesn't approach the vibrant use of color that ""Hero"" and ""House of Flying Daggers"" so eminently achieve. What it does serve up are excitingly well choreographed fights in various venues that push the limits of physical dexterity and inventive use of wire work; the battle against Master Chin at the restaurant best exemplifies that dichotomy. For those who look for the more cerebral, the tea conversation between Huo Yuan Jia and Tanaka and how it relates to Wushu fighting styles is especially well done. For me, a satisfying martial arts film, even if not the best the genre has to offer.",/review/rw1275806/?ref_=tt_urv
30 April 2006,hkswordman,9," An exceptional martial arts movie
","This is an exciting, beautiful, exceptional martial arts movie that cements Jet Li's superlative contribution to kung-fu cinema. It is absolutely filled with stirring martial arts and gloriously made, with eye-filling cinematography. Although the story is simple, it is heart-felt and effective. It's hard to understand how anyone who could call this boring, unless they are so jaded and cynical that their review would be useless in any case. This film is a great accompaniment to Jet's Shaolin Temple series, Once Upon a Time in China films, Fist of Legend, and Hero, and an absolute must-see for anyone who enjoyed those films.",/review/rw1275806/?ref_=tt_urv
22 September 2006,GOWBTW,10," A magnificent work of art by Jet Li!
","Jet Li is known for his prowness and skill as a martial artist. For his final movie, ""Fearless"" makes its point! Based on the life of Wushu master Huo Yuanjia. Ronny Yu did a spectacular job make this movie work. Huo(Li) is a proud fighter, who would goes to the extremes to be the best. His pride however always seems to get the better of him. Whenever he wins a battle, disciples follow him around and began to worship him. When he picks a battle against Master Chin. His fates was sealed. After defeating, and killing Chin his godson takes advantage of killing his mother and daughter Jade. It's a shame that his pride got himself into trouble, then again one of his disciples isn't as loyal as he thought. So Huo leaves his city, and when he made a settling, he meets Moon(Li Sun), a young, blind caring woman. She helps his find himself again which is good, and he also finds a sense of redemption. Then after a few years of exile, his city has changed. It has foreigners residing there. I guess exile served as a purpose to see the errors of his country's lifestyle. In that city he meets a Japanese fighter named Tanaka(Shiro Nakamura). Who talks to Huo about tea, and fighting styles. A sign of respect is brewing between countries. And that fight between Huo and O'Brien(Nathan Jones) makes another awakening. This movie is great. I liked everything it has: The storyline, the choreography, and the fighting skills which surpasses all other movies Jet Li has made. The main theme of this movie is Honor! 5 Stars!",/review/rw1275806/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2006,tavm,9," Fearless or Huo Yuan Jia is excellent martial arts bio
","Jet Li's Fearless is the true story of Huo Yuanjia, a martial arts champion of Tianjin, who overcomes great tragedy to form a sports club that gets respected around the world. Of course the fight scenes are spectacular, including one against his opponent on his birthday in a restaurant owned by a friend of his, but it's Yuanjia's spiritual journey that truly touches the soul of this Ronny Yu pic. Li commands every scene and makes you feel his emotions through every path he takes with Yu taking us along for the ride. Unless you think the restaurant scene may be too intense for anyone under 12, I highly recommend the whole family watch this highly entertaining and serious movie about one of the most important martial artists ever.",/review/rw1275806/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2007,semi-buff,9," Worth watching even if you hate fight movies.
","Not being a fan of the kung fu genre, I watched this because I like Jet Li. For me, some the fight scenes were too long or too CGI'd. I especially detest enhanced metal-on-metal sounds and had to mute and/or fast forward through some of those scenes. After about a half hour of almost non-stop very lonnng fight scenes, I almost gave up; but I;' glad I didn't, because the rest of the movie was very worth watching. I wondered at the historical accuracy of some of it. For example, would there really be an all-girl drumming team in ca. 1905 China? Would there be female students at the sports school? Women were very important to the story, as they are in real life, and I appreciated that. Beautiful cinematography. look forward to seeing Li in his future non-martial arts films.",/review/rw1275806/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2006,JJ_oscartsang,9," A Great Action Flick, Stunning Performance
","This is the first martial arts film that I enjoyed very much. It has a very strong plot which is also based on a true story about an martial arts master, Huo Yuan Jia and together with great actors and actresses, a masterpiece is presented. As an Asian, I have already seen too much martial arts movie, however this one stuns me with the story and acting as I have mentioned above, but as well as their visual effects, every movement is shown clearly, one would find their heart beating hard as the fight is going on, the music in the film also fits perfectly with the film. I have to mention that this film is quite Hollywood standard and I believe it is because Jet Li had already learn a few elements to make a good Hollywood film when he was filming some Hollywood films a few years back. As Jet Li has said, this will be his last martial arts movie and wants to make it a good one, I think he has already fulfilled his dreams, because this is a truly Jet Li movie and I think a lot of people would like this film.",/review/rw1275806/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2006,zxantosdragon,9," Jet Li's best film in years!
","Let's get to the point. This is Jet Li's best movie in years. Not because of the fight scenes, but because the plot is engaging throughout and the emotional tension of the movie works, even though it was a bit tangled with a bit of preach.",/review/rw1275806/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2020,toutouguy,10," Masterful in many ways
","Thought I was watching a regular Jet Li action movie at the beginning. Turns out, it rivals the likes of Crouching Tiger, Drunken master, Fist of Fury, Hero and Ip Man as the greatest ever. Pure and intense, as if these events had actually taken place right before our very own eyes. Awesome depiction of the early Chinese struggles with foreigners and the kung fu is beautiful and no doubt should be considered art in it's highest forms.",/review/rw1275806/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2006,jon2005,7," Fearless
","Fearless has a similar structure to last years' Unleashed (2005), in that this is not just a martial arts extravaganza, but also a film with heart and proper acting on the part of Jet Li. This latest effort, despite flaws, is the much more accomplished of the two works; both contain exceptional and brutal fight scenes, and a central 'drama' section where Li's character learns about life and about who he is, and both of these aspects are handled better in Fearless.

4 February 2015,SnoopyStyle,7," Great fight, good looking, well acted
","It's 1910. China is considered the sick man of Asia. In Shanghai, the foreign powers created a contest with their four champion fighters. Only martial artist Huo Yuanjia (Jet Li) rose to the challenge. He dispatches the three western champions in various disciplines. Only Tanaka from Japan is left. The movie flashes back 30 years ago in Tianjin. Yuanjia's father wants him to learn writing rather than the family wushu. Despite that, he continues to strive to make Huo Wushu the best. However family tragedy strikes and he has to reconsider his life.",/review/rw1275806/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2007,Bob-45,8," Jet Li's Swan Song is Epic, Near-Masterpiece
","Jet Li has announced ""Fearless"" is his last martial arts film. If so, Li and director Ronny Yu have ended Li's career on a decidedly high note; for ""Fearless"" is an epic, near masterpiece, flawed, ironically, because of the inexplicable deletion of the film's pivotal scene. It would be easy to say ""Fearless"" is nearly as good as ""Hero""; it's not, neither artistically or in its profundity. Nonetheless, Fearless is still a top notch film, and far deeper than, say, ""House of Flying Daggers."" WARNING: SPOILERS In ""Fearless,"" Jet Li plays Huo Yuanjia, a martial arts master and actual historical figure, whose assassination is credited by martial artists as triggering the reemergence of Chinese national pride. Indeed, Huo Yuanjia 's assassination is the impetus for both Bruce Lee's ""The Chinese Connection"" and Jet Li's ""Fist of Legend."" END SPOILERS",/review/rw1275806/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2007,thinker1691,8," ""A Champion is more than a man of strength and power""
","This is the first modern martial arts Chinese film which impressed me. Going back to the days of Bruce Lee, China has never really been able to get past their comic portrayal of their martial artists as anything more than puppetry clowns with trampolines. When Bruce Lee came to America and captured the attention and loyal following of American audiences with his superb fighting skills, and serious acting, he was able to adapt all he knew into the visual art called entertainment. I believe Jet Li has also overcome his theatrical roots and has perfected his art. This film entitled ""Fearless"", is the result. Here we have him portraying the legendary Chinese hero Huo Yuanjia. That hero began as a street fighter, but never knew much more than being a common thug out for power and glory. Only experiencing a life segment of tragedy and suffering did he finally acquire the true meaning of his craft. Upon returning to the arena, he faces an American opponent called Hercules O'Brien, (Nathan Jones, last time, he was in TROY). It is here audiences observe, our hero is no longer a thug, but a Master of his craft and a Representative of his awakening country. Excellent film. ****",/review/rw1275806/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2006,wrlang,8," good film based on a true story
","Jet Li's Fearless is about a 19th century Chineese martial artist named Huo Yuanjia who help unite China into a single nation. After a trying young life, Hou made his way back to the old ways and helped China realize it can be united if they forget their internal differences and practice a nationalism. Best fight scenes I've seen in a long time as the choreography was not in close like so many poorly made fighting films. The morality of the film gets a little corny near the end, but that is what the discipline of the Wushu is all about, respect for everyone. Humanity respects strength and only those who can defend themselves can be magnanimous to others. It would be nice if this morality would slip into the majority of the world, but it will take some time if ever. A well made film with believable characters and good directing/acting. Not as bloody as I thought it would be.",/review/rw1275806/?ref_=tt_urv

22 April 2006,sarastro7,8," Brawls-to-the-walls
","Fearless is a quintessential top-flight kung fu movie. It's got great fights, a good story, and is based on a historical character. The movie is structured so that it imparts to us all the cardinal values of martial arts; how it is all tied in with honor and self-improvement and helping others, and how it should not be used for simple brawling. Huo Yuan Jia learns this the hard way, and so the movie really teaches us the same lessons that a martial arts teacher would teach us: use kung fu for doing good! With power comes responsibility. Abusing your power will only bring you disaster.",/review/rw1275806/?ref_=tt_urv

26 January 2006,harry_tk_yung,," Could be considered Ronny Yu's signature piece
","Director Ronny Yu, just like HUA Yuan Jia, is a fighter who has conquered his inner devil. Moderately handicapped by polio, he endured an isolated childhood. Against his father's (kindly meant) wishes for him to go into business, he followed his own dreams of directing movies, something for which his physical handicap makes him particularly unsuitable. Not among the prolific Hong Kong directors, he kept up with bringing to the local audience good quality work in the 80s and early 90s.",/review/rw1275806/?ref_=tt_urv
