27 March 2022,A_Different_Drummer,7," comfy like old socks
","You review this show in terms of what it is not. Not Morse. Not Lewis. Not even close. Not written by Moffat. Not something you would go out of your way to schedule for a family viewing. Not fast moving. In fact if Scarborough's detective were any slower, he would require dusting. But it is safe, it is comfy, it is not excessively woke, and it holds the attention. Sonita Henry does an especially decent job as the sidekick, packing a massive amount of dignity and self-confidence into a role nobody usually pays attention to. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

29 March 2022,wrxsti54,8," Another great British cop show
","Yet another superb British cop show. Due to its size and dominance in British culture, a good number of UK police dramas are set in London, the capital. UK TV show makers have based a good number of cop shows in regional parts of the UK and the local customs and accents add flavour to the show.",/review/rw8000080/?ref_=tt_urv
14 April 2022,gee-15,8," Shades of ""Vera"" and ""Inspector Morse""
","Nothing terribly innovative here. Just another interesting detective procedural. The two leads are fun to watch but, surprisingly, lead fairly normal lives. DI Arnold( Scarborough) is struggling with the breakup of his marriage and DI Shamsie (Henry) just had a baby and is making adjustments. But it's all within a normal range and so the emphasis is on the detecting. Their two costars (played by Bankole and Phelps) are a good addition and create a team of uber-competent policepersons. Adrian Scarborough is a revelation. I'm used to seeing him in comic buffoonish roles. He plays it serious here with his cycling, piano playing, dyslexic detective and does it well. The plots are the usual combo of twisty narratives, people lying to the police (sometimes for absurd reasons...""Why didn't I tell you I was at the victim's house five minutes before he was bludgeoned to death? I didn't think it was relevant."") and interrogations accompanied by legal counsel who remain silent and doodle on yellow pads. It's all been done before but it goes down easy. Good show!",/review/rw8000080/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2022,guy-summerton,8," Good old British detective show.
","Really enjoying this and I do hope it comes back for another series. What is it I like about it? That's a difficult question to answer. It just works, the characters are good , the storylines are good and I'm pleased to be seeing it set in London for some reason. As a Yorkshire man I think I've seen enough northern dramas for a while. Keep up the good work.",/review/rw8000080/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2022,westsideschl,8," Normal Thus a Bit Different
","Good choice of actors; a bit more normal than we usually find in crime series (no bizarre issues or personalities). Crimes are fairly normal also, but just different enough to be interesting. Forensics (important) are well done.",/review/rw8000080/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2022,bigbeariow,8," Just watched and loved it.
","Sometimes I'm not wanting different or radical. Sometimes I want easy and familiar and just watchable. This is it, familiar places with just a touch of humour. Sonita Henry is great and a good foil to Adrian Scarborough who plays the DI with a slight weariness that is subtle and smile worthy to enjoy. The plots are easy and it's a distraction that's not too taxing after a working day.",/review/rw8000080/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2022,egriggs-567-11622,9," What a GEM!
","Wonderful well rounded characters especially for a first season show. I want more. I certainly hope it's renewed and they keep up the quality writing and acting. I just find it so enjoyable. Not too dark. Quirky & coupled with a good story line. Continuous personal drama but completion of ""murder of the week"" (so to speak)
I really enjoyed this show.",/review/rw8000080/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2022,tikitim-76520,8," It's growing on me
",I have watched three episodes so far and I will say that it is growing on me. I like the first one and then the second one I was on the fence but the third one got my interest again. I think I like the characters the best and even though the dialogue in parts is not realistic it is engaging and keeps my interest. I also like the photography and getting to see parts of London. It kind of takes me there. I would say it is a solid show and hopefully it will get better with even more character to development.,/review/rw8000080/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2022,Ghillie_Forrest,10," Love it
",I like these characters. I like that he lives on a houseboat (and is planning to stay on it -- the one thing that might have spoiled it for me would have been a reconciliation between Max and Astrid). I found Frances Barber irrelevant.,/review/rw8000080/?ref_=tt_urv

7 March 2022,kms-91461,7," Neither 10 nor 3
","I would have never given this show 10. Neither 3. It is sort of average, but good entertainment and quite watchable. Not very handsome, ginger, middle aged and sligthly over weight - the main character, despite all that is rather symphatetic. Some death, some life, as ususal in British criminal story. And this makes it likeable. Good acting, good dialogues, London nicely shown. And that is it.",/review/rw8000080/?ref_=tt_urv

30 March 2022,jacgvn-38197,10," I'm enjoying it thoroughly!
","I really like this show! Very good acting. If you want something more intense, fast-paced, etc. I would suggest MI5 and the like. There is myriad of British detective shows and I really like most of them (far too long to list, going back many years) Adrian Scarborough is great in this role (love the houseboat!) and though I'm not really familiar with this actress, I really like Sonita Henry. I'm looking forward to season 2.",/review/rw8000080/?ref_=tt_urv

27 April 2022,gypsygaldiana,8," Great and has a nice edge...
","Really like this show. Something I really like that other cop shows don't do and that is toward the end, they give you the thought that different people are the perpetrator. But while interviewing them, they become eliminated until the end when the true perpetrator is revealed. Edgy and keeps you on your toes.",/review/rw8000080/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2022,cibrocsa,9," Well Done
","My wife and I watched the first episode, and we both were very pleased with this new show. Sometimes 90 minute shows seem like 60 minutes episodes where much padding has been added to extend, but this kept us involved throughout. Early character development, an interesting plot and good dialog made for a fine premiere.",/review/rw8000080/?ref_=tt_urv

22 February 2022,trademarcdesigns,4," The low end of British police shows
","Typical British police show - except most of those police shows have reasonably credible characters and plot lines. The characters simply don't ring true. Example: the female detective doesn't want to stay at home with her newborn, but not because she's suffering from post-partum depression (which would make sense), but rather because she doesn't think she'll be a good mum. Seriously?",/review/rw8000080/?ref_=tt_urv
25 July 2022,grnwltr-11212,5," One After Another
","There are so many of these short form British procedurals that they have a tendency to bleed (no pun) into each other. This is no better, and no worse, than the rest of the programs that have proliferated over the past decade. The acting is serviceable. Character development is by the numbers (new baby; recent divorce; secondary players barely fleshed out). The four cases in Series One provide few surprises (if you are familiar with this kind of stuff) and are essentially comfort food for brains on autopilot. Six hours to dampen one's expectations. That is, if you come to these four episodes expecting very little you will not be disappointed.",/review/rw8000080/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2022,louisianagrey,," Worth a look
","The bad review bears all the hallmarks of someone who read the synopsis and cast list but didn't actually watch the program and therefore doesn't understand it. OK, it's not the deepest, most thought-provoking programme you'll ever see, but having watched the first I'm looking forward to watching the rest of the series to see how the characters develop, particularly the complex relationship between the protagonist and his estranged partner. The crime-solving is an added bonus!",/review/rw8000080/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2022,ronaldalamascus-90506,7," Mostly Solid.
","Adrian Scarborough is solid as always with just the right touch of quirky and thankfully got us in the suburbs of Chelsea rather than downtown London. And then of course we have all the prerequisite gays, racial issues and relationships that have to be present for today's politically correct presentation reality be damned. The stories themselves have just enough twists and suspects that playing amateur detective is quite entertaining. Perhaps one of the more delightful unexpected characters is the deaf pathologist played by Sophie Stone as again, a pathologist has to be a good character and she has a natural charm and honesty that balances the scenes quite nicely. This could easily be a much higher quality production with less contrived ""diversity"" and more emphasis on the quality of the various characters and stories rather than making sure all the various minorities are represented.",/review/rw8000080/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2022,altereggo123,5," Good, but a little disappointing.
","The brilliant photography of the Chelsea streets and skyline seemed to promise something fresh and smart, but this was a bit formulaic. It is at least the fourth detective series I can name in which the detective lives on a boat, usually after a bad break-up. This doesn't count detectives who live in an RV or detectives who live in an RV and then move to a boat.",/review/rw8000080/?ref_=tt_urv
24 March 2022,mika-82,8," Good so far
","So far the stories have been interesting, good cast of characters with some of my favorite British actors joining as guest characters. I look forward to learning more about the two main characters and seeing more of Chelsea. Hope it continues.",/review/rw8000080/?ref_=tt_urv
