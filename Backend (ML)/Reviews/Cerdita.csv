18 August 2007,thinker1691,7," Museums; "" Where History comes Alive ""
","All Hollywood movies have one thing in common. They have the special ability to make past eras of history, rich, poignant and interesting. That is the premise of this film, ""A Night at The Museum."" It is the simple story of a father, Larry Daley (Ben Stiller) who has developed a strained relation with his son. The boy, like most children wishes his bond with his father was more secure. Instead, Larry dreams of becoming an over-night success with his wild 'get rich' schemes. In doing so he puts in jeopardy the custody of his son. To remedy this situation, Larry takes a job as a night-watchman at a museum. Unbeknownst to him, three aging guards, Cecil, Gus and Reginald (Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney and Bill Cobbs) do not inform him of their larcenous intentions, nor of the 'Special' magic which descends upon the place each night. Because of the three aging veterans of Hollywood and a well-placed Robin Williams, this movie is destined for Classic status. Due to the incredible artistry of special Effects, what the viewer sees is nothing short of wondrous. This is a fantastic movie. If pressed to find a flaw in the film, I'd say, I would have chosen someone like, Jim Carey or Michael Richards for the father/son scenes as Mr. Stiller was a bit artificial. Still, the movie is worth seeing as it is. ****",/review/rw1560387/?ref_=tt_urv

22 December 2006,mreliae,8," Well... I laughed! So did everyone in the theater.
",Don't go into this movie expecting a complex plot and deep insight into the human condition. The story and plot are lightweight but that doesn't matter too much. The characters are likable enough and the situation is definitely full of possibilities. ,/review/rw1560387/?ref_=tt_urv
16 December 2006,dark_lunar_wolf,6," A fun flick!
","I got to see a showing of Night at the Museum last night. I was impressed by the trailers and I got really pumped when I saw people like Stiller, Wilson, Robins, Rudd and more famous comedian actors like Gervais in it.",/review/rw1560387/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2009,TheLittleSongbird,7," Fun and entertaining family film.
","True, it is overlong, some parts are a tad slow particularly the beginning, and it was let down by bad marketing, but on the whole Night At The Museum is a fun and entertaining family film. Some of it is very, very funny, not hilarious, just funny, and Ben Stiller gives a very good account of himself as Larry. The museum characters are very well designed, and it was when they came to life when the film let itself go. Dick Van Dyke and Mickey Rooney are great fun in their roles, but my favourite has to be Robin Williams as Theodore Roosevelt, in one of his more entertaining ""recent"" films. Plus the story is imaginative and fresh.",/review/rw1560387/?ref_=tt_urv
18 December 2006,Deja_Entendu,8," Another movie let-down by bad marketing.
","I came into this movie thinking that it would suck AND disliking Ben Stiller very much. But I thought, hey, free tickets, Monday night, how bad could it be? Well, it wasn't. It was much funnier and had a much better script than I had anticipated. Stiller, famous for being *in* funny situations and not making them, actually acted like a comic character, something of a cross between Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler. Usuaully he's a passive element, but here he propelled the comedy further. Great job. Also, a fantastic group of supporting characters like Gus, Mr. McPhee and Atilla the Hun. The only problem I really had was the son, who was much too perfect and pacific to be of any interest, and was, at most times, quite annoying.",/review/rw1560387/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2006,terrycarter,8," As good a family film as you'll find this holiday
","Slightly overlong - and lacking the perhaps obligatory love interest - this is as good a film as any parent will be able to excite their kids with this holiday period - well certainly in the UK. The film has huge plot holes and probably hundreds of continuity errors but rampaging dinosaurs, goodish CGI and another athletic comic turn from Ben Stiller, together with the gorgeous Carla Gugino make this near perfect Xmas cinematic fair.",/review/rw1560387/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2006,keithclock,7," Great kids movie!
","I think it's really annoying when I read reviews on here of a kids movie and someone tears it apart. Do these people expect to see Oscar award winning performances and production? As for this film, I thought it was really cute. It's perfect for a kid's imagination. I saw the movie at a pre-screening and every kid afterwards was smiling and excitedly talking about the movie. Sure there are some dumb jokes, etc., but overall the movie was great. It was especially cool to see Dick Van Dyke and Mickey Rooney working together.",/review/rw1560387/?ref_=tt_urv

14 May 2020,BabelAlexandria,8," No, The ________ Exhibit is not actually at the Natural History Museum
","The enduring appeal of this movie is fueled by the fantasy of fascinating exhibits coming to life - or back to life - combined with their great characterization. My son Sebastian loved Rexie and Dexter and the Crazy Cowboy and the Roman Soldier. The weakest part by far is the cliched father-guard played by Ben Stiller, who displays his usual adolescent hijinks, which clash with the movie's vibe of child-like wonder.",/review/rw1560387/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2006,terperin,8," Very Funny
","I saw it with a big group of friends (all in their early 20's) on opening night, and we all thought it was hilarious. It wasn't until a few days later that I heard reviews for it that were less than favorable. I thought the movie was funny and light-hearted. Yeah, some parts may not have seemed to make sense, but come on. It's a movie about exhibits in a museum coming to life - I don't think the creators were aiming for realism. I thought Ben Stiller did a great job, as did other supporting actors, especially the security guards. Everyone in the theater clapped when it was over, so they must have liked it too. I would definitely recommend it.",/review/rw1560387/?ref_=tt_urv

1 January 2007,DaRick89,5," A serviceable film which has enjoyable aspects - however, it is wholly formulaic and occasionally cringe-inducing
","When I first saw A Night at the Museum at the movies, I didn't know whether I really liked it or not. In fact, my reaction to it was so mixed that it confounded me. Now that I have managed to formulate an opinion, I can proceed with writing this review. That being said, my expectations for A Night at the Museum were hardly great. Indeed, my friend and I only saw it because we had, much to our chagrin, arrived too early to see the critically-acclaimed Borat or Casino Royale. We decided to see it because of the presence of the usually steady Ben Stiller. Despite his star billing, I expected A Night at the Museum to be standard family fare; not bad, just predictable and formulaic. My expectations were fulfilled. There were bad scenes, mostly involving Stiller and his son, which introduced overpowering, cringe-inducing sentiment. The plot is also uninspired, revolving around a stereotypical loser with a downtrodden son and marital difficulties. (wait on - is this a reprise of the appalling Jingle All The Way?) The saddest part is that my friend and I managed to telegraph key areas of the plot and also many of the various subplots. The rap music which was dubbed over the credits was also out of place with the rest of the movie. Not only can I see the presence of the rap music potentially turning off parents from seeing the movie, but the rap-c*** also left a bad taste in my mouth.",/review/rw1560387/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2007,EThompsonUMD,5," Great idea for a comedy, but they forgot the funny parts.
","In Night At the Museum, Ben Stiller plays his usual role as a good-hearted schlemiel thrust into a humiliating situation that he ultimately emerges from with a small measure of heroic dignity. In this instance, his character, Larry Daley, is an out of work weekend Dad who is about to be evicted from his apartment once again and thus lose the last shred of admiration his ten year old son has for him. To keep both the apartment and the son's affections, he accepts a job as night watchman at a New York City Natural History Museum, where an Egyptian tablet has for some decades administered a powerful magic spell that causes history literally to ""come alive.""

16 June 2007,zardoz-13,9," A Night To You Won't Forget!!!.
","Children that haven't seen the Robin Williams fantasy ""Jumanji"" (1995) may enjoy the supernatural shenanigans in the new Ben Stiller comedy fantasy ""Night at the Museum"" more than their elders. Like the ""Jumanji"" inspired space epic ""Zathura"" (2005), ""Night At the Museum"" plunges average everyday mortals—usually a single father and his children (numbers vary)--into paranormal peril, but the principals don't play games in this variation on a theme. As entertaining and resembles one of its best computer-generated special effects—the rambunctious skeleton dinosaur that prefers to play fetch with one of its own bones like a dog. Meaning, ""Night at the Museum"" qualifies as bare-bones buffoonery that shuns literal logic for outlandish laughs. This 108 minute nonsense relies on lowest common denominator comedy with a PG rating. Ben Stiller makes himself appear suitably ridiculous as a divorced dad who wants to impress his impressionable young son. Stiller's on-again, off-again co-star Owen Wilson, best known for ""Wedding Crashers,"" has a small role—literally speaking--but gets in a few jibes at Stiller's expense. Wilson plays a pint-sized cowpoke in a railroad diorama who clashes with an empire-building Roman centurion (Steve Coogan of ""Around the World in 80 Days"") from another diorama. The two constantly clash with each until our sincere, underdog hero convinces them to stop fighting each other and help him with the animals. Classic TV comedian Dick Van Dyke and classic screen comedian Mickey Rooney steal a couple of scenes from Stiller as villains forged in the ""Home Alone"" mold. Although it relies lavishly on its special effects to compensate for its skeletal storyline and its superficial characters, ""Night at the Museum"" boasts more than enough breakneck adventure. Stiller gravitates between two gals, his ex-wife Erica (Kim Raver of TV's ""24"") and an attractive museum docent Rebecca (Carla Gugino of ""Snake Eyes""), but the movie gives these relationships short shrift. The father and son relationship at the heart of the drama doesn't fare any better, serving largely as a plot device to advance the action. Unlike both ""Jumanji"" and ""Zathura,"" ""Night at the Museum"" also contains armies of Lilliputian soldiers along the lines of Jonathan Swift's ""Gulliver's Travels."" Clearly, ""Pink Panther"" director Shawn Levy and co-scenarists Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon of TV's ""Reno: 911"" had their work cut out for them. They fleshed out Croatian artist Milan Trenc's 32-page illustrated novel, published back in 1993 by Barrons, and targeted primarily at pre-schoolers. Undoubtedly, Levy and company added the farcical scene where a small monkey urinates contemptuously on our hapless hero.",/review/rw1560387/?ref_=tt_urv

","Larry Daley needs to get a job quickly if his ex-wife is to allow him to keep seeing his son; he finds a job working as the night-watchman at a New York museum. It turns out that it is no ordinary museum; each night all of the exhibits come to life! This means he has to contend with a rampaging T-Rex skeleton, assorted animals, Attila the Hun as well as miniature cowboys and Romans who want to fight each other. He does get some help though; from a waxwork of Teddy Roosevelt. He learns that the strange goings on are due to a valuable Egyptian tablet. After his first night he is ready to quit but doesn't because of his son; after the second he is almost fired then on the third night he invites his son to see his work this will be his toughest night yet as he must unite the living exhibits to thwart a robbery.",/review/rw1560387/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2019,tabuno,6," A Flawed But Entertaining Family Movie
","30 December 2006. This Jumanji (1995) like growing up tale for an adult male (Ben Stiller) taps into some nice special effects and family value themes that just don't seem to mesh completely. Ben sometimes ends up with his dumb, silly stereotyped character from earlier films. And the casting of criminal characters are a abit of a disappointing shock for older audience members, especially without warning or clues. The female protagonists in this movie are underdeveloped. With good intent, this fantasy world of a museum coming to life had a lot of excitement, cute scenes but it failed to deliver the potential as a classic family comedy fantasy. Ben Stiller's development as a character seemed to be uneven and inconsistent. And unlike Jumanji, it seemed to revolve around the exploits of one man, alone who had to grow up. There was some nice plausible explanations for the use of English language, yet even so it was unnecessarily inconsistent. Fun and entertaining, the movie doesn't reach the levels of its possibilities. Six out of Ten Stars.",/review/rw1560387/?ref_=tt_urv

","Ben Stiller stars in this offbeat family film about Larry Daley, a divorced guy trying to make it ""big."" He jumps from job to job trying to hit the ""big one"" and be successful. When his son expresses his concern of changing careers so often and moving, Larry decides to settle down and take a night shift guard position at the Museum of Natural History. Much to Larry's surprise there is magical artifact that brings all the different ancient things to life at night. Struggling with this new responsibility, we see Stiller fumbling around and trying to communicate to these living artifacts like prehistoric cavemen, prehistoric T-Rex, etc. There are some comedic elements that could bring some giggles but the story is a little flat and a bit lacking in character development.",/review/rw1560387/?ref_=tt_urv

25 December 2006,zetes,3," Awful script mucks good idea
","The idea of this was fun and promising: the new night guard at the natural history museum discovers that all the exhibits come to life at night. The previews were even actually amusing. Unfortunately, the script is just painfully awful. It sets up all these rules in this universe and doesn't even try to follow them. It commits the egregious crime of making veteran actors Dick Van Dyke and Mickey Rooney, along with lesser known Bill Cobbs (he was the magic janitor in The Hudsucker Proxy) into villains, who, I might add, have little believable motivation for the things they do. What's really funny is that the screenwriters are Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant, who are the creators of the enormously funny television show (and upcoming movie) Reno 911. They apparently slum writing for mainstream movies, and they must think very little of the audience. Their screen writing credits also include the masterpieces The Pacifier, Herbie: Fully Loaded, and Let's Go to Prison. I guess their underestimation must be on the money, though, as my movie-going companions seemed to enjoy it (they were not children; and children, for what it's worth, might actually like this okay), even through the dozens of plot inconsistencies (so the wax Teddy Roosevelt isn't really Roosevelt, but Sacajawea is the real Sacajawea?). The script is so bad, there are several loose ends that they forget to tie up, until the end credits, that is. But I was already heading fast for the door and couldn't be bothered to find out if they tidied everything up. Somehow I doubt it.",/review/rw1560387/?ref_=tt_urv
