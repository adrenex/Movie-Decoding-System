1 March 2020,Med-Jasta,10," Really really good.
","The feel of the show it great. The clothes, the music, the way they talk... The cinematography is amazing. I watched this show in the dead of winter and kept thinking that it was summer outside because the colors of the show conveyed that perfectly. The characters are great and their relationships are really good. Will Arnet is fantastic.",/review/rw7117545/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2020,zwolsa,9," Must watch
","I love this show and I can't even tell why. Especially the first season. I've seen it 3 times in 3 years. I guess it's the atmosphere. These two friends who live thru the days, somehow disconnected from the rat race. And it's definitely the dialogues. You don't get the finesse and the oftentimes silent humor or sarcasm when you don't pay attention. I wish it would have been more appreciated and successful. There are not many shows that are ignoring what the mainstream expects and that are just telling a story.",/review/rw7117545/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2019,PCT1970,7," Arnett Is Flaked
","Arnett and Chappell have created a considerable dramedy series. The duo also pen the series first season. Great direction, writing, cinematography, setting, soundtrack and acting. All of the artists involved deliver significant performances. Arnett stands out with his innate ability to deliver comedic dialogue in sometimes serious, sarcastic and subtle ways. There are several guest stars in the series which contribute to the humor. The plot is set in Venice Beach, CA and revolves around Chip. Chip is a man in recovery from an incident that occurred ten years earlier. Through his recovery he lives a stock lifestyle and has surrounded himself with his best friend Dennis, a stoner friend Cooler, his former sponsor who is a cop George and his sometimes love interest Kara. He is also still married to his very successful wife Tilly. Suddenly Chip's routine life is turned upside down upon the arrival of a girl named London. Everyone around Chip views him as a self serving individual who can never quite tell the truth, but at the same time often seek life choices advisement from him. They seem to tolerate him because of his likability and love for his community. Initially it is Dennis that pines over London, but as usual Chip's self serving habit leans his eyes towards her and he always gets his way. Everyone in Venice Beach knows what each other is up to much like a small town. Chip's web of little white lies always catch up with him and little does he know, but London didn't just arrive in Venice Beach by coincidence. While Chip is living his everyday existence his sobriety is constantly being tested by topics such as his wife, the gentrification of Venice Beach and many more events in life. The plot is emotional, clever, witty, crisp and insightful. Both seasons have delivered the goods. This is an indelible series and one of the better in it's genre",/review/rw7117545/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2017,kynick2,8," Here we go.
","I would have preferred...I even expected a little bit of Gob Bluth but Chip is cool in all his flawed-ness. I like the show, it feels like a refreshing slice of real life starring real people. Bits and pieces of the show remind me of my friends and I at various points in our lives. I love the fact that nothing is rushed (relationships) Now on to the real star of the show...The soundtrack. Every single episode I realize how fortunate I am to discover new music and new artists. I spent so much of the show looking up the songs I heard. Not since Gossip Girl have a watched a show with so much good music.",/review/rw7117545/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2017,johan-herstad,8," Underrated and misunderstood
","This show is certainly flawed in some aspects, but that is also part of its nature. That might be difficult to understand. It can be a bit of a mess, just like the main character and the spirit of the show. ",/review/rw7117545/?ref_=tt_urv
18 March 2018,drinkdrunkthedifferencei,9," Painfully good
","It saddens me that this show isn't hailed by critics and viewers alike. Those looking for a knee-slapping comedy will have to look elsewhere. Not to say it isn't funny, because it is - but the humour is usually low-key, often muted by an underlying sadness or ennui. But it's all so beautiful. The setting and ambience give me deep, long nostalgia pangs, even though I've never lived in Venice or anywhere near it. People riding around in shorts, getting by on a shoestring, struggling with honesty and friendships and knowing what to do with their life... well, I loved it. Ignore the critics (and get past the first episode, which isn't the best).",/review/rw7117545/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2016,freebirdisgod,8," Six Degrees of Humor and Heart
","I saw this on Netflix, I decided to give it a chance. So I watched the first episode and I was shocked at how good it really is. This is not slapstick humor nor is it over the top. The lead role is Chip, he is a 40 something guy who runs a stool shop in downtown Venice. He is a troubled individual who simply survives life. He is a recovering alcoholic with a tragic past and yet he chooses to endure even if his existence is not entirely humorous. There is a great deal of emotion with the characters, including his roommate Dennis and his love interest London.",/review/rw7117545/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2021,aliciaphillips-88935,10," Sticks with you
","I am still thinking of this series many months (and other series) later. I laughed, I cried, I loved the complex characters.",/review/rw7117545/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2016,writetopcat,7," Drama/Comedy better than I expected
","Set in Venice CA the show centers around a recovering alcoholic named Chip and his friends. Since Chip is played by Will Arnett I imagined the show would have a lot more comedy, one liners, etc. I took a shot at it on Netflix even though I was afraid it might lack enough substance to hold my attention. Sometimes comedies rely far too much on witty lines and predictable gags. But FLAKED is not just a vehicle for snappy lines and comebacks. Most of the characters have enough depth to keep me interested. There are a few which are kind of one dimensional like Cooler, a stoner type. He is shallow and not too bright and not too with it and sometimes irritating because of it. But he adds comic relief. ",/review/rw7117545/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2018,kellyrned,10," Unique Storyline That Keeps You Wanting More
","I started watching this show last night & like reading a damn good book, I couldn't put it down. I watched thru to season 2. The acting is extremely good, the storyline is original and well played out, and I never heard of Will Arnett (sorry) before this show. He is amazingly talented and delivers an Emmy-worthy performance. I'm shocked I've missed the boat with his previous acting skills. The girls who plays London and Kara are talented actresses! The role of Dennis is just a great addition. Every one of them perform their roles at its best, & it's very enlightening to have seen Kirstie Alley & Heather play in small roles. Just a really good show!",/review/rw7117545/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2016,snowabode,9," Arnett has found it
","Along too, with all the people needed to create this sort of thing and put it in front of us, Will Arnett has found a real gem. I haven't been able to really enjoy a TV comedy with him since Arrested Development. Now, I want the next episode right away.",/review/rw7117545/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2016,rexstone2010,8," Fantastic Debut for Only 8 Episodes
","The plot line of the show is unique and dark, yet humorous. Disguised as a typical comedy drama, this show is quite an emotional roller-coaster with a sensational soundtrack to compliment. It does have a ""hipster"" vibe to it, but that's just the culture of California and specifically the character of Venice. To complain about that is just silly. ",/review/rw7117545/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2016,imbendingtime,6," Has Promise
","I really want to like this show. The acting is great. The writing is great. I like Will Arnett in the lead role. Like the bro love between the main characters. The trouble I'm having is with the casting of the female leads. Really? 40 something, dead beat guys, with no real jobs, no real purpose and coloured backgrounds are pulling smoking hot 20 something, hipster girls? Really?",/review/rw7117545/?ref_=tt_urv
4 December 2020,isskrisktyliai,8," Light and entertaining
","This is a good watch and definitely not just a comedy but so much more. I would say it is drama about life. It is quite standard and cliche story but there is nothing else bad to say about these series. The acting is good, the music is nice and there are many funny moments. Hoping for more seasons.",/review/rw7117545/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2016,dannerkins,7," Dark and painfully witty. Will Arnett shines as a dark star.
",I've been a fan of Will Arnett for years. But this is the first time we're seeing the true range of his acting. Chip is dark and complex in a way that is not appealing except for the fact that Will Arnett somehow manages to make a very unlikable person desirable. There are moments when watching Will Arnett as Chip that makes you completely forget that you're looking at what is usually a very funny man.,/review/rw7117545/?ref_=tt_urv
11 February 2018,rick-183-641615,9," I hope it never ends
","As soon as I started the show, it began pulling me in. Now I try to watch the episodes as slowly as possible. I'm on an anti-binge. I don't want to run out and have to wait for more. The show has heart and it shows a flawed human being trying to stay as straight as he can amongst a group of broken friends. The chemistry is wonderful and the show is addictive.",/review/rw7117545/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2016,jetohu,9," Quietly charming and engaging
","It has a very relaxed-paced and is character/setting-driven. It is incredibly charming if you give it a chance. I decided I liked it about episode 3, but really fell in love with it by episode 5. I really enjoyed its laid back vibe, quietly angst-ridden characters, and the Venice/southern California setting. Personally, it was refreshing to not be bombarded by slick, wise- cracking main characters or overly insecure nerdy types so popular these days. Thanks for that, writers! The setting is also a big part of the show. I felt like I was there in Venice with the characters. The show does a good job of creating the sense of ""being there"" which is incredibly enjoyable. The great indie-type music used in the scene transitions is a bonus.",/review/rw7117545/?ref_=tt_urv
26 July 2018,toniegarcia,10," Love at first episode - Binge Time
","Intelligent, well written, great story line. Could ramble on but I instantly want to be transported into this beautiful mess of life. I expected it to be similar to Arrested Development but it definitely is it's own show. Great acting and dark comedic delivery makes this worth giving it a shot.",/review/rw7117545/?ref_=tt_urv

15 February 2022,davesjbb,10," A viewer lesson learned.....
","This started out painful as the first few episodes show a bunch of people with seemingly no income nor assets somehow managing to live blocks from the ocean. With nothing else to watch, I stuck with it and an interesting story developed. Then a series of unforeseen surprises emerged that explained where their support came from and introduced some stunning revelations. So by sticking with it, I had a great experience watching this series. Kudos to the writers and cast for delivering a refreshing story in the perfect length (14 episodes only). I learned from this series and a couple others (Wayne, Love, Patriot) that you really need to give these things a chance before you judge.",/review/rw7117545/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2016,jcrawfordor,8," Beautiful and strange

18 July 2016,DerrrrDerp,6," Anyone who has ever been part of AA/Al-Anon
","and didn't drink the Koolaide or buy into it wholesale, might appreciate this show. It's dark, dry and real. There's always ""that guy"" (many of them) who talk the program and really ""work it"" whether they are still drinking or not. They also love to work the 13th step, which consists of preying on younger and vulnerable women new to the program. They are indeed flakes. AA is full of them. They talk love and acceptance but in my experience, ego stroking, controlling their sponsees, and bragging is the real name of the game. I don't begrudge the community many of these folks get at AA. Most of them need serious psychological help they can't afford. They do get help but the program isn't entirely healthy. World wide membership is way down, their funds are way down.

31 October 2016,mr_big17,8," Under-appreciated Netflix Original Production
","Will Arnett stars in this beautiful comedy/drama Netflix Original. The whole show is about change: Chip (Arnett) refuses to change anything about his life. He rides a bike, does not have a cellphone, sells the same stool since 2008. When his friends, entourage and town try to move on from the way things are, he will do whatever is in his power to prevent that. Also, the past is literally chasing Chip.

1 June 2021,davidsmovingcastle,9," Understated, doesn't try to be anything other than a great TV show.
","What I really like about Flaked is that it doesn't try to pander to gender, race, sexuality, woke politics, and whatever else is popular or being posted on social media garbage holes...it's just a good TV show, and it's a story told well.",/review/rw7117545/?ref_=tt_urv
12 July 2021,bxfbkrdz,9," Will Arnett Nailed AA Hypocrisy and 13th Steppers to a Tee! Love it$
","Those who aren't familiar with the vernacular of Alcoholics Anonymous will have a difficult time understanding the inside jokes Arnett brilliantly pulls off in this series. The very first words of his monologue indicate a clear understanding of how ""the program"" works. It's brilliant! Think not? Attend 6 months of meetings as an ""observer"" and truly observe. Every character, victims and perpetrators alike, are accurately portrayed in this series. Those who don't get it it are lucky. It means they've yet to be exposed to AA and all its 12-step offshoots. Chip's character is a conglomerate of all: hypocrisy at its finest yet somehow Arnett gives the viewer just enough authenticity to somehow think this guy can still be saved. It's all a lie of course because ""nothing changes if nothing changes"", right? Accurate and true to the characters. Well done.",/review/rw7117545/?ref_=tt_urv
