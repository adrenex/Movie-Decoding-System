14 January 2006,ccthemovieman-1,7," Much Better Than Expected
","Even though I had heard good things about this film, I didn't expect that much....but was very surprised. It's good, very entertaining and worth watching. The humor is excellent with some very funny things in here and very clever in spots. It helps a lot to know your Looney Tunes characters and it helps a great deal to know your film history. References to old films and characters are everywhere. For that reason, I would recommend this film for classic movie fans. They'll be pleasantly surprised.",/review/rw5213345/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2003,filmbuff-36,8," Slam dunks ""Space Jam"" and outdoodles ""Cool World""
","Ever since ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" hit theaters in 1988, Hollywood has tried to replicate the formula of placing animated characters in the real world and vice-versa. ""Space Jam"" was loved when first released but now seems like a feature length commercial for Michael Jordan's career. ""The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle"" worked on a spot-the-cameo level but little else. ""Cool World"" has for the most part blissfully faded from memory.",/review/rw5213345/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2003,dtb,10," What The Yosemite Sam Were Those Naysayers Talking About?!
","What movie did those negative reviewers see?! It sure wasn't the affectionate, screamingly funny, devilishly clever animation/live-action comedy-adventure my family and I saw! Perhaps you need to be a Looney Tunes lover like our household and director Joe Dante to best appreciate this zany romp, because when we weren't laughing hysterically over the wall-to-wall gags (often delightfully inventive, like the sequence in the Louvre and the space climax -- and don't you dare leave before the end credits finish rolling!), the various pop culture references had us grinning, and not just the cameos by more obscure Looney Tunes characters (and I don't just mean Nasty Canasta and Cottontail Smith as Vegas casino owner Yosemite Sam's strong-arm boys, either!); spy flicks and action-adventure flicks come in for some sharply funny ribbing, too. Also, keep your eyes peeled for a couple of other beloved animated characters owned by Time-Warner these days. The humans are up to the task of acting opposite the irrepressible 'toons, too (Joe Dante fans, keep an eye out for cameos by his favorite actors and a certain B-movie director), especially hilariously ridiculous villain Steve Martin (as the head of the Acme Corporation -- which explains a lot :-) and Brendan Fraser, who good-naturedly sends up his own role in a certain movie franchise as well as simply being full of the muffiny goodness that long ago won our household's collective heart! :-) Don't listen to those flinthearted critics -- just see LOONEY TUNES... and have a big ol' laughariffic time!",/review/rw5213345/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2004,Thomas_Veil,10," Of course, you realize this means war!
","I have to admit having approached this movie with as much trepidation as anticipation. After all, Mel Blanc is gone, Chuck Jones is gone, and the hallowed Looney Tunes franchise now resides in the hands of younger players.",/review/rw5213345/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2003,supercygnus,7," Loved it, as will most fans of the classic cartoons
","Back in Action really captured that snarky wit we all love from Bugs, the put upon egomaniac that is Daffy and many of the other great traits of the original crew from the glory days of the Looney Tunes. Dante really knows this territory and his affection for the material is very apparent. He is the ONLY logical choice for the director (watch his older films for countless references to the Looney Tune gang). The humans are all game, but never upstage the real stars (Bugs and the Gang of course), rather they simply add to the film and give us at least a few flesh and blood characters for us to relate to. Fraser is once again both heroic and likable/goofy, Elfman is sexy and a bit cynical in fresh change of pace from her more docile ""Dharma"" character  from t.v. and Martin is like a human cartoon character himself. He hasn't been this ""out there"" and unpredictable since his celebrated stand-up days. He does anything but play it safe, and ends up with a memorable, if not a little eccentric performance. Timothy Dalton as Fraser's Dad is a real stand-out both referencing and spoofing his 007 past, without scuffing up himself or the good Bond name. The fact he plays it so straight really adds to the quality of his scenes and jokes (love the ""slapping himself"" scene!). There are some really inspired bits here; funny and clever. The scene in the Louvre was both gorgeous to watch and so funny I laughed harder than I have at the theaters for a while. The entire outer space sequence is also just jammed packed with so many great bits you'll need to see it twice just to take it all in. It's unfortunate this little gem of a flick has been gobbled up in the busy holiday release schedule, but fans should be pleased this film was made at all and will be able to own and enjoy it in the near future. I loved it, as did my 12 year old sister, my girlfriend and the theater I saw it with. Sad there will probably not be another large scale Looney production after this, but we have this one to treasure. I believe over time, and certainly on home video / DVD, Back in Action will find it's audience. Like all great cult films, it will probably take some time for it to be discovered, but fans will keep it alive. examples? Big Trouble in Little China, Tron, Buckaroo Banzai, Austin Powers, Swingers and F/X are just a handful of films that did very poor or just ok at the box office, but went on to great success on home video and in many cases garnered RABID cult followings that have made them favorites with fans even today.",/review/rw5213345/?ref_=tt_urv
14 November 2003,KYWES,5," Fun to watch but watch close
","The real fun of this movie is to see if you can catch all the gags in it such as the show frog eating flys and the man sneaking away with him as in the cartoon. I'll have to watch it again to catch them all. It was also fun to see them use stuff from other films and shows such as the Daleks saying ""exterminate, exterminate"" What a hoot. The movie is so so, good, not great IMNHO and they did give plenty of safe eye candy for the men in the audience.",/review/rw5213345/?ref_=tt_urv

26 August 2016,Leofwine_draca,5," Breathless tribute to the Warner cartoons
","LOONEY TUNES: BACK IN ACTION was Joe Dante's live action tribute to the Warner Brothers cartoons he loved as a kid, made in respect to Chuck Jones, the famous animator who had recently died. Dante went on record to say how much he had hated SPACE JAM for ruining those cartoon characters (and it's hard to disagree with him), so this was his chance to make amends. The problem with the film is, ironically, Warner Brothers themselves. They refused to give Dante much in the way of creative control so what we get is largely a generic piece of junk. Certainly the scenes involving the constantly mugging actors Brendan Fraser and Jenna Elfman are largely wince-inducing and never have you seen such irritating lead characters. And the less said about Steve Martin's villain the better - what on Earth was that all about, anyway?",/review/rw5213345/?ref_=tt_urv

14 July 2021,aidanratesmovies,9," Underrated
","Clever, incredibly meta, and very upbeat- Looney Tunes Back in Action is a film that is timely as it is timeless. Speaking of time, I felt this film was far ahead of its own time. Its meta exploitation of the infamous cartoon characters from Warner Bros. Not only is amusing, but is often downright hilarious. There are so many fun and ingenious gags throughout the film that there is no chance you'll be able to catch them all the first time around. Brendan Fraser leads the human cast throughout the film and is honestly a perfectly campy match for the toons on screen, not to mention he also does some great uncredited work as Taz himself. Jenna Elfman is nothing special, her performance and/or character feeling a bit forced at time, and the character itself losing its depth as it goes on. Steve Martin is exuberant to say the least in his villainous head of ACME role, as well as Joan Cusack in her smaller but largely standout-ish role as 'Mother.' The film is incredibly entertaining, but it loses some of its charisma as it reaches the end. I feel the first half of the film is definitely stronger in definition than the second, but the second is still thankfully entertaining enough to get the job done, even with it being slightly artificial in its way of doing so. The animation is fantastic as always, and there are quite a few references to other Warner properties that I did enjoy. There are a few dated jokes here and there as well, but thankfully nothing horrendous. In the end, Looney Tunes Back in Action is an underrated delight that just might be the best feature film of the characters to date.",/review/rw5213345/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2004,Buddy-51,," Fairly dreadful film
","I bow to no one in my love and admiration for those classic Warner Brothers cartoons of the 1940's and 1950's. Like so many of my generation, I was virtually raised on these works from infancy on up. Yet, for those of us who are die-hard aficionados, 'Looney Tunes: Back in Action' is a decidedly depressing experience, proving, once again, that when it comes to revisiting one's childhood, a person truly can't go home again.",/review/rw5213345/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2016,utgard14,5," ""Nice of Wal-Mart to provide these Wal-Mart beverages in return for us saying Wal-Mart so many times.""
","An attempt at bringing Looney Tunes into the 21st Century (why would we want to do that?), brought to us by the master of nostalgia Joe Dante. Lots of cameos and in-jokes as you would expect from Dante. Also just about every character from a popular WB property is represented, from Scooby Doo to Batman to Robby the Robot, as well as all of the Looney Tunes characters, of course. The live action stuff is hit and miss, with Jenna Elfman and Brendan Fraser likable enough but others like Steve Martin coming across as annoying in their attempts to be funny. The Looney Tunes are all 'off' to me, a huge fan of the original cartoons. These characters just seem hollow copies at best and, at worst, they're bizarrely out-of-character. I especially don't like Daffy in this. It's like someone never saw any of his cartoons, just read a brief description about him and wrote from there. Anyway, I can see a lot of other people really loved this. I don't, obviously. It's fine, I mean, but it just feels like it's trying too hard. I rarely laughed at it. It's more (occasionally) amusing than consistently funny. It looks good, though.",/review/rw5213345/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2004,CuriosityKilledShawn,10," Quite frankly, the BEST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!

21 February 2010,TheLittleSongbird,8," Enormously entertaining, with flaws along the way, but just great fun
","I wasn't expecting this film to be as good as it was. It was funny, original and just really entertaining. It does have its flaws, the story has a tendency to become a tad too loud and a little uneven in pace and Steve Martin does overact as Mr Chairman. But along the way there is some great dialogue, very good visual effects and a great music score from the late Jerry Goldsmith. The Looney Tunes characters are stellar, thanks to the lively vocal turns from Joe Alaskey, and have some classic scenes like the chase through the Louvre where they leap into paintings and transformed into the style of artists like Salvador Dali and Edvard Munch. The live acting was not bad at all, Brendan Fraser is an appealing lead, and Jenna Elfman has her moments as Kate. Overall, this is a good film, and I do think it is better than ""Space Jam"", but I did like that film too. 8/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw5213345/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2003,duefiori,5," Flat, disappointing and wooden
","Forget ""Roger Rabbit"", but forget also ""Space Jam"". It is so sad when three great actors like Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and Steve Martin blatantly ""do it for the > money"" (or the carrots, or whatever they pay Daffy with). All three of them do a really poor standard performance... The human villain thinks it's enough to act stupid  to look like a cartoon, the two toons seem to justify wooden acting with pretending to be human. A recent Hollywood fashion is an attitude like ""Hey, let's get something that worked in the past, cut some stupid expenses like a decent screenwriter, and let's be back in the big bucks again! Just put in some expensive-looking effects and the morons won't notice!"" - Matrix 2.1 and 2.2 as a case in point. And the effects are marginally under standard, too. Bottom line, I definitely didn't like it; make it 5/10, and just thanks to the only true professional there: Vile E. Coyote, great as usual (and quoting himself, they pay him WAY too little).",/review/rw5213345/?ref_=tt_urv

","My first question after exiting the screening room for ""Looney Tunes: Back in Action"" was: How did this happen? How did such a disaster form with such a talented director and cast behind a film with such looney potential? I don't know. But for whatever reason there may be, ""Looney Tunes: Back in Action"" is merely a poor piece of family entertainment--a pale shadow of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit,"" and yes, even ""Space Jam,"" which--although bashed by the critics--was much funnier, fresher, and more entertaining (not to mention more cohesive) than this blend of sporadic, high-energy jokes that fly by before you can even catch them.",/review/rw5213345/?ref_=tt_urv

12 September 2005,jboothmillard,3," Looney Tunes: Back in Action
","I thought Space Jam was a good idea for a film, mixing animation with live action, especially Looney Tunes. Unfortunately this sequel from director Joe Dante (Gremlins) is the most corny and hardly funny animated and live action film I have probably ever seen. Basically Brendan Fraser as DJ Drake dreams of having an adventure and being a professional stuntman, then he discovers with help from Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck (both Joe Alaskey) that his Dad, Damien Drake (Timothy Dalton) is a spy (obviously). He also discovers that The Chairman (Steve Martin) plans to do something evil. The only really funny bit I remember is the bit where Bugs, Daffy and Elmer Fudd run through that melting clocks painting, and they melt, like the picture. Also, it is nice to see some favourite Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies characters, but it is still a very corny and not very good sequel to Space Jam. Daffy Duck was number 50, Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies number number 20 and Bugs Bunny number 10 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Adequate!",/review/rw5213345/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2019,abalpn-99472,10," What's up, Doc? The funniest movie with Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck! I still like it!
",It's just like watching Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Warner Bros. Pictures did a good job making the film. Bugs and Daffy are still my favorite Looney Tunes and I've been watching them when I was a kid. I watched the film and I enjoyed it. The action and humor were great. Brendan and Jenna were hilarious. Steve Martin was also crazy and funny as the villainous Mr. Chairman. Timothy Dalton was in this one and the plot was just like a James Bond film. Mr. Chairman and the Acme corporation taking over the world. No matter what the plot is all about; I still like it. There were critics who disliked this film. I would watch it again on YouTube.,/review/rw5213345/?ref_=tt_urv
