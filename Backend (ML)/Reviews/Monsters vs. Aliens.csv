5 October 2021,Calicodreamin,6," Actually pretty good
","For a suspense thriller this was actually pretty good. There were definitely a few ""what are you doing moments?!"" and Megan's perfect makeup was distracting, but overall more good than bad. The thrills kept up throughout and the acting was decent. The storyline was unique and had a few cool moments.",/review/rw7085548/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2021,Floated2,8," Highly entertaining thriller
",There seems to be much backlash over this film and the character of Megan Fox due to her not cutting off her husband's hand using the vase or sharp edges from the picture frame. Where people rate the film low simply due to that.,/review/rw7085548/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2021,paul_haakonsen,6," Entertaining thriller...
","The 2021 movie ""Till Death"" definitely felt like a good old fashioned thriller, for better or worse. So if you enjoyed the thrillers from back then, then chances are you'll also like ""Till Death"".",/review/rw7085548/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2021,nairtejas,7," Will Keep You Hooked
","I went in with very low expectations but Till Death and its leader Megan Fox surprised me. The mystery of a woman handcuffed to the corpse of her dead husband is interesting, but it gets more as the story unfolds. Kept me hooked till the end with some clever writing in the final act and excellent action overall.",/review/rw7085548/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2021,UniqueParticle,8," Daunting, suspenseful and under appreciated!
",I don't understand the hate at all Till Death is pretty solid. This is fun thriller that I crave especially during the Halloween season and I'm glad I don't have to pay because of Netflix which I rarely use. Sure there's a few dumb parts but that doesn't make it as bad as some say not by a long shot! Megan Fox is great in horror she should do it more.,/review/rw7085548/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2021,apryla-58795,4," Her makeup looks perfect throughout
","Here's all you need to know about this...Fox is married to a dirty DA. She has an affair...he finds out. He gets back at her by taking her to their remote lake house handcuffing himself to her and then shooting himself in the head. Before he did that he made sure to remove anything from the house that she could use to cut herself free from him. Just in case she managed to get that far he also siphoned all the gas from the car so she couldn't leave. And just to make sure she didn't somehow survive otherwise he hires two goons to kill her. She manages to elude them throughout the whole movie until help finally arrives. And she does all of it in perfect makeup. She went to bed in her makeup the night before this happened and when a woman does that she wakes up with most of it off or really smeared. But nope still perfect. Then when her husband killed himself his blood splatters all over her face. She washes it off and still perfect makeup. She runs around and gets beat up and thrown around and even gets dragged into ice water but still managed to retain that perfectly applied makeup look all the way to the end. I get that Fox is only utilized because she's pretty (it's not for her acting...fight me) but things need to be slightly realistic. This isn't the worst thing I've ever seen even though watching Fox try to act is painful but it sure isn't something that needs to be on the ""top 100 movies you must see before you die"" list.",/review/rw7085548/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2021,wisemanfromtowne,4," Watchable....once.
","To call it garbage as I have read from other reviews is a bit nonsensical and juvenile. This movie wasn't garbage at all. It's watchable....once. A heist film with all the predictable ingredients starring Megan Fox, who by the way did a decent job as lead in this small budget film. I put this into the category of an above average Lifetime movie thriller.",/review/rw7085548/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2021,Tweekums,7," A taut little thriller
","It is Emma and Mark's eleventh wedding anniversary. Things haven't been going for them lately but he takes her out to dinner, gives her a necklace then drives her to the remote lakeside house where they had happy times before. It looks as if he intends to try to rekindle their romance... until the next morning when she finds herself chained to him. Moments later he shoot himself in the head! She is miles from anywhere, the temperature is well below freezing and Mark has made sure there are no obvious means of breaking the chain or driving away. To make matters worse Mark has contacted a couple of brothers, one of whom has just served ten years for attacking Emma, and told them she holds the key to a fortune. It won't be easy for her to get away from them and avoid freezing to death.",/review/rw7085548/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2021,nooshinnorouzi,6," Her make-up!!!
",Just wondered how her makeup remains untouched till the end of the movie! That's hilarious ðŸ¤£,/review/rw7085548/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2021,Top_Dawg_Critic,8," Flawed, but also impressively put together by newb filmmakers.
","I must say, that the directing by S. K. Dale - in his first full length feature film, was outstanding. Then you have this film as the third ever writing credit by Jason Carvey. These two managed to give us an intense edge-of-your seat thrilling well paced 88 mins of impressive filmmaking, with what I'm certain was a low budget. They even managed to put some seasoned filmmakers' recent big-budget blockbuster releases to shame (e.g. Soderbergh's star-studded No Sudden Move). Mad props and respect to Dale and Carvey for pulling this little gem off so well.",/review/rw7085548/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2021,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,3," Weekend at Bernie's meets Home Alone
","Terrible film, and terribly boring. I thought Megan Fox had better range in acting skills.",/review/rw7085548/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2021,headrushn,4," Writers think we are stupid or that women are
","Maybe a spoiler but I'm not even 40 minutes in and lugging this body around is beyond me. THINK FOR A MINUTE!! Either Break glass vase to cut hand then slip off cuffs or just smash the damn hand to a pulp. Yes it gross but...life or death!! NOBODY would drag a person around flights of stairs and all, especially someone heavier than yourself. I'm going to finish this flick but seriously I feel disrespected for the sheer stupidity they think we should go along with.",/review/rw7085548/?ref_=tt_urv
6 July 2021,mjsreg,3," More plastic than a Sindy Doll factory
",This has to be one of the worst films I have seen so far this year.,/review/rw7085548/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2021,jfgibson73,6," Does what it sets out to do
","I too am surprised at the negative reviews and low rating. I thought this was a fairly well structured little thriller. I didn't think too much about it or expect great performances. I just went in for some light entertainment, and it was fine. I thought all the pieces fit together well enough. I don't think I would ever watch it again, and I don't disagree with anyone who wasn't into it, but I got some enjoyment from it.",/review/rw7085548/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2021,veselkokelava,8," Lot of hate for no reason
","OK, so this movie got a lot of really bad reviews. First, because it's Megan Fox. Are you really gonna rate the movie 1/10 because you have some personal issues about Megan Fox? Grow up. Is it because she can't act? She did just fine in this movie.",/review/rw7085548/?ref_=tt_urv
17 March 2022,TerribleKatherine,2," I just cannot take Fox seriously
","Why would anyone cast Megan Fox? She cannot act. I feel like with a different main actress this could've been an okay film, but is just hurts my brain to watch her do anything. She should've skipped the plastic surgery and put her money in to an acting class! She is wooden and boring and I guess she just cannot show any emotions on her face.",/review/rw7085548/?ref_=tt_urv
12 October 2021,MikeWright75,1," Water Proof Death Proof Make Up
",Best part of this movie is the make up used by Ms Fox. It stays put no matter what. The glue for her false eyelashes must surely be marketed to the public as veritably super unstuckable,/review/rw7085548/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2021,deloudelouvain,5," Some suspense, some mediocre acting.
","The thing with Till Death is that Megan Fox is just not a good actress. She gets roles because of her looks, which in my humble opinion are not that great like everybody else seems to think. The movie starts slow, borderline boring, but gets a kick in the second half, where there's actually some decent suspense. The story is not to be taken too seriously as there's no way a fragile woman like her could drag a dead weight like that without getting noticed. But there's some suspense, I'll give them that, but that's about it. Good enough to watch once, but you will forget everything about it the next day.",/review/rw7085548/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2021,trashgang,7," even as it is a simple story, it's full of suspense
",Remember the time that Megan Fox would be the next big thing. And sshe was on the way to become it until she made some fatal errors. From there on her Hollywood career was over but the horror genre picked her up. Jennifer's Body (2009) was her first entry in the genre and by a lot of geeks she became a new scream queen.,/review/rw7085548/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2021,tomguycz,3," Sooo many flaws
","That shirt? And with bow tie? Her face perfectly edged with the ""blood"" but for some reason that splatter entirely missed her eyebrows, eyes, lips and her hair. Not a drop of it on her hair. Lol.",/review/rw7085548/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2021,JoelChamp85,9," Finally something Worth Watching This Year
","Solid little thriller. This is filmmaking using little resources but executing big effect. Old Drazic still killing it which is great to see, and I like Fox in this type of gritty story. It's one of the better films I've seen this year.",/review/rw7085548/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2021,nicci1972,4," Interested but ultimately disappointed
","So while it had some serious ""wTF"" moments, I was intrigued with where it was going. Which was absolutely no where. And Ms Fox's acting, that crying in the beginning- seriously- terrible. Some great camera shots though.",/review/rw7085548/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2021,MK_Ultra_,1," Headache inducing nonsense
","Never had the pleasure of watching a full Megan Fox film, and I almost held that streak, as I was ready to shut it off about 40 minutes in. She's basically a plastic mannequin that makes word noises as far as her acting abilities go.",/review/rw7085548/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2021,dannyreyntiens,1," What am I missing?
","Apart from the dire revenge, it's one question throughout the film... ""Why didn't she do this?"" it's with everything decision she makes. I had to switch it off. It's too idiotic of a film. How do these scripts get made?",/review/rw7085548/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2021,leftbanker-1,1," The Same as Every Other ""Hand-Cuffed to a Corpse"" Movie
","If you think this ridiculous premise can get you through a 1h28m feature film, good luck with that. Equal parts bloody and stupid with every horror/thriller trope thrown in like they are making a bad movie potluck dinner. I wish that I could have been there at the meeting when they decided to give this story a greenlight. You have to wonder about what they rejected to push this into production: half a Siamese twin you have to drag around? How about a 160-pound tumor? She can't remove the leash from her pet wolverine? Two women have to share the same pair of pants for the day? I can keep going if you want. I can do this all day.",/review/rw7085548/?ref_=tt_urv
