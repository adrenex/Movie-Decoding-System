","""The Forgotten"" is a film that has provoked quite a number of comments to this forum. Never saw it in its commercial run, but we caught it on cable a few nights ago. The film, as directed by Joseph Ruben, and based on Gerard Di Pego's screen treatment has the feeling of a long Sci-Fi channel offering, or maybe an extended ""X Files"" episode.",/review/rw1053476/?ref_=tt_urv

30 December 2005,Howlin Wolf,4," That's what this movie deserves to be.
","The title offers the perfect opportunity to score some easy points; and I must admit that I'm not the sort of guy to pass these kinds of things up. So let's get it out of the way early - here goes: Hollywood has obviously 'forgotten' how to execute a polished thriller; and Julianne Moore must by now have 'forgotten' exactly why she chose this role. The very word should clue an audience in that what follows will deal with memories, or to be precise, certain characters lack of them. That being the case, the makers might as well have settled on the ultimate explanation that someone's drink has been spiked, I assure you that this would raise as many questions, is as unspecific, and is as deeply uninspired as the scenario that eventually plays itself out. To underpin a thriller, one would ordinarily want an intricate puzzle, a complex conspiracy web of intrigue and downright nefariousness. What we actually get is a basic idea that the screenplay never bothers to delve into fully, and seems like it was desperately thought up so everyone concerned had a catch-all excuse for some decidedly 'loose' plotting.",/review/rw1053476/?ref_=tt_urv

7 May 2010,moonspinner55,6," So many good ingredients, it's a pity the film isn't better...
","Screenwriter Gerald Di Pego comes up with an interesting new slant on a well-trodden movie idea: grieving woman is obsessed with the child she lost to a plane crash, and refuses to accept it when her husband, neighbor, and psychiatrist all tell her he never existed. Conspiracy thriller with science-fiction overtures steps a little bit into ""Close Encounters"" territory, but manages to hold the viewer with strong individual scenes and a lovely, matter-of-fact lead performance by Julianne Moore. However, the editing goes slack by the film's midsection, with Moore constantly on the run and Di Pego's script scrambling to explain itself whilst keeping the audience in suspense. It's a gambit which doesn't quite pay off. Supporting characters played by Anthony Edwards and Alfre Woodard are unceremoniously shafted, while the tepid final act (more running) leaves a bushel of unanswered questions and unrealized ideas behind. The chilly cinematography (grayish blues and whites) is artsy and distracting, and the overall result smacks of too many cooks. **1/2 from ****",/review/rw1053476/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2021,quitwastingmytime,7," Deserves a Higher Rating

8 December 2016,Tweekums,7," An intriguing mystery the less you know going in the better
","Protagonist Telly Paretta has not been able to get over the loss of her eight year old son, Sam, in a plane crash fourteen months previously. Each day she spends hours looking at pictures of him or watching a video of him; her psychiatrist advises her not to but she does anyway. Then one day she finds the photos have gone and the video has been deleted; she confronts her husband but he tells her that he hasn't done anything not just that he tells her there never were any pictures of her son as he had been still born and all her memories are false; part of a condition. She is convinced that he is lying but everybody else she asks has no knowledge of Sam. Her one hope is Ash Correll, the father of a girl who also died in the crash except he has no memory of any of it either. He lets her spend the night in his flat but calls the police in the morning. Strangely as they are taking her away a pair of NSA agents turn up and take her from the police not what one would expect given what we have seen before. At this point the things she said to Ash get through and he realises that he somehow forgot his daughter. He helps Telly escape and together the two of them determine to find out what happened to their children; it won't be easy though as powerful forces are determined to stop them.",/review/rw1053476/?ref_=tt_urv

","Now THIS is what I want from a thriller. I had high hopes for this movie, and for the most part it delivers. The story grabs you from the start, and what I like is that nothing is revealed too soon. The movie pulls you along and keeps things nice and subtle until BAM it hits you with an uppercut. The pace smooths out and then WHAM, a right hook to the jaw. Pretty much the same method my mom used to employ to keep me on my toes.",/review/rw1053476/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2014,Quebec_Dragon,8," ♪ Don't you forget about me ♪
","First, if it's not already too late, please avoid the trailers, and I recommend watching the extended version with the alternate version. Why? One of the best surprises is spoiled in the trailer (lesser ones too) and the alternate ending is arguably better, definitely less simple and Hollywood-like despite the same final result. So, this was a very good thriller with an excellent concept I don't remember seeing done anywhere before in TV or film. What if your kid died in an accident but months later you were told by everyone he never existed? I appreciated how the subject was explored and how gradually that revelation and others were made. Is our mother delusional or is there something else going on? Of course, an option is more likely than the other, but the journey was suspenseful. At several moments in the film, there was an escalation of events that raised the stakes and made things more interesting and disturbing.",/review/rw1053476/?ref_=tt_urv

","It has been over a year since Telly Pretta's son died in a plane crash; she is in therapy and daily lingers over his pictures and possessions. When the pictures start to disappear she gets angry at her husband for hiding them but her husband doesn't know what she is talking about while her doctor starts to consider putting her in hospital because she is not getting over this fictional ""son"" that she claims she had. Telly's memories are so strong and she knows she isn't crazy  a belief only confirmed when she meets another person who can't remember the daughter he lost in the same crash.

21 June 2007,zardoz-13,2," Forget about watching ""The Forgotten!""
","Deception plays an integral part in the films of director Joseph Ruben. In his 1984 science-fiction saga ""Dreamscape,"" Ruben put Dennis Quaid and Kate Capshaw through the paces as psychics trying to help clinical patients wrestling with dream demons in their nightmares. The devious title character in Ruben's clever 1987 serial killer thriller ""The Stepfather"" deluded young women in their 20s with children into marrying him, so he could hack them to pieces and head off to his next victims. Ruben's 1991 white-knuckler ""Sleeping with the Enemy"" cast Julia Roberts as a battered heroine who deceived her abusive spouse and fled to forge a new identity. ""Home Alone's"" Macaulay Culkin pulled fiendish stunts in the ""The Good Son"" (1993) as an evil child who fooled everybody into believing in his innate virtue. N.Y. Transit cops Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson in ""The Money Train"" (1995) deceived everybody about their part in a police subway robbery. Not surprisingly, Ruben's latest epic ""The Forgotten"" (*1/2 out of ****) proves no exception about the recurring theme of deception. This deliberately-paced, psychological puzzler, starring Julianne Moore, Gary Sinise, and Alfre Woodard, about missing children and perturbed parents will grip you up to the half-way mark as it draws you slowly but surely into a mystifying predicament involving a delusional mother struggling to preserve the memories of her recently deceased son. Sadly, however, when scenarist Gerald Di Pego of ""Phenomenon"" fame and Ruben reveal what actually happened to her child, this atmospheric but anemic nail-biter degenerates into a laughable cross-between of an inferior ""X-Files"" episode and the 1998 Australian sci-fi chiller ""Dark City"" where curious aliens conducted experiments with humans to determine what made humans humane.",/review/rw1053476/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2019,arthur_tafero,6," Better Than Average Sci-Fi - The Forgotten
","This is better than average sci-fi, with a nice serving of mystery thrown in the pot as well. Add ingredients like good actress Julianne Moore (who is always hot), and a decent supporting cast, good special effects; and any parent who is sympathetic to having their child kidnapped (all of us?), and you have a guaranteed success. The pacing of this film is very interesting. It starts very slowly; and some may actually tune out before the plot unravels. Be patient. It does speed up. Better to have a film speed up in the middle until the end, rather than the other way around. There are enough duds that start off with a bang, and then leave us grasping for straws. This is not one of them. See it. And no, it is not really an X-Files or Twilight Zone episode; it can stand on its own.",/review/rw1053476/?ref_=tt_urv

28 September 2004,artiquels,1," Great actress in an awful film
",This is a brief comment about The forgotten. It was so dreadful that the friend I came with went in the lobby to play with the amusement machines. I am sure he had more enjoyment than me. A silly and very poor film. Julianne Moore is the only good thing in this bad film. Even the aliens were so poor they only had one alien representing their entire planet. I wonder if it was something to do with the alien actors union. If these aliens ever see this film they will probably return to their planet wondering why humans spend so much money on utter drivel. I have no idea how this film won the backing to be made or why Julianne Moore wanted to make it. She has probably FORGOTTEN the reason.,/review/rw1053476/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2005,Kareninysimba,2," To be forgotten
","In her long lasting mourning because of her lost son, Mrs. Paretta (particular selection for a name, huh?) keeps her son memories very much alive after more that a year of his disappearance. One not special day, all of her material memories start changing: pictures disappear or modified, all of the sudden nobody remembers anything of her son, not even her husband, the very robotic Anthony Edwards. Although she keeps recalling her son very vividly, there are no clues of why she does it and everybody else don't. I guess there are interesting clues developed about this fact later on during the movie. Unfortunately, I particularly didn't catch them if there is any. She joins efforts with the father of another disappeared kid along with her son. Aliens start to be major suspects here without a plausible or natural reason and spectacular abductions occur during these people search for the truth. Unlike major special effects movies, here the abduction where major part of the trailers, being the top spectacular scenes in the movie itself, so the reaction is ""Oh yeah.. that was in the trailer..."" In the search of ""her son"". Mrs Paretta (Julianne Moore) says ""I want my son back"" and ""Where is my son"" so many times that at some point I wished her son never showed up, and now I've been waking up in the middle of the night shouting ""I WANT MY SON BACK!"". The dialog is mediocre all the way, excessively naive and repetitive, many time falls in the ridicule and absurd (see the ""Memorable Quotes"" page and you'll understand). Repited scenes of her son, recalled by her, coming once and again, and over and over again is actually tiring! The phrase ""my son"" I believe is approximately 90% of the script. I think the director had no clear idea on how to establish the actions among the characters, I got the sensation that their movements, actions and reactions were many times random and loose. There's a particular scene almost at the end, with broken windows, that totally spontaneously produced a strong loud laugh in me, I couldn't help it. There is too an annoying noise when aliens are near or influencing the scene that sounds like worms and termites fighting inside a decomposing body.",/review/rw1053476/?ref_=tt_urv
