16 October 2019,tinyfeet69,10," Bring on Season 2!
","With social media being as it is, you cannot help but get roped into all the controversy going on about this show. So I took a look at some YouTube clips and other things going around on Twitter and Instagram etc and got the general gist of what the show is all about. All I can say, is that I was hooked - right from the very first clip. Whoever had the brilliant idea to cast Theo James as the tall, dark, mysteriously brooding Sidney Parker should be applauded. He is absolutely brilliant in this role. I have seen him in other things, but I think this has really showed how good of an actor he really is. Of course he is handsome (any red blooded female can see that) but that didn't even matter to me, because he brought Sidney Parker to life for me. He made me fall in love with him just as Charlotte did and he made me irritated and annoyed just as Charlotte was. He is just an amazing actor and he suited this role to a tee. Charlotte's character (played by Rose Williams) took me a while to warm up to but I found her maturing with each episode and I liked her spunk and charisma but I also liked her softer more vulnerable side which came out slowly as she begun to realize her true feelings for Sidney. Rose is a very talented actor as well. She is exactly how I would picture Charlotte to be.",/review/rw5154141/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2020,debdshaw60,5," Jane Austen would be appalled
","They took the germ of an idea, characters partially developed, and twisted it into a travesty. This took a very normal appearing Austen outline and made it as dark and wicked as possible.",/review/rw5154141/?ref_=tt_urv

30 September 2019,mstaffordca,10," Stick with it, you won't regret it
","Such a wonderful adaptation! Thank you! Yet again the Brits prove that nobody can do a period piece like they can! They always have the right balance of love, drama, relatable emotion, scandal, heartbreak etc. Everyone else is so far behind. Thanks for this great series in honor of the last writings of Jane Austen.",/review/rw5154141/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2019,jobarbary,10," Please please please give us a second series
","Loved, loved, loved this series but desperately need all loose ends tied up with a further series.

",Really enjoyed it from beginning to end. Hope we get to see more of the characters! Let's have a series 2 please!,/review/rw5154141/?ref_=tt_urv

17 April 2020,AJ_McAninch,6," A travesty.
",Beautiful production physically with the worst ending I can remember seeing in ages and an insult to Jane Austen.,/review/rw5154141/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2019,ang-61989,8," Enjoyable
",I love period dramas and this programme has not disappointed me! Great actors with the 2 main leads having such chemistry! Recommended,/review/rw5154141/?ref_=tt_urv
3 October 2019,SuziP,10," Ignore the naysayers, wonderfully refreshing adaptation!
","Wonderfully acted all around + I don't think I've ever seen chemistry, like that between the 2 leads, on tele before (the 2nd ball is simply spellbinding). The layered storylines are very absorbing and good to see other characters have depth and meaningful plots of their own. Some viewers don't seem to like the ""warts/bums and all"" portrayal of Austen's work in this adaptation, but it feels like a truer reflection of the times she lived in and reflects issues we're still trying to come to terms with in society today - so I, for one, think it's refreshing!",/review/rw5154141/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2019,rachelhutchinson-26713,10," Jane Austen unfinished novel Sanditon
",I absolutely loved series 1 apart from the ending definitely had me in tears but I do hope series 2 would turn it around and see our heroine Charlotte get her man which is Mr Sidney Parker. But overall great first series and made with fantastic actors who I loved playing the characters. Also series 2 would be great as lot more story to tell.,/review/rw5154141/?ref_=tt_urv
24 February 2020,Wilsoncpu-605-474004,1," An unmitigated disaster
","Supposedly a ""love letter"" of sorts to Jane Austen, this is instead an incredibly inappropriate parody, which seems to have been created more by someone who hates Austen, rather than adores her. Hand jobs in the park? Forced coupling on the floor of a mansion? Really? In Jane Austen? And then, if we could have forgiven these tone-deaf attempts to perhaps ""update"" Austen for modern tastes - it ends with the heroine both UNHAPPY and POOR. For God's sake, one thing Austen required was that the heroine end up with someone with money, since that was so critical in her day. But when the putative hero rides up at the last moment, we don't get a wonderful ""I've rejected the other woman's money, I love you too much, blah blah"" (perhaps with some arcane excuse for some other method of getting the required funds). No, we get a limp ""I couldn't bear you to think badly of me."" Really? To assuage your own feelings you make this dramatic appearance? Pitiful.
And the WORST part of the whole painful exercise was listening to the creator repeatedly natter on about how clever it all was, how faithful, how brilliant, when it was obvious, shallow, and inappropriate.
This was the first ""Masterpiece"" series that I've ever seen which got so much wrong. Beyond the writing, the direction was clunky, the continuity nonexistent - hilariously, two people dressed mainly in white treat a worker who's spurting blood in all direction, yet emerge moments later with all their clothing spotless. That sort of thing was painfully common.
An embarrassment all around.",/review/rw5154141/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2022,gordonidwan,5," This is not Austen
","Hmmm think Bridgerton, certainly not Austen. The characters were fleshed out somewhat, the acting was good for the most part. The part of Sidney Parker could have been improved upon. Austen describes him as an agreeable, lively man. The actor/director/writer choose to ignore this description and play him as an even less tolerable Mr. Darcy but it didn't work unfortunately. The sister and brother in this adaptation soon were changed to step brother and sister so that the story could comfortably explore their incestuous relationship. Something I am sure a 19th century author would not have put on paper like it was parking a car. It was appalling to say the least. This adaptation was a huge disappointment to me. I did keep watching looking for a redemption that would never come. Hoping someone will do much better one day.",/review/rw5154141/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2019,julielbish,10," Austen, but not as we know it
","A fresh approach to one of Jane Austen's unfinished works with some fabulous locations and costumes and more bare flesh than you'd expect. Sadly, we will never know how she would have ended it....and we still don't as the production left the ending...well...open, sort of.
Let's hope we get a second series to give us a suitably Austenesque happy ending.",/review/rw5154141/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2019,unearththepast,10," Brilliant adaptation
","This could be my favourite Austen adaptation and I thought that nothing could top the 1995 version of Pride and Prejudice. The series was a slow burner for me but by episode 2, I was hooked. The love story between the two main characters keeps you on your seat throughout the whole series and by ep 7 you are shouting at the screen for them to get together. The ending is unexpected, however, it sets it up perfectly for season two.",/review/rw5154141/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2019,erinehalford,10," Absolutely beautiful!
","By the third episode I was completely hooked. The music, acting and scenery get better and better. It ends on a huge cliff hanger and I'm excited for season 2 to be announced to make everything right.",/review/rw5154141/?ref_=tt_urv
2 September 2019,alidavidson-48284,9," Can't wait until next week
","I've only just watched the second episode, but I'm hooked now! The main character is really observant and brave and I love watching her expressions whenever someone particularly greasy tries to befriend her. There's a lot of tension in the first couple episodes around authenticity, motivations, and the slave trade, with hints of childhood sexual abuse.",/review/rw5154141/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2019,carol_a_ford,10," Best period drama ever
",I watched all 8 episodes of Sanditon and it had me captivated every single week. Andrew Davies did well with the storyline but the ending of episode 8 was such an anti-climax that we now need season 2 to finish the story with a happy ending. The acting was superb as was the location and costumes. Looking forward to more in the near future.,/review/rw5154141/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2019,sonyamarren,10," Loved It
",I absolutely loved this series and I couldn't help but invest emotionally in the characters. The way the storylines developed and intertwined made it so interesting. Can't wait for a second series.,/review/rw5154141/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2019,steelergirl83,10," Lovely Series Deserving of a 2nd Season!
","I am a major consumer of romantic fiction and romantic dramas, my favorite being historically set fiction and period costume dramas and I must say, Sanditon ranks as one of my favorite works. Andrew Davies has done a fabulous job at bringing the characters of Austen's unfinished work to life.",/review/rw5154141/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2019,davorkalulic,9," I wish...
","I loved this show. A well known concept of period drama, but still somehow different. And after the last episode, acutally quite different and very unexpected. Left me with unease, because we all expect the happy ending. I wish there were some episodes left in the series, that there is a story for Georgiana too, and that in the end, we see Charlotte happy.",/review/rw5154141/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2019,rebecca_shaw7,9," Why the negative reviews?!
","This is a great show. Great characters and a good story. I love Jane Austin and I'm really enjoying this show, I don't understand the negativity.",/review/rw5154141/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2020,ematerso,1," Absolutely the worse production I have ever seen on Masterpiece
","I will give this one star simply because I liked Ann Reid, whom I did not like at all in Last Tango in Halifax. . .which shows what a good actress she is. I have not read the eleven chapters of Jane Austen's Sanditon, but I have read enough of her novels to think she must have spun in her grave over this pathetic adaptation. Every kind of current theme in contemporary life was addressed in the first episode. The molesting priest (not actually but certainly in his sermon), the molested child, Charlottes many costume changes, the dancing (we almost switched channels at that one) the black female welcomed into society. We hated t his. Nice scenery though.",/review/rw5154141/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2019,jennyfewings,10," Wonderful Drama, Amazing Acting
","Just watching this wonderful series again for the second time and I know I'll be watching it again and again. Such wonderful acting from the leads with an amazing supporting cast.
I've never been so addicted to a tv series before, I was truly hooked on this.",/review/rw5154141/?ref_=tt_urv
1 October 2019,masala-76817,10," Don't understand all the negativity - This isn't a Jane Austen completed & published novel
","It is an uncompleted novel, it was in draft form when Jane Austen died so no one can actually say Andrew Davies version is ""wrong"". The music is sublime; (the music IS dialogue) especially the dancing sequences. The sets and costumes are beautiful, all that candlelight!!!! The time is the ""Regency"" period in England so it's accurate. The lead actress is perfect, her facial expressions and the imitation she does of Sidney Parker are brilliant. The actor who plays the doctor is also a wonderful actor in a wonderful role. Arthur Parker's role and actor brings wonderful comedy. This series proves you don't need the violence, sexual violence and full frontal female nudity of Game of Thrones; aren't viewers over all the explicit violence and female nudity that is prevalent in most TV series/shows and movies?",/review/rw5154141/?ref_=tt_urv
