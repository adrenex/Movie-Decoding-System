23 November 2014,Dr_Sagan,," A conventional thriller with an unfortunate fact ...
","A sad, unfortunate fact about this movie is that the 2 young female stars Brittany Murphy and Skye McCole Bartusiak (who plays the daughter of Michael Douglas) both died in a young age.",/review/rw0760457/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2006,ccthemovieman-1,7," Decent Kidnap Story Worth One Look
","Here's another interesting kidnap story. Sean Bean always plays a believable villain and Michael Douglas usually plays roles that keep the audience's attention....so the almost- two hours go by pretty quickly. The whole cast, actually, pretty good with no one person standing out.",/review/rw0760457/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2003,sddavis63,7," Good Thriller With Sustained Suspense
","Overall, I really liked this movie, which surprised me a little bit. The trailers I had seen for it had me thinking it was going to be kind of ""cheesy"" for lack of a better word, but this was actually very engrossing. It had an interesting story line, sustained suspense and for the most part was well acted.",/review/rw0760457/?ref_=tt_urv
8 October 2001,pc_dean,7," Ve Haff Vays of MAKING You Talk...
","They say there's nothing new under the sun, and that's especially apt in sunny Hollywood.  So it's tempting to ask, merely as a theoretical exercise, ""can you make a movie that is essentially a model kit assembled from other movies, and still make it effective?""  ""Don't Say a Word"" proves that the answer is ""Yes.""  WHY you would want to set out to do such a thing is another question; you'll have to ask the producers about it.",/review/rw0760457/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2002,mattkratz,," good thriller
",This movie provides in the thrills department. It stars Michael Douglas in the lead role (and he IS well cast) as a psychiatrist whose daughter is kidnapped by a bunch of men who want him to extract a six-digit number from a mentally disturbed young lady. Both parties then proceed to match wits en route to a great climax towards the end of the movie.,/review/rw0760457/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2002,Boyo-2,7," Fast moving thriller
","My 11 year old nephew said it was the scariest movie he's ever seen.  I can't quite agree with that, but the level of intensity and the fast moving plot really impressed me, even if it all didn't quite add up in the end.  I can't remember a movie that I've seen in awhile that just MOVED along so well and had so little downtime. Given the 'deadline', it felt like it was in real-time for the second half of the movie.

11 December 2020,Just-A-Girl-14,9," Excellent!!
","I really don't understand the bad reviews and low rating! This movie is totally underrated! It's a really good thriller with interesting psychological aspect to it. Michael Douglas, Sean Bean and Brittany Murphy are all Excellent! Maybe it's not too innovative (it's a typical ""we kidnapped someone you love and now you do as we say"") but so what?! It's interesting and suspenseful and 20 years later it's still working! If you never watched it and you like good thrillers, give it a chance!",/review/rw0760457/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2002,TxMike,," Somewhat formulaic thriller, simple story drawn out to elapse in 110 minutes, but with really good DVD extras.
","SPOILERS - DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE YET. The current IMDb average rating of 6.5 is a pretty accurate number. The story is simple. A crook Patrick (Irishman Sean Bean) just out of 10 years in prison needs to find the valuable red jewel that got him there in the first place. The daughter (Elisabeth, played by Brittany Murphy) of the double-crossing partner he threw in front of the NYC train in 1991 is now 18, the jewel was in her doll which she placed in his casket, buried on an island with only an 8-digit number identifying the burial plot. Having gone from one hospital to another as a mentally ill child, she knows the number but won't tell anyone. So famous child shrink Dr Conrad (Michael Douglas) is forced to find out, in 7 hours on Thanksgiving Day, or they will kill his kidnapped daughter Jessie (cute, talented Houstonian Skye Bartusiak).",/review/rw0760457/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2002,dfranzen70,3," Don't Waste Your Time
","This movie, starring Michael Douglas as Nathan Conrad, a prominent psychiatrist as a man who must retrieve a number from a patient in order to save his adorable kidnapped daughter, probably should win some sort of award for Dumbest Movie Title. It ranks up there with Don't Look in the Basement, Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead, and Don't Tell Her It's Me (all real titles). The title's not terribly descriptive, but it fits in with the plotline itself, which is pretty faceless.",/review/rw0760457/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2002,Luigi Di Pilla,8," ONE WORD: G R E A T
","It was a very dramatic and suspenseful thriller and the film is never boring. So I can only say a word: G R E A T. Michael Douglas played as usual good in the role as a psychiatrist. Also good performance from Skye McCole as Jessie the little girl. There are some scary scenes. I will add no doubt this DVD to my best of collection. If you liked this movie you shouldnÂ´t miss ""KISS THE GIRLS"" also from director Gary Fleder or ""SINGLE WHITE FEMALE"" from Barbet Schroeder. Believe me you will not be disappointed. I think the film is too underrated. I give it a minimum of 8/10.",/review/rw0760457/?ref_=tt_urv

",Renowned psychiatrist Nathan Conrad visits an 18 year old woman who is mentally disturbed with his colleague Dr Sachs.  The next morning he awakes to find his daughter kidnapped and him and his wife under surveillance by a shadowy group of men.

10 November 2003,Theo Robertson,4," There's No Honour Amongst Thieves ....
",".... Is what DON'T SAY A WORD screamed at me in the opening heist sequence . This is very true to life , thieves stab each other in the back and once they're caught it's a race to turn stool pigeon and make a deal with the DA. However after the opening robbery we're treated to the domestic life of hero shrink Nathan Conrad . Cheer as Nathan tucks his daughter into bed , weep with awe as Nathan gives his wife a blanket bath , gasp in amazement as Nathan shows the audience his culinary skills in the kitchen , but don't worry the story does improve when Mr Bean and the bad boys reappear in the story ",/review/rw0760457/?ref_=tt_urv
16 August 2018,Rainey-Dawn,8," Good Thriller
","As a young girl Brittany Murphy witnessed a gang of men hunting her father down which resulted in his death. She was severely traumatized and institutionalized after that. The gang leader, Patrick, has tracked her down and has also taken the daughter of psychiatrist Nathan Conrad hostage in order to force Dr. Conrad into finding out a 6 digit number that Brittany has in her memory.

28 September 2001,Quinoa1984,7," A great concept pushed to a good deal of entertainment
","Don't Say a Word takes a great concept and, at least for a pretty good amount of the movie, runs with it with style and suspense.  The concept- a psychiatrist (Michael Douglas, good in this type of role) meets a (semi) catatonic girl, but then find himself in a dangerous situation when a kidnapper (Sean Bean) takes his daughter right out of his house and demands he get an important number locked inside the girl's memory.  Sometimes contains scenes that could've been left for the DVD deleted scenes (Oliver Platt, while he's good, serves no real perpose in the core of the story). But when it gets exciting, it can hold your attention well enough.  Murphy, who plays the girl, is off and on believable and over-believable. B+",/review/rw0760457/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2002,alicecbr,," Sean Bean being Mean but he does it SOOOOO Well
","You may be used to seeing mean Sean Bean act ugly and beat people up, treating violence as a standard operating method.  But you have got to see him as a cowardly thug in ""Rowin"", a shy schoolteacher in ""My Kingdom for a Horse"" and a bi-sexual in ""Carnavaggio"" to know how resourceful this he-man is.  He is 43, but knows how to act and how to make violent scenes very realistic.  Although he says that the superfluity of dirt in this film almost got him.",/review/rw0760457/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2006,Boba_Fett1138,6," Formalaic standard thriller. Good but not surprising enough.
","This thriller certainly is a good enough one to watch and it also is a very professionally made one but it however offers very little new or refreshing enough material. It makes ""Don't Say a Word"" nothing more than a standard thriller, with some good actors in it.",/review/rw0760457/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2012,seymourblack-1,7," A High Stakes Thriller With Some Good Performances
","""Don't Say A Word"" is an entertaining ""race against time"" thriller with plenty of action, some good acting and a few neat twists. Visually, it's easy on the eye and its plot involves bank robbery, murder and kidnapping as well as an ordinary man who has to do something extraordinary in order to save the life of his child. The stakes are high and the tension grows steadily until things become even more desperate as time starts to run out. Interestingly, the story has a few different strands which eventually converge and the pace of the action is lively throughout.",/review/rw0760457/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2020,AngelHonesty,8," Worth a watch
","Not as bad as I first thought it was going to be. I watched this with no expectations and found myself surprised. I enjoyed the mix of well known actors that appeared in the film. The good acting from the much beloved cast made it worth the view! The story itself isn't too special with the familiar ""we kid nap your daughter, now do something for us"" plot. But it was interesting seeing it from a psychiatrists perspective and how he broke through to Murphy to get her to help him. The suspense was nice as it kept you on your toes during the entire film. Perhaps it was a predictable movie, with cliches, but I greatly enjoyed the acting and suspense that it kept me interested during the entire movie. The only thing I really did not enjoy is I wish they would have given Jennifer Esposito a bigger part in the film. Her acting talent was great but her role was too small and almost made you feel as though there was no point to her character being in the film. Like honestly what did she really do? She chased after the bad guys trying to catch them when they were unaware of her chasing after them, to suddenly pop up at the very end to take credit for the big win?",/review/rw0760457/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2004,Billy_Crash,1," Suspense so typical - it's lame
","This is a poorly written and utterly predictable ""suspense."" Though Brittany Murphy is a standout, the story is over-the-top - and when you can see everything coming, it's as suspenseful as watching paint dry.",/review/rw0760457/?ref_=tt_urv
18 April 2002,slinky-8,," Why ruin a good premise?
","Spoilers Ever go to a movie where you try to just sit back and enjoy a little coincidence and potential implausibility but the awkwardness and unexplained events just ruin the whole experience for you? Well, ""Don't Say A Word"" falls into that genre with the following, in order of some to great contrivance: (1) The addition of Esposito as a cop who plays virtually no role in the film except somehow managing to figure out the whole series of events in just a few short hours and whose contrived lines (included an obtrusive, meaningless telephone conversation with someone unexplained) and ability to somehow find the location of the movie's climax with virtually no guidance. Additionally, there is this semi-emotional scene with Douglas which makes no sense since the two never spoke during the entire film. (2) The placement of the extraordinary, surveillance equipment all over New York without a hint of how it got there. It relies upon the audience to formulate various ways in which it *could* have been placed there -- never a good idea. (3) No explanation why the whole focus of the movie, some small red jewel, was so immensely valuable beyond everything else. (4) The psychological aspect is virtually tossed out the window from the start and the movie becomes an action flick. (5) How in the world the bad guys knew that the 6 digit number was in the girl's head and how the jewel ended up where it was. (6) The ability of Douglas and his crippled wife to beat the crap out of guys much larger than themselves. (7) The placement but lack of real explanation of characters like Esposito and then the revelation of the Dr. who has an association with another victim, that is so ridiculously obtrusive and unexplained that it will jolt your attention from being absorbed in this movie to ask yourself why the ""character that obviously does not belong"" played such a prominent role of distraction. Horrible movie? By no means, I've seen worse. Disappointing? You bet.",/review/rw0760457/?ref_=tt_urv
2 July 2003,LeThAlWeApOn389,9," Excellent
",This movie was great. It was a fantastic movie. It has a lot of suspense and thrills in this movie. Michael Douglas played his part very good and he made the movie as good as it was. The acting was great by Brittany Murphy as a confused child who knows a secret code of some sort. The movie was great and I recommend it to all viewers who like Michael Douglas and like the thrilling and suspenseful movies because this movie has a lot of it.,/review/rw0760457/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2018,jrarichards,9," Still good stuff
","Gary Fleder's movie based on an Andrew Klavan novel from 10 years before it begins with a basic kidnapping story, but throws in the fascinating twist that the leverage is being exerted on psychiatrist Dr Nathan Conrad (Michael Douglas), who needs to work swiftly with patient Elisabeth Burrows (Brittany Murphy) to get out of her key information needed by the kidnappers. There's much more to it than that, but that's an intriguing story, and it requires Conrad (done by Douglas with his usual aplomb) to work on the limits of professional ethics ... as well as at a speed not normally associated with therapy! In this he is a little bit accompanied by a hospital manager played well as usual by Oliver Platt.",/review/rw0760457/?ref_=tt_urv
