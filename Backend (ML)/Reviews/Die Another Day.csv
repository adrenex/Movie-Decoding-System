","Yes I know. I've heard all the complaints already. ""That's not how it happened"" (as if anybody really knows); ""All of those events could not have co-occurred on the same boat in the same trip"" (as if anybody really knows); etc. etc. Well, here's my answer - it's a movie, just a movie. Don't see a movie to learn about ""what really happened"" unless the film states very clearly that it is a documentary. Films are, like good books, supposed to tell you something true about people, about things that happen, and about life. They're not (even when they're placed in the documentary shoebox) necessarily about what really happened and how.",/review/rw1705254/?ref_=tt_urv

","The Perfect Storm:  Billy Tyne is a swordboat captain who's hit a patch of bad luck - while his colleagues have returned to port nearly bursting at the seams with fish, his hold is nearly empty.  Convinced that it is his turn to score the big haul, Tyne convinces his crew to go on one last run before the end of the season and heads for the North Atlantic.  He never figured Mother Nature into his plans.",/review/rw1705254/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2000,jhclues,10," ""Perfect Storm,"" Perfect Movie
","Based on a true story, and dedicated to ten thousand Gloucestermen lost at sea since 1623, `The Perfect Storm' is a powerful movie that will take you places to which you've never been before.  Director Wolfgang Peterson has deftly crafted an intense rendering of the story of the Andrea Gail, a swordfishing boat captained by Billy Tyne that left Gloucester, Massachusetts, in the fall of 1991, and soon encountered the storm of the century.  After a less than profitable trip out, Captain Tyne (George Clooney) sets out again in October, with a crew of five men, and heads for deep water and a place know as the `Flemish Cap.'  It's a dangerous trek for that time of year, but he assures his men that the catch will be worth the risk.  What he could not foresee, however (nor could any meteorologist), was that three major storms would converge to form a single storm, the likes of which comes along only once in every one hundred years or so.  Fate steps in further when, after their catch is made, their ice making machine burns out, leaving them without the means of packing and preserving the fish.  They have no choice but to go back in, directly through the storm, lest the fish spoil, in which case all of their work, and the risks taken, would be for naught.  Tyne lets the crew decide; do they turn away and wait out the storm, losing everything, or do they prove that they're `Gloucestermen,' and try to make it back. 	What Peterson did with this film, the way he tells the story, can be likened to what Melville did with the novel, `Moby Dick;' as it moves along, he fleshes out the characters and subtly provides an intimate portrait of what this kind of life is all about.  He pays such meticulous attention to details, that by the time you're in the middle of the storm, the impact is extraordinary; you know what this boat is and how it works, you've smelled the fish and the sweat and the sea, and worked alongside the crew.   You know these people and what's at stake here.  You know the feel of the fishing lines and the grappling hooks, felt that rush of adrenaline that comes when you hook a big one, or when a huge wave washes over the deck.  He gives you so much in this film, puts you in it so completely, that it primes your senses for whatever's to come.  Combine all of this with the best special effects imaginable, outstanding performances, and a terrific score by John Horner, and you're in for the thrill of a lifetime. 	The charismatic Clooney is exemplary here as Tyne; he knows him from the inside out, which enables him to convey a real sense of who this man is. And it shows in the way he carries himself, the way he walks and talks, right down to the look in his eye.  He's tough without any unwarranted theatrics or bravura, is self-assured, but aware of his own shortcomings, as well.  It's a commanding performance with nuance and depth; It's all there, and Clooney makes it real.  Mark Wahlberg, also, is outstanding as Bobby Shatford, the rookie fisherman who can't stand to be more than two feet away from the woman he loves, Christina (Diane Lane).  Lane gives a notable performance here, too, as does John C. Reilly, who does an emotional turn as `Murph,' the veteran fisherman with a young son he loves, and who lives with the remorse of past mistakes that cost him his wife. 	Rounding out the exceptional supporting cast are William Fichtner (Sully), Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (Linda), Allen Payne (Alfred), John Hawkes (Bugsy) and Michael Ironside (Bobby Brown).  There are thrills and heroics to spare in `The Perfect Storm,' but it's also inspiring; once you've seen the Coast Guard in action, for example, you'll never take them for granted again.  What makes this such a great movie, though, is that it's about real people, doing their jobs and going about living their lives like we all do. It's an instance of ordinary people getting caught up in extraordinary circumstances, and Peterson has made them accessible, ones with whom anyone in the audience will be able to identify.  This is an emotionally charged, unforgettable film; you'll experience things from the comfort of your seat in the theater (or on the couch) that most people will never get close to in real life.  And therein lies the true magic of the cinema.  This is one movie you absolutely do not want to miss. 10/10.",/review/rw1705254/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2001,pursenut,," Good movie
","While watching this movie, I kept imagining if this was how horrible it was for those people when this true story really happened.  By the end, my heart went out to all of them.  It was a good portrayal of what may have happened, and I enjoyed it immensely.",/review/rw1705254/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2000,m.p.,," Not a novel
","Having survived (barely, on land) the ""No Name Storm"" of 1991 on the coast of New England, I assure you this was a true story (I'm mentioning this for the New Zealand poster who said it was adapted from a novel and others who may not realize it really was a *true* story). Obviously, we can't know what was actually said or done once the Andrea Gail lost radio contact (and isn't that true of any movie based on ""historical fact"" - we can only surmise the actual dialog and conversations that may have taken place).  However, the characters were based on the actual crew members and the Coast Guard did have to ditch one helicopter during the storm - from a story I read in People magazine, I'd say the portrayal of the Coast Guard's actions were accurate.  I can't say I liked this movie - perhaps remembering the terror of that night (I lived in a seaside town and the ocean had come over the seawall and was filling up streets 3 and 4 blocks in from the beach) makes it difficult for me to watch this movie as entertainment.  In answer to one post here, Clooney said that the Boston accent is one of the most difficult and he didn't even want to attempt it - Markie Mark is from Boston so it wasn't a stretch for him.  The special effects are phenomenal of course...I just wish it had a different ending.  By the way, the statue of the fisherman at the ship wheel shown at the beginning of the movie is an actual Gloucester landmark (and you can see it on Gorton frozen seafood products which come from Gloucester) - the legend on the base of the monument says, ""Those that go down to the sea in ships...""",/review/rw1705254/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2000,Illusia,," I really loved this movie...
","It was slow at first, but the second time I saw it, it meant more to me because I knew what was going to happen to the characters. My fiance and son went to see it with me, and they kept asking me if I was ok, because I was crying like a baby. You dont get much character background, but once the boys get out to sea, you feel as you get to know them better. You can tell Billy Tyne truly loved being on the sea. It was his home. George Clooney did a phenominal job portraying this character. The rest of the cast put some great emotions into their parts. Mark Wahlberg, formerly Marky-mark, has grown up into a wonderfully talented actor. You really get the feeling that this was a close knit fishing town, and you feel like you are a part of that town.

2 July 2000,DR.Z,," A roller coaster ride on water
","I was struck by the documentary quality of this film, and couldn't help but look back to an earlier Peterson film, Das Boot, where we got up close and intimate with all the crew of the submarine--where they slept, went to the washroom, their soaking wet clothes, the damp, the stink of unwashed clothes, the  claustrophobia on board.  I had absolutely no trouble believing that Mark Wahlberg and Clooney were fishermen, trying to earn a hardscrabble living against a tough and unforgiving sea.  The movie even starts slowly, giving the viewers insights into their lives at home, why they fish, and why they make the decisions later on in the movie.   Then the film starts to slowly build the tension as the storm builds in strength. The special effects were absolutely believable, and Peterson piles on the tension even while breaking it up by adding a parallel rescue at the same time as the Andrea Gail begins to run into trouble.  An excellent summer thriller that is a real roller coaster ride--literally and figuratively--on water.",/review/rw1705254/?ref_=tt_urv

23 August 2020,CubsandCulture,8," I am puzzled by the critical reception of this film
","To my mind this was a perfectly cromulent survival story-abet a tragic one- that was rooted in historical fact about a some blue collar guys. I thought the script did everything it needed to put some characters you care about and some drama to be resolved in the context of a disaster story . So yeah Tyne and the gang are not the most complex characters but you come to know them and importantly care about them. The same is true to a lesser extent for the coast guard crew and the rich smucks on the sail boat. The plotting around developing character and interpersonal drama was just enough to keep you interested. But for some reasons critics dismissed this as ""simple"" and ""thin"" plotting and characters. A lot of the charm of these character is just how everyman they all are.",/review/rw1705254/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2000,merrywood,5," The Perfect Zero!
","This film appears to epitomize the string of films of the last years of the 20th Century where the structured story has been replaced by a blaze of stunning visual effects.  The literate directors, who once brought us audience pleasing, soul-satisfying stories, seem to have vanished the way of the American Bison.  What has emerged is an empty, soulless presentation of eye-popping scenes tied to nothing at all.   ",/review/rw1705254/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2000,Robin_Hood,8," Clooney gives his all in storming depressant.
","Active, exciting, moving...depressing.  I have so many mixed emotions about this movie due to realising that more or less everything we see is true. George Clooney perfectly captures the busy, yet quite lonely man, that was Billy Tyne.  Mark Whalberg, who supported Clooney in 'Three Kings', also gives an excellent performance as Bobby Shatford.  The movie, on a whole, succeeds where a lot of films this year have - it's gripping.  The whole scenario of the storm, the crew, the boat and the relationships are so scarily captivating it's unreal.  However, if you don't know the ending or what goes on in the film, i won't say anything, but be warned!  This film has scarred my mind.  The performances from all actors are so good, i was depressed for about 3 days afterwards!  That is the only weakness however. It's a great film a really worth watching.  I would also recommend the book to anyone who hasn't read it - A bloody good read, although even that has it's depressing moments.  8/10 - worth purchasing because it could effectively become a classic.",/review/rw1705254/?ref_=tt_urv

THE PERFECT STORM is definitely one of the best films of 2000, which in itself was a pretty good year for movies, and works because of the characterisation and acting involved, factors which really make us care about the people in the film before putting them through their paces.",/review/rw1705254/?ref_=tt_urv
