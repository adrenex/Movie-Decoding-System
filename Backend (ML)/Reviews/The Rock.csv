8 February 2022,fhazduzj,10," I love this show
",This is a great show with some beautiful animation that somehow manages to get me invested in every character even minor ones. It started a bit mediocre and too hyper with the first 2 episodes but after that it's only improved with season 2 on average being even better than the 1st one.,/review/rw5971596/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2020,michael-04313,8," Unexpected Depth
","As the title suggests, this was unexpected. I was a big doubter off the show due to the trailer, but after relenting, I watched the first episode. Then the second, and third, etc.",/review/rw5971596/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2021,Tweekums,9," An amusing animation centred on low ranking characters on a minor Star Fleet ship
","Star Trek series tend to be centred on important characters aboard important vessels... but not this one. The ship is the USS Cerritos, which gets sent on relatively minor missions and the protagonists are lower deck crew who aren't important enough to be told what is going on. Ensign Beckett Mariner, who is capable but has no desire for promotion and can be insubordinate; Ensign Brad Boimler is keen to follow every rule and dreams of promotion; Ensign D'Vana Tendi, is an Orion recently transferred to the ship; and Ensign Samanthan Rutherford is an engineer with cybernetic implants. Throughout the series we see them getting into a number of adventures as well as their mundane jobs.",/review/rw5971596/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2020,mrragnarmar,10," So good!
","What's with all those uptight reviews??
This is my first review, I always read reviews first and I was bummed that this one was receiving so many bad ones!
But this show is so good and I had a blast watching it! I also love other Star Trek but why can't there be a funny sci-fi about the lower ranked people?, those people saying this is the death of Star Trek need to check into a senior citizen facility or try to loosen up. Two different types of Star Trek can exist at once, I for one like that they are expanding the franchise and I hope this show gets many many seasons!",/review/rw5971596/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2020,kythia,10," Funny, fresh, and ten times more Star Trek than Discovery
","Lower Decks can best be described as a Futurama-episode about Star Trek, except that its actually Star Trek. The delays between jokes are very short, sometimes this leads to an oversaturation, but the show generally pulls it off. Whoever expects a serious adventure like DS9 or something akin to ""The amazing Michael Burnham Show"" is clearly wrong here.",/review/rw5971596/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2020,willard12,9," Beam Me Up!
","Not sure how crappy Christian flicks and soppy romcoms can garner 6+ ratings on IMDB, while this gets a 5.8. This is a lot of fun in a familiar setting that doesn't take itself too seriously. Discovery and Picard are so dark and lacking the optimism of other iterations, that I was sure they'd become typical action/adventure flicks in sci-fi settings like Marvel movies. The Orville is a breath of fresh air as is Rick and Morty and Final Space, and this joins those ranks. Big hit for me. Tawny Newsome is the shining star here, just like Space Force. She's havin a heckuva season!",/review/rw5971596/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2020,xaocam-77480,7," A bit o fun
","Don't know what all the harsh reviews are about. After reading them I was expecting absolute rubbish but thought I would give it a go. It's not fantastic but but it is enjoyable. Its obviously having a bit of fun around star trek and it's an animation so what would you expect? I would actually consider it better than the Orville which after a few episodes became too melodramatic, I can't see that happening here.",/review/rw5971596/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2020,drvix,9," Don't be fooled...
","... By mediocre scores or disgruntled purists pining for a canon that was shattered before the original series even ended it's first run. Star Trek has always been escapist fun with an added layer of social awareness. It never became ""woke"" - it was ""woke"" back when we called ""woke"" people hippies and it never changed (with the notably shameful exception of S01 of TNG).
It's enjoyable, Trek flavoured comedy with added in-jokes for nerds. The older (and nerdier) you are, the more of those in-jokes will hit home. As a 50 year old, lifelong Sci-fi fan I really enjoyed the 1st episode and look forward to more.",/review/rw5971596/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2020,Nerdfury,10," Funny, irreverent, and gets Trekker's shorts in a bunch - perfect combo
","I've seen every Star Trek series and movie there is. I've watched all things Trek since my dad introduced me to TNG in the late 80s, and have followed the franchise ever since. That said, despite being a fan, I still love this series. It meshes the irreverence that people like about The Orville, the comedy and animation of Final Space, and the lore and world of Star Trek.",/review/rw5971596/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2020,numbahunna,10," It's fun and I like it.
","Star Trek has always been great and although it's no stranger to some comedy it is usually pretty heavy material. With two star trek series running with a 3rd on the way lower decks is a great comedic break from the normal star trek we're used to. It's light hearted and original, and although it seems a little whacky it fits into the Star Trek Universe quite well in my opinion. I am looking forward to more.",/review/rw5971596/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2020,rd-45882,8," It was fun!
",I was going into it without any expectations. But i enjoyed it very much. Its an ironic take on star trek. As long as it doesnt join canon iam fine with it!,/review/rw5971596/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2022,nategerard77,8," Surprisingly good!
",I'll admit that I'm an old Trek purist. I abandoned Discovery after a season and couldn't get through the second season of Picard. They both just didn't come across as anything that resembled the reasons I've loved this show since the 70's.,/review/rw5971596/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2020,marianthenightman,10," This is pretty good.
","Relax,people,this is just an animated comedy,nothing more and it was the time for something more optimistic.I give it 10 stars for the TNG style of the aliens and the ships,because it reminds me of the golden era of the franchise.",/review/rw5971596/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2020,linda-846-907013,10," Hilarious and so much potential
",I just watched the first episode and loved it! The set up for character growth was a clearly laid foundation. Plus it was so funny! I laughed through the whole thing. I can't wait to watch the rest of this show!,/review/rw5971596/?ref_=tt_urv
30 October 2020,Arcadia1701,10," Huge Star Trek fan here - love this!
","Let's face it, this is NOT a good time for trek... discovery and Picard are so awful it hurts me. They ruin the vision and optimism of the universe and even if you can get passed that, they don't even make any sense in their stories and episodes. Lower Decks is fully intrenched in the trek universe; they reference places, words, canon etc - following the basic principles laid out over the last 60 years (even the intro and font is on point!). It's way over the top in terms of pace and style - kinda like Star Trek meets family guy (but not as controversial lol).
I really enjoyed season one and there is def a place for this style of Star Trek in the universe.
Unlike discovery and Picard which are abominations - not sure I mentioned that ðŸ˜‚)",/review/rw5971596/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2020,danieljohn-55153,10," Great scifi comedy
","Ignore these neckbeard ST Gatekeepers. A very fun show. Very interesting take on the sublevel (the dregs) of the Star trek universe. Very funny, quality animation budget and voice acting helps solidify this format of a whimsical satire raunchy version of ST. Hope it gets more better as the show goes on.",/review/rw5971596/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2020,heatherlbeltran,10," If Star Trek and Futurama Had a Baby
","I thoroughly enjoy this series! It's not 100% Star Trek, like the same style writing, or seriousness, or anything like that, but Star Trek is the foundation and follows the ships and lower ranking officers who are generally in the background. Then add the same style of episodes and humor of Futurama, and TADA! You have Star Trek: Lower Decks. I hope this series keeps going!",/review/rw5971596/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2020,stevehc-05118,10," LOVE IT!
","I consider myself to be a Star Trek ""old-timer,"" having been a ST fan from day one, and I LOVE this show!",/review/rw5971596/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2020,RussHog,1," ""It's dead, Jim!""
",A catastrophe that nobody asked for. Bad humor. Terrible animation. The episode of TNG that dealt with the lower deck ensigns is so much better than this crap. Another travesty from CBS Star Trek. I wish the Borg would assimilate the Federation and make all this horrible Star Trek just go away.,/review/rw5971596/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2020,KingAssmar,2," Not a big trekkie, but Star Trek deserves better
","I'm a casual fan, I've seen some of TNG, and those movies, as well as most if not all of the more recent explody/lens flare ones so I have a very rudimentary knowledge of Trekdom, and even I'm not impressed. Only 1.333 episodes in, and I must say I'm underwhelmed with the humor. The writers seem to think one reference equals one joke, so a million references must equal a million jokes. Also, the Rick and Morty style animation really doesn't do it for me except for Rick and Morty itself, and that's due to the writing and humor that OVERCOMES the failings of its hideous art style. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but to be honest, it had a pretty low bar to hurdle and it still managed to stumble.",/review/rw5971596/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2020,weiss4307,9," A lot of fun
","First episode was great. Entertaining, funny and the trailer for what's to come made me laugh. The negative reviews are just haters of the new trek movement.",/review/rw5971596/?ref_=tt_urv
9 August 2020,jdgan,1," WHY?
","Just no. This should not have been made in the first place. Not only is it too embarrassing and childish for Adults but is too cynical and violent for kids, the characters apart from the main male guy are unlikeable (Gee, I haven't seen that before.).",/review/rw5971596/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2020,burkholdermicah,4," A really BAD Rick and Morty rip-off!
","I never liked these new Star Trek shows, at all. Picard and Discovery proved to me that they don't care about Star Trek anymore. Star Trek and Star Wars have become such tainted brands at this point, and they're now just in it for the money. They don't listen to you, they don't care about you! The animation here is really Rick and Morty-ish, but not in a good way. I don't care about any of the characters.",/review/rw5971596/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2020,danchrismanco,10," Why the hate?
","It seems like some trekkies will just never be pleased because they have this idealized Star Trek in their heads that can't actually be recreated. Just have fun with it, man. Give the show a chance to develop. Can you imagine if TNG had been judged on the entire first season, even? Loosen up.",/review/rw5971596/?ref_=tt_urv
