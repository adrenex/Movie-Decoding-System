3 January 2023,Jeremy_Urquhart,7," A compelling documentary
","Andrew Callaghan is best known for his YouTube videos where he interviews people with very large personalities who are also sometimes under the influence of various substances. I'm only a little familiar with his stuff, having seen a couple here and there, but the format was still recognizable in this feature-length documentary, which sees Callaghan going to various events that took place between November 2020 and January 2021. All revolved around the then-current election and its dramatic fallout, and along the way, he also interviews a few high-profile people in more standard interviews.",/review/rw8775317/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2023,chelseakaliwhatever,9," This is INSANE
","I said ""THIS IS INSAAAANE"" so many times it coulda been a drinking game. I feel so much more sane after watching this. Politics in this country makes sense to me again. American discourse makes sense to me. I didn't even realize I had forgotten what objective journalism looks like. And then along comes an ad with this doofy-looking guy named Andrew and I thought sure, why not revisit January 6th and assess the wreckage. My man, where have you been all this time. I thought this country was polarized but really my view was polarized. We're all the same. We're all unhealthy, uneducated, pumped full of different misinformation, and understandably angry and confused and trying to figure it all out.",/review/rw8775317/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2023,FKDZ,7," This Place Rules
","This Place Rules is great first documentary from Callaghan. To say this is just the beginning of a incredible documentarian would be an understatement. To preface this I know Callaghan's work for a while, being at the birth of All Gas No Brakes. His way of showcasing a unbiased view of extremism and radicalism is addictive. Combined with the comedic aspect you get a golden combination of fascination, intrigue, repulsion and comedy.",/review/rw8775317/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2022,bennettmurphy,10," An unsettling view of American insanity
","In ""This Place Rules"" Andrew Callaghan doesn't spin narratives or tell you how to think - he simply documents events that led up to January 6th.",/review/rw8775317/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2023,nathandm-75297,8," The Dangers of Radical Beliefs
",I've been a fan of Andrew's for years. And I think most fans would tell you that it was inevitable that he would go on to make a full-length documentary film.,/review/rw8775317/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2022,lpsangeldaschund,10," amazing as expected
","This documentary was amazing (as expected of Andrew) and highlights a really key moment in American history. Andrew truly has a gift of getting people to say what they really think on camera and he lets people speak their minds. They're represented as they are, and a lot of the time they make a fool of themselves by themselves. Some of my favorite moments included the dichotomy between ronin (???) and the little boy from the Q family. It was shocking to see a normal, well adjusted kid having fun and then a child who's been influenced so much by his parents insane fantasies that he doesn't even sound like a child anymore. No child should be thinking about the things he was reciting (seemingly from memory). I truly feel bad for these kids who are growing up in households like that and I worry for their futures. Another favorite moment was at the end with the guy who was a convicted sex offender claiming every political figure he doesn't like is a pedophile. I think it really highlights the projection so many of these kinds of people have. I'm so excited for more content from Andrew. He's truly inspiring. Definitely give this documentary a watch! And if you want more from Andrew he has a YouTube channel called channel five with some more lighthearted interviews.",/review/rw8775317/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2022,yogiho-62846,10," Very Entertaining documentary
","Didn't waste a second of my time its a very fun documentary even if you don't like politics , it shows all the different sides of Jan 6 riot without taking sides , my jaw was always wide open while watching this as it show the different kinda of people who participated and was affected by this also Andrew is a great interviewer as he never project his own thoughts or value into others and let them speak their opinion",/review/rw8775317/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2022,matticety,10," 'This Place Rules' gives a viewpoint to the many facets of America's disinformation problem.
","Andrew Callaghan and his brand, Channel 5, are unlike any journalism you've seen because it begs for your undivided attention while never seeing a boring moment throughout.",/review/rw8775317/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2022,Delornne,10," A powerful insight into modern misinformation, radicalism, and opportunist profiteers
",With just the right amount of relief whether through comedy or lighthearted fun This Place Rules reveals in retrospect the perfect recipe for disaster which lead up to the 2020 election and the infamous January 6th attack on the United States capitol.,/review/rw8775317/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2023,ciscalt,8," A Certified Andrew Callaghan Classic
","If you've enjoyed Channel 5 or All Gas No Breaks then you will most likely enjoy This Place Rules. For those that haven't watched either, Andrew Callaghan's journalism style centers around fringe views, either being portrayed in a humorous or sometimes more sinister and discomforting way.",/review/rw8775317/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2023,ryanpersaud-59415,6," An Entertaining and Compelling Documentary, But Lacks the Pedigree of HBO and A24.
","Andrew Callaghan's Channel 5 series on YouTube is probably one the best ways anyone can try and understand contemporary America in our age of polarization, weirdness, and chronic rule breaking. Often, I watch Channel 5 and think to myself, ""there really is no place quite like America, is there?""",/review/rw8775317/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2023,logansgotmail,3," A highlight tape of weirdos with no direction
","Really wanted to like this but came away just sort of let down. They never delve into anything for more than a few minutes and it makes the whole documentary feel incomplete. They tryi to cover too much and as a result fail to really cover anything. Barely touching covid, the election, protests, etc, everything was so surface level and the whole documentary had no real direction or narrative. It felt like they just found the weirdest individuals they could and then tried to weave a story around that after the fact. The start of the film talks about asking ""how we got here"" and then they just silently hold the mike up to the most riled up people they could find without really questioning them. Honestly not really worth the time.",/review/rw8775317/?ref_=tt_urv

3 January 2023,micalclark,," All the worst America has to offer
","Lots of interviews with drunk and drugged up people on both sides. It really exposes the worst of the US in every way. People who are so disconnected from reality that they have nothing to offer beyond fear and anger. People who openly claim to be Nazi's, fascists, religious zealots, and anarchists. It's frightening to see children raised in families like these that feed them non-sensical, truly unbelievable conspiracy theories from a young age.",/review/rw8775317/?ref_=tt_urv
4 January 2023,tomqcollins,8," Unflinching look at how crazy this country has become
","I wasn't familiar with Andrew Callaghan's work prior to learning of this documentary, but based on some other reviews he seems to have a following. I was also pretty sure I'd seen and heard everything there was to know about the events of January 06, 2021 and Qanon.",/review/rw8775317/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2022,jsn_dacruz,6," Love Andrew, and really wanted to love this
","Channel 5 is immensely entertaining, and is a testament to Andrew's impartial interview style. Unfortunately, this extended format focused on a narrative that was never fleshed out.",/review/rw8775317/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2023,joeytosi,4," Better off watching YouTube vid about juggalos.
","This is basically a collection of home video snippets where the filmmaker tried to go viral. There's not much of a through line in this documentary. The irony in this documentary is that the filmmaker is a dude looking for attention, much like the subjects in his doc. There is only one memorable moment in this documentary. After spending a lot of time with a convicted pedophile conspiracy theorist, the filmmaker surmises that the reason this dude fell down the rabbit hole is that he is just trying to add some meaning to his broken life. That moment was sublime. However, the rest of this ""documentary"" is akin to a collection of bum fights on YouTube, but it fails to be as entertaining. It's designed to be provocative and speak to a younger audience who isn't looking for depth. It's shallow and obvious and shameless. It doesn't have much of anything to say and doesn't keep a focused theme or point of view other than being focused on the provocative side of right wing politics while attempting to paint all conservatives with the same brush. It's even disingenuous about that, pretending to be balanced in its approach by peppering in a few lefty crazies for good measure. This was a bummer. Stick to the guys YouTube channel where the expectation is much lower and he can deliver on the promise. In this case, this dude bit off more then he could chew. He places himself a the center of his doc to because he thinks his brand and personality is strong enough to sustain us for an hour, but it's not.",/review/rw8775317/?ref_=tt_urv

6 January 2023,ColinTheGorilla,8," Wow
",I'm super proud that Andrew Callaghan was able to get a HBO documentary and I'm glad with how he did it. He shows unbiased thoughts and let's everyone voice their opinions. This really exceeded my expectations and I think it's 100% worth this watch as it really does show how politics affect our country and how it does bad and that the media only wants to show you certain things instead of other things. I'm proud Andrew Callaghan was able to get this documentary and I think he really did such an amazing job and I'm super happy for him since this was so enjoyable and I think it was a pretty good documentary.,/review/rw8775317/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2023,utahlgbtq,1," What did I just watch?
","I wanted to like this more, but felt like it lost direction and had no general thesis or structure. It was a bit all over the place. Good interviews wild people, but this ""documentary"" - and I'm not even sure I can even call it this. Does Andrew actually know what he is talking about? I think he did a good job finding crazy people - but there is no direct point to this movie. It is just a bit disjointed and all over the place.",/review/rw8775317/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2023,thedannycameron,10," Fantastic Documentary by Andrew
","I've enjoyed Channel 5 for a while, because Andrew is such a smart interviewer, letting people just talk. It's amazing how much people can dig their own graves, if allowed to speak without an interviewer shoving their agenda down their throat.",/review/rw8775317/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2023,the-antichrist-is-near,9," Amazing and dystopian
","Andrew Callaghan is one of the best interviewers around these days. Not one to hack into his subjects, trying to pull the answers out, but sometimes merely a bystander guiding them into comfortably throwing their weird ideas and beliefs onto the table. I'm no expert in the land of documentaries and interviews, but truly do believe Callaghan has found a new and fresh style of interviewing with this.",/review/rw8775317/?ref_=tt_urv

","I would recommend to all people in every country to watch this, especially those who handle the media. I am not from America, but a similar scenario happened to this country when election was happening. I wish all of the media are as objective as him and covering all sides. I hope we all get to the point where we see how toxic is extreme polarity. In the end, it's all the capitalists game of selling merchandise and selling biased information. I hope we get to the point where we are in balanced. However, that rarely happens. This ""civil war"" has shown to us how the common people are the pawns. We're being played. I hope we all get to realize that we have to step back first in order to arrive at the best action towards an event. Don't throw yourself immediately into the hordes.",/review/rw8775317/?ref_=tt_urv
