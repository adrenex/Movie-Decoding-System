","Lovecraft has always fascinated me. I can't say I've read any of his works but the ideas of extra dimensional horrors beyond our comprehension is such an interesting concept. Because of that, I was pretty hyped for a show centering on Lovecraftian horror and if ever I thought one would deliver it, it would be the one named after it, right?",/review/rw6297721/?ref_=tt_urv
6 October 2020,misty_hendon,4," Awful
","I'm baffled by the high reviews for this. I love sci-fi and horror and all the kooky stories out there, but this was even too much for me. There is so much going on and it doesn't follow any clear path. The description of ""man looking for his father"" is so misleading. It's illuminati, mutants, magic, racism, vampires, monsters, ghosts, and even more. But it's so much that you just can't keep up! By the time I got to episode 5 I realized I didn't give a crap about any of the characters. None of them form a connection with the viewers. I was so disappointed.",/review/rw6297721/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2021,namob-43673,3," Tries to do it all and fails
","This is 5% scify, 5% adventure, 5% drama, 5% action, 5% anti-racism, 5% fake history...5%... 5%... and so on and so further. This is basically everything thrown in a blender spitting things out randomly and so quickly that in the end you do not care about anything.",/review/rw6297721/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2020,gmacfilms,3," I wanted to love it...
","Pros:
The music/soundtrack for the film is fantastic. I love how they incorporated old recordings of civil rights leaders into the soundtrack. Very effective.",/review/rw6297721/?ref_=tt_urv
6 November 2020,Azanspy,3," Ugh.
","This is simply one of the worst series I have ever watched. I enjoyed Riverdale better than this. The Pilot episode and the Korean episode was the only goo episodes. I don't why but I felt the performances were also poor eventhough they're all great actress. Maybe it's because of the poor story. Overall, I hated it (even the sex scenes) and I won't watch this if it gets renewed.",/review/rw6297721/?ref_=tt_urv
14 October 2020,On_The_Mark,2," Two episodes and I could barely get through those
","They just took a bunch of ideas and threw them into a blender. There is no coherence to anything in these episodes. They're hard to get through. I painfully got through the first two episodes and that was that. The ""Moving on up"" scene was dreadful, among others. I don't know what will happen to the characters but I couldn't care less. They were just cardboard cutouts you don't care about and since the ""story"" is all over the place, I can't figure out why anyone else does. This thing has a lot of 10 star reviews and I'm wondering if they even saw the same thing I did or they think they look smart by giving this poorly written drivel ten stars.",/review/rw6297721/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2020,stevebondi,6," Good start, but ultimately unsatisfying

14 November 2020,HeirOfDorne,5," Disappointed
","The series tried tying together so many ideas in such a short period that it ended up being way too choppy. Every episode feels like its purpose is to highlight racial inequality during the time period, rather than delivering a coherent plot. It focused so much on race that it really hampered the enjoyability of the fantasy aspects.",/review/rw6297721/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2020,elli56,6," I really wanted to love this show
","AND after the opening episode, even with the unexpected fantasy ending! I was hooked & raving about it to anyone who would listen.....",/review/rw6297721/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2020,caroline_chupaa,7," Well, well..
",Wanted to like it. First episode was really good and so was the second and third one but after that it pretty much went downhill.. too much going one and not finishing a story before it starts a new one. Too bad. The beginning it had so much potential,/review/rw6297721/?ref_=tt_urv
25 December 2020,Tsull73-503-253468,5," Ultimately, it doesn't work.
","The first few episodes are decent and well written. But, it really gets tedious during the last few episodes. I stopped caring about the characters. Tic could live or die. By the end, I simply didn't care. At some point, you need more than bad white people to keep a story going. This just becomes a convoluted tiresome uninteresting mess. Jordan Peele and JJ Abrams continue to deliver average forgetable content.",/review/rw6297721/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2020,sage-42618,4," It started high, then ran downhill
","This series is a mess. It's never clear what exactly the message is. Is it about racism? All of the characters practice it. ALL white people are bad, but not all black people are good, especially the ones who betray their families for their white lovers. History? The actual history that is mentioned never relates to the plot. Gay people are made evil. Magic is desirable, especially if you can use it to hurt people. I watched every episode, some of them twice, trying to figure out what exactly was going on. What was I supposed to learn? I have no idea. And what were those monsters in the woods? Never explained. I wasted my time, but I can say I saw it. Knowing the state of awards now, this will probably walk away with all of them and I'll still ask why.",/review/rw6297721/?ref_=tt_urv
24 September 2020,Radu_A,2," Script, script, SCRIIIIPT!
","I tuned into this expecting something along the lines of American Horror Story, not Lovecraft - I knew this wasn't based on his works. Instead, this is a bit like Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter - there is a basic premise, but the story is all over the place so there is zero suspense. Loosely connected noise with some pseudo-intellectual banter. Had they focused on dialogue, it might have worked, had they spent some money on the CGI - which is cringe-worthy - it might have entertained. However, like most of the stuff with Jordan Peele attached, it's unbelievably lazy. Like, absolutely no effort at all. The actors do a fine job, but they're not given anything to work with.",/review/rw6297721/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2020,rwfanj,4," Started off great...then went off the rails.
","I was really impressed with the first two episodes, the third episode turned a bit strange, while the fourth and fifth have just sent it off the rails.
I'm a big Michael Kenneth Williams fan so I figured it'd be a great series, and there's nothing wrong at all with the acting or the actors, it's just not making sense.
I'm really disappointed because the story is getting hard to follow, it seems like it just took off on a completely unrelated tangent away from the science fiction and historical baseline that was established at the beginning. It holds true to the times of the 1950's, the racial injustice, etc., but beyond that it just seems to be kind of aimless.
I really don't know what to say beyond the fact that I'm disappointed.",/review/rw6297721/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2020,tomarm-21596,4," Seems to be about racism...and so much less
","Anyone have a clue what it's about? Kind of an disjointed mess. Too bad, as clearly lots of expense went into it, and it has good actors. Was ready to quit into ep 3, finally watched all 10 via dvr (maybe out of curiosity). Yes, racism Is a very bad thing, but that's something (hopefully) most of us really know, already. A series also needs a comprehensible a story and writing, with some sense of dramatic flow.",/review/rw6297721/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2020,jonathanmarklund,3," This is my attempt at a fair review
","This show is based on Matt Ruff's novel. Not on any of the original Lovecraft works. The people who are complaining about propaganda, liberal media, or bla bla bla are idiots. The TV-show is following the source material fairly well. They didn't choose the title just to cash in on the Lovecraft name, they choose this work because they clearly liked the source.",/review/rw6297721/?ref_=tt_urv

17 August 2020,UniqueParticle,10," Off to a superb start
","Great cast, scenery, music, cinematography and intriguing acting! I've been anticipating this show awhile even before there was a trailer with the creators/ producers involved plus I binged Underground by Misha Green a couple months ago. Not sure why Lovecraft Country already has a 5.7 definitely deserves better! From the trailers I can imagine the rest is exhilaratingly unique and has so much potential.",/review/rw6297721/?ref_=tt_urv

27 October 2020,shaun-35238,2," Ran off the rails
","Started promisingly but soon got quite lost and never really found itself again.
Struggled to keep my interest.
The character Abbey Lee Kershaw played seemed to be hamstrung by writers or directors.
Keep scrolling to the next show on your list",/review/rw6297721/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2021,imperialwalkrnyr,1," Beyond Bad...cringeworthy

17 August 2020,dsruss-770-941629,5," Updated review - There are too many trolls these days.
",The artificially depressed rating of this show is shameful. Every technical element in this pilot episode is a 9/10 or higher. The script could be tighter. 7/10. Acting is superb. 8/10. Overall 8/10 and I cant wait to watch episode 2.,/review/rw6297721/?ref_=tt_urv

","What a mess this is. The actors do their best with what they are given but even they can't help this gigantic turd. There are brief moments of creativity but that creativity takes things beyond any semblance of coherence. If you have tons to waste by all means use it for that. If not, pass it up.",/review/rw6297721/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2020,sinmoybycosmoy-89613,2," Tried way too many things. Except Horror.
","I really wanted to see this series. Lovecraft name was the primary reason. But what it turned out was a mash-up of Social Justice messaging, pathetic CGI, laughable Indiana Jones copy, tired copy-pasted writing, series wide discontinuity and clearly the characters were not sure what emotion they need to portray. The protagonist was forever frowned, his father forever high-toned and all characters extremely foul mouthing. But what this series completely bypasses is horror. You will laugh at the so called horror scenes.",/review/rw6297721/?ref_=tt_urv
