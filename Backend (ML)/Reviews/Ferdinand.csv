5 December 2002,kalel6868,9," Lots of Fun, and Tuneful Too!
","Waaaaaaaaaaaay back in the early 1990's, when Jeffrey Katzenberg was still a top exec at Disney, he had one of his less successful ideas -- to bring back the break-into-song musical.  So, as the story goes, he selected three scripts that were about to go into production and gave them to Disney Music Maestro Alan Menken and asked him which of the scripts could be turned into a musical.",/review/rw1911773/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2002,BRiTbOhO83,," Carry the banner!
","I'm 19 years old in college. I sing the music from this movie on my way to class. And people stop me and say ""that's from 'Newsies!' I love that movie!"" How many times do you get that kind of response? This movie was exciting, well-choreographed, and funny. It has the best ingredients a musical could have. The best part...you can find this stuff in the history books (well, maybe not dancing newsboys and Robert Duvall playing Joseph Pulitzer...but nobody's perfect...except Christian Bale). See it, love it, brings the kids. They'll want to carry the banner after the movie's long over.",/review/rw1911773/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2000,scoobyg69,," This is a movie that you can STAND UP AND CHEER about!
","In 1992, Hollywood has all but lost the fine art of movie-musicals, then along came this film & PRESTO, Disney breathed NEW LIFE into the forgotten art.  NEWSIES entertains on ALL levels. The songs are singable and catchy, the dancing is lively, the charactors are lovable, and the story is PURELY INSPIRATIONAL!!!  This movie works so well on the screen, and could VERY EASILY work as a Broadway Stage Production, that's the feeling it carries. This movie is So MUCH FUN, and I don't feel ashamed for announcing that. This is a movie that you could STAND UP and CHEER about!  Christian Bale delivers a powerful performance in acting, singing, AND dancing, and the rest of the boys are equally as talanted.  Headlines don't sell papes, NEWSIES sell papes, and they SOLD ME on this film.  NEWSIES DELIVERS!!!!",/review/rw1911773/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 2002,Funnibone31,6," i absolutely love this movei!!
","apart from being a wonderful musical (which i've grown up watching so i can tell a good from a bad) it also has a wonderful story-line.  the plot is so well thought of, it isn't every day when they make a musical about a strike that happened in 1899.  i fell in love with this movie the first time i watched it.  it's classical, and when you see it, you can't help but liking it.  the dancing, acting, and singing is great.  i don't know many teenagers who can dance and sing like that!  evenn thought this movie was made 10 years ago and i don't remember it, it's starting to come back.  my mom's friend called one day saying that her daughter loves this movie called newsies, and i said that i love it!  i thought nobody knew about it, but i was wrong.  how could you forget a great movie like this?  if you haven't seen it, i gaurentee you 100% that you will probably end up liking it as much as i do.",/review/rw1911773/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2005,fearfalls,10," Movie that never gets old!
","When I first watched this movie, I was just 3 years old.. My mom tells me that my little brother and I used to dance and jump off couches and try to spin around on the ceiling fan, and sing, when we watched this movie... ",/review/rw1911773/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2006,jimmylee-1,5," Making a Musical Makes News
","So, I'm reading the comments for Newsies, expecting to find some suitably pithy remarks since this movie was universally panned upon release. But apparently I've stumbled on Tiger Beat magazine's subscription base. Or, to be more forgiving, a group of musical fans that will do anything to see the genre return.",/review/rw1911773/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2020,lisafordeay,7," Really entertaining
","Newsies is a 1992 musical starring Christian Bale,David Moscow,Bill Pullman and Aaron Lohr and is based on true events about newsboys who are trying to make a difference. Music from Alan Menken was great and the story was good.",/review/rw1911773/?ref_=tt_urv

2 May 2020,LeonardKniffel,9," Astonishing Young Performers
","This is a musical based on the New York City newsboy strike of 1899. When young newspaper sellers stood up to their ruthless, exploitative bosses. Disney produced this tough precursor to television musicals in which young people burst into songs largely related to their own angst. The young men who perform in this musical are nothing short of astonishing. This is a musical in the truest sense; the songs tell the story. Ann-Margret, often underappreciated as an actress, shines in the small role of Medda Larkson. You will look into the faces of these self-described ""bunch of street rats"" and wonder how such performances are made to happen--and wonder even more about the real boys who inspired them. Although this show never produced any ""hit tunes"" of note, ""The World Will Know"" and ""Seize the Day"" stand out as the best scenes in the film. Watch carefully and you'll catch young Christian Bale in the cast. ---from Musicals on the Silver Screen, American Library Association, 2013",/review/rw1911773/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2000,JennieB,10," A Thousand Fans. One Great Film.
","""Newsies"" is one of the few Disney films that can be classified as 'great'. What makes it even more amazing is the fact that, although it's a Disney movie and based on actual events, it actually stays very close to what actually happened. (Who would've thought?) The movie has a very good script, great acting, and music that make even the biggest musical-hater tapping his/her feet. Add into this mix show-stopping choreography, humor, and some of the best actors and actresses you can find anywhere, and you will see why this movie has generated more fans than any other movie in history.",/review/rw1911773/?ref_=tt_urv
29 February 2012,ceeingred13,9," Uplifting and fun, takes me back to younger years
","Very important movie from my childhood. It has it's obvious flaws, too long, a few unnecessary musical numbers, not very true to historical events, but for me the positives outweigh it.",/review/rw1911773/?ref_=tt_urv
5 August 2004,vampireslayer277-1,10," Excellent Movie
","This is a fantastic movie for people of all ages. It has historical information presented in a fun, and exciting way that keeps viewers entertained throughout. It is a brilliant musical filled with catchy tunes by Academy Award Winner Alan Menken, that wrote songs for The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast, that keep you humming and singing even after the movie is over. Great dialogue between characters and fantastic dance sequences. The Newsies is filled with a incredibly talented cast, including Christian Bale, Robert Duvall, Gabriel Damon, Max Casella, Aaron Lohr, Ann-Margaret, David Moscow, and much more. Overall, a very entertaining movie, highly recommended for everyone!!!",/review/rw1911773/?ref_=tt_urv
30 November 2004,Mytowngirl,," An energetic,family friendly film.
","It is so hard to find something that the whole family can watch but this one of the few. Christian Bale does it again bringing laughter and tears to his portrayal of Jack Kelly. Jack is a Newsie(a young boy who sells newspapers) that helps lead a stike against the newspaper owners of NYC in the late 1800's. With the help of his friends, Jack overcomes and wins his rights as a working boy of NYC. Along the way he wins the heart of the girl he loves,confronts his past, and sings and dances his way into the hearts of everyone how watches this film. The music and dance routines are fun and energetic,making everyone want to join in the fun. Includes apreances by:Bill Pulman and Ann-Margret. Music by: Alan Menkin",/review/rw1911773/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2004,ForeverRhapsodey,10," Fantastic Film!
","I loved this film! We had used a dance number from it for a musical I was in and we watched the film at out cast party. I had heard my friends talk about this film before but had never watched it. I love the story and everything about this film! The songs are so catchy, my personal favourites are Carrying The Banner, King of New York, and Seize the Day. My favourite characters are Mush, Jack, Les, Crutchy and David. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes musicals and good songs. Alan Menkin wrote most of the music and he was the one who wrote the music for The Little Mermaid so you know it has to be good! After watching this movie for the first time, I asked for it as a Christmas present. I also bought the soundtrack so that I could listen to the songs wherever I went. I love this musical and it will always be in my top 10 movies list. I don't see how anyone could not like this movie. I've never met anyone who hasn't liked it yet. Kind of like the same thing with the Princess Bride. I don't a single person who doesn't like this movie! I give it 10 stars!!!",/review/rw1911773/?ref_=tt_urv
5 May 2003,JupiterAmy,," What a fine movie.
","Having seen this movie in the theatres when it was released, at the age of eight, I have a real affection for it. I had the hugest crush on Spot Conlon. It's hard to find faults in a movie like that. How you feel about this movie will probably depend on how receptive you are to it. Chances are, you'll have one of two reactions while watching ""Newsies"". One: ""I can't believe I'm watching a musical about newsboys."" Two: ""I freakin' *love* this movie.""",/review/rw1911773/?ref_=tt_urv
13 November 2018,mosevale-05131,5," Review history through film
",This movie was kinda corny i thought at least because they were singing with their New York accents. Other than that i thought it was a decent film with a goof story with a message about not letting the rich guy control you. I liked the time frame it was set in.,/review/rw1911773/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2018,jessiejones-59844,6," Who knew batman could dance?
",Watching this musical for the first time was interesting I am pretty sure that the riots are accurate but the songs and dances not that much. I was entertained but it's just not my taste. I didn't enjoy it very much but if you're looking for a historical film that shows some amazing choreography then look no further.,/review/rw1911773/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2005,gioia345,," Movie Review
","'""Newsies"" keeps itself from an educational documentary by holding the Pulitzer and Hearst conflict, Theodore Roosevelt and effectiveness of strikes in the periphery. Indeed, it forces historical accuracy out of the periphery and into the trashcan to provide a feel good ending for the film.",/review/rw1911773/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2009,pc95,5," Disjointed,w/ Poor Singing
","An early Christian Bale movie during his late teenage years, Newsies features support from Robert Duvall and Bill Pullman. It seems worn out, the singing is average to poor especially by Bale and the storyline doesn't flow and is disjointed. Most outdoors scenes seem like backlot sets, but costuming is fairly well done. Dialog is mostly run of the mill. Newsies may harken back to a time when Newspapers were the information highways and all important, but this Disney effort doesn't have the talent direction or musical numbers to stand tall with a movie like say Annie. It tries and deserves some points for what it can muster - maybe worth a look if you like musicals.",/review/rw1911773/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2007,griffolyon12,10," An amazing movie,that is flat-out entertaining!
","Newsies is a wonderful movie musical put out in the early 90s by Disney.Although the film initially bombed at the box office.It has,over the past 15 years or so,gained a cult following through video sales and multiple broadcasts on the Disney channel.I first heard about this movie a few months ago,so my curious self went out and bought it,and I fell in love with it.",/review/rw1911773/?ref_=tt_urv

11 March 2022,athorpe-95303,7," One of the best musicals adapted to film
","Remarks: That was good. Not as good as I remember from my childhood, and nowhere near as good as Courtayrd's rendition ;) but still really good. I appreciate all the effort and coordination that went into so many large musical numbers, but regardless, there were a few flaws. The dialogue was kinda mid, and the cinematography wasn't anything special. The music and acting were, I thought, quite extraordinary though. Excellent cast, excellent plot, overall a very good film/musical. 74/100",/review/rw1911773/?ref_=tt_urv

17 September 2019,laurasomia,7," A young Christian Bale singing and dancing around!
",This moving is a testament to how good of an actor Christian Bale is. The casting director literally picked a Welch actor -who absolutely couldn't sing or dance if his life depended on it- to play the lead character in this disney musical about New York kids unionizing. Amazing.,/review/rw1911773/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2008,missmissa,8," Fans Carry the Banner
","It will probably always be remembered as a box-office disaster, but Newsies wasn't a disaster because it's a bad movie, it was simply ill timed. If it had been made 35 years earlier, it would have probably been a huge hit, but it came out in 1992 and was an initial disaster. Oops.",/review/rw1911773/?ref_=tt_urv
