",So they replace the lead guy with Dylan who was very very recently on the Law & Order series. I keep picturing him as Wheatley. Bad move. Was really enjoying it before and liking his new found romance with his girlfriend and his daughter. That's all gone. Now we have former bad guy Wheatley turning into a good guy is a matter of months.,/review/rw5392981/?ref_=tt_urv

24 February 2022,rhodeosc,3," Alexa Davalos, speak up!!!!!
","Why does Alexa Davalos's character talk like that. It's like a loud whisper. No matter what happens, her volume never goes any higher. It doesn't make her character mysterious it just makes her annoying. I have to turn the caption on just so I know what she's saying . There's also the matter of that stupid look she has on her face all the time. The character is lame.",/review/rw5392981/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2021,Kaleecee,6," New Agent Season 3,,,, HORRIBLE
","I mostly liked this show from the beginning, then they started losing actors, which was a bummer, but I still liked it until the new agent in season 3 came... she is horrible! She is always sulking! She looks pissed all the time. She acts like she owns the place and knows all! There is no chemistry or camaraderie with her and anyone else. PLEASE bring in someone with a little charm and personality!",/review/rw5392981/?ref_=tt_urv
21 September 2022,pbenvin-04957,7," Too Many Political Episodes
","I've been watching this show from the start and read the other reviews from time to time. Others don't seem to like Dylan McDermott because of his previous villain roles. I have never seen any of those other roles so have nothing to compare this one too. I have to admit that I like the Remy character much better than Jess, he's not as brooding and morose as Jess was. I am not a big fan of Julian McMahon and kept seeing Dr Christian Troy from Nip/Tuck.",/review/rw5392981/?ref_=tt_urv
24 May 2022,fjmetro,2," Not worth it
","After LaCroix died I wondered how the show could survive. Surprise, the cast was great. Then along came over stuffed, fat headed, obnoxious Remy. Get rid of him and I'll be back. Bye.",/review/rw5392981/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2020,andrewrye-06535,2," Boring
","This was just a waste of time. I was hoping for a new take on the FBI serial. But nope. As others have said it is a rehash on old stories. I can't work out why the others are there yet, they don't seem to help the story along or add anything to the group. There is certainly no chemistry.
I was just bored, I even left the room for 10 mins and forgot it only to return and had no trouble seeing nothing had happened. And the dramatic music is annoying when they are talking. Why is it there???
Wont be watching anymore, hopefully it fades in to the ether.",/review/rw5392981/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2020,Ed-Shullivan,3," It may be a new series but with very old and rehashed story lines ad nauseam
",Nothing new here folks. A mature middle-aged widower raising his daughter on his own leads yet another team of good looking and buffed FBI agents. The pilot episode is as new as that bad smell caused by a lone vegetable long forgotten and rotting wet and stinky in the back of your vegetable crisper.,/review/rw5392981/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2020,cerivs-29558,1," How many stereotypes can you cram into an hour...
","About half way into it I was thinking maybe episode #2 would be better as so far the show was nothing but pandering to every stereotype cop show and situation I have ever seen, all in less than 30 minutes.
Being a retired, ex-policeman, and avid TV and movie buff, I've seen a lot of cop/crime fighting oriented productions and situations but upon getting to the predictable ending I don't think this show deserves my time for a 2nd look or viewing of episode 2.
The original ""FBI"" is barely tolerable and enough time spent turning off my brain during the week for that hour. I keep hoping that gets better too.
But this show had no nuance, and was an example of flagrant predictable crap. This is insulting to the viewer.
The characters were superficial and in the first show you already gave too much info on their quirks and dysfunctions which they brazenly air in public, no less.
Although I've seen several of the actors in other shows where I've like them and they do good to great work, they're not the problem here, it's the writing. Pee-eew!
A word of advice, stop trying so hard, quantity is not as good as quality and ease into development of the personalities as these people were simplistic and cartoonish and I already don't like them or their dysfunctions.
Then again, dumbing down may works for the general public... ie. look at L&O: SUV, NCIS:NOLA... a lot of good actors...,
wasted, but that crap is still on. Who knows maybe you've got a hit?!?",/review/rw5392981/?ref_=tt_urv

26 September 2020,Jbird65,1," Don't torture yourself
","Avoid this liberal drivel at all costs. If you don't, you'll be angry at yourself for the time you wasted on it. It has a fairly decent cast and had the potential to be brilliants but the writers chose to go the generic woke nonsene way instead.",/review/rw5392981/?ref_=tt_urv
8 April 2021,cdeanroane,1," One of the worse things under the Dick Wolf banner.
",From a cast that is totally unrealistic with dubious acting talent this show just drags on and on. The lead actor seems to feel his personal opinion is better then federal laws he is suppose to enforce and being paid to do. This is a liberal piece of Hollywood agenda to enforce this ideas on the rest of the country.,/review/rw5392981/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2020,schubej-1,2," Poor Sequel
","The original FBI series is unrealistic and formulaic but there is good chemistry with the characters which makes it worth watching. The first episode of this series had an incredibly poor script, characters totally lacking any chemistry and a lead actor that either lacks acting skills or is forced by the Director look totally foolish. I usually try to give new programs at least two viewings before I decide on its value but in this case I don't see anything that merits watching a second showing.",/review/rw5392981/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2021,cockezville,8," Good procedural
","If you like Dick Wolf shows, this one is good. The best part of the show is the acting chops of Terry O'Quinn and Julian McMahon, and their complicated relationship. Supporting cast is quite good. It works for me .",/review/rw5392981/?ref_=tt_urv

3 April 2022,dtobert,6," Actor wants to Leave Series
","An actor wants to leave the series, so the writers get together to plan his exit. ""Let's do something original, let's kill him off."" You have got to be kidding me. That has been done a million times. The FBI transfers people all the time. Why not transfer him or medically retire him due to the shooting or have him retire due to the shock of the shooting. In any of the scenarios he could come back as a guest star. However, killing him off probably seems easier because they don't have to think too hard.",/review/rw5392981/?ref_=tt_urv

30 October 2021,Phylum22,5," Not bad, better with the new guy.

This has to be the worse piece of junk for a so-called show.

9 January 2020,gdump,5," I'm giving it a chance -- a very small chance
","The first episode was awful. Predictable, badly acted by everyone, terrible script, and obnoxiously intrusive music. But, there just might be a small chance for a decent show to be hiding underneath all that... stuff. I'm going to give it 3 episodes on the small chance that this was just the writers trying to make a n impression on the pilot episode, and then I'll give it my personal thumbs up/down.",/review/rw5392981/?ref_=tt_urv
