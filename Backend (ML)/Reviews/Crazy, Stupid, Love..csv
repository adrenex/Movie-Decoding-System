16 October 2019,bowmanblue,7," It brings out the kid in you
","Superhero this, superhero that. Someone gets super powers and ends up fighting an evil version of themselves with similar abilities. If you've seen one (recent) superhero movie then you've probably seen them all and it gets to the stage where you start to wonder if there's anything new a film company can bring to the genre. I'm pleased to say that, despite following most superhero cliches, 'Shazam!' has enough going for it to make it definitely worth a watch.",/review/rw4748038/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2019,Clive_W,8," DC doing it right
","DC has had a rocky road, but shazam, aka captain marvel was an enjoyable film, silly yet fun, found a good medium, and the villain was great. Can't wait for Black Adam. See it if you just want some fun and nothing serious.",/review/rw4748038/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2021,dybae,7," Easy watching
","Easy watching, some funny bits. Starts off well but then gets a bit muddled in its ideas and a bit 'seen it all before'. I think the 7/10 is accurate but it a good seven.",/review/rw4748038/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2019,bkoganbing,7," A show for kids of all ages
","My only previous reference to Shazam! is the 70s morning TV series that Michael
Gray and Les Tremayne starred in with two different actor playing the adult Captain Marvel. It was shot on a shoestring budget with Gray and Tremayne wearing the same clothing every episode.",/review/rw4748038/?ref_=tt_urv
6 September 2019,classicsoncall,7," ""If a super-hero can't save his family, he's not much of a super-hero!""
","Finally, the DC Comics franchise managed to inject some humor into one of their super-hero projects. A lot of it works, though the story line is merely so-so, as the target audience appears to be well below the age of the average DC based film which is darker in tone. With that in mind, it probably would have been a good idea to temper some of the language to make it an all around, better family friendly picture. I didn't care much for the character of young Billy Batson (Asher Angel), his personality didn't seem right to be selected as the 'chosen one'. I actually liked his foster brother Freddy (Jack Dylan Grazer) better; he seemed to have some of the qualities, and even the looks of the young Fred Savage in ""The Wonder Years"" television program. It probably comes as no surprise that the release of this picture around the same time as ""Captain Marvel"" would confuse comic book fans who thought both Captain Marvel and Shazam were one and the same character. It even had be puzzled for a while when the titles were announced, but changing story lines, ethnicity and genders is nothing new for comic book writers looking to push the envelope on transforming existing characters. The picture is pretty well balanced between the comedic aspects of the players and the threat posed by the evil Dr. Sivana (Mark Strong) and his Seven Deadly Sin allies. The foster home setting at the center of the story was a good one to demonstrate how kids in that kind of environment can learn to overcome their circumstances and achieve personal goals and fulfillment; in that regard, teenage Mary (Grace Fulton) was a perfectly good role model. I don't know that this film would lead to an even more effective sequel, though one of the credits scenes hinted as much. I did like the final scene after all the credits rolled in which an in joke was leveled at Aquaman's expense, and the final clip in the movie proper ended things on a high note with the appearance of a faceless Superman. When the film makers follow up on this one, it would be a good idea to maintain the same sense of fun this one had.",/review/rw4748038/?ref_=tt_urv
12 September 2019,PennyReviews,8," Good Enough
","Shazam! was light, funny and simple. It was actually pretty much what you expect from a super hero movie : the tragic past, the super villain, the transformation, the built up and the final great battle. However, what this movie had extra was the comedy factor, the teenager's theme and a more heartly story, all of which can't be easily found in the nowdays superhero movies that focus on the action and visuals rather than the actual story.",/review/rw4748038/?ref_=tt_urv
6 April 2019,piggulu,6," Decent, but wholly unimpressive
","Technically a 6.5, but definitely not anything to be thrilled about, as there isn't much novelty. I'm not familiar with the comics so I had no special expectations. I can honestly say it was a fun movie, but I just don't see where the glowing praise is coming from.",/review/rw4748038/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2021,danielmanson,7," Little predictable, but very fun
","So I finally decided to give this a go and I have to say, I'm a little annoyed I waited this long, because it's a very fun film.",/review/rw4748038/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2019,dynamiteheaddy-43387,7," Probably an unpopular opinion
","It was pretty much exactly what I expected which is a really enjoyable and lighthearted superhero film with some funny moments and that will be enough for most people but it just didn't blow me away. No way this is a 10 like some are suggesting and to nitpick, adult Billy acts nothing like young Billy at all. Don't get me wrong - its still a fun movie which I can recommend.",/review/rw4748038/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2019,jakebirkel,9," The future is bright for the DCEU with chapters like these!
","I got to see an early screening of Shazam! at my local theater, and boy did it not disappoint. It's not flawless, but the good outweighs the bad more often than not. With a bright story, boundless energy, and an irresistible sense of fun, this is certainly one of the best-if not the best-installment of the DCEU so far.",/review/rw4748038/?ref_=tt_urv

11 May 2019,bloodworia,6," A real childrens movie
",I've seen some reviews before and this movie was supposed to be somehow good. It really was just meh. But i think for children (even though there were some questionable hard scenes) it could be something nice. Also the after credit scene was probably more hilarious than the actual movie.,/review/rw4748038/?ref_=tt_urv
12 April 2019,NpMoviez,8," Nice addition in DCEU.
","If this was the potential of DCEU, why on earth movies like Justice League, BvS and Suicide Squad even exist? The more I watch films like this, the more I think Snyder was the biggest mistake of DCEU.",/review/rw4748038/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2021,Pyro_Pizza,7," The Good side of the DCEU
","A lot of the DCEU movies are overly dark and gritty but not Shazam, it's bright, colorful, funny, and has a heartfelt story. The film's pacing at times can be a little slow and not all of the jokes land, but overall this is perfect movie to watch with the family.",/review/rw4748038/?ref_=tt_urv

21 June 2019,kosmasp,8," Captain Marvel
","I'm pretty certain I'm not the only one using that summary line. And it is not because any of us are Marvel (Cinematic Universe) fanboys - well I guess it is sort of true in my case, can't talk about the others. But just to the effect that I really enjoy the movies they put out. It is not that I prefer the comics from one publisher more than others.",/review/rw4748038/?ref_=tt_urv
15 April 2019,TheBigSick,," The worst superhero movie of all time
","The idea of the film is essentially copied/plagiarized from Tom Hanks's 1988 hit Big, but is much worse in every possible way. The visual effects are cheap and lousy. Levi's performance is a disaster. The tones of the young Billy and the grownup Billy are not consistent. The buildup is too long, and the plot lacks credibility. The result is a mindless comedy that is neither funny nor with heart.",/review/rw4748038/?ref_=tt_urv

12 April 2019,tandc-53810,1," POSITIVE REVIEWS ARE A FRAUD ON YOU!
","After 45minutes of sheer boredom, I walked out of this movie and saw Dumbo instead. As the honest reviewers have aptly noted, SHAZAM! is designed for younger children age 8-14. Older teenagers and adults will find this movie tedious, unimaginative, and hard to watch for more than 15 minutes. The reviewers who gave this a ""10"" are purposely fooling you; they likely were paid to do it. Don't fall for this amateurish mess. I've seen better CG on cable.
