26 October 2021,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,9," The most endearing film of 2021! Hilarious!
","Simply put, Swan Song is the most heartwarming film I have seen come out this year, and the greatest Udo Kier role/performance I've ever seen by a long shot. Though all film fans should know Udo Kier, since he's been appearing in things nonstop since the 60's, this is the perfect time to get to know him if you don't already. I came across this one on streaming (Hulu) with a friend and we are both so immensely glad we noticed it and decided to give it a chance. It's one of the my favorite movies of 2021.",/review/rw7319347/?ref_=tt_urv
31 May 2021,Red-125,9," A road movie within Sandusky, Ohio
","Swan Song (II) (2021) was written and directed by Todd Stephens. It's a narrative film, but the protagonist, Pat Pitsenbarger was a well-known flamboyant gay hairdresser in Sandusky. When director Stephens was young, he knew Pitsenbarger. Also, Stephens gathered anecdotes about Pitsenbarger from other people who had known him.",/review/rw7319347/?ref_=tt_urv
19 March 2021,ferguson-6,7," one last go
","SXSW 2021
Greetings again from the darkness. It's never too late. We've all heard the phrase, but is it accurate ... at least mostly? Writer-director Todd Stephens met the real life Pat Pitsenbarger in a small town gay bar, and he turned that person into this engaging story by casting the great Udo Kier in the lead. When we first meet Pat, he's living a life of daily drudgery in a nursing home. He's a curmudgeon whose hobbies are folding (perfectly) the paper napkins he takes from the cafeteria, and sneaking a smoke when no one is looking. We also see how tenderly he treats an incapacitated neighbor. It's not the last time we see his two sides.",/review/rw7319347/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2021,MrDeWinters,10," great indie
","Very poetic, colourful, sad and uplifting at the same time. Not without shortcomings, too slow at times, but real and heart breaking. Great to see Jennifer Coolidge in a more down to earth part, without that silly voice of hers. 10 for story and effort.",/review/rw7319347/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2021,ronterry55,9," Udo Kier shines
","Just saw Swan Song, and I was totally taken with Udo Kier's performance as Pat. He is a retired hairdresser and gay cabaret performer who lives in a nursing home. When he is offered 25K to do the hair & makeup on a deceased friend ( Linda Evans); he initially refuses . But he then leaves the home to do the job. We find out why he at first refused to help, and his story unfolds as he walks through the streets of Sandusky, Ohio. He meets old and new friends and each plays a part in telling his story.",/review/rw7319347/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2021,akira-hideyo,10," Oscar worthy!
","It has class, soul, empathy, nostalgia, passage, character, value......and its timeless gem of a movie. Udo deserves critical acclaim for his role that embodies all these. Thank you for this beautiful and precious piece of exquisite vintage.",/review/rw7319347/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2021,aarpcats,8," Forgive each other.
","An eldergay has fallen on hard times in Sandusky, Ohio. His partner died of AIDS before SSM, and he had no legal rights to the home he had built with him. His partner's death caused him to lose the toney customers at his hair salon. And, as one of the few survivors of the AIDS pandemic, he is alone and lonely in a nursing home. He waits for death with the other elderly outcasts in his town.",/review/rw7319347/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2021,talllguysf,8," Very poignant and important film...
","A very touching film regardless of it's gay theme. That said, it's the gay theme that makes this film truly special.",/review/rw7319347/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2021,matlock-74399,9," Shame this has low exposure because it's fabulous
",Other reviews say it better but I'll say it with less words. Watch this and enjoy! It's a great film with a beautiful story.,/review/rw7319347/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2022,pasaribuharisfadli,7," Hopefully isn't Udo Kier's swan song
","It took 13 years but Todd Stephens finally return as a director with Swan Song. And personally, I think this is his best so far. Mainly because of the always charismatic Udo Kier who was able to defy the sometimes campy yet melancholic Stephens' narrative. While the film is sorely too subdued or moody for its own good, but at least it still has room for some moving and emotional moments.",/review/rw7319347/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2021,carolinephillips-47427,8," Udo Kier's Finest Moment
","Former small town hairstylist, Pat (Kier), has been spending his days in a retirement home recovering from a stroke. When he receives news that his friend and client, Rita (Evans), has passed away and wanted him to do her hair for her funeral, he gathers up enough strength for one last hurrah, meeting all sorts of interesting characters and resolving past drama on the way.",/review/rw7319347/?ref_=tt_urv
15 August 2021,Almost_Soldout,10," Bright blue
","It's very talented slow burn indie movie with its own tone of voice. It's not for everyone, so I do understand some negative review as this movie is special. But I am happy that This masterpiece made me and other viewers to cry and smile, really thankful creators for such touching and truly bright blue movie.",/review/rw7319347/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2021,paulclaassen,5," Not what I expected, but Udo Kier is fantastic!
","My mind unfairly convinced me the film was to be in the vein of 'To Wong Foo' and 'Priscilla Queen of the Desert'. As a result, I was a bit disappointed.",/review/rw7319347/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2021,sevenvienna,10," I cried, I laughed...
",This was a beautiful movie. Loved it! It was a wild ride but I really enjoyed every minute of it. It is obvious that this movie was made with so much love and respect. Udo Kier is magnificent as Pat!,/review/rw7319347/?ref_=tt_urv
3 January 2022,nick94965,10," Outstanding, moving portrait of an outsider
","Beautifully done story about a gay male hairdresser who can no longer lay claim to his one-time title as ""Mr. Pat"", the Liberace of Sandusky, Ohio, played with gusto by the brilliant and shining Udo Kier. Udo practically owns the screen here, showing up in every scene and having the time of his life pulling out no stops to bring to life the very 'colorful' hairdresser Mr. Patrick, who spent 33 years taking care of the first lady of Sandusky (in a cameo by none other than the great Linda Evans).",/review/rw7319347/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2021,jeffsocorso,10," Perfection.
","Kudos and blessings on Todd Stephens and Udo Kier for making an absolutely perfect movie. Acting, writing, casting, cinematography, editing, set design, costumes, soundtrack, music selections (two Shirleys.....Bassey AND Horn) and directing... it's all perfect.",/review/rw7319347/?ref_=tt_urv
5 September 2021,geneticanja,10," What a beautiful little road movie
","I never heard of Pitsenbarger before watching the movie. What a beautiful story of a man contemplating his life while on the road. It is wonderfully slow and very touching. Udo Kier is well casted, his acting is near to perfection. Bitterness, happiness, sadness, they all have their place during the movie. I hope it will get the attention it deserves. What a gem. And the soundtrack! Great song after great song.",/review/rw7319347/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2021,sergexx,10," I cried... the entire movie!
","I didn't know what to expect, but I knew I had to watch this movie at the local SF Landmark Cinema. Being the fourth attendee on a Wednesday night, I basically had the entire theater to myself. Once the movie started, the four of us could not stop laughing, hooting and crying!!!",/review/rw7319347/?ref_=tt_urv

But it makes you wish people were.",/review/rw7319347/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2021,gallmann-38827,8," Very nice
","Very nicely done. I expected it to be about a different topic, but I'm fine with what I watched. For me, the choice of music had a great part why I liked it. It's a quiet movie and I LOVE such if they're done well. Many times when just sad classical music is used, it totally freaks me out and I instantly stop watching and skip the movie. Swan Song didn't make this mistake and so I can honestly recommend this movie. Of course also because the story is quite nice,",/review/rw7319347/?ref_=tt_urv

","I rarely write reviews, but this was such a brilliantly acted and written film, it was beautiful.",/review/rw7319347/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2021,NoBBQforyou,7," Dark, heartbreaking, infuriating
","There is much to recommend this movie: moments of absurd, tender, unexpected humor, the brilliance of Udo Kier, and the concept itself. Otoh, I found myself at times thinking that the director was culturally appropriating the very culture he is a part of. Some tiresome, cringe inducing bits about drag queens and a talk with an old friend on a bench that try way too hard. But those are really minor quibbles. This is a brilliant piece of work.",/review/rw7319347/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2021,ARetroworld,8," Dusted with a touch of Fantasy
","Really enjoyed this movie, and Udo Kier is great fun. Don't pick it apart over a few details - take it as a bit of fantasy, and you're in for a great time. While SWAN SONG is a smaller movie, it reminds me of BIG EDEN in terms of story elements that you just accept and go with. Thank you Todd Stephens - I Love it!",/review/rw7319347/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2021,joanjen-83987,8," simply-a Fine Film
","Count on Magnolia Films to deliver a grown-ups film. And don't nitpick on the very few useless points - let a superb writer and director bring great casting, thereby talented actors deliver a wonderful story!",/review/rw7319347/?ref_=tt_urv
7 September 2021,hollyswitow,10," Snap Snap Bye
","Loved it. The last scene - those shoes - priceless. Udo Kier, such a great character actor, played Pat to perfection. And it was nice to see Linda Evans again even if just for a moment. Very well done.",/review/rw7319347/?ref_=tt_urv
