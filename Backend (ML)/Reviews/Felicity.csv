1 May 2006,ccthemovieman-1,9," Very Intriguing Film With Great Ending
","This is a much better film than I ever thought it would be, and intrigues me every time I watch it. Samuel L. Jackson's role is what mainly inspires me to watch this multiple times. His character is amazing and just leaves me shaking my head.",/review/rw1020092/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2002,bob the moo,," Slow, thoughtful and clever -but the lack of traditional action or thrills may frustrate some
","A massive train crash outside Philadelphia kills 132 passengers and leaves only one survivor.  The survivor, security guard David Dunn walks away completely unhurt from the accident.  Some time later he is contacted by comic book collector Elijah Price who believes that comic books are merely exaggerated versions of truth and that some people are created weak like him while some are created strong in order to protect the weak.  David develops his talents with the support of Price and his son Joseph and, despite his cynicism, starts to try to use his powers to help people on need.",/review/rw1020092/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2012,TheLittleSongbird,9," Shyamalan's second best film
","For me, The Sixth Sense is M Night Shyamalan's best film, but Unbreakable comes very, very close. Maybe it is not a movie for everybody, due to some parts dragging and rambling on just a tad, but it is a thoughtful, moving and compelling film.",/review/rw1020092/?ref_=tt_urv
17 August 2004,bilcal7-1,9," Personal Significance
","It seems this movie has taken a bit of heat, known by many as Shyamalan's ""worst"" film. It is often written off as slow moving, and the twist at the end as unoriginal and boring. I've heard people say the acting and camera work was awkward and stale and that the casting was poor. Ironically enough, as more people begin to dislike this movie, the more I seem to fall in love with it. This film has a lot of personal bearing with me, both as a student of psychology and a lover of movies and just plain art. I feel like I've taken this film under my wing during its times of criticism, and now I'd like to try and show everyone what exactly I love about it so much. ",/review/rw1020092/?ref_=tt_urv
18 July 2004,Videofilm,," Very subtle. Requires multiple sips to get the full measure.
","This movie will be the curious nugget in the collection of Shyamalan films. It is great to see young writing and directing talent that is carving a niche away from the usual fair while running with the big boys and girls. Entering the mainstream was achieved through his kick-off blockbuster, The Sixth Sense. If you are among the small cadre of people who figured out The Sixth Sense's twist before the ending, salute! Unbreakable continues Shyamalan's unorthodox view of things by crafting a more 'mortal' superhero drama. Unlike Peter Parker (Toby Maguire - Spiderman) who completely emerges as Spiderman (web-slinging and building-hopping) within about 30 minutes of the whole movie, David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is discovering his more subtle but extraordinary abilities for the whole movie, with some help from his friends and foes. Being able to stick to and vertically climb a building wall is a fairly noticeable attribute (why it would occur to somebody to try it escapes me) but never being sick in one's life may actually escape one's attention. People develop mindsets that prevent them from recognizing certain things until a suggestion changes that condition. In this movie, being the sole (uninjured) survivor of a train crash is a pretty strong suggestion. From there you watch the revelation unfold. Yes, there is a villain but I won't spoil the movie for those who have not ventured to try it. If you have been avoiding it after poor recommendations from others, forget about The Sixth Sense and give it an undivided attention DVD viewing.",/review/rw1020092/?ref_=tt_urv
24 June 2012,ma-cortes,7," Thrilling and suspenseful film excellently played and compellingly directed by M. Night Shyamalan
","Interesting film and one of the greatest successes of the magnificent filmmaker Night Shyamalan . This intriguing picture with twist ending revolves around a security guard named David Dunn (Bruce Willis) who miraculously survives a catastrophic train crash outside Philadelphia . His marriage to Audrey (Robin Wright) is crumbling , and he's thinking of moving to New York . David learns something extraordinary about himself after a devastating accident . He formerly had a car accident that was a pivotal point in David and Audrey's relationship. He meets a strange man (Samuel L Jackson) with Osteogenesis Imperfecta , a real but rare disease . At the end takes place a confrontation against a violent delinquent , some camera shots show David in a hooded raincoat , which may be to imply that he's some sort of a caped crusader.",/review/rw1020092/?ref_=tt_urv
10 January 2006,edinburghstoryteller,8," Hugely underrated and misunderstood movie
","I love this film. I'm the only person I know who doesn't hate it, but I cannot fathom why it gets such a bad rap from everybody. It seems that Shyamalan's films have this a running theme - with the notable exception of the Sixth Sense, which pretty much everyone seems to get. He makes movies that are very subtle, and which seem to need you to focus on them just right to fully grasp what he was trying to do. I've enjoyed all his movies, but for me the alien part of Signs takes a lot away from what I believe to be the central storyline and as such the whole movie suffers a little. Yet I know other people who think Signs is his best, specifically because of the way the alien plot line accentuates the central one.",/review/rw1020092/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2007,poolandrews,7," ""172,000 comics are sold in the US everyday."" I liked it.
","Unbreakable starts as the Eastrail Train #177 from New York to Philadelphia derails with the loss of 131 lives, the only survivor is security guard David Dunn (Bruce Willis) who has walked away from the crash without a single scratch on him. Shortly after the crash he receives a letter from Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) the owner of an an art gallery specialising in comic books & related artwork, Elijah suffers from a rare disease called Osteogenesis Imperfecta which means he has very brittle bones which are easily broken. Elijah tells David that he feels there are people on the opposite side of the scale to him, people with very strong bones & great strength & him walking away from that train crash is proof that he is one of them. Elijah tries to convince David that he is a real life comic book superhero & that his unique powers should be used for good...",/review/rw1020092/?ref_=tt_urv

16 July 2001,mikecalla,9," a consummate clinic in directing,etc.
","M. Night Shyamalan seems to be proving himself quite the auteur. Unbreakable was the cinematic experience I had hoped it would be, especially after The Sixth Sense.  A quiet sense of wonder permeated each and every scene, accomplished with some of the finest cinematography I've seen in the last couple of years.

27 February 2018,Woodyanders,9," A different kind of super hero film

13 March 2006,lee_eisenberg,7," M. Night Shyamalan's last really interesting movie so far.
","M. Night Shyamalan followed up ""The Sixth Sense"" with the not-quite-as-great, but no less fascinating, ""Unbreakable"". Bruce Willis plays Philadelphia security guard David Dunn, who survives a train wreck that kills everyone else. After this, he meets Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), who suffers from Osteogenesis Imperfecta, which causes his bones to break very easily. Elijah is convinced that David is as strong as the superheros in comic books. But what is there about either of these men that remains to be discovered? As in his previous movie, Shyamalan creates a bleak setting that may be about to undergo a mind-shattering change. This one isn't as good as ""The Sixth Sense"", but you will be shocked at the end just the same. Watch for Shyamalan as the man whom David investigates at the stadium.",/review/rw1020092/?ref_=tt_urv

13 January 2001,dgeerts,9," Moving - in its most original sense
","The final plot twist  in ""The Sixth Sense"" made me wonder whether its director could repeat such a stunt, in ""Unbreakable"". Force us to follow the path he wants us to take, by telling his story, slowly, subtly leading us. Make us start to believe we know what will happen next, make us love the characters, then make us *want* things to happen next. Yes, tonight when seeing ""Unbreakable"", all that happens, again. And then, exactly like in ""The Sixth Sense"", he pulls the carpet right from under us, in the final seconds of the movie takes away everything, every expectation, he first gave us. Many people will be so disappointed by this that they will end up hating the movie. So did I, for about five minutes. Now I know the movie will make me think, literally move my thoughts, for a long time after tonight. I want to see it again, right now. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. Hollywood has a new master storyteller. His name is Manoj Night Shyamalan.",/review/rw1020092/?ref_=tt_urv
23 September 2001,neovsmatrix,10," Unbreakable is one of the finest movies in years.
","I guess I can't be too surprised with all the negative responses that Unbreakable is getting.  These days, the masses don't appreciate a buildup of atmosphere, strong character interaction, and stories heavily centered on characters and their psychology.  Unbreakable has all of these traits, and proves to be a superior movie to the Sixth Sense in my opinion.  Too bad it's so underrated.",/review/rw1020092/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2008,moonspinner55,8," Masterful filmmaking
","A perversely enjoyable unease permeates this psychological thriller from writer-director M. Night Shyamalan, here following his commercial success with ""The Sixth Sense"" in top form. A comic book connoisseur with an alarming, lifelong bone density deficiency befriends a security guard who was recently the only survivor of a massive train derailment; convincing the survivor he may in fact be unbreakable proves to be quite tough...however, even super-heroes have a weakness. Meticulously mounted film features one of Bruce Willis' best performances; he is altogether convincing, vulnerable, touching, and sympathetic as a modern-day man afraid of what powers he may possess. The film does err on occasion (a sequence in a comic book shop at night is confusing, and the picture's main color scheme--steely blues and grays--becomes visually monotonous), however the wonderful script and performances take the movie to a higher realm for this genre. There is a great deal of art in Shyamalan's presentation (including a gorgeous shot of Robin Wright Penn being carried up the stairs), and he works wonders with the supporting cast--even the two-line players are perfection. ***1/2 from ****",/review/rw1020092/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2000,tedg,," Night Time
","Why was this made? To establish a new genre, following on the heels of `The Sixth Sense.' Playing it safe, we have Willis again as confused in the face of the supernatural, a knowing boy, a background wife. Right, and a plot twist at the end. Fund it well enough to ensure a high level of craft and produce not just good box office, but also a new Hollywood trend to ride.",/review/rw1020092/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's really frustrating to find a movie that comes so close to being great and only a few minor faults are holding it back. Luckily, it's not so frustrating that it ruins the experience. Unbreakable is still an intense and emotional movie and I wish M. Night Shyamalan was still making movies like this.",/review/rw1020092/?ref_=tt_urv
24 November 2016,Leofwine_draca,9," Shyamalan's second masterpiece - and his last good film
","M. Night Shyamalan's follow-up to THE SIXTH SENSE is a remarkable one; remarkable in the sense that it's very nearly as good as the film that made Shyamalan's name famous, and that it proves that he wasn't just a one-hit wonder. UNBREAKABLE offers up the same kind of intense spooky atmosphere as his first film, and yet isn't a horror movie at all. Instead, it's a gripping thriller that draws you into the lives of a diverse bunch of characters and doesn't let you go until the very end.",/review/rw1020092/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2005,ryan_kuhn,8," ""Do you remember me ever being sick?""
","I was never a big fan of comic books, but I do appreciate the style and storytelling that goes into them. My favorite show growing up was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, based on a comic book, in which each episode our heroes face their enemies, but nothing is ever decided. Comic books are about episodes of action where nothing is ever ultimately decided. The 2000 movie by M. Night Shyamalan, his first movie after his surprise smash The Sixth Sense, plays as the first edition of a comic book, where the hero is immune to all ailments and broken bones and a lurking villain who is his opposite. The movie is all about discovery, as Bruce Willis plays David Dunn, the lone survivor of a railway accident. Soon after, Dunn is invited to see a comic book collector, Elijah Price, played by Samuel L. Jackson, who is brittle and always sick. Jackson figures if there is one man as weak as he, there has to be a strong man who is unbreakable, and he thinks it is Dunn. The meat of the movie deals with Dunn trying to come to grips with the prospect of near-invincibility and ability to ""see"" evil before it happens. The end of the movie is Dunn seeing for himself if he has the power, we learn his weakness, then we find out what the entire movie was about. My only complaint to the end of the movie, I really liked the final relationship between Price and Dunn, is how Shyamalan finished the movie. For those who have seen the movie know what I'm talking about, the final shot is of words super-imposed on the screen telling the audience what happened after the film ends. I did not want that. I loved how the movie served as a first edition of a series, but the words on the screen make it a one-episode series. Nothing in comic books is supposed to be resolved as quickly as it is in Unbreakable. That annoyed me, almost as much as the son of David Dunn, played by Spencer Treat Clark, who was annoying in Gladiator as well. For the most part, Unbreakable is a great movie, and is a great movie if you hit the ""Stop"" button on your DVD player just as Bruce Willis walks off the screen in the final scene.",/review/rw1020092/?ref_=tt_urv
