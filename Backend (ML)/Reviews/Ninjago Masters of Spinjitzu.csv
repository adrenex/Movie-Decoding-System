1 June 2004,SonicStuart,," Great Show!
","Nash Bridges was cool mystery show! Nash Bridges (Don Johnson) is a detective fights crime on the streets of San Francisco while driving around in his yellow 70ish Plymouth Hemi Barracuda. He's the typical super-cop on the beat, who always wins in the end. Unfortunately, his personal relationships leave much to be desired. He has two ex-wives, a 16-year-old daughter needing a lot of supervision, and a father with Alzheimer's disease who keeps getting kicked out of retirement homes and dropping by to visit. My mom and my mom's boyfriend introduced me to this show and I thought it was neat. I remember when I first watched this show on USA Network which the network where the repeats were shown while the new episodes were on CBS. They should release the complete series of this show out on to DVD. Before Don Johnson did this show he did the famous TV-show Miami Vice! You might like this show if you like CSI: Miami, Dark Angel or 90210.",/review/rw4359957/?ref_=tt_urv

","Whoever did the casting, pairing of these two leads, is a f..kin' genius. Happening to catch this show, one arvo at my Dad's, this is one cop show, which grew on me. Though it really isn't anything earth shattering, lacking in a kind of slight blandness, you like the show for the characters, mostly Cheech Marin, who's quit his comic days for seriously good acting. It's surprising how good he is he in this, as he will surprise you a bit. Don Johnson, plays a more reckless cop than his Miami Vice days, which he played a much more controlled character. Johnson, an underrated actor (Django Unchained, Machete are any indication) is very good here, and steers the show well, where you some other likable supports. In one episode, he actually had his MV co star in it. Nash is a SF cop (although you don't fee like your in Francisco most of the time) who does his things his way (sound familiar) to get better and more quicker results, and he likes it too. Cheech does still provide some comic relief, and a couple of his own devised lines. He's an asset to the show, it'd only be, half a show without him. Although the show, does have stereotypical traits and some ordinaryness (my word) to it, what you get is quite a good sufficient hour of cop drama, with some action, although it's a long way from the loud, cool glitzy style of Miami, but this one kind of retains a style of it of it's own.",/review/rw4359957/?ref_=tt_urv

","NASH BRIDGES has occupied my Friday nights since the second season, when I started watching. Every Friday, it felt like I was sitting down with a group of friends with it's great combination of the right actors in the right roles. The supporting characters were just as interesting as the main characters, with each having their own background developed over the years. The best episodes were clearly in the early years, and while the show seemed to be losing some steam in the final season, it never lost it's entertainment value, even with the weak moments it had. Yasmine Bleeth was, thankfully, not there that long. She was a really bad character and proved she didn't have much talent. The final season introduced us to Cress Williams and the beautiful Wendy Moniz, who were both welcomes addition, but unfortunately, the show was cancelled, and we never got to learn a lot about either character. The show sometimes did get a little too talky, and the show did hurt itself by making Jodi Lyn-O'Keefe become a cop in the final season, a decision that was really bad and made her character become hated by many fans of the show. Cassidy worked best as Nash's daughter, but she was just never believable as a tough cop. But the five seasons before it out-weigh the lackluster sixth season, with plenty of episodes providing a well-balanced mixture of humor, action, and character. The moments between Nash and his father were always touching, making for some pleasant father/son moments that are hardly ever seen on television these days. Cheech Marin was always a riot with his get-rich-quick schemes and general bad luck, and Jeff Perry's Harvey Leek should go down as one of the best supporting characters on television. I just wish they had never killed off Kelly Hu's character. She was really good, and we instead got Bleeth as an extremely poor substitute. But the good times live on in reruns on USA, giving me plenty of nights to catch up with the humor, action, and characters (and of course, the car) that made NASH BRIDGES such a fun show.",/review/rw4359957/?ref_=tt_urv
6 March 2004,leelulori,," The first 5 seasons were great with great cast members.
","When Season 6 introduced Inspectors Antwon Babcock(Cress Williams) and Rachel McCabe(Wendy Moniz), the show tanked. There was no chemistry between Antwon & Harvey and Rachel didn't even belong in the series. There was a real friendship between Harvey & Evan; which, when lost caused the show to lose an exceptional link to viewers. Nash & Joe have the same chemistry that Harvey & Evan had. No one would even think of killing off Joe. Cassity becoming a member of the SFPD was the beginning of the end. Rachel's addition sealed it. I loved the show and certainly San Francisco was shown to the be beautiful city that it is. Nash's ability to solve crimes & know everything instantly was a little over the top, but the show could have remained one of the great ones had the supporting cast been allowed to shine. What made it great in the beginning was slowly killed off.",/review/rw4359957/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2004,PaulietheParrot,," What else can I say, THE BEST SHOW THAT THERE EVER WAS!
","What else can it be. Don Johnson/Cheech Marin had what is by far the best chemistry on the show that makes it so watchable. One other note that I would like to say is that since I used to live in the Bay area during the duration of the series, I always wanted to be an extra on the series. I tried but never really made it through. The only thing that I would say is that since SF was a great place wher Nash and his Sexy '70-'71 Plymouth Baracuda (my favorite classic car!) made it's way onto TV I would really like to see this show go into DVD one of these days since this is by far one of the best crime dramas in history in simialar to The Price is Right of Cop Shows! The only thing I have to say is that since the show got canned back in May '01 I really wanted to see the ending in it's right of way but since the show was getting too expensive I thought six seasons is one hell of a run to begin with! Also the locations during the shows 6 seasons with the Routunda, (season 1 and some of season 2) the Hyde St. Pier (seasons 2-4) and the Embarcadero shelter (seasons 4-6) I would have to pick the Hyde St. Pier as the favorite SIU offices!

22 July 2003,MichaelJohnMartin,10," Brilliant.
","One of my favourite shows on television,I enjoy it immensely. Don Johnson is at his best,and in his element,in this type of show.His back up in the series,Harvey,Evan and Joe are very likeable as well.And the little side stories with Joe usually getting himself into all manner of situations provide some welcome light relief to the episodes.A shame really that here(in the UK)the channels do not deem it worthy of an earlier time slot,the episode I just watched started at 12.35am,a little late perhaps for a work night,but all in all,an excellent show.",/review/rw4359957/?ref_=tt_urv

","Nash Bridges is a great show, it's about a special investigation unit, Nash Bridges has great action, comedy, and drama. it's great watching Don Johnson as Nash and Cheech Marin as Joe, Joe always gets himself into funny things, it's also fun watching Joe and Nick (James Gammon) come with crazy ideas to strike it rich, Nick plays Nash Bridges Dad, Christian Meoli who plays Boz Bishop is very funny but he only does maybe 6 shows a season, the best ones on the show are Jeff Perry who plays Harvey leek and his partner Jaime p. Gomez who played Evan Cortez but he was killed off at the end of season 5, but he lives on in repeats on Usa network, now in season 6 there are two new people cress Williams who plays Antwon Babcock, he is Harvey's new partner and also new Wendy Moniz who plays Rachel both of the new characters are great, i thought the show might not be as good without Evan (Jaime p. Gomez) but it's still good but not the same, the whole cast is great but Jeff Perry stands out Harvey is the best one on the show, and everynow and then Stone Cold Steve Austin is on the show playing Jake Cage, and just like the way he is great in the wwf he is great on Nash Bridges, so as Nash would say Bubba watch this show it's really good",/review/rw4359957/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2003,ajwebb,," Worth Watching
","Nash Bridges is, in many ways, like Miami Vice. Nash Bridges is somewhat like a new Miami Vice, with new suits, a cell phone and more technology. It is a great series, although sometimes has boring episodes. I tape it every time it comes on, and I do recommend it to anyone who wants a good action/somewhat drama series. I give it a 9.5/10 star rating.",/review/rw4359957/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2001,Brian-272,," Not the best of Don Johnson but far from the worst.
","""Nash Bridges"" has been for the last several years one of your better action series on TV. Don Johnson was at his best and most popular during his ""Miami Vice"" days but he has scored several points with ""Nash Bridges"" Johnson is detective Nash Bridges who fights crime throughout the city of San Francisco in the process his job is helped along just fine by his partner played by the funny and likeable Cheech Marin. Another bright reason that I watched ""Nash Bridges"" over the years was due to Jodi Lyn O' Keefe who was a delight as the beautiful daughter of Nash. Jodi is one sexy thing! she sure has a bright future ahead. Plus for two seasons the famous and beautiful Yasmine Bleeth sparkled this series up as the love interest of Nash. Many episodes featured guest appearances from beautiful women I remember watching one episode recently with Shannon Tweed. Mainly this series was great due to Don Johnson once again in a role which had him defeating crime always filled with the action and drama to keep a viewer interested. Sadly CBS has canceled the new episodes but you can view the rerun episodes on the USA Network.",/review/rw4359957/?ref_=tt_urv
30 August 2014,manitobaman81,7," Good
","I love watching Don Johnson in all the shows he has done. Johnson carries this series and saves it from being a disaster. From an artistic standpoint, it holds its own. I already miss Johnson but I enjoy the others in the cast as well. Johnson and Marin make a solid, if not stilly, team. This was back when television was television, you know what I'm saying? This kind of character piece needs a tight focus so all of the nuances of the characters shine through. With this culture of ignorance in the Information Age persisting, fed by the corporate media, Johnson has appeared in one of his best series yet. It gets 7/10.",/review/rw4359957/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2008,qormi,1," Burn This Bridge
","This is beyond a doubt the worst detective show to appear on television. Don Johnson must have had an ironclad no - cancellation clause in his contract because the show was mired in the bottom of the Nielsens. The show was muddled, to say the least. The sets were confusing. Cool-guy Don naturally lived in a penthouse/loft hybrid of a place with bricks appearing here and there in the decor. His ex-wife and daughters kept cropping up to add deadweight to a dead show. By the way, did you know that Don was shagging the 17-year old girl who played his daughter (Jody O'Keefe)? I read it in the Enquirer, and most of that stuff, believe it or not, is true. The supporting cast was composed of boring character actors, not the least being Cheech Marin. The balding, pudgy actor was a mere shadow of the funnyman of the 70's and 80's. He was a humorless, bland, chubby, depressed-looking guy. So when this 5'1"" dynamo married a sexy Swedish bombshell on the show, credibility took another hit. And what about the police station or city hall or whatever it was? It was always under construction, it seemed. Another annoying detail. Don Johnson was cool in Miami Vice. Here, he just wore a sweater-vest and sportcoat and acted bored. That 1971 Challenger he rode around in was yellow with a white interior(yuck!). It, too, seemed bored.",/review/rw4359957/?ref_=tt_urv

","I really enjoy watching Don Johnson in all the shows he's done. I've been recording them for years. I watched most of the shows several times over and never get tired of seeing that man in action or his smile. Please keep airing the series. I already miss him. I also enjoy the others in the cast. I love that Cuda and the way he drives it. Are you going to bring the show back? I think you should and I hope you will. Don Johnson and Cheech Martin (Joe) make a great team. Nash's dad is sweet. And I just love Pepe. Harvey is great and a super addition to the SUI. I love that he's a deadhead and the way he dresses. Nash is the best and knows what he's doing. Bring him back, please.",/review/rw4359957/?ref_=tt_urv

","Having grown up with Starsky and Hutch, I enjoyed Nash a lot. A fun buddy series, with good chemistry between Johnson and Marin (who actually steals a lot of their scenes together). I can't understand why so many people compare it to Miami Vice, which was posing and pretentious, while this show has its tongue firmly planted in its cheek.",/review/rw4359957/?ref_=tt_urv
15 September 2000,eibon09,," Jodi Lyn O'Keefe is One of the Main Reasons to Watch the Show
","Nash Bridges(1996) is an average but entertaining show that has its share of action, comedy, and drama.  Don Johnson does a good job as the lead star while Cheech Marin is funny as Nash's partner.  My favorite episodes involved the ones that focused on police procedures and mystery.  Jodi Lyn O'Keefe is beautiful as well as wonderful as Nash's daughter, Cassidy.  The best episode was the one where Cassady gets into a car accident and almost dies because Nasn Bridges is shown in a more complex and three demensional light.  One of my favorite characters was Michelle Chan Played by Martial Law's Kelly Hu(Its too bad that she wasn't on the show long enough).  Two of the five season finalle have ended with an important character killed off...I.E, Michelle Chan(Kelly Hu), and Evan Cortez(Jaime Gomez).",/review/rw4359957/?ref_=tt_urv

","You can understand why cop shows are on the wane on network television these days.You can have a show like Law And Order and then you can have Nash Bridges,a comic book like drama with Don Johnson.Johnson was a hero and icon on Miami Vice a decade before the show is so lousy and boring.Miami Vice was chic and trendsetting where as Nash Bridges is routine and uninteresting.That can't be lost on the viewer at home.Nor could the fact that two other retreads are with Johnson as his sidekicks in this mess,Cheech Martin,who has seen better days with a better partner,his old friend Tommy Chong.Then there is Yasmine Bleeth who was great on Ryan's Hope back in the early 80's when she was younger but looks lost and old on this show.The crime drama ,the cop show,is slowly fading in popularity with TV viewers these days.After watching a couple of epidsodes of Nash Bridges it is not hard to see why this is true.",/review/rw4359957/?ref_=tt_urv

","The pilot for this series was quite impressive but unfortunately the series itself swiftly decided into a routine cop show with no sense of identity.Watching an episode of Nash Bridges is like watching any of a number of similar American series.One of the main problems is the title character who is simply too much in control of every situation.He's always right, everyone likes him and anyone he doesn't immediately warm to turns out to be a baddie.With those infallible instincts and his network of social contacts one can only wonder why San Francisco needs any other cops.",/review/rw4359957/?ref_=tt_urv
