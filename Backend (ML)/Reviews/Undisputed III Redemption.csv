18 February 2018,ivo-cobra8,10," The best teenage horror slasher film in the 90's my all time personal favorite in the horror genre
","Scream is the best teenage horror slasher film in the 90's and it is my all time personal favorite film in the horror genre. I love this film I always did and I love to death! It was really the first movie that introduced me in to ""horror"" genre slasher films. It was directed from my favorite horror master Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson. It is a horror mystery like was Friday the 13th and April Fool's Day. Scream deserve legendary status. The movie spawned three sequels and the TV series that I did like. Neve Campbell, David Arquette and Courteney Cox and Rose McGowan work for me. It is about a high school teenage student in the fictional town of Woodsboro, California, who becomes the target of a mysterious killer known as Ghostface who kills teens and who uses his obsession with scary movies. The first one is the best in the series and it is still one of the best horror films of all time. ",/review/rw6813794/?ref_=tt_urv
1 April 2002,bob the moo,," Scary, funny and clever  the best Scream movie by miles
","Almost a year after someone raped and killed Sidney Prescott's mother in the small town of Woodsboro, someone is killing teenagers.  When Sidney herself becomes a target, the link is apparent and her missing father is a suspect. However, as with all good scary movies, everyone is a suspect.",/review/rw6813794/?ref_=tt_urv
13 April 2007,MaxBorg89,8," Clever, scary and funny - a must-see for horror fans
","Making a brilliant, original horror film is pretty hard these days, since practically everything has already been told, and more than once. Using that premise, director Wes Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson came up with Scream, whose cleverness derives from the fact that it knows every single stereotype of the genre and satirizes them.",/review/rw6813794/?ref_=tt_urv
13 August 2002,Smells_Like_Cheese,10," It's a scream that they made something this original!
","In 1996, when I saw this in the theater, I was expecting to see a predictable movie. That we would just get bored with. But I was wrong. This has to be one of the most clever movies of the 90's. Believe me, this was an awesome thriller. Wes Craven should stick to movies like this,",/review/rw6813794/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2006,Mr_PCM,8," Iconic, unique, fresh, a definitive new horror
","Scream With the countless number of teen slasher movies doing the rounds, it is too easy to watch scream and see simply another school serial killer movie that has just rolled off the factory production line. However, it was Wes Craven's 'Scream' that started the whole revival of the horror genre and re-invented the teen horror. Through no fault of its own, but rather a succession of bland rip-offs, not to mention a very successful spoof (Scary Movie), Scream's original impact has been severely dulled. Were Scream released today it would no doubt be moderately successful but would be instantly forgettable. But back in 1996 the teen horror market was wide open. The teenagers of the 90s were bored of traditional horror movies featuring haunted houses, vampires or deformed monsters. They had seen them all. So Wes Craven, having reinvigorated the horror genre once before with 'Nightmare on Elm Street', set out to do it again. This time, along with Kevin Williamson, who would go on to be creator of Dawson's Creek, created a new kind of horror  one that you could laugh at as well as scream at.",/review/rw6813794/?ref_=tt_urv
15 July 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10," A true scream of a horror classic
","What can I say? Scream is a wonderful film, a classic of its genre and a real scream from start to finish. The production values are excellent with atmospheric photography and settings, Wes Craven's direction is to date one of his best directing jobs, the music is haunting and the sound effects unsettling. The acting from Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox and David Arquette is top notch, and GhostFace as a character is iconic. What struck me as truly impressive about Scream was its originality, the story is fresh and while there are some funny lines, there are some genuinely scary, jump-out-of-your-seat moments too. Overall, brilliant. 10/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw6813794/?ref_=tt_urv
9 May 2001,MadReviewer,8," Hate To Admit It, But It's Great
","There's more than a few reasons to hate `Scream'; the main reason would be that the film single-handedly resurrected the teen-slasher genre, a movie category that had long been beaten to death.  Because of the success of `Scream', witless horror crap like `I Know What You Did Last Summer' and `Urban Legend' got greenlighted, half the teenage casts of various WB television shows got summer acting jobs, and some awful scripts that should've been left dead and buried `Teaching Mrs. Tingle' got to see the light of day.  `Scream' is responsible for a lot of garbage.  But the truth of the matter is, `Scream' is also a phenomenal movie.",/review/rw6813794/?ref_=tt_urv
11 December 2016,Leofwine_draca,9," The undisputed king of the '90s slasher
","Single-handedly breathing life into the dead teen genre (read that as you will), SCREAM was a box office hit to be reckoned with. Rave reviews at the time meant that it was the 1990s' most popular horror film, but it's easy to get caught up in the hype of something. On my first viewing I agreed that it was an excellent film. Now, a few years later when we're all a little older and a little wiser, it's time for a second look. Especially after the glut of teen slashers following in SCREAM's wake diluted the originality and freshness of it.",/review/rw6813794/?ref_=tt_urv
6 February 2000,Xophianic,9," One of the coolest and more original horror movies I've ever seen
","I thoroughly enjoyed SCREAM. I haven't seen too many horror movies that struck me as great, especially since most of them are the same. I like THE SIXTH SENSE, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and SCREAM for the same reason, they are more original than the default horror flick.",/review/rw6813794/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2011,freemantle_uk,8," What is your favourite scary movie?
","By the 1990s the Slasher genre was becoming stale, filled with clichés, countless sequels and very predictable and uninventive. Likely two men was able to play on this, Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven was able to play on this and made a really excellent take on Slashers.",/review/rw6813794/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2019,DylanCanonge,10," A classic
","With Scream (1996), Wes Craven re-invented & revitalised the slasher genre with this modern horror classic, Scream is funny, clever & scary, as a fright-masked knife maniac stalks high-school students. A beautiful love letter to horror movies that came before it. A truly classic horror film. What a genius Wes Craven was. Brilliant film making. Defines 90s horror.",/review/rw6813794/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2011,ajs-10,8," Enjoyed it a lot more than expected...
","I have been recently reading a lot of reviews of the latest film in this series, Scream 4. Now, for one reason or another I have never seen any of the 'Scream' films before well not all the way through anyway. Time to change that I thought and so here we are with the first one, Scream. I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would, it doesn't take itself all that seriously and there's an awful lot more humour than I expected.",/review/rw6813794/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2011,asda-man,10," Send yourself a copy
","I'm a sucker for a slasher. I even like the bad ones like ""Halloween: Resurrection"" and ""Urban Legends: Final Cut"" but to me they're really fun and often have a really cool twist ending. So when an actual good slasher comes along, I'm all over it. As soon as ""Scream"" starts with its tremendous opening, you know you're in for a really fun and interesting film with originality. ""Scream"" ticks all the boxes and is probably the best slasher film ever! ",/review/rw6813794/?ref_=tt_urv

17 December 2006,the_moody_youngest,10," Leave it to Wes to create a good scare...
","This film would have to be the scariest movie I have ever seen. Great acting, highly original plot, and interesting characters. This film also had a great script. Not that lame, typical horror film. This film was unpredictably scary. My friends were covering their eyes, but I wasn't, even though this movie scared the crap out of me! Neve Cambell was surprisingly impressive and I loved her character, Sydney, so strong willed.",/review/rw6813794/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2022,reeceicy,10," Single-Handedly Revived the Slasher Genre
","Scream single-handedly revitalized the slasher genre, which was beyond dead as of 1996, and inspired countless spin-offs and attempted remakes in its wake. Wes Craven creates yet another horror masterpiece, and does so in an original and unique way. Add in the witty, self aware, reference-filled script by Kevin Williamson, which was rumored to have taken influence from Friday the 13th Pt 6, and you have one of the most iconic slashers ever made. Arguably the greatest opening scene to a horror movie ever, along with so many more iconic lines and scenes (Randy watching Halloween on the couch). The acting is next level by horror/slasher standards and has a very likable cast. Skeet Ulrich giving his best performance of his career, Matthew Lillard, Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, Drew Barrymore ... do i need to go on? The influence and impact Scream had on the late 90's is undeniable, simply one of the best scary movies of all time.",/review/rw6813794/?ref_=tt_urv
21 October 2011,dee.reid,10," ""Scream"" - 15 years later, it's still the mother of all modern-day, MTV-generation slasher movies!
","OK, here it is, finally, the mother of all modern-day, MTV-generation slashers: ""Scream"" is the popular 1996 slasher epic that single-handedly signaled the return of the slasher movie, and also single-handedly revitalized the sagging horror genre. But there was a twist: a large part of ""Scream's"" massive success had to deal with its open acknowledgment of its source material, lending the movie a level of self-awareness that had never been done before in horror (or at the very least, done very successfully).",/review/rw6813794/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Scream"" does not seem like the kind of movie that could make you appreciate American cinema. If you haven't seen it, then you're probably viewing it as just another silly slasher flick that creates more laughs than scares. On the contrary. This movie IS filled with plenty of scares and satirizes the horror genre in a way that literally has turned this film into a masterpiece. I guarantee you that while you may not love it (it nearly was rated NC-17 for its intense violence), you'll be highly amused by this one. A-",/review/rw6813794/?ref_=tt_urv

","Watching this film for the first time in the basement of a four story house, with no-one else in was the perfect setting for this film. From the very first scene I was gripped and I could not wait for the climax to discover the murderer and his motives. The script was extremely original, as they had purposely set out to parodie the typical slasher style movie.",/review/rw6813794/?ref_=tt_urv

","Wes Craven proves he's a master of horror and innovation with Scream, over 10 years since his last smash A Nightmare on Elm Street. Craven had been a legend for 3 decades, but with this he made possibly his best known film, reinventing a dead genre for better and worse, making horror films profitable again.
