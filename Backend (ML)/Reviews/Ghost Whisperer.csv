4 November 2019,Faristuta,10," Hilarious for the right audience
","Is this movie silly? Yes. Is it packed with toilet humor? Yes. Do you see the erect (and later, flaccid) penis of a monster? Yes. Is there an important take-home message you get from watching it? Absolutely not.
So why am I giving it 10 stars? Because it made me laugh uncontrollably.
Maybe I'm different but even cheap laughs are good laughs.",/review/rw5680369/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2013,napierslogs,8," How to make a stoner comedy with a bunch of friends and turn it into a smart, shrewd and hilarious statement on humanity
","A vanity project for a bunch of Hollywood's highest paid comedic actors, playing themselves in a ""stoner comedy"". So how do you make that good? By making it an hilarious, smart, insightful, satirical and scathing commentary on religion, celebrity and Los Angeles. And how do you make that successful? By making it a stoner comedy about a hapless group of actors saying and doing the stupidest things.",/review/rw5680369/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2013,Ric-7,9," A devil put aside for me
","I thoroughly enjoyed the film, though in retrospect, I am not sure if it is really a great film--there's not much to compare it to. One thing's for certain: this film is not ""just like"" any other film you could name. It is one of the funniest films I have seen in quite a while. And I am probably going to miss the Rapture as a result of my enjoyment.",/review/rw5680369/?ref_=tt_urv

","Why isn't Jay Baruchel in more things?! Well, more relevant things. I mean ""Goon"" was a really good movie, but how many people saw that? The writing team that brought you ""Superbad"", Seth Rogen and the very hit and miss Evan Goldberg, come together once again to write and direct this film. Adapted from a 2007 short by Goldberg, Rogen and Baruchel entitled Jay and Seth Versus the Apocalypse, ""This Is the End"" has one of the most simplistically brilliant plot lines in film history. Basically, Rogen, Baruchel and every other comedic actor you can think of (all playing themselves) attend a party at James Franco's houseÂ…and then the world ends. This plays out like an elongated Funny or Die skit. The only difference being that ""This Is the End"" is consistently funny.",/review/rw5680369/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2013,jordan2240,1," This is the End of me ever attending a Seth Rogen creation
","This was perhaps THE worst movie I've ever seen. Perhaps my wife and I are simply too old for the subject matter (50s), but sex-oriented jokes, drug use, and constant use of the f-word do not a humorous movie make - and we are not prudish people, particularly my wife. I think I smiled once, and I heard my wife giggle once, but I was as close to walking out of a movie as I've ever come. I doubt there was much of a script involved, and my guess is that all of the actors were told to ad-lib the nastiest sex joke that could get an 'R' rating they could think of. I mean a five minute scene about ejaculating all over someone's house...??? Hardy-har-har. I now hate Danny McBride even more than I did before this garbage, and what the hell was Emma Watson thinking.",/review/rw5680369/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2013,drqshadow-reviews,8," Good For a Few Huge Laughs, It's Not as Consistent as You May Have Heard
","Seth Rogen and his usual entourage of stoner near-celebrities return to the screen, this time propped against the backdrop of a biblical end-of-world scenario. There's a certain taste of playful irony in the fact that so many of these actors, Rogen, Jonah Hill and Danny McBride especially, who share the common criticism of merely playing themselves throughout their careers, are doing so literally this time around. They're able to play that up to ridiculous extremes and big laughs in the long-form party scene that eats up most of the first act, riffing and rolling with the punches in their never-ending quest to make the cast and crew smile. Predictably, that's the film's sweet spot - a blank slate for ad-lib spoils - and when it's finally cast aside to make way for a more coherent narrative (admittedly, a very loose one) their ship springs a big leak. Where a more thoroughly-incubated concept like Shaun of the Dead is able to easily blend quick, witty banter with big set pieces and wild, frenzied action, This is the End struggles to unify an equally diverse toolbox. I can get the fish-out-of-water aspect that was being fronted here, of a catered group of celebrities who were lost when their smartphones dropped off the grid, but that runs out of gas near the three-quarter mark and when the big special effects swing and miss, there's nothing left to carry us the rest of the way. Really uproariously funny at a few points, but pointlessly thin and overblown at others.",/review/rw5680369/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2013,Pumpkin_Man,10," A Unique & Hilarious Film!!!
","This movie was exactly what I expected and more. Filling it with dirty jokes, weed, cameos, the apocalypse, religion, demonic possession, and much more. The idea and plot of actors playing themselves is unique and fresh. During a party at James Franco's house, the world begins to crumble. Seth Rogen, Craig Robinson, Danny McBride, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, and James Franco all try to survive the apocalypse, and most importantly, try to survive from each other. From making a home-made sequel to 'The Pineapple Express' to getting high and listening to that ridiculous Gangnam Style song, this movie has a little bit of everything. I highly recommend THIS IS THE END!!!",/review/rw5680369/?ref_=tt_urv

24 June 2013,Rage-Kage,8," best comedy of the year so far
",I saw this movie opening weekend but did not review it right away because I was not sure of what I thought of it. It was not really what I was expecting. I was expecting a raunchy but light hearted comedy that took light of a bad situation but instead the apocalypse in this movie is taken very seriously. I was not so sure I liked that. But I've had over a week to think on it and I have decided that Overall I really enjoyed watching This is the End.,/review/rw5680369/?ref_=tt_urv
29 April 2014,freemantle_uk,8," The fun of the rapture
","Many of Hollywood's biggest comedy stars united for This is the End for one of two comedies about the end of the week. Whilst Edgar Wright's The World's End is the superior film that is consistently funny and action packed flick, This is the End does offer many laugh out loud moments, using more crass and crude humour, having jokes ranging from masturbation, stoner jokes and violent slapstick. Some of the best moments include a trailer for 'Pineapple Express 2', Emma Watson's cameo and discussion between James Franco and Danny McBride over a porn mag. Other jokes are more miss or crude for the such as the demon's man parts. The main stars have excellent chemistry together and had a strong dramatic with Seth Rogan balancing his old friendship with Jay Baruchel who hates LA and his newer friends in the city.",/review/rw5680369/?ref_=tt_urv

20 December 2013,SmileysWorld,1," A good idea gone to waste.
","The idea seemed like a good one.A group of current Hollywood A listers playing fictionalized versions of themselves in a fictionalized idea of how the world will end.The basic idea is funny.What is presented to us on film is not.What we have here is a vile,tasteless,vulgar,sacrilegious piece of garbage of a movie.The language in this atrocity alone made me sick to my stomach.That seldom happens to me.You blew it,guys.You took what was a hysterical idea that could have potentially been labeled a classic sometime in the future,and turned into something I wouldn't contaminate my garbage with.I went in wanting to like it,and came out wishing I hadn't wasted the rental.",/review/rw5680369/?ref_=tt_urv

4 February 2015,jan_kalina,10," ""I don't wanna die at James Franco's house.""
","Some comedy premises seem to go over people's heads. Which the case with This Is The End. The film is based on an idea that the actors play exaggerated versions of themselves, based on the characters they play in their films, which seem to be the same character over and over again. Or they play completely against type - Michael Cera's case.",/review/rw5680369/?ref_=tt_urv

2 November 2013,ramtinsirous,10," One of the best comedies I've ever seen!!!
","Okay, we all have seen a lot of comedy movies but they were not good as we expected. Or we always had to wait for a scene to laugh and t only made us to smile a little bit! This is the End is a great movie! Surprisingly good. They are a lot of scenes that you get surprised and that makes you laugh hard. The plot of the story is based on true character names and that makes you wonder are they really the same person in the real life? It was confusing because some part of the movie was exactly about the real characteristics of the actors and that's what I like about the movie! I think this comedy is far one of the best comedies I've ever seen. Highly RECOMMENDED!!! 10/10",/review/rw5680369/?ref_=tt_urv

","Let me start by saying this movie isn't for everyone. If you enjoyed Rogen/Goldberg's previous efforts, namely Superbad and Pineapple Express, then you will thoroughly enjoy this one. I will admit I laughed so hard, there were tears. It didn't seem like it was trying too hard, it flowed well and was as ridiculous as I expected it to be. ",/review/rw5680369/?ref_=tt_urv

","Although 'This is the end' does not have the greatest storyline in the history of film, it is a very inventive movie in its own way. The fact that every actor and actress plays him or herself makes the movie quite original and refreshing. Besides that, there is also the fact that the makers took an overused theme, the end of the world, and made it completely their own.",/review/rw5680369/?ref_=tt_urv

","I originally saw in the theater back then I wasn't reviewing and here I am loving the movie all over again. So much fun every time, I really enjoy these type of wild comedies especially with Seth Rogen! I think it's great that the majority of the film is improvised, that's rare thing. A nice time for an apocalypse type as well with everything going on in the world; comedies are always a delight for sure!
