22 February 2009,TheLittleSongbird,9," Very funny, possibly better than the first!
","I absolutely loved the first movie. I bought this two days ago, and I was really impressed, because this is a really funny movie. it is possibly better than the first but only just. If there are any flaws, they are minor, but why is the rating for this movie so low? 6.2? It is much better than that! I can name other great movies that have fallen victim to low ratings. The humour was wonderful. Black humour suits the Addams Family perfectly. As for the acting, it was superb. Christina Ricci tops them all as Wednesday, but that doesn't mean that the others weren't good either. Raul Julia and Angelica Huston are note perfect as Gomez and Morticia. To be honest, I think that Gomez is Julia's best role. Christopher Lloyd was born to play Fester, just as entertaining as he was in Back To The Future and Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Jimmy Workman was also really good, and the underrated actress Joan Cusack took me completely by surprise as Debbie. That baby was cute too. If there was one minor flaw, it would be that you don't see much of Cousin It and Margaret. As I'm probably not able to write a review for the first film, what I've said for this film, applies pretty much also for that too. I give this a 9/10, same with the first, but avoid the New Addams Family and unless you're a Tim Curry fan, avoid Addams Family Reunion also. 9/10. Bethany Cox",/review/rw5489352/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2001,HumanoidOfFlesh,10," Funny as hell!
","Usually I don't like horror comedies and I hate mainstream movies,but ""Addams Family Values"" completely cracked me up.It was so immensely enjoyable and funny as hell!Especially the first Thanksgiving Day performance,where Wednesday Addams(Christina Ricci)as a Pocahontas,and other Indians took a revenge on American colonists-I almost cried with laughter during that scene!I wonder what Americans think about it?As for Christina Ricci,she simply steals the show in this one!I'm looking forward to see this talented,young actress in more movies.The other actors are also excellent,and the film is filled with wonderful touches of black humour.Highly recommended.",/review/rw5489352/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2014,SnoopyStyle,8," love the summer camp
",The Addams Family is back. Morticia (Anjelica Huston) and Gomez Addams (Raul Julia) have a new baby. Wednesday (Christina Ricci) and Pugsley (Jimmy Workman) are playing a little too dangerously with the baby. They hire Debby Jellinsky (Joan Cusack) as the new nanny. Uncle Fester (Christopher Lloyd) is immediately enchanted. Only she's actually a serial killer called 'The Black Widow'. Wednesday gets suspicious of her. Debby tricks the family into sending the kids to summer camp. Meanwhile she searches for hidden family treasure and tries to hook her next victim Fester.,/review/rw5489352/?ref_=tt_urv

","This film is one of those rare gems, a sequel that is as good as, or even better than the original.",/review/rw5489352/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2003,barbarella70,," Very funny
","Barry Sonnenfeld (Get Shorty) takes a zany script written by Paul Rudnick (Jeffrey, In and Out) and directs with an exhilarating rhythm to tell the tale of Uncle Fester's marriage to a suspicious young nanny (Joan Cusack) and its effect on the Addams family.",/review/rw5489352/?ref_=tt_urv
3 November 2001,leif.hellstrom,," Ricci rules
","This is a film with several excellent performances, but that of Christina ""Wednesday"" Ricci is near perfect. The reluctant smile outside the ""harmony hut"" is Oscar material. And Christina as Pocahantas is the very definition of ""cute"".",/review/rw5489352/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 1999,Andy Willett,8," No longer rehashing old material, they're even funnier this time.
",One of my favorite films. Paul Rudnick clearly had a field day writing this screenplay.,/review/rw5489352/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2005,lee_eisenberg,10," It should be the value of any family to see this movie if possible.
","""Addams Family Values"" accomplishes what ""The Godfather, Part II"" did: it equals, if not outdoes, the original. In this case, Morticia (Anjelica Huston) has a baby - whom they name Pubert (you read that right), Fester (Christopher Lloyd) marries nanny Debbie Jellinsky (Joan Cusack) and Gomez (Raul Julia) decides that Wednesday and Pugsley should spend the summer at a camp.",/review/rw5489352/?ref_=tt_urv
9 January 2000,Op_Prime,," Snap, snap continued
","It's a pleasant surprise to see sequel live up to the original. All the actors are great, particularly Raul Julia and Christopher Lloyd. Oh, can not forget Anjelica Huston. Sequels rarely live up to their predecessor and that's what makes this movie so special. Filled with humor, Values is highly recommended for all.",/review/rw5489352/?ref_=tt_urv

19 October 2002,soranno,," An improvement on the original film
","Almost everybody who was in the original ""The Addams Family"" returns to reprise their roles in this sequel which is actually better than the first film. The laughs come at a faster and better pace and Joan Cusack makes a delightfully sinister villain who masquerades as a nanny, marries Uncle Fester (Christopher Lloyd), and wants to get her hands on the Addams Family riches. It's up too all of the Addams along with new arrival Baby Pubert to stop her. Thing and Cousin Itt are also along for the ride once again.",/review/rw5489352/?ref_=tt_urv
28 November 2003,Smells_Like_Cheese,10," 100 times funnier then the first one
","Even though the first ""Addams Family"" delivered a ton of laughs, you will get more kicks and need more air from this movie. I cannot understand how even one person could not get at least a laugh from this film. The whole camp sequences are hilarious. Christina Ricci has come a long way, and despite the many wonderful films I have seen her in, this was always my favorite role. The kids were just perfect for this comedy. Fester and Debbie, I absolutely loved them. I thought Debbie was the perfect edition to the Addams clan. :D Her speech at the end about her ""victims"" was right on key and on the floor funny! Any true film lover should give this movie a chance and have fun. It's a great film that might even brighten your day. In an Addams Family way :D.",/review/rw5489352/?ref_=tt_urv

13 November 2022,lukem-52760,10," Another 90's Classic & One Of The Best Sequels Ever!!!
","I grew up watching both Classic Addams Family films on video & i love both so much. There's something so special about the fun Family films we grew up watching on video back in the 90's, maybe it's the better times or Nostalgia or the innocence of its time on film? All of the above i think & these Addams Family films are treasures from that beautiful era.",/review/rw5489352/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2021,mooveephantom,8," Hilarious, still holds up well.
","Loved this movie as a kid and I love it years later. For being a PG-13 rating in 1993, this dark comedy really pushed the boundaries for a family film. It mostly succeeds because of the direction, writing and fantastic acting. The whole main cast is great. But let's be real, it's Joan Cusack's show. She steals every scene and is so damn good as the devilish, sexy serial killer. Her facial muscles/expressions alone sell the scenes to sidesplittingly funny results. Christina Ricci is definitely in need of some recognition as well. She ""murders"" every scene and line.",/review/rw5489352/?ref_=tt_urv
31 October 2014,ironhorse_iv,7," Addams Family Value has a lot of value to me. I love it!
","They're creepy and they're kooky, Mysterious and spooky, they're all together ooky, the Addams Family. Directed by Barry Sonnenfled, the Addams Family Values is the sequel to the 1991 American dark comedy film, The Addams Family. The success of the first movie was what inspired a trend of film adaptations of TV series throughout The Nineties. So, it was no surprise that a sequel was greenlighted. Based on the characters from the cartoon of the same name created by cartoonist Charles Addams. 'The Addams Family' film series paint their characters as much more macabre than the 1960 TV show sitcom, playing off as light dark humor. Often a nostalgia cult follow brand, the movie saw the return of many of the cast members from the original 1991 film. The movie has the same plot of the first movie. Instead, of a gold digger mother trying to manipulate Uncle Fester (Christopher Lloyd) to get to the family money, we get a gold digger murderous wife, Debbie Jellinsky (Joan Cusack) trying to do the same. The movie tends to focus more on Uncle Fester than ever in this film, as characters like Gomez (Raúl Juliá) and Morticia Addams (Anjelica Huston) are given, nothing much to do. Raul Julia really gives some good hammy one-liners to make up for that time. I love how they shot Morticia on the camera. Her lighting always consists of one beam of light across her eyes that gradually fades outward to add to her grim look. She is so beautiful in the film. She is equaling as funny as Raul Julia. I love the oddly place dance number. It made the little amount of scenes between them, so memorable for me. Still, I'm not really complaining, about how much Gomez and Morticia lack screen time. Seeing the serial killer, Debbie try to attempt to kill Uncle Fester are pretty funny and most of their scenes, together are well acted. Joan Cusack is great as Debbie. Not only that, she make an unlikeable character, into a likable character. She also gave the film, some really needed sex appeal. I have a crush on her character when I was a kid. I love the fact, how clueless and lovable, Christopher Lloyd makes Fester to be. It's one of his best roles, besides Doc Brown of the Back to the Future series. As humor goes, the best parts of this film are the Wednesday Addams (Christina Ricci) & Pugsley (Jimmy Workman) going to a pretentious summer camp subplot by Debbie. Christina Ricci is great as Wednesday Addams, and I wouldn't see anybody else in that role. She delivers nothing, but deadpan snark, which only serves to make her all the more hilarious. The whole Thanksgiving play/raid was such a memorable scene that every time, I re watch this film, I looked forward to seeing this sequence. I have no idea; why a Thanksgiving play is being perform in the middle of the summer, but I love it. I love the conflict between the over the top snobby living in a fantasy world, rich kids, played well to the realist grim Addams kids. The sub-plot is so much better than the main plot in some ways. If anything, the fault of the film could be, the main plot offered nothing new; while the sub-plot should had more focus. Even the sub-plot of Gomez & Morticia looking after newborn Pubert wasn't really needed. The movie is pretty smart for a kid's movie, bringing social satire commentary to a lot of adult themes such as criticize of consumerism, the mistreatment of Native Americans, realism vs idealism and others. This movie doesn't treat kids as babies. There are tons of things in the film that might be view as today as not suitable for children. It really depends on the parent, if this movie is worth your children watching it. There are lot of dark humor, such as trying to kill a baby joke, sexual innuendos, and lots of foul language. There are a lot of things that kids might not get. The movie is also really shot, well. Lots of fantastic scenery and special effects. The theme song is really catchy. Still, the Addams-themed remake of ""Whoomp! (There It Is) by Tag Team"" was a bit cheeky. Kinda made me wish for the days of McHammer rap from the first film. Michael Jackson was signed on to write and perform a song for the film's soundtrack and to promote it with a music video. Although he was able to finish the song, contractual difficulties coupled with the child molestation allegations made against Jackson resulted in the song being dropped from the soundtrack, and the video was never filmed. The song, ""Is It Scary,"" was later included on Jackson's 1997 'Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix' album and was also used in his short film, Ghosts (1997). Overall: The movie is not to be taken too serious in a logic sense, it is a tongue-in-cheek comedy that work so well in its own world. It's worth the watch on Halloween or any good day, when a good laugh is needed.",/review/rw5489352/?ref_=tt_urv
16 September 1999,Gerald-O,," Its so funny! It's scary!
","ADDAMS FAMILY VALUES is a rare gem of a sequel that surpasses its original in every way possible. The original ADDAMS FAMILY movie had a horribly thin plot and stupid one-liners...but who cared...it had stunning cinematography and and set design!  Well, the sequel is less showy with its art direction and focuses more on making us laugh.  The screenplay was written by Paul Rudnick, who is the Messiah of One-liners.  His script has a wickedly dark sense of humor thats just irresistible.  Angelica Huston and Raul Julia are more sensual than ever. Christina Ricci is superb as Wednesday; she brings the perfect sense of melancholy and dryness to her character.  My favorite performace though was Joan Cusack, as the diabolical nanny Debbie.  She is just a blast to watch as a gold-digging psycho killer who wants Uncle Fester's money.  I loved how this movie satirizes the white upper class, which is a perfect contrast to the Addamses themselves. This is one hilarious movie.",/review/rw5489352/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2001,dimadick,8," Wednesday the 13th.
","This movie is a quit nice comedy but the reason I realy like it is the portrayal of Wednesday Addams by Christina Ricci.The Addams are usualy seen as a foolish monster-like family.Here Wednesday is seen as melancholyc teenager,inteligent,dark,cynic,sadistic and possibly murderous.She makes fools out of everybody else.She would make an excelent horror movie star.She also makes some points.She turns a dull theatrical Thanks-giving play portraying the indians as barbarians,inferior to the British settlers into a protest on behalf of the indians as well as a way to avenge herself from what she went through in the hands of stupid campers.She turned the camps loosers into a fighting squad.Forget about the rest of the Addams,Michael Myers,Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger.Wednesday brings the darkness.Bloody good for a comedy.",/review/rw5489352/?ref_=tt_urv
