16 February 2002,tex-42,," A mixed bag of a summer camp film
","This movie defintely has its high and low points, the plot concerns the last day of camp in 1981 at a small Jewish summer camp in Maine.  It's meant as a parody of all those late 70s, early 80s teen sex romps like Porky's and Meatballs, and while some of the parodies are dead on, others fall rather flat.  Perhaps the funniest moment concerns some of the counselors ""hour-long"" trip into town which starts out innocently but then degrades into a drugged-out parody where the kids start out smoking cigarettes and quickly go to robbing old ladies to feed their newfound cocaine and heroin addictions.  Other high points include the Vietnam veteran cook, the loony arts & crafts instructor, and even the children deciding not to play baseball against the anonymously evil-rival camp because they just don't feel like it.  A lot of the movie seems more like a bunch of strung together sketches, which adds to its weakness.  However, it is fun to see the return of the bad haircuts, too-short shorts, and high socks that made up that era, along with some great early 80s rock hits.",/review/rw0724031/?ref_=tt_urv
12 March 2002,deputydoofus,9," ""It's fun to get away from the camp, even if it's just for an hour.""
","The strangest point in this film is a point, about a half hour through, when all of the seemingly normal camp counselors go out in to the city.  In a montage shot, they slowly go from reading books at the library, to smoking cigarettes, to smoking joints, to buying cocaine from a guy on the street, to becoming prostitutes, then becoming strung out heroin-addicts at the local crack house.  This is not your parent's parody movie.",/review/rw0724031/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2011,StevePulaski,5," Was hoping for a wet hot discovering summer
","Wet Hot American Summer is the kind of movie where you either get it or you don't. If you do, you're good. If you don't, you are the red-headed step child among your friends and are subject to ridicule because you didn't laugh all that much. I have to say I'm in that category, but I appreciated what the film was doing. It was trying to be a different movie for a certain crowd. It succeeds in being different, but not much else.",/review/rw0724031/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2003,WriterDave,9," A Cult Classic of Epic Proportions
","""Wet Hot American Summer"" is an overlooked comic gem and an absurdest spoof of those god-awful summer camp movies from the 1980's. If you enjoy ""Monty Python"" style sketch humor or were a fan of ""The State"" (many of the players are employed here) or ""Kids in the Hall,"" then this is the ticket for you. People who enjoy humor more in line with the Farelly Brothers or the ""American Pie"" films probably just won't ""get this."" It's all a matter of taste and your sense of humor. But seriously, how can you go wrong with a movie that has a pep talk from a talking can of vegetables or an overly dramatic chase scene where the person doing the chasing is thwarted by a single barrel of hay in the middle of a wide open road? My personal favorite is when the guy is driving the van singing along to ""Danny's Song"" and then out of nowhere screams bloody murder as he slams into a tree. Oh, and who can forget the hilariously rapid decent into the underworld of drugs and despair by the kids spending an hour away from camp in town? This is also a must see for people who appreciate Janeane Garafalo's comic timing and Molly Shannon's bizarre brand of humor. This film was grossly overlooked when it hit theaters, but I think there is a cult following waiting for this movie. I hope these people are allowed to collaborate on another comedy. If they are, then we may have a new dawn of ""Monty Python"" style humor infecting the barbarian hordes.",/review/rw0724031/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie is not funny.  It's Friggin' HILARIOUS.  The first time I watched it was during the winter and I laughed a few times, but remembering the motorcycle chase scene, I gave it another run and was blown away.  I haven't laughed so hard since the second time I saw ""The Big Lebowski"" and I ended up buying my own copy.  ",/review/rw0724031/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2002,Brian B-2,1," Idiotic and self-indulgent pointless waste of time
","There are so many struggling film makers with good ideas, who would love to have David Hyde-Pierce or Jeanine Garafolo help get their films made. Good original films. Bit, no! They star in this tripe. Why this was made, I don't know. Writer/producer/director David wain obviously has unresolved issues about being a nerd at summer camp, but this unfunny movie ought to have stayed private between him and his therapist. Porky's and American Pie , though gross, each have something to say about youth and sex. This movie says nothing. Even Meatballs is better. And of course, Woody Allen does the alienated Jewish intelligentsia experience definitively. Wet Hot American Summer is not even good enough to be so bad its funny.",/review/rw0724031/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2007,vitachiel,1," Waiting to forget...
","Camp? Parody?? Cult classic??? Get out of here! What a drag to sit out this movie. Almost all the scenes are very short, but not short enough, because with the start of each fresh scene I was already waiting for the next, fruitlessly hoping on any thing funny to happen. No way. My irritation soon reached boiling point and not before was I so happy with the closing credits.",/review/rw0724031/?ref_=tt_urv
25 September 2017,13Funbags,1," I don't know what this is supposed to be.
","I somehow managed to go 16 years without knowing this movie existed and I wish I could have kept it that way. A certain movie podcast host mentioned how great this was(and that it was based on movies like Sleepaway Camp) and after seeing that it was the guys from The State, I knew it had to be funny. I couldn't have been more wrong. This movie has no comedy and no real story. Just a bunch of lame, shallow characters. Sleepaway Camp was not only a much better movie, it was a lot funnier and it wasn't even a comedy. Never see this.",/review/rw0724031/?ref_=tt_urv
26 January 2002,mangospider,8," Genius
","This movie made me so happy.  The performers are so gifted.  The details in the art direction and characterizations were pretty spot-on too.  Amy Poehler in particular delighted me.  That girl rocks my world.  Everyone has their moment though.  In this time when parodies are almost more common than original ideas, this movie stands out as one of the best.",/review/rw0724031/?ref_=tt_urv
16 March 2006,phazetds,1," What am I missing?
","OK, I am pretty forgiving and can enjoy a lot of stupid movies. But I REALLY don't get what it is people like about this movie! I like a lot of the actors, but the jokes were NOT funny. I mean maybe 5% of the jokes worked. It was like a long bad SNL skit or something. I just really rally don't get it. I would rather watch Weekend at Bernie's 2 three times in a row than see this again. This movie was flat, unfunny, and just a complete waste of time. I am sorry, I really wanted it to be good, but I think I laughed once the entire time. ",/review/rw0724031/?ref_=tt_urv
14 February 2005,smatysia,2," Absolutely no redeeming features
","What an awful movie. Okay, I understand that maybe I am not the target demographic for this film. And, while absurdity humor may not be my cup of tea, I can and do appreciate it when it is done well. Here, it was not. At all. This is just bad. I am surprised at all the raves I saw in the comments section. All right, everyone doesn't have to agree with me. I respect the opinions of others. But in my opinion, this movie sucks. Actually, I had never heard of it, and only taped it because I saw that Janeane Garofalo was top-billed. I remember thinking that she was so cute when she was on The Larry Sanders Show. Even though I know she is kind of loony, politically, I thought I would watch this film. Imagine my chagrin when, on top of a really bad movie, Miss Garofalo wasn't even very pretty anymore! My recommendation: Avoid at all costs Grade: F",/review/rw0724031/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2003,PIST-OFF,1," terrible
",the internet movie database lists this movie under the genre of comedy and i think they should review their choice and possible invent a new genre called worthless. Jeneanne Garofolo an intelligent comedian picks another unintelligent movie to star in. this film even with a ton of attractive ladies in it manages to avoid anything that might be considered a redeeming quality. The movies like Meatballs and Porky's that this movie aspires to at least never insulted their audience. This movie never gives you a chance. The characters are played so absolutely paper thing that 2x4s could aptly fill the acting spots. Whatever deeply troubled soul is responsible for this movie should probably spend the rest of their life in prison in order to give them time to think about what they want to say in apology on the day they meet their maker. I would recommend this only on the basis of showing someone that ANYONE IN THE WORLD can write a better and funnier movie than this.,/review/rw0724031/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2002,seltzer,10," Hilarious parody of the dreckiest film genre
","They don't get any worse than summer camp movies, but nothing is funnier than this satire aimed at that very genre.  People who came of age in the early eighties ( like me ) may get more of the jokes, but the movie is great all the way through.  The cast is impeccable, the writing is spot on, and a much neglected era is brought to life convincingly.  Many jokes start out as the same old predictable stuff but get turned on their heads.  Watch until the very end of the credits for one of the funniest jokes I have ever seen on film; it's worth the price of admission for that alone.  Fans of the State, the most brilliant sketch comedy show of the past 187 years, will go absolutely crazy over this.  A must see film that puts to shame many a period piece.",/review/rw0724031/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2002,scottand,1," Where ""funny"" goes to die!!!
","What planet are you people from?! That anyone could find this movie even remotely funny is proof positive that there is no God. Watching this was like being trapped in a room with a bunch of potheads who think that they're being funnier than they in fact are. And the fact that some people on this site described the ""humor"" in this abomination as ""subtle"" is probably funnier than anything in the movie itself. Would someone please explain to me how a man humping a refrigerator or a girl saying that she needs some spermicide, ""You know, for my pu**y,"" is subtle. This is the movie that you'd expect a bunch of twelve year old boys with a movie camera and too much time on their hands to make. This movie was actually painful to watch. It was like watching the very concept of ""funny"" sicken, die and rot before my very eyes. Not for the squeamish.",/review/rw0724031/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2018,LawnBoy-4,1," The pinnacle of Unfunny
","Yeah, I get it. They were attempting to create a spoof/parody of 70s/80s camp films. Done properly, this could have been a comedic classic. As it stands, the writers were apparently convinced that cornball ""humor"" and supposedly satirical and overt stereotypes were enough to appeal to the masses on the basis of forced ""irony"" and quasi-esoteric inside jokes. What a mess.",/review/rw0724031/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2011,UAWildcat28,1," A Dry Cold American Mess
","I've been wanting to see this movie ever since I read an article in Entertainment Weekly about how funny it was and included many comedians, that were unknown in 2001, that are well known now. I was completely set to see a movie about camping in the early 80s and when I saw it on Netflix I knew it was time. Then splat, I couldn't believe the garbage I was seeing. Yeah it was cool to see some of my favorite comedians and actors in one of their earlier films, like Paul Rudd, but I didn't laugh once. I saw it as a dramedy trying too hard to have some comedic value but failed miserably. Maybe it was my expectations or maybe you had to have experienced camps similar to this to understand it. Whatever the reason I can safely say that I am glad I never watched this film when it came out or I might not have risked seeing some of the actors' later films.",/review/rw0724031/?ref_=tt_urv

","Why would anyone like this? This is one of those ""cult classic"" you hear about and it has been on my watch-list for a while now. As you can tell by the title of this review, I'm not a fan. I get ""dumb"" comedies. I just watch 'Hot Rod' the other night, it is a magnificently funny dumb comedy. But this, I just do not get why anyone would call this a funny movie. I get why some of the scenes should be funny but they just fall flat. If you look at the director's track record, you'll see why I'm right about this lame duck comedy. I will say this about it, aesthetically it look well produced. But it just su#ks as a movie.",/review/rw0724031/?ref_=tt_urv
1 September 2001,fuldamobil,10," This is a wonderful, funny, funny movie!
","Hilarious. A goofy, nostalgic spoof of the early 80's. I loved this movie in all its crudeness and sincerity. See it, these people deserve to make more films. Comedies have become so gross and so ironic, that it's nice to see something that is just plain smart, honest and entertaining. This film doesn't want to do anything but make you laugh and it succeeds.",/review/rw0724031/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2002,butchM,1," Absolutely Horrible!
","I like stupid comedies as much as the next person and based on the great reviews and cast could not wait to see this.  About six of us had a ""movie night"" and watched it together.  I think I was almost lynched at the end of the evening!  NOBODY LAUGHED ONCE!  I completely get the concept (and it is a good idea) the problem is, every 80's summer movie it lampoons is actually at least a LITTLE funny.  This movie has at most two half smiles. It is awful.  There is no continuity, bad tech. srtuff all around.   There are some very funny people in this film - but they must have owed money to somebody, because there is absolutely no excuse for this crap!",/review/rw0724031/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2002,msuare01,10," Like nothing you've seen before
","Wet Hot American Summer is without question, the funniest movie to come out in years, and certainly among the funniest I've ever seen. The reason you might not have heard of it is because it isn't as advertised as other movies, because it doesn't have the type of budget to advertise itself. It breaks my heart that horribly made, unfunny, unoriginal movies, such as American Pie 2, were in more theaters and are more available to rent or buy.",/review/rw0724031/?ref_=tt_urv
26 March 2007,Blondie_,3," Gotta disagree with the consensus here
","When I saw that this movie was being shown on TV, I was really looking forward to it. I grew up in the 1980's and like everyone else who has grown up in that era, have seen every 80's teen and summer camp movie out there. So I couldn't wait to see this movie that totally spoofs that film genre. What a disappointment!! The movie was nothing but a bunch of really bad jokes and gags over and over, with hardly any plot and no substance. And the filmmakers attempts at dark humor totally failed-some of these so-called jokes didn't come across as anything but downright cruel and offensive. The only good things about this film were the wardrobe, music, and acting. It was nice to go on a nostalgia trip and see all of the summer clothing styles from the 80's, and the same goes for the music. And the acting was top-notch throughout: almost all of Hollywood's best comedians were present. Too bad they didn't have better material to work with.",/review/rw0724031/?ref_=tt_urv
12 June 2014,bradsbucs,1," worst movie ever???
","I guess a lot of the reviewers are less that 14 years old and think that jokes about lice are just the funniest thing in the universe or maybe they just have the IQ of a rock. This movie was so BADLY over acted and TERRIBLY directed and the script so CHILDISHLY written that the mere watching of it was worse than ""train wreck"" status. The budget is listed here at approximately 5 million: Cheap enough by 21st century standards. Opening week it brought in $17,481 and did a gross business of $292,102! That pretty much sums up what the theater goers thought of this dreck. They hated it!!! No word of mouth here! So about 48 thousand people actually paid to see this and it died on the vine virtually overnight. There are over 5,000 theaters with over 39,000 screens in the USA. If it had a general release at just 100 screens, with 3 showings a day, the average audience for the weekend was about 50 people per show. That translates to about 20 viewers per showing on Sunday. The producers, investors, and even theater owners lost pot fulls of money on this dog.",/review/rw0724031/?ref_=tt_urv
17 November 2002,starwolf,1," A piece of crap
