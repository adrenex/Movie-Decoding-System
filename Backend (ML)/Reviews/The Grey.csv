15 October 2000,Erewhon,4," Trendy, junky, phony remake
","Approximately 1/10th as good as the original, this version of GET CARTER doesn't even have the courage to use the original ending.  And it is edited in today's hyper-trendy style using extremely brief shots edited together in a welter of images hoping to create an impression of kinetic action. Instead, it's just indecipherable chaos.",/review/rw0664103/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2012,ma-cortes,6," Acceptable though inferior remake dealing with a Las Vegas avenger goes home to Seattle to learn his brother's death
","Violent film about a hardman named Jack Carter, he is a domineering , dapper angel of vengeance who returns home to investigate a familiar crime and meets sleazy character after another . An acceptable noir film produced by actor Andrew Stevens , Elie Samaha and professionally directed by Stephen Kay (Boogeyman , The last time I committed suicide), though with no originality . An extremely tough movie burdened by cruel murders and seedy characters , based on a novel titled 'Get Carter' by Ted Lewis from 1970 . This brutal , austere crime-thriller focuses a cheerless enforcer Jack Carter (hard-working star Sylvester Stallone) , a tough , amoral gangster who works as a killer in Los Angeles . Passable Sylvester Stallone in the title role , but inferior to Michael Caine (he played Jack Carter in the original) here playing a secondary role as Cliff Brumby (his character was only in one scene in the original cut, but test audiences said they liked him and they transformed the movie to have Caine as the bad guy) . Here Stallone is a hit-man who returns home to investigate his brother's death by some mobsters .As he decides to travel his natal Seattle to investigate who is responsible ; Jack contends enemies , but he stands a head above fellow hoods , but not apart from them . Two-fisted Jack in order to revenge his sibling , vows vengeance and spontaneously meets sleazy characters (bad ass Mickey Rourke and nasty computer magnate Alan Cummings) in the middle of sinister bands war and running afoul into underworld . When his brother dies under mysterious circumstances in a car accident , gangster Jack Carter travels to Seattle to investigate and reunites his widow (Miranda Richardson and niece (Rachael Leigh Cook) and he subsequently meets ominous characters who may have been involved . Carter aware the murder of his brother at the hands of a ""gang"" opponent led by a mobster . We see as his facade of sophisticated and elegant mob gentleman with exquisite manners , educated pose , and expensive costumes , begins collapsing , leaving see the lascivious, malleability and a cold killer . Carter starts moving in this ambient but all of this ends in a shocking discovery delivered by a compact disc which greatly angers Carter . This triggers a wave of violence that sweeps the the underworld lumpen in Seattle . Carter keeps the things moving along until ending vendetta. The end of the film is like a summary of the entire story for the scenarios that uses austere bleak and cold environment .",/review/rw0664103/?ref_=tt_urv
2 December 2015,Leofwine_draca,4," Forgettable
","Sylvester Stallone's remake of the British classic GET CARTER has gone down in history as one of the biggest flops and worst remakes ever. Watching it now, I can see why; it's a completely forgettable film that might just pass muster as an average straight-to-video thriller but which feels like a catastrophe when compared to the original.",/review/rw0664103/?ref_=tt_urv

22 April 2011,thinker1691,7," "" I'm the kind of guy your mother warned you about ""
","In 1971, the first of these action, violence prone films was offered. In the original novel, written by Ted Lewis, it was Michael Caine who was the unstoppable, revenge filled Gangster out to discover who killed his brother. In this updated version directed by Stephen Kay, we have Sylvester Stallone playing Jack Carter. Both versions were very well conceived. The updated film has added the blood, gore and non-stop drama which is common with newer versions. The story remains the same in that Carter (Stallone) learns his younger brother died under suspicious circumstances and he is determined to learn why. Along the way, he is met with business types who are not interested in helping Carter find the truth. To that end, John C. McGinley, Mickey Rourke and even Michael Caine get in the action. The movie is filled with dark sequences, black violence and thrilling chase scenes, all of which add to the final outcome. Great movie and a worthy successor to the original. ****",/review/rw0664103/?ref_=tt_urv
1 August 2002,invincible_seattle,7," Another unappreciated film by an unappreciated icon
","For some unknown reason, the industry 'suits' have decided to black-list Sylvester Stallone, not giving him large leading roles, and when they give him a role, they refuse to heavily market his films.  This trend started, I believe, sometime during the early 90s, probably after his last big hit, ""Cliffhanger.""  Nevertheless, Stallone has continued to make films, most of them actually pretty good.",/review/rw0664103/?ref_=tt_urv
10 October 2007,KHayes666,4," why remake this?
","OK, the original version of this movie wasn't imposing so why bother to remake it? The storyline is Stallone plays a Luca Brazi type mob enforcer who heads home for his brother's funeral. When he gets home he learns some of his old cronies were responsible so you know the drill....revengeeeee! I say the only reason this movie is watchable besides the usual Stallone delivery is because of Rachel Leigh Cook...this was back when she was in her true prime and she is GORGEOUS in the movie.",/review/rw0664103/?ref_=tt_urv

12 January 2010,johnnyboyz,5," Trite, overplayed, lecturing nonsense which functions only as a guilty, mindless revenge picture.
","Stallone and director Stephen T. Kay's re-imaging of the stunning, 1971 British gangster film Get Carter is a monumental mess on mostly all levels; a wavering, distorted and frankly quite annoying piece that renders what was once scuzzy pulp into polished actioner and slow burning film-noir into loud, messy, flashy nonsense. Some will claim it is Kay implementing his own style onto a set text, but in this case it is a set text that did not need re-imagining combined with a style we don't want to see, while the original did not need an update and certainly doesn't need to be fiddled with in order to act as a directorial calling card for someone who would later go onto have a career in making television shows.",/review/rw0664103/?ref_=tt_urv
14 March 2001,mattgenne,," slick editing can't hide the holes
","By far, the most entertaining moment on the DVD of ""Get Carter"" is the hilariously outdated 1971 theatrical preview for the original version of the film, which starred Michael Caine. (Caine does appear in this Stallone update.) Sadly, this update stinks. Sylvester Stallone's Jack Carter, a Las Vegas button man, skips town without his boss's permission and heads up to his old stomping grounds in Seattle to investigate the mysterious death of his brother, whom he hasn't seen in five years. That's the pitch.",/review/rw0664103/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2007,buzznzipp1995,9," Here is a 'Stallone role' that I've been waiting for...
","Oh yes he's heavy and he ain't got a brother anymore. I saw this in 2000, (in THX -Dolby ) I was engulfed from the moment it came onto the screen!! that is probably the best way to view this, on a huge screen with a kickin' surround sound system, in the dark!

26 September 2001,michaelRokeefe,6," You must know the difference between a promise and a threat.
","Director Stephen Kay gets one hell of a performance out of Sly Stallone. Ranking right up there with Rocky fighting the Russian boxer. Stallone plays Jack Carter, a no nonsense enforcer for the mob in Vegas. He goes back home for his brother's funeral and suspects that the death was not accidental, but murder. Carter goes up against some tough resistance in collecting info on his brother and his death. ",/review/rw0664103/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2022,searchanddestroy-1,2," Such a disgrace
","I was such in a hurry, back in 2001, to watch this movie, because I am a die hard fan of the genuine GET CARTER, back in 1971. Such an extremist, ayatollah like fan of this absolute masterpiece. And what a pain for me to discover this pure garbage, because mostly of the script and Stallone. Shame on him, such a skilled actor, who could have had greater roles after F. I. S. T, ROCKY, PARADISE ALLEY, such a skilled actor, but who unfortunately was lost in the image he had of himself. He totally smashes this film. I prefer forget this garbage. But I wanted to warn you.",/review/rw0664103/?ref_=tt_urv
24 August 2008,Cristi_Ciopron,1," Totally Unenjoyable
","In our times, the idiots, cretins, imbeciles seem to prevail; yet it is still astonishing that a movie like this crap ,this megacrap, ever gets being made, released ,etc.. Our times are maybe poor for the Hollywoodian cinema, with several trends of lifeless flicks occupying the first ranks; yet this Stallone flick is outrageous even being given that. What kind of morons, of retards, of cretins are those who dared to get this rubbish on the market? (Let alone any comparison with one of the masterpieces of the thrillers, the Caine film I mean. Is Stallone the man to replace Caine? How dumb must one be to even dream of this?) It is bad AS exploitation, violence, brutality, etc.; it is an outrageous movie for its genre. Its problem it's not its genre; on the contraryit is its failure as a genre movie. It completely fails to be a genre movie. It is not for those who like genre films.",/review/rw0664103/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2001,baumer,7," Stallone may be passe, but this film is pretty good.
","I think it is now pretty much official.  When one of the last action heroes from the 80's returns to his roots and gives people what they at one time wanted to see, and no one cares, it is perhaps time to take a different route in your career.  Stallone is never going to be short on money and fame so instead of trying to inject life into his career by doing starring vehicles like this one, why not take some cameos or some smaller roles in an ensemble cast?  Stallone has been pigeon holed and has a caricature about him that he may never get out of.  This film has pretty much solidified the fact that he is not the kind of actor and does not contain the kind of persona that can win a modern audience over onto his side.",/review/rw0664103/?ref_=tt_urv
2 March 2001,FlickJunkie-2,5," Mediocre Remake
","This is a mediocre remake of a 1971 film by the same name, with Sylvester Stallone inheriting the title role from Michael Caine (who also has a minor role in this film).  The screenplay has been updated to make it more techie (cyber porn, cell phones and internet billionaires).  Writer David McKenna (`American History X') attempts to flesh out Carter a bit more and make him a nice guy in a bad profession.  Unfortunately, while that helps, the dialogue is uniformly bad and the characters are boringly stereotypical.",/review/rw0664103/?ref_=tt_urv

2 March 2004,Vlad-58,7," Effective. Complex. Layered. Well acted. Sharp. Smart.
","I simply do not get what certain people have against this movie. Sure, it's not a cinematic breakthrough, but it is very sharp, smart and focused. Jack Carter's brother, Richie, dies under mysterious circumstances. Jack goes back to his home town to check things out and perhaps find out the truth.

14 September 2010,Robsnide,1," Caine is still Carter
","The impossibility of making good films in the 21st century is perfectly illustrated by this perfunctory remake of the 1971 Mike Hodges classic which starred Michael Caine as 'Jack Carter', a gangster who travels to the north of England to find out how his brother Frank died. This version shifts the story to America, and casts Sylvester Stallone in the main role. Caine himself plays 'Cliff Brumby'. The end result is a routine crime drama whereas the original is a classic. But what really takes the breath away is the ending. Instead of being shot on a beach, Carter jumps into his car and drives off. Presumably it was changed because American audiences hate films with unhappy endings. I take it then that if ( heaven forbid ) 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' ever gets remade, it will climax with 'McMurphy' building a jet pack and escaping from Nurse Ratched's institution by zooming Rocketeer-like over the fence. Have movies ever been quite as bad as they are right now?",/review/rw0664103/?ref_=tt_urv
