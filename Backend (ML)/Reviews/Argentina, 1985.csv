1 November 2020,quiqueperezsoler,9," This is the RIGHT way. The subtle difference between ""reproducing"" Star Wars and ""recapturing"" Star Wars. Why The Mandalorian gets Star Wars right
","It's one thing to bring back elements, characters, settings and stories, and to flash them in front of the audience to cash in on the nostalgia and/or recognisable memorabilia but without using it to further the plot and other to do exactly the opposite. It was about time that Star Wars directives understood that it is too unique a product to be lend to corporate filmmakers. Star Wars needs to be understood and its uniqueness has to be acknowledged in order to make the new stories feel like they belong. This may sound too obvious but if you ever wondered why the new SW movies are so controversial this may be the reason.",/review/rw6748551/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2022,DiCaprioFan13,9," Best thing Star Wars since the original trilogy!
",The Mandalorian is every bit as good as everyone says it is. It's easily the best thing Star Wars has done since the original trilogy. Every episode of every season has been good so far. Jon Favreau definitely hit a home run with this. The Mandalorian is about a lone gunfighter who makes his way through the galaxy after the fall of the empire. He then comes across a baby Yoda who he pretty much adopts and brings along through all these adventures. This is the show every Star Wars fan has been waiting for. It just goes to show that they can still make good content when they want. Every episode is action packed. It will hook you from the beginning and you'll want to binge it a fast as possible. It's a must watch for any Star Wars fan!,/review/rw6748551/?ref_=tt_urv
20 December 2020,ThomDerd,10," Excellent! And I m not even a star wars fan...
",Jon Favreau did a fantastic job here. Beautiful and well crafted series that binds nicely in the star wars story and gives more depth to it. 10/10 Highly recommended.,/review/rw6748551/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2022,Supermanfan-13,8," Pretty Good!
","I finally watched The Mandalorian after putting it off for so long and I absolutely loved it! I don't consider myself to be a huge Star Wars superfan like some of these other fans out there but I am a regular fan that really enjoys watching the movies. I even didn't mind the latest trilogy, Rogue One and Solo more than most but The Mandalorian is without a doubt the best thing Star Wars related since the original trilogy! Jon Favreau is mostly known as an actor but he's also such an underrated Director, he's done some amazing movies (Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Elf, Swingers, Made, Cowboys & Aliens, The Jungle Book, etc.). I've really enjoyed it and can't wait for more to come!",/review/rw6748551/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2020,paul_haakonsen,10," Simply phenomenal...
","Right, well yeah, I grew up on ""Star Wars"" and have been loving it ever since ""Star Wars Episode 4: A New Hope"", and I am still loving it today. So when ""The Mandalorian"" was announced, I was thrilled.",/review/rw6748551/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2020,vincentvino,9," Best Star Wars since the original trilogy.
",Jon Favreau should be in charge of all future Star Wars projects. It's exactly how it should be. I will not give 10 stars because nothing is perfect but this is very very close. Hats off!,/review/rw6748551/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2021,classicsoncall,10," ""So what happens if you take that thing off?"" - Cara Dune to The Mandalorian - Ep. #1.4
","This was a well executed return to the origins of the Star Wars saga beginning with 'A New Hope'. I was thrilled to see characters and locales that reminded me of Alderaan and Tatooine, along with the space vessels that were a throwback to the ones in the first Star Wars trilogy. I don't recall the term 'Mandalorian' ever being mentioned in connection with the New Republic or the Empire before; if so then I missed it. The back story we get here of the Mandalorian (Pedro Pascal) and his Creed gives rise to a credible tale of how he came into possession of The Kid, and how his mission becomes one to reunite Grogu with a Jedi Master. One thing I was always fascinated by in the Star Wars lexicon was the names given to particular characters and how well they fit their personalities. Here, in addition to Mando, we have Greef Karga (Carl Weathers), Cara Dune (Gina Carano), Fennec Shand (Ming-Na Wen), Peli Motto (Amy Sedaris), and Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito) among others. One of my favorites with only a one episode appearance was The Marshall, Cobb Vanth, portrayed by Timothy Oliphant. As the second season entered it's latter half, it was exciting to hear the name of Boba Fett (Temuera Morrison) once again, while seeing him team with Mando. The icing on the cake of course is the reuniting of baby Yoda Grugo with Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), who will train him in the ways of the Jedi. I thought this was just a very cool series for old time Star Wars fans like myself who weren't all that thrilled with the prequels and sequels. I guess if there's a good way to describe it, it would be 'This is the Way'.",/review/rw6748551/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2019,jonahe123,10," The vibe is finally right
","This is the Star Wars atmosphere and feeling I've been waiting for. No dumb humor, cool characters, and a story I can take seriously. I'm a big fan of what they've done with this series so far and current Star Wars filmmakers need to take notes. The cinematography is amazing. You can tell they use practicality as much as possible and CGI is used only for the obvious like spaceships and creatures etc. It's a truly remarkable balance of old and new.",/review/rw6748551/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2019,Her-Excellency,10," Cowboy in a Galaxy Far, Far Away = Pure Magic
","The Mandalorian (so far) has everything anyone could ask for. It is SO well-crafted, I have yet to see one flaw in it.",/review/rw6748551/?ref_=tt_urv
9 April 2020,deloudelouvain,9," The best of the whole Star Wars saga if you ask me.
","After so many years of postponing I finally decided to watch all the Star Wars movies and so also this series. Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones, Revenge Of The Sith, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Rogue One, A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return Of The Jedi it's now time for The Mandalorian. It's supposed to be happening between Return Of The Jedi and The Force Awakens so it's only logical I watch it now. I do hope there will be much more seasons though as I just loved this show. Pedro Pascal is perfect as The Mandalorian. Each episode is quite short but very enjoyable to watch, certainly if you just watched all the other movies just before. It's a nice continuation of this saga. You can write whatever you want about the early movies in this saga, but the modern ones just beat them in everything, quality, acting, and technology, as so does this series. I binge watched the first season in 24 hours that's how good I thought it was. Next will be The Force Awakens but to be honest I can't wait to watch other seasons from The Mandalorian as it's for me the best thing in the whole Star Wars saga thus far.",/review/rw6748551/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2019,MarkoutTV,9," So far so good
","I like that they gave the Mandalorian some personality, some good vistas and action setpieces, solid comedy, fun little additions to the Star Wars canon (bounty droids are officially awesome) and a general sense of adventure that I dig. It's all very small and big at the same time. All good stuff and I hope they can keep it up.",/review/rw6748551/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2020,neoclone07,9," If you're a SW fan, you must watch
","There's not much to say here... it's a great show, with solid acting, great cast, a script that dives into SW lore, superb fx (both pratical and digital) which leads to a real SW atmosphere (which lacks in the last movie trilogy).
I'm a long time SW fan and you can say that the new trilogy brought new stuff into the franchise, blablabla... but no, the trilogy is a pain in the ass to watch indeed. So, instead, watch The Mandalorian, it's way much better in so many ways.",/review/rw6748551/?ref_=tt_urv
23 November 2019,nerdgasms,10," This is the way
","I'm a huge Star Wars fan but I have to admit, all hope was beginning to be lost. I was excited for The Mandalorian but had my bar set very low. But my God man this is amazing! I can't believe it's this good! The OG Star Wars vibes are crazy! It's like they took the original Star Wars and buffed it with modern day big budget CGI without making it a crappy blockbuster. The story is actually incredible so far and every episode is better than the last. I was gonna just watch these online but I've gotta support Disney+ for finally allowing something good to come out of them owning Star Wars. Thanks Jon Favreau, this is the way.",/review/rw6748551/?ref_=tt_urv
22 November 2019,brentscott,10," Kathleen Kennedy,JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson take notice. This is how you do Star Wars
","This is Star Wars. It feels like Star Wars. It Looks Like Star Wars. Why is this such a tough concept for the geniuses associated with the films to get? No subversion's needed, no forced 8 yr old humor, no political agenda. Just make it look and feel like the original Star Wars trilogy and fans will be happy, its literally that simple.",/review/rw6748551/?ref_=tt_urv
16 November 2019,vanja-pletikosic,10," The Mandalorian - Now THIS is Star Wars
","This show is such a refreshing breeze of great quality Star Wars. Hopefully with Episode 9, this horrible era of Star Wars will end, and we will finally get what we all wanted the whole time - great stories set in the Star Wars universe. Stories like this, that make sense. Stories that hook us and make us want more, make us relate to the characters on the screen, just by showing their weaknesses along with their strengths. The Mandalorian has faced more adversity in these two episodes than Rey has in two three hour movies. Definitely my favorite character of the Disney Star Wars era, and he has only said a few lines. Brilliant directing, brilliant script, brilliant execution of everything. I can't wait to see where the story goes.",/review/rw6748551/?ref_=tt_urv

12 November 2019,diornodouwes,9," A New Hope
","A new chapter for Star-Wars, one like we haven't seen before. First of all, you can feel the star wars vibe from a mile away. The beautiful world-building production- and costumedesign, the thrilling cinematography and the great (sound)editing. There are however some aspects that divide this artwork from the trilogies. the type of storytelling for example. focusing completely on one character, and making this one character so interesting.",/review/rw6748551/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2020,view_and_review,9," Indispensable Watching for Any ""Star Wars"" Fan
","I'm amazed at how going off track from the main Star Wars storyline has produced, arguably, better movies and shows. Sure, Baby Yoda aka Grogu, is adorable enough to make any warm-blooded person fall in love.",/review/rw6748551/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2020,kuarinofu,5," Read this to save your time (if you care)
",Looks like they finally got someone to re-watch the original trilogy.,/review/rw6748551/?ref_=tt_urv
5 December 2020,Homer_Ate2,5," It's okay
","It plays it very safely. Each episode is very much the same, land on a planet, help a local militia fight something, a small skirmish and episode ends. And there's no tension in the fight scenes, the Mandalorian easily dispenses of his does.
With that being said it is innocent fun.",/review/rw6748551/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2022,bill_allison,9," truely exquisite; next watch Star Wars Rebels
","There are many fine reviews, so I will simply say this is a must see. It has the feel of a big budget blockbuster. The script, acting, editing, sound and video effects are all 1st rate. Much of the filming used exotic locations rather than doing everything on a set with green screen. The story fits into the ""canon"" of the SW universe, unlike some other new shows. You won't be offended by inconsistencies and will feel rewarded with greater understanding of the Mandalorians..",/review/rw6748551/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2020,madameminty,5," Setting over everything else
","There's no actual plot. Every single character is at best one-dimensional. Things happen because banal clichés collide, cause shootouts, then leave the scene fundamentally unchanged. Conflicts arise because people are stupid.",/review/rw6748551/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2021,badoli,5," Visually stunning, yet very weak writing.
","The plot points can be seen coming from a mile away, everything is written for effect instead of logic and hardly any idea is really creative.

27 March 2021,SouthernViews,6," Too Much Filler and Formula
","If you are heavily invested in the Star Wars universe and a big fan of Clone Wars, you will love this show. At least, that's what I'm getting from the other reviews. As a big Star Wars movie fan, I've never seen the Clone Wars cartoons. So, I'm guessing I'm missing out on a lot of Easter Egg stuff.",/review/rw6748551/?ref_=tt_urv
