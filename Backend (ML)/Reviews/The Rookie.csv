12 June 2016,kosmasp,7," Step up Dad
","This is actually pretty funny. It's not the most sophisticated comedy, but you should know that even before watching this. Mark Wahlberg showing off his perks ... I mean comedic talents again. Also his muscles yes (for those who care). There are quite a few jokes that go below the belt (even literally), but it's all kept pretty light, if you don't mind that direction in general.",/review/rw3640676/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2016,Gordon-11,," Way better than I expected!
","This film tells the story of a sensitive stepfather who is disliked by his two stepchildren, despite trying super hard to win the kids' hearts. One day, the biological father shows up at the doorstep, and a big oneupmanship ensues.",/review/rw3640676/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2016,Wizard-8,," Some giggles, but pretty formulaic
","I have to confess that for the most part, Will Ferrell kind of mystifies me; I don't see what makes him so popular with the mass public. Still, I have to confess that in ""Daddy's Home"", he tones it down so he isn't strident like he is in other movies. In fact, he does end up having some charm and likability, and paired up with Mark Wahlberg (another actor who usually doesn't impress me), some genuine chemistry is generated. Also, director Sean Anders wisely lessens the raunch factor that is usually high in in the two stars' other movie; there is an easy-going feeling instead that is quite palatable, a feeling that does sneak up on you and does tickle your funny bone on occasion. However, in the end there are not quite enough laughs to make me give it a recommendation. As I said in my summary line, the movie is quite formulaic; you can really predict what will happen before it actually happens throughout. Since there are no surprises, it becomes very difficult for the movie to pull the rug out under the audience and generate laughs. There are many comedies that are much worse than this, I admit, but in the end it's only a movie to watch when something else in your home is asking for your primary attention.",/review/rw3640676/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2016,lesleyharris30,3," Another Typical Comedy where all the Good Parts are in the Trailer,
","Daddy's Home is an awful movie with a very poorly developed storyline that is all a set up for poor jokes, and an impressive comedic cast that all just felt wasted. There are some funny parts in it, but sadly those parts were also in the trailer, so we are left with good bits that are no longer funny cause we've seen them all already, and a ton of lame, immature jokes such as watching Will Ferrell get electrocuted or a ridiculous dance off between Mark Wahlberg and Bill Burr. Ferrell and Wahlberg really weren't the stars of this movie because any chemistry that the two certainly have is thrown away with poor development, as well as the fact that both of their characters are unlikeable, it was hard to tell who we were suppose to root for, neither of them was really an antagonist or protagonist. The only two people who really seemed to enjoy being a part of this movie were Thomas Haden Church and Hannibal Buress, they did have me genuinely laughing in their scenes, and for the time they're on screen we can forget about how poor, unfunny, poorly edited and regretful this movie is. Lacking energy, heart and original comedy, Daddy's Home kills any potential it has, and you would be much better off avoiding it. ",/review/rw3640676/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2015,jtindahouse,7," Has its moments but it's no game-changer
","'Daddy's Home' is the second collaboration between Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg, the first being 2010's 'The Other Guys'. There's no doubt the two have chemistry. What there is doubt about is how to perfectly utilise each of the two as characters. The problem is that for Wahlberg's confident, in-charge character (which he has to play) to work Ferrell needs to play the straight guy and that isn't when he's at his best. He does it well there's no doubt about it, but he's at his best when his character has an edge to him like 'Ron Burgundy' or his character in 'Step Brothers'. Playing the overly straight guy just seems almost a waste for the one Ferrell movie we get a year, even though no one could deny he still does it very well. ",/review/rw3640676/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Modern Family"" has been showing it to us on our TV screens since 2009. On the big screen, ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" talked about it back in 1993: ""Some parents, when they're angry, they get along much better when they don't live together. They don't fight all the time, and they can become better people, and much better mummies and daddies for you. There are all sorts of different families."" The Best Picture Oscar winner ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" dramatized it back in 1979, along with numerous other TV shows and movies before and since. These entertainment products reflect today's society and help people deal with the stresses and heartbreak of divorce and the formation of new and even unconventional families. Often, TV shows and movies do these things with humor, as in the film ""Daddy's Home"" (PG-13, 1:36).",/review/rw3640676/?ref_=tt_urv

9 January 2016,RNMorton,9," Really funny
","I don't usually laugh out loud in a movie theater but I had at least 4 or 5 big ones here. I think Will Ferrell can be great in the right spot, but certainly not all of his movies have been entertaining, same for Wahlberg. They play off each other very well in a very intelligent comedy, Will is the touchy feely warm step dad and Wahlberg the macho irresponsible bio dad. The movie plays out very smartly and, unlike a lot of other recent movies, doesn't run too long. The other characters are well played, including Will's wife, and the final wrap is excellent. I have nothing more to say but the website requires 10 lines. An unashamed 9 of 10.",/review/rw3640676/?ref_=tt_urv

27 December 2015,brendandevere,8," Ferrell versus Wahlberg!
","Everybody loves a good laugh, but what makes us burst out into shrieks of delight is purely in the eye of the beholder. Some people still find Adam Sandler funny (and relevant)while others find the rebooted canned laughter of early eighties slapstick comedy the right fit for their sense of humour. It is all about taste and what one actually finds amusing. I find Will Ferrell amusing and when he teams up with Marky Mark Wahlberg, then what you have are a couple of ""goofs"" that can actually make people laugh. They are opposite in every way and because of this extreme difference, their personalities just seem to gel.",/review/rw3640676/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2015,trooper5783,10," Hilarious!!!! Critics, stop pushing this into the ground!!!!!!
","I saw Daddy's Home in a packed theater at an afternoon screening and I personally think this movie's very funny in a lot of places. I found myself laughing out loud throughout the entire movie, and the rest of the audience agrees with me. There were times where the people in the theater were laughing so loudly and heartily that the next lines of dialogue were nearly inaudible! Everyone loved it so much, they clapped their hands at the end of the film, so critics, know what a great comedy is. The characters Griff and the boss played by Thomas Haden Church were particularly hysterical. The movie also has a few heartwarming moments to add to a really funny script. The trailers and TV ads didn't show all of the belly laughs for a change!! Great soundtrack to add to that. Daddy's Home is a hilarious gem and it's definitely worth going to watch in the theater!!!! Don't believe the critics that gave this a negative review who just select little nitpicks and enlarge them to an extent so that they can get a paycheck- go watch this!!",/review/rw3640676/?ref_=tt_urv
7 April 2016,bkoganbing,3," The parenting thing
","Plot premises such as we have in Daddy's Home usually are reserved for more serious type films, father and stepfather rivalry for the affections of the kids.

24 November 2017,Horst_In_Translation,6," Sometimes very funny, at other times just try-hard
","""Daddy's Home"" is a 95-minute award-winning comedy movie from 2015 that recently returned to the headlines because a sequel is coming out these days that adds the legendary Mel Gibson to the cast, but we will talk about that one later. Today the focus is on this one we got here. It is among the most known career works by writer and director Sean Anders and the story can be summarized quickly. Will Ferrell plays a family man, only problem is the two kids are not his, but from his love's previous relationship. And when that man (played by Mark Wahlberg) enters the family's life again, it is not helping Ferrell's character's plans at all for the kids to finally accept him as their co-dad if you want to call it like that, especially as Wahlberg is (apart from the issue of responsibility) the perfect man, but not really the perfect dad. This is 100% about the comedy for me. There were some moments where they slightly tried to make a statement on good parenting and emotions, but these were really not too memorable at all. But it's fine as the film never takes itself seriously at all. Ferell is the MVP here without a doubt, but he also has the best material and he only has very few moments when he is missing the mark. It sure helps too that for the most part he is next to a relatively limited actor when it comes to comedy at least.",/review/rw3640676/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2015,StevePulaski,3," A desperately unfunny, mean-spirited slog of a family comedy
","""Daddy's Home"" is a questionable film on all cylinders, not only for its cynical, truly mean-spirited temperament just in time for the holiday season, but by it's marketing approach. This was a film that seemed to be communicated through advertisements and TV commercials, to my judgment, a movie for young children. I wasn't alone in this assumption because, when I attended my screening, my demographic of eighteen and older were undermined by the barrage of young children in the audience. If you pay attention to the zippy, blink-and-you-miss-it previews for ""Daddy's Home,"" you'll take note that this is indeed a PG-13 film, and a hard PG-13 film, if I do say so myself. Jokes about sex, nudity, male and female genitalia, and innuendos run rampant in the film, but I just can't help but think that this is a film that won't appeal too much to people older than eighteen, who will likely perceive the premise as being too childish, nor parents of kids younger than twelve who probably, knowing full well what they're in for when they see this film, wouldn't allow their little angels to see it.",/review/rw3640676/?ref_=tt_urv
28 December 2015,benj-20839,10," Funny Funny Funny.
","Fun and very funny movie. One of,if not the best comedy of the year based on the amount of laugh out loud moments. No filler, Very well paced and never a dull moment. Laughs were frequent and often throughout the entire running time. If you like the premise of the trailer and found it funny then the film totally delivers on it. The audience around me were laughing throughout too and it was a packed screening. I can't understand why the critics have given it such poor reviews, worse than the majority of the other comedies reviewed this year or before. Maybe they want you to go and see that boring below average Star Wars movie that's dominating film news and screens at multiplexes right now. If you want to be entertained, have fun and leave the cinema totally satisfied then i would thoroughly recommend Daddy's Home over the blandbuster Star Wars The Force Awakens anyday.",/review/rw3640676/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2015,RogerCampbell,10," A very funny movie!
","""Daddy's Home"" was a very enjoyable movie to watch! The mix of polar opposites Will Ferrell and Mark Walhberg was almost perfect. Ferrell plays the wimpy, goody two-shoes husband who is desperately trying to keep his wife and step-kids together as a family. Wahlberg plays the charismatic and tough guy ex-husband/biological father looking to win back his family at almost any cost. The beautiful Linda Cardellini plays Sara the wife/ex-wife who is caught in the hilarious tug of war between her two suitors. While the plot is somewhat predictable, the humor is fresh and so very enjoyable! If you're looking for an hour and a half of laughs, look no further and go see this enjoyable movie. However, you might want to leave the younger kids at home for this one because of sexual innuendo and language.",/review/rw3640676/?ref_=tt_urv
25 January 2016,ironhorse_iv,6," It's seem like nobody was home in Daddy's home. This comedy had little laughs from me.
","This family duo comedy from mega-stars Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg was no 'The Other Guys' (2010). Directed by Sean Anders, the movie follows a mild-mannered, devoted stepfather, Brad Whitaker (Will Ferrell), struggling to connect with his two new step-kids, Dylan (Owen Vaccaro) and Megan (Scarlett Estevez) after marrying their mother, Sarah (Linda Cardellini). But just as his new family is warming up to him as a father figure, the kids' real dad, Dusty Mayron (Mark Wahlberg), comes to visit with his sights set on winning back his family. And, as you probably guessed, a battle for the right of fatherhood ensues in a depressing, unfunny bitter childish action. Don't get me wrong, I get that Dusty has the right to see his kids, but here is the reason, why this set-up fails. Who in the right mind, would allow, the ex to live with them, so he can have time with his kids? Not only, is the plot so easily could be solve with a strong 'no' from Brad or his wife, or settle in a legal action, logically, but it doesn't make any sense, for Brad to keep him, around, after the two started to butt heads with each other. The conflict was so drawn out, that it becomes so unrealistic and unwarranted. Not only has this gag, gotten beyond borderline stupid, but it also became too frustrating to watch. I really, don't mind, most comedies, when they do this fighting for custody bit, like 1993's Mrs. Doubtfire or 1979's Kramer Vs Kramer, because they somewhat give the subject, somewhat emotional weight; however, in this film, it's still all play as laughs. Seeing, these two fighting endlessly over the love of their children isn't that funny, it's just sad. Add, the crass, cruel, and mean-spirited jokes, and you have a receipt of a very unpleasant movie. I really couldn't stomach, watching most of this film. If anything, the trailer for this film is more interesting to watch, than the movie. After all, it showcase most of the good slapstick humor that mostly got a laugh from me. Other than that, it's not funny. The characters are all one-dimensional, over-the top stereotypical and even somewhat recycled. I really felt like everybody talent was wasted by the horrible written dialogue. Like, honestly, who in the hell, talk like Brad in this movie!? 'I'm a hot habanero pepper!?"" Who says, things like that!? At least, he's doesn't have, too many, irritating yelling and screaming scenes in this film, like his other films. I also hate the fact, that Will Ferrell's insecure Brad is mostly the same character as he was in 'The Other Guys', just not a cop. The same can be, said with Mark Wahlberg's character of Dusty. Supporting actors like Linda Cardellini got it worst. Not only does, both Will Ferrell and Mark Walhberg don't share any sign of chemistry with her, at all. She barely has any lines and barely a character. It's sad, because she's a fine actress. I hate that she has little more to do than look pretty and warn Brad that Dusty is a master manipulator. It was a very lackluster role. You would think, maybe, she would play a bigger part in the film, but no. She has no say, in anything, what Brad and Dusty is going to each other. Then, there is the bizarre & completely random subplot featuring Griff, the repairman (Hannibal Burress) who moves in with the family because Dusty invited him. Not only does Hannibal's character get really annoying with the film's overused 'racism card' jokes, but he also takes away, most of scenes that could had been reserved for Linda Cardellini's character. It could had been Sarah commentary about why it is wrong, it was, for Brad & Dusty to fight against each other than this minor character. If there was anybody, that look good in this film, it had to be Thomas Haden Church as Brad's womanizing boss, Leo Holt. He looks like he's having tons of fun and had some semi-alright jokes. Yes, he doesn't really play much into the plot, but for me, it's was a blessing, just to have, something different than seeing these two father figures fight like morons. Overall: Despite the movie, not being that funny, there are some positive messages to take from this film about, the benefits of biological and stepparents being around and getting along, and the fact that jealousy, while understandable, is toxic to healthy relationships, but in the end. Daddy's Home is a far cry from Ferrell and Wahlberg's last team-up and that's the sad truth.",/review/rw3640676/?ref_=tt_urv

","Daddy's Home (2015): Dir: Sean Anders / Cast: Will Ferrell, Mark Wahlberg, Linda Cardellini, Thomas Hayden Church, Hannibal Buress: Daddy's home and hopefully not met with this disappointment. Idiotic comedy about man's competitive nature as step-dad Brad Whitaker, played by Will Ferrell desires to be accepted by his step-kids but when biological father Dusty Mayron, played by Mark Wahlberg, returns a predictable back and forth unfunny prat falls follows as one struggles to out do the other. Formula driven plot with a dance off climax that is as lame as they get. Sean Anders has directed better comedies in Horrible Bosses 2 and Sex Drive, which are both underrated but here even the production seems routine and uninspiring. Ferrell as Brad is his usual self in his loud payoff but the character can be identified with and Ferrell is a trooper even when accidentally electrocuted. Wahlberg as Dusty shows up on a motorcycle brandishing black leather and intimidation. Linda Cardellini as Ferrell's wife caught between the two is nothing more than a prop to be jerked back and forth. She wants a third child and obviously Dusty will attempt to fulfil that. Thomas Hayden Church as Brad's boss at the radio station is another cardboard role best forgotten. Hannibal Buress is the one supporting characters that brings a few chuckles as a black construction worker sheltered in Brad's home because of a racial situation urged on by Dusty. The message regards being a good father or step-father and coming to some sort of truce. Either way when daddy gets home, something better has to be playing on TV.
