9 October 2022,DiCaprioFan13,10," Incredible!
","Warrior is one of the best and most underrated shows of the last decade. It's hard for me to even describe how much I love this show. Everything from the acting to the writing to the production is fantastic! All you have to do is read through the reviews to see how loved this show really is. A lot of fans were worried when Cinemax announced they won't be making shows anymore but fortunately for us fans HBO Max picked it and season three is right around the corner. It was so deserving of another season, hopefully with HBO Max's platform and the great word of mouth that the fan base will continue to grow. I can't wait to see more of this incredible show!",/review/rw7542409/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2020,Eiriksterminator,10," This show is just pure awesome.
","One of the best shows I've ever seen. The story, the setting, the history, the characters, the cinematography, the ACTION...just...WOW! Everything is amazing, and it just gets better and better as the series moves along. The buildup is something else, and the second to last episode of season 2 needs to be seen to be believed! They BETTER not cancel this, and give us a third season! The story is still unresolved. In any case, go watch this right now if you haven't already!",/review/rw7542409/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2020,Supermanfan-13,10," Action packed thriller that deserves more recognition!
","Warrior is a flat out awesome show that really does deserves a lot more attention than it's been getting as it's one of the better shows on right now! For some reason Cinemax hasn't done a very good job promoting this series (or any of their series really) but people are finally starting to figure out how good this show really is through word of mouth! It's just an awesome, action packed thriller with a great story, great acting and even better fight scenes! Give it a chance, I promise you won't be disappointed!",/review/rw7542409/?ref_=tt_urv

",This series is really promising. It has all the ingredients to be as good as Banshee or Peaky Blinders. The mixture of both worlds made this series born. Hopefully it will become a masterpiece.,/review/rw7542409/?ref_=tt_urv

","Three minutes into this show and I was ALL IN! It has everything I want in a show.
I felt like Cinemax should've knocked on my door and said, ""YO CHECK THIS OUT""!
I see many negative reviews on here. I'm guessing those to be written by people that like musicals or boring artsy films. If you like crime and action movies? Then you'll say F@#$ YEAH! If you don't? Go watch La La Land, The Artist, or Eat Pray Love. You know films that should make a man contemplate committing seppuku rather than sit through.",/review/rw7542409/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2021,RussHog,9," Hot Babes and Martial Arts!
",I just finished the second episode and I am hooked. The characters are all very interesting. The main character is quite likable and all the role players are strong. The production value is great. The action is exciting. There isn't anything about this show that annoys me. It's very stylistic and pushes the story forward with a good brisk pace. The women on this show are HOT and it kinda makes me wish I lived in this world. PS - I've never been a big fan of martial arts stories but this show makes me want to watch a lot more of them.,/review/rw7542409/?ref_=tt_urv
11 January 2021,vincerodriguez447,9," HOPING WE GET MORE SEASONS SOON!
","**First off, disregard the few very low scores and comments. I read them all and they were basically all trolling comments and ratings **
That said, the show wasn't perfect in the first few scenes but it really pulled itself together and shaped up really well to end (2 seasons so far) with a strong ending and interesting cliffhangers! The 1st episode of season 1 was so so but every subsequent episode just got better and better! A very interesting story that comes from true history and needs more attention (especially now, when all the whitewashed chapters of our history are finally being told and told truthfully) & a really sharp martial arts action series. Unlike Into The Badlands which I couldn't get into because the choreography (although stunning) was unbelievable and the storyline was uninteresting, Warrior has way better writing and action that is more realistic (of course some is over the top but that's lthe point when it focuses on Ah-Sahms fights. He personifies Bruce Lee's larger than like persona) in many cases.
I'm really glad I found this series. I binged it all in 2 days. I'm eagerly awaiting and hoping that although Cinemax is no longer renewing its shows that HBO max which absorbed the properties renews this one as was promised and as many many fans are awaiting. I can't see why they wouldn't.
Can't recommend Warrior enough to martial arts & historical piece (the sets and costumes are excellent and fit the late 1800's perfectly!) lovers! 9/10!",/review/rw7542409/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2022,ebmilkyway,10," Amazing!
","A historical crime, martial arts, action, drama based on a story written and inspired by the late, great Bruce Lee. The base story has historical fact and that makes this series so engaging. The acting is fantastic, the action is fantastic, the sories between the tongs and the Irish union and the SFPD are all so engaging. I'm still in season one but I am so happy to know HBO has picked it up for season three. I am a huge fan.",/review/rw7542409/?ref_=tt_urv

21 March 2022,daviddiepusc-92269,9," Like opium, this show is addictive
","I love this show. I was looking for something similar to Banshee and this fit the bill. The show is so fun to watch, we have enjoyed every minute of it. I cannot wait to get more!",/review/rw7542409/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2021,destroyerwod,8," If its done, it was very good and satisfying but i want more !
","From what i heard the company who does the show decided to cancel all its programing or something, so a season 3 seem unlikely to happen unless another network buy it. With Covid and all its been a rough time for TV so maybe the 2 seasons we got will be all we get. So the question is... is it satisfying? Without any spoilers, the answer is YES !",/review/rw7542409/?ref_=tt_urv

8 April 2019,skip-98756,10," Outstanding New Series that has the Vibe of Banshee
","About 15 mins in and I found myself Really liking this show and the vibe it had! I wasnt quite sure why? What I Did not know was that the guy who created Banshee ,also made this,,Honestly, i had no preconceptions ,nor foreknowledge of even what the show was about ,except its name.
As i was watching, i felt as if this had a familiar vibe, I was like ""man ,this show feels alot like Banshee!""..The lead actor is fantastic, as is the brothel owner, there is immediate chemistry here! Then as im watching , there pops up a character that looked all the world like Hoon Lee and upon closer look, it was indeed Him! so WTF? Its like im watching a kind of ""Chinese Banshee"" and im Loving it! Ive been wanting to see Something that had that vibe and this show is the 1st that has captured it..I remember when the series from 2016 called Quarry had come out..it was supposed to be the New Banshee ,and i watched it but it never came close to capturing that feeling..This show does,right out of the gate,and those banshee fans out there are gonna love this new show! the writing is outstanding as are the character choices and the actors picked to play them... super thumbs up and a great surprise!",/review/rw7542409/?ref_=tt_urv

",Eat way to describe it is Bruce Lee meets Clint Eastwood meets Tommy Shelby. Some great fight scenes a solid storyline and relationships built enough twists and character building to keep you invested. A thoroughly underrated series that deserves a much wider audience.

13 November 2021,dogonlion,8," Updated review because of the 2nd season
",I had already rated this series 4 stars but after seeing the 2nd season which was so much better than the first I had to upgrade the rating to an 8. The first one had some weak dialogs and was struggling to be what this show was supposed to be. They fixed in the 2nd season. Even the fight scenes are way better. The writing is also far superior.,/review/rw7542409/?ref_=tt_urv
