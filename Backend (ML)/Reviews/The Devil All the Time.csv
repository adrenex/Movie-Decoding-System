9 September 2015,themadmovieman,7," Hardy is excellent, the rest is not so much
","The story of the Kray twins is a fascinating one, full of violence and deceit. In Legend, that story isn't really taken to its full potential, thanks to an unfortunately clunky structure despite brilliant performances, good humour and violence.",/review/rw3333287/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2015,lnvicta,6," Two of Hardy's best performances in a movie with not much else going for it.
","Legend is a gripping movie, there's no doubt about it. Seeing Tom Hardy on screen, whether he's playing Reggie, Ronald, or both, is absolutely captivating. He owns the roles, and despite their identical looks you feel that they're completely different people because of how well Hardy portrays them. Reggie is sophisticated, methodical, affable; Ronnie is impulsive, unpredictable, paranoid. As a vehicle for Tom Hardy's acting chops, Legend is a home run. Unfortunately, that is where the positives of the movie end.",/review/rw3333287/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2015,quincytheodore,7," Proof that you can't have too much of Tom Hardy
","It is true that glasses and change of hairdo can actually produce a different personality. This movie is mostly dedicated to Tom Hardy delivering his excellent, albeit slightly and funnily schizophrenic, acting prowess. As far as biopic goes, other films such as Black Mass delivers a more in depth-look of the mafia life style, but Legend opts for a direct personal view of the brothers and takes full advantage of the lead actor.",/review/rw3333287/?ref_=tt_urv
28 February 2016,bob-the-movie-man,7," Hardy excels in a dual role of some right historical bad 'uns
","Tom Hardy is a strange fish as an actor. Famous for being almost incomprehensible in ""The Dark Night Rises"" and almost equally incomprehensible in his co-starring role in ""The Revenant"", it's sometimes really difficult to get a sense of his true abilities. Here in ""Legend"" he gets to show what he's made of. Twice! Hardy plays both roles in the story of Reggie and Ronnie Kray, the infamous gangsters who ruled across large parts of London in the 1960's.",/review/rw3333287/?ref_=tt_urv

2 January 2016,Lejink,4," Hardy and Hardy
","Let's start with the title...of all the films I've seen with irrelevant and inappropriate titles, this one takes the biscuit and I'm sorry, I didn't find the film legendary either. British cinema's continuing fascination with the notorious (now there's a better one-word title!) Kray Twins continues and I doubt this will be the last one either. The twist here of course is having Tom Hardy play both parts, thanks to some clever editing and video trickery, although with Reggie and Ronnie not at any time looking like the identical twins in the movie, you sort of wonder what was the point.",/review/rw3333287/?ref_=tt_urv
11 September 2015,mgould23,5," Tom Hardy shines in bad movie.
","The only good thing about this very average film is Tom Hardy's acting. A lesser talented actor would have made it almost unwatchable. Short on facts, the writers here have just invented or borrowed bits to try and make the film sensational. It hasn't worked very well but at least shows the 'Krays' were a couple of psychopathic violent lunatics whose scrambled brains believed they were something special. Fact is, in this film, the one bit of fact we do know was said by Chas Palmintiri as Angelo Bruno the Philly mob boss, 'mobsters should keep a low profile'. Ironically poor old Angelo Bruno got whacked by Nicky Scarfo, a psychopath mafiosi who just like the 'Krays' loved being high profile and just like the Krays was sentenced to die in prison.",/review/rw3333287/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2015,MovieIQTest,," Tom Hardy is just.......AMAZING!!!!
","I have to confess that I could never finish or even forced myself to watch any British gangster films until this ""Legend"". At first, I thought I just might give it a try and predicted that as usual, I'd quit within 5 or 10 minutes, because 99.9% out of 100, the British gangster movies sucked. The reason why I decided to give it a try was because of Tom Hardy, since any film he played turned out to be very good. And this film, Lordy, Lordy, he was just amazing, playing two completely different persons and characters as twin brothers. This kind of performance is simply at genius level, so good that I simply couldn't find word to describe or praise him. I think Tom Hardy is not only one of the best actors in 21st Century, he IS the BEST! What a great gift to movie history and civilization. There's nothing I could express more.",/review/rw3333287/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2017,alanbenfieldjr,8," The Hardy Twins, what a treat
","The original film about the subject ""The Krays"" (1990) had Billie Whitelaw as their mother and, somehow, she dominated my memory of the film. Here the twins have a mother but she is, on the film, a distant character and that's what I missed here. I missed their interaction. She clearly had a massive influence in their characters but in Legend, those pieces of the puzzle are unfortunately missing. But, Tom Hardy compensates for any flaws. He is extraordinary, twice. The twins are total individuals, totally two people. What they carry in common is a sort of sexual danger, one explicitly the other implicitly but both as powerful. They dare us to get close. Amazing performance(s)",/review/rw3333287/?ref_=tt_urv

16 May 2016,Leofwine_draca,6," Solid, but flawed
","The second of the big screen retellings of the Kray storyline, following on from 1990's THE KRAYS which starred real-life brothers Martin and Gary Kemp as the terrible twosome. While I enjoyed LEGEND on a superficial level, I found it an oddly hollow viewing experience and not as good as the previous version. The problem lies with the direction, which is oddly inexperienced for a long-time director like Brian Helgeland.",/review/rw3333287/?ref_=tt_urv

","If you don't understand true British underworld history, it probably isn't for you, you won't understand it. Fifty years from now, Hardy wil go down as one of the greatest actors of all time. He absolutely nailed this roll - the era, the persona, just incredible.",/review/rw3333287/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2015,michaelradny,8," Legends
","Tom Hardy gives an all time great performance, double acting as both the notorious Kray twins. The story is also quite comedic, clever and full of some great thrilling scenes. One of the great things about this film is you know what you're going to get, and it delivers, then some. It's bloody on top of witty, charming and fun. Legend serves up one of the great films of the year, whilst also being quite modest in its approach. ",/review/rw3333287/?ref_=tt_urv
16 October 2015,Troy_Campbell,8," Outstanding crime picture (and Hardy is a LEGEND).
","The infamous Kray brothers – identical twins Reggie and Ronnie – are so well known in British gangster history they've already had multiple films made about them. What writer-director Brian Helgeland brings to the table with his take on the notorious siblings is exuberant storytelling, classy visual styling and a tour de force performance by Tom Hardy as both twins. Hardy's dual turn is undeniably the centrepiece of the movie. His Reggie is all charm and swagger, with intelligence and ambition to boot, whilst the schizophrenic Ronnie is a short-tempered ball of emotional bluster. Helgeland sensibly opts to make Reggie the focus; of the two he is the more grounded one, a gangster with lofty aspirations and the ability to interact on a human level with those around him to make his goals a reality. There is also genuine chemistry between Hardy (as Reggie) and Emily Browning, her fragile yet strong-willed Frances able to draw out the romantic side of Reggie, making his bursts of savagery all the more terrifying. Sporadically placed throughout the (overlong) two hour plus runtime, the bouts of violence bubble with intensity and exhilaration, often uneasily enjoyable thanks to moments of levity sprinkled alongside them. The 60s setting is capitalised on too, Dick Pope's elegant photography giving proceedings a classical feel while Carter Burwell's powerfully soulful score affects deeply at all the right times. There's a sense of glorification here that mightn't sit well with some audience members, however the Krays were adored in the East End and to deny the glitzier parts of their life would be to deny what made them popular to begin with. An exceptional crime picture with two outstanding performances from one man, proving again that Hardy really is an acting legend.",/review/rw3333287/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2019,classicsoncall,8," ""You know, me and my brother, we're going to rule London.""
","It wasn't until the movie was over while watching the credits roll that I realized the characters of both Ron and Reggie Kray were both played by Tom Hardy. He did quite the exceptional job of portraying the brother gangsters with their own unique personas and quite different looks for being paternal twins. They also shared common attributes as well, the most noticeable being a predisposition for violence when it suited them, and it seemed to suit them a lot. Reggie had a bit more self control, and when Frances Shea (Emily Browning) entered his life, he more or less tried to keep his impulses under control, but situations often demanded that he get involved in a bit of brutality.",/review/rw3333287/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2015,drjgardner,2," Boring beyond belief
","The only thing legendary about this film is the boredom it creates. Marketed as a ""gangster"" film, the film falls way short of the mark. Instead it dwells on the mental instability of one of the brothers and the ill-fated love life of the other brother. The film disappoints on all 3 levels – it is not a satisfactory gangster film, nor a very compelling love story, nor will it give you much insight into mental illness.",/review/rw3333287/?ref_=tt_urv

10 November 2015,AliceofX,4," Not Really About The Krays
","I bet that you, like me, walked into the theatre expecting to see a gangster movie about the Kray twins only the film is not about them at all. Instead the central character is Frances and the entire story is told from her point of view. You don't get a picture of the criminal world just long love scenes between Reggie and Frances.",/review/rw3333287/?ref_=tt_urv
12 January 2016,Horst_In_Translation,6," A solid effort and outcome
","In the shadows of Johnny Depp's ""Black Mass"", there is another crime thriller based on real characters and events from 2015: This is ""Legend"". It was written and directed by Academy Award winner Brian Helgeland (""L.A. Confidential"") and runs for an impressive 132 minutes. Actor Tom Hardy plays twin brothers Ronald and Reggie Kray, who are very different in terms of character for the most part of the film, but actually really similar in terms of certain crucial situations. Hardy definitely did a fine job with this double role he has here and his acting, together with the film's script, result in a couple pretty great moments. This fraternal relationship is one of the core elements of the film. Others include one character's relationship with Emily Browning's character. She played her character well too and was a very positive surprise. I must say I have never been a big Tom Hardy fan, but with performances like these, he certainly elevates my interest in him. Finally, there are of course many crime-related (sometimes also police-related) developments happening in here, also interesting to watch for the most part.",/review/rw3333287/?ref_=tt_urv
22 December 2015,Theo Robertson,8," Hugely Enjoyable Absurdist Black Comedy
","I gave this a miss when it came out and you can understand why . Yet another Brit flick featuring gangsters and this time it once again revolves around those poor misunderstood Kray boys . I do remember the pretentious biopic on them from 1990 starring the Kemp twins and that was unforgettable for all the wrong reasons with Steven Berkoff giving the worst performance of any actor in any film ever . And no doubt we'd be getting the usual myth of ""They stuck to their own . It was business , we were safe in those days etc"" so I found myself watching LEGEND as a mere change from the Oscar bait material I've seen over the last couple of days ",/review/rw3333287/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2017,nicholls_les,6," Good mainly because of Tom Hardy
","Tom Hardy is Brilliant in this and after a while you forget that he is acting both roles as Reggie and Ronnie. Nothing much new in this apart from the tragedy of Reggie's wife Frances and that is the slant that they put on this otherwise well known story, but it is in fact Hardy's portrayal of Ronnie that is most outstanding. he captures the true madness of the man without becoming a caricature.",/review/rw3333287/?ref_=tt_urv
26 February 2016,cosmo_tiger,8," This is a movie that I really enjoyed and highly recommend but the reason to watch is for the dual role played by Hardy
","""The Queen would survive, but God save the rest of us."" London in the 1960's was run by two twin gangsters, Reggie and Ron Kray (Hardy). Nothing happened without them knowing or allowing it. Reggie was calculating and deadly while Ron was a little psychotic and unstable. Eventually they only thing that could challenge their reign was each other. As many of you know by now I am a HUGE fan of gangster and mafia movies. I was looking forward to this one for that reason. I like Tom Hardy but never really got all the hype around him, until now. He was so good in this that it almost actually hurt the movie. He plays both brothers perfectly and to the point of you forgetting its the same actor. The dialog and intonation of his voice is even different. I've never seen anything like it and half the time I was staring at them, going back and forth trying to see similarities and failing. It also made me wonder if the movie would have been as good if it had not been for him. What it came down to was it doesn't matter, he is in it and I was just mesmerized by his acting in this. I say distracting because as good as this movie was all I could talk about was his performance, that isn't a bad thing though. Overall, this is a movie that I really enjoyed and highly recommend but the reason to watch is for the dual role played by Hardy. I give this movie a high B+.",/review/rw3333287/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2015,scott_thompson7454,7," Hardy terrific, film so so
","I was really looking forward to this one; the trailers were great and, whilst I'm not one of those who glamourise the Krays (they loved their mums, would do anything for you blah blah blah), I do find it bizarrely fascinating how the Krays/Richardsons have passed into London folklore. Alas, it's a bit of a let down. Hardy throws himself into both roles, by turns amusing and scary as Ronnie and compelling as a Reggie trying to build an empire while struggling to keep his brother in check. But he is let down by a clunky structure, it takes a while to get going and subplots and characters are introduced and then discarded on a whim, an awful Frances Kray voice-over, and an uneven script which can't quite decide if it wants to be an American style gangster flick or tread the same path as The Long Good Friday, Get Carter et al. And who let Duffy and her nails down a blackboard voice back in? I really hoped we'd seen the last of her after that crap Diet Coke ad. The club scenes aren't quite working guys. I know, let's get Duffy, stuck a wig on her and she can caterwaul her way through some 60s classics. High five!!!",/review/rw3333287/?ref_=tt_urv
