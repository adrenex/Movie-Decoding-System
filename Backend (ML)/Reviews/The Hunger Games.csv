16 October 2020,ferguson-6,6," 2 stories as one
","Greetings again from the darkness. We've seen it before. Two stories, seemingly unrelated, yet parallel. Only this time it's based on a true story, and the 2017 book ""All My Tomorrows"" by Brian Gregory. Director Lance Hool and co-writers Veronica Hool and Robin U. Russin serve up a touching and inspirational story of how the lives of families can intersect, and how triumph can come from tragedy.",/review/rw7006788/?ref_=tt_urv
14 June 2021,wruzek,9," Not just any movie
","I've read some poor reviews and am astounded that those who wrote them were fixated on technicalities of acting or the story line or some other triviality. This is the true story of heroic life-saving goodness. How can that be ignored? To those who love and appreciate life, you won't be disappointed!",/review/rw7006788/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 2020,suiebabe,8," Melt your heart
",Only a few details do i know about this and was shocked to find it was a true story. The intertwined story of Chris and Sam and Jorge and Leslie was so romantic and touching yet both were heartbreaking.,/review/rw7006788/?ref_=tt_urv

15 February 2021,ajvariety,9," Two Love Stories - TTwo families - TRUE Story
","Two very beautiful stories following two families with two love stories - and a turn of events - which will bring them together in the end.
Very moving - very touching - at times comical and lighthearted - and then very spiritual with a message of true love and importance of family - and of caring for others.
The sceneries are breathtaking and the characters very believable and their connections and relationships hold your interest to the end.
The fact based on real people - just completes the story.",/review/rw7006788/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2020,tracimyers1972,10," Beautiful and sad!
","It was a beautiful story. I prefer going to movies without knowing what happens, so I was stunned with the outcome. I loved Chris' spunk. And he and Sam had such great chemistry. Jorge and Sarah's love was beautiful too. Lots of sweet times spent together telling their beautiful love stories and how they eventually connect. Reminds us that there is always good even in the bad!",/review/rw7006788/?ref_=tt_urv
7 February 2021,annbss,10," Enjoy every inch of life
",2 hearts remind us of being passionate in life and to love every single moment. Time is everything. Jacob Elordi portrays an amazing young man living fully and to have no regrets. He really brings the goodness in the movie as well as Tiera Skovbye. I really very much enjoy watching the film. Such a nice feel good and unexpected genre. I'd definitely rewatch it from time to time.,/review/rw7006788/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2020,trinaboice,6," Have your tissues ready
","IN A NUTSHELL:
Based on the dramatic true story from the 2017 book All My Tomorrows: A Story of Tragedy, Transplant and Hope by Brian Gregory, the movie intertwines two families' lives. It tells the story of Christopher Gregory and Jorge Bacardi, who is practically Cuban royalty of the Bacardi Rum dynasty. Directed by Lance Hool, the movie is family-friendly and sugary sweet. Chris Charalambous, the Head of Acquisitions at Freestyle stated, ""We believe 2 Hearts is the kind of heartwarming and uplifting love story that audiences need right now and will want to experience."" A special thanks to all of those who bravely declare themselves organ donors on their driver's license. They will live on in all of the lives they touch.",/review/rw7006788/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2021,odavestidosyregalos,10," Amazing 100%
","At first I thought it was just another movie, but it wasn't, I get from the depths of my incredible feelings, knowing that they all exist and that it is a true story was even more emotional and significant.",/review/rw7006788/?ref_=tt_urv
13 March 2021,PerryAtTheMovies,5," A simple ""2 Hearts"" review....
","Overall:
An ok movie. Acting was subpar and it took too long to be emotionally attached. I don't tend to cry during movies, but when I do the waterworks will flow. If you've been wanting to watch this movie it won't hurt to watch it. It's not the straight on romantic movie I was expecting, but still it would fall in that category.",/review/rw7006788/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2021,anthonydapiii,6," True Stories are the Best Stories
",An incredible story that makes us realize how connected we all are. Love that they made this into a movie.,/review/rw7006788/?ref_=tt_urv
19 October 2020,rannynm,8," Inspiring messages in this romantic drama that will melt your heart
",This romantic drama is filled with inspiring messages that melted my heart and moved me in unexpected ways. Make sure you grab a box of tissues before you watch this tearjerker. I cried my eyes out!,/review/rw7006788/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2021,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,10," Live the day and be generous.
",I don't usually care for romance films. But this one was on Netflix's top ten trending when I logged in and I had seen everything else I cared to watch on that list. To my surprise I really enjoyed it. I felt the romantic story was more organic and not so synthetic Hollywood romance films. The story flowed nicely with this one. All of the actors were very likeable.,/review/rw7006788/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2021,laurelmecca,5," Decent story, sub par execution
","The acting and writing was a little cringey. The ending of the movie was given away far far before the ""twist"" because they made such a big deal out of Chris being an organ donor. I also feel like they could've told more story and gotten you more attached to Chris instead seeing where his imaginary future led. Otherwise, it was decent and watchable.",/review/rw7006788/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2021,aimtrain1021,1," Missing something
","I wanted to like this. I like the premise and that it was based on a true story. I usually like these types of movies, but there was something off about this. The pacing wasn't right, not enough time to really care about the characters or believe their relationships. Dialogue was a little awkward. Even Jacob's good looks and charm couldn't really save this.",/review/rw7006788/?ref_=tt_urv
27 October 2020,trimblair,9," Great movie for the whole family
","One f-bomb for no reason at all. Otherwise, outstanding flick with a great message. Well directed and well acted. Ww loved it!",/review/rw7006788/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2021,dvdgrvs,9," Great twists, story line and thoughts!
","A must to watch ! A heart warming story.
Movies aren't written as superb as Two Hearts. The actors present a story that is for all ages. Well performed.
Great scenery as well as music.
Abrazos to the Hool's for creating this fantastic work.",/review/rw7006788/?ref_=tt_urv
9 July 2021,cherylcummings-59089,9," Beautifully moving
","I had no clue what this movie was about when it popped up on my ""Recommended For You"" list. I was expecting a sweet romantic comedy, but instead I was given so much more...a true story that moved me to my core. I haven't cried that hard in a long time. The people giving low scores because of trivial things are completely missing the point. In fact, just like the movie says, those people are missing the bigger picture. And this might sound exaggerated, but this movie could help save lives with it's message.",/review/rw7006788/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2021,bek-50240,9," Heartfelt
",I honestly haven't seen a movie in a while that made me feel so deeply. The simplicity of love and all the glory of having it and losing it. This story makes you appreciate what you have for our time on earth is never guaranteed.,/review/rw7006788/?ref_=tt_urv

5 June 2021,brendasmpt,8," Saving a life is the best gift you can give
","I loved that this is based on a true story written by a family member of the young boy who gave life to 5 other people because he was an organ donor. I think it's the most unselfish thing a person or family can do. The story is sweet, & music is lovely & peaceful, & the ending scene stating that Gabriel house was created in gratitude of the gift the Bacardi man received is the best. If that hadn't been written at the end, I would have given it a 5/10 & wouldn't have cried because knowing what came out of this situation is what made me cry, not the acting....",/review/rw7006788/?ref_=tt_urv
9 October 2022,albertval-69560,8," Pay it Forward
","This is a sob story based on a true story. But don't get me wrong. It not cheesy or overly sentimental at all. And this makes it the
the more compelling. The fact that two
lives with striking similarities set apart by time intersect is not only serendipity at work (or the universe conspiring in a positive way) but could be the stuff that miracles are made of.",/review/rw7006788/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2021,lillyries,9," Based on a True Story, Inspiring and Emotional
","This movie was based on a true story! Although the acting wasn't the best at times, the plot was intriguing, the characters were lovable, and the end drove me to tears. As someone who's father was an organ donor, they got the emotions spot-on-- yes, it's sad, but it's beautiful, and the movie captured it perfectly.",/review/rw7006788/?ref_=tt_urv
11 March 2021,kwenchow,1," Another worst film! Full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Avoid at all cost!
","This film start with the narrator talking about two ways to live your life, and the introduction of the main character ""Chris"" scene! As turnout, this film is about Chris need to donate his organ to save Jorge! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the driving scene, overuse of the kissing scene, overuse of the eating scene, overuse of the narration scene, overuse of the calling names scene, overuse of the talking on the phone scene, overuse of the crying scene, overuse of the browsing with laptop scene, and overuse of the pass out scene! Make the film unwatchable! At the end, Chris die! Jorge eventually found out who save his life! That's it! Wasting time to watch!",/review/rw7006788/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2021,RobTheWatcher,5," Sweet story - lackluster movie
",It was a really heartfelt story based on true events but unfortunately not that well executed. It was what you'd expect from a movie on Netflix at this level. Worth the watch but not great.,/review/rw7006788/?ref_=tt_urv
