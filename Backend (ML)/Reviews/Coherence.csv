25 March 2009,ccthemovieman-1,9," A Haunting Portrait Of Loneliness
","Wow, what a sordid but fascinating film. I can why Mickey Rourke won so many awards for his performance, too. The same goes for the film.",/review/rw1943205/?ref_=tt_urv
31 December 2008,MovieAddict2016,10," One of the best films of 2008
","Enough has been written already about Mickey Rourke's real-life parallels with his fictional character in The Wrestler. Yes, it makes the story seem even realer, and is perhaps what attracted Rourke to the project. (Or perhaps not  perhaps, instead, it is what attracted Darren Aronofsky to the actor.) But to focus on such surface similarities seems like an undermining of his work here. Rourke may not be as out-of-his-comfort-zone as Sean Penn in Milk, the only other Oscar-worthy lead performance this year, but that is merely a testament to his fundamental understanding of his character: Randy is an understated guy with big scars, both literally and figuratively. He's been wrestling for years  now reduced to borderline tribute shows in front of dwindling crowds, scrounging up barely enough cash to buy the variety of drugs and steroids he needs to maintain his weight. He lives in a trailer park and gets locked out for not being able to keep up rent. He works part-time at a grocery store and visits strip clubs regularly, because it's the only place where he seemingly has any meaningful connections with another human being  namely the dancer Cassidy (played by Marisa Tomei), who is similarly a bit older than most peers in her ""profession,"" yet doesn't really know any other way to live.",/review/rw1943205/?ref_=tt_urv
27 February 2009,Superunknovvn,8," The role Mickey Rourke was born to play
","""The Wrestler"" is a beautiful movie, but it wouldn't be half as good if Mickey Rourke hadn't given the main character a face and a heart. There's virtually no other Hollywood actor that could have embodied Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson as perfectly as Rourke, and it's shocking to think how the movie could have turned out had someone else, say Bruce Willis or - as originally planned - Nicolas Cage played the part. With Rourke it's not so much an actor memorizing lines and delivering them convincingly, it's like watching a guy having gone through hell and now showing his scars. Rourke's performance even lets one overlook some rather clichéd elements in the story (the exotic dancer with a golden heart, the neglected daughter, a dance in a romantic dilapidated ballroom). It's all good, because one look at Randy's face reminds us of all the hits and punches he must have taken in the past, and it all becomes real again.",/review/rw1943205/?ref_=tt_urv
20 January 2009,Billy_Costigan,," Brutal, Honest, Touching film
","The Wrestler is a drama centered around an aging professional wrestler past his prime. It's so much more than that. You don't have to be a fan of wrestling to enjoy this film. The wrestling part of it can be put aside as a back story. Randy ""The Ram"" could be in any other profession, doing any other thing and could be in the same situation. That's what's so great about it. He's just a lonely guy, whose life seems to have passed him by. A middle aged man who doesn't have much going for him. Sure, he's a wrestler, but he needs wrestling more than wrestling needs him. He needs it to feel important, to feel like a somebody. He really has nothing to show for himself, no wife, just a daughter he hasn't been there for his whole life. Missed opportunities. He's sad and alone and we really do feel for him.",/review/rw1943205/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2008,littlemartinarocena,9," The Return of Mickey Rourke
","Very rarely an artistic come back is so pointed, so truthful and/or so honest. Mickey Rourke is extraordinary here and I can assure you, he'll break your heart. ""It's not over until you (pointing at the audience) tell me its over"" Who was saying that? Mickey Rourke himself or his character? Both, I think both. I felt a chill run down my spine, the kind of chill you feel when confronted by an unvarnished truth. Darren Aronofsky is definitely someone to watch and to follow. His characters face limit situations and he finds torturous paths for them to travel. What makes the whole thing endurable is the unmistakable signs of self awareness. In ""The Wrestler"" the painful meeting between Ram and his daughter (played by Evan Rachel Wood) have the overwhelming weight of the truth without a hint of sentimentality. As we are approaching Oscar season I imagine already a fight to the finish between Sean Penn for ""Milk"" and Mickey Rourke for ""The Wrestler"" They both deserve the highest accolade. What a year!",/review/rw1943205/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2011,MissyH316,8," Well done!!
","As someone who's a fan and who has actually worked behind the scenes in pro wrestling, I can tell you that Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson's story is a very respectful and realistic portrayal of the toll pro wrestling takes on its stars' lives. Certainly not everyone in the biz ends up as destitute and lonely as Randy was - some do, definitely - but those who end up well-off in every sense of the word (like Hulk Hogan, John Cena, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and The Rock, for instance) are VERY, VERY rare. Most end up somewhere in between.",/review/rw1943205/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2008,BandofInsiders,10," A Broken Down Piece of Meat That Doesn't Deserve To Be All Alone
","It's no coincidence that Mickey Rourke is responsible for the comeback performance of the year if not the decade. Rourke's life and tumultuous past parallel Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson's own life so eerily close it becomes clear that no one else could have ever played this role. Darren Aronofsky's fourth feature is not only his most intimate but also his most accomplished to date. Aronofsky offers his most simplistic film both visually and narratively and ends up creating a film that has more depth and layers to it than any of his previous films.",/review/rw1943205/?ref_=tt_urv
2 October 2008,Chris Knipp,8," Charisma, heart, and hard work make a comeback of a has-been
","Billed as Mickey Rourke's big comeback, this film is the finale presentation of the New York Film Festival 2008. Awarded in Venice and shown at Toronto, it features a winning performance by Rourke. It's a simple story, a mixture of raw authenticity and old fashioned corn about a washed up professional wrestler who's 20 years past his prime and resists admitting it till he has a heart attack and is forced t turn to the only two people he has in his life, a lap dancer and an estranged daughter. It's pretty monochromatic and claustrophobic, but the tiny framework shows off Rourke's generous, authoritative performance. Rourke's weathered, soulful face and sweet-sad smile sell the movie.",/review/rw1943205/?ref_=tt_urv
10 December 2008,nonsequitur247,," Mickey Rourke is as great as everyone's saying he is.
","Nicholas Cage? Bruce Willis? Wrong. Never would have worked. No one else could have played Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson with the compassion and energy he brings to the role--it's painful to see the fading professional wrestler coming to terms with both his mortality and the emptiness of his life outside the ring, and this is largely due to Rourke's excellent acting. Twenty years after the defining match of his career, Randy is still a fan favorite and loving his work--until he suffers a heart attack. The film follows the gentle giant as he tries to adjust to living without wrestling, reconnect with his estranged daughter (Evan Rachel Wood), and kindle a bond with a friend who works in a strip club (Marisa Tomei).",/review/rw1943205/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2008,grmagne,9," An excellent drama about an aging wrestler
","The Wrestler won the Golden Lion a few days ago in Venice. Obviously that's going to build up some high expectations but director Darren Aronofsky introduced it as a ""simple little film"" and he didn't want the movie to get over-hyped. He said it's been a busy week as he only finished the film 6 days ago!! ",/review/rw1943205/?ref_=tt_urv
12 December 2008,natasha-bishop,10," Honest to the core!
","I caught an advanced screening of The Wrestler starring Mickey Rourke last night in Hollywood, CA. Following the screening was a Q&A session with Mickey Rourke, Darren Aronofsky, Marisa Tomei, Evan Rachel Wood, and film composer Clint Mansell.",/review/rw1943205/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2009,Smells_Like_Cheese,7," Heartbreaking
","OK, after all the talk, literally, talk after talk of how wonderful Mickey Rourke's performance was in The Wrestler and that he's finally back in action. So I just had to see what all the hype was, especially after everyone started panicking when Sean Penn took the 2009 Oscar for Milk, I was curious if this movie really was as good as everyone was making it to be. So I'm going to give my honest opinion which either is going to get me a lot of hate mail or the ""un-useful"" marks on my comment, but I'm an honest user, I tell it like it is. The Wrestler is actually a really good movie, I would say that it was one of the top 10 that came out of 2008, but one thing that I really didn't like about the movie was the way it was made and the ending, which I'll explain why in a moment. Mickey Rourke does pull in a top performance, including Marisa Tomei, they took us on this heartbreaking story and made the movie into a small gem.",/review/rw1943205/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2009,alexkolokotronis,10," Indicative of Mickey Rourke's Career
","The Wrestler is a very good drama filled with originality. The film follows a fictional character named Randy ""Ram"" Robinson whose a ""has been"" wrestler. His prime far behind him and continues to wrestle hoping to get back in the lime light.",/review/rw1943205/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2009,loco_73,8," Have you ever seen a broken man...
","If the phrase ""the little movie that could"" applies to any movie this year then it most certainly does to ""The Wrestler"". It is one of the best movies I've seen last year, and more than that it is even more special due to the brilliant and amazing performance of its cast.",/review/rw1943205/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2008,Ludypro1,9," Amazing film that focuses on two often misjudged professions.
","Mickey Rourke returns to the big screen in Darren Aronofsky's brilliant character study, The Wrestler. Mickey Rourke gained about 35 pounds of muscle to play Randy 'The Ram' Robinson and looks the part of an old beaten down wrestler. Aronofsky creates a cold atmosphere that leaves the audience feeling as old and depressed as Rourke's character. The Wrestler doesn't have the look or feel of any previous Aronofsky film, it is mainly hand-held and has a gritty look to it that gives it a documentary feel. This film sucked me in. I really felt for the main character. I felt his pain and anger throughout the film. I felt his desperation. When a film has you reflecting the emotions expressed on the screen then it has accomplished something. I also appreciated that the story focused on two professions that are frowned upon in society, that being professional wrestling and stripping. Both professions are linked in the film and has the audience realize how similar they are. We also see the hardship of carrying out such a profession. I really enjoyed this film and had the pleasure of meeting the director after the showing. I was most impressed with him and can't wait till this film gets released.",/review/rw1943205/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2008,dfranzen70,9," Top-notch, exhilarating, jarring, authentic
","In Darren Aronofsky's brilliant character drama The Wrestler, Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Mickey Rourke) is a down-and-almost-out pro wrestler who grapples with his own mortality and a fear of being alone and desperate. Rourke is phenomenal, delivering a powerful, highly physical performance that will knock your socks off as much as if he'd clotheslined you himself. Rourke's Randy is intrepid, a scarred battle cruiser who desperately needs to be in the ring to survive, a man who's emotions are kept as close to the vest as possible, a man with nothing else going for him other than his time in the spotlight.",/review/rw1943205/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2022,Bonitao,7," Wrestling is not as fake as they say
","When I was a kid, I really liked watching WWE, I was in disbelief with the blows, I remember liking Jeff Hardy and Rey Mysterio a lot, having these good memories I started watching this movie with good expectations, hoping that maybe it would be a movie that spoke more behind the scenes or that maybe real fighters would appear.",/review/rw1943205/?ref_=tt_urv
15 October 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10," Darren Aronofsky's best film
","I enjoyed Aronofsky's other work too, but I will always consider this his best film. It is a well made movie, with excellent editing and cinematography. Aronofsky directs superbly, I consider him one of the more promising directors around and The Wrestler doesn't do anything to change my mind. The soundtrack is memorable, the script has some suitably dour moments but also some hopeful ones and jolts at humour- loved the the scene of Robinson's first shift behind a supermarket deli counter- and the story is really quite remarkable and compelling, I couldn't help drawing parallels to Mickey Rourke's own career and life. Rourke himself is just perfect here, he gives the role a lot of humanity which I appreciated. Marisa Tomei's role is a rather obvious one, but she like Rourke portrays it wonderfully regardless. All in all, one of the best of 2008. 10/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw1943205/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2008,jaredmobarak,10," TIFF 08: Sacrificial ramThe Wrestler
","It's a fascinating thought I had going into Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler, screened at the Toronto International Film Festival. I began to worry that a straightforward tale may not be playing to the director's strengths. It wasn't until the end credits that I recalled Requiem For a Dream being an adaptation and his debut π being pretty grounded in reality despite its surrealistic tendencies. So in actuality, the guy had only made one non-straightforward film, and all to immense success, at least in my eyes. So, as of now, the guy is four for four. Not only does Mickey Rourke own the screen every second of the movie, but Aronofsky lends just the right amount of his stamp on the proceedings, creating a definite top ten inclusion for my end of year list and, by far, the best film I had seen at the festival.",/review/rw1943205/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2009,bob the moo,," Not as perfect a film as is being said, but a great character study that subverts the sports genre to be suitably drab and real (which is a compliment)
","After the imagination and creativity shown in The Fountain, The Wrestler initially strikes the viewer as a bit of a disappointment because director Darren Aronofsky appears to have gone to the other extreme of style and has delivered a film that is very much in the real world, with no flights of fancy and no real visual flair to it. However in the same way as The Fountain was about the heart of the central male character, The Wrestler is the same, just with a totally different character struggling with a totally different set of emotions. As a faded wrestler, Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson is living in a trailer park where he can barely keep up the rent, during the week he works a manual job in the stock room of a local supermarket and at weekends he dons his costume and takes part in wrestling events in small and only partially filled leisure centres and halls.",/review/rw1943205/?ref_=tt_urv
23 March 2009,funkyfry,8," good movie
","I really enjoyed this movie, which tells the tale of Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Mickey Rourke), a former big-time pro wrestler fallen on hard times, most of which seem to be the result not of bad luck but bad planning and bad habits. Forced to compete in violent and dangerous stunt matches with other former big-timers and young wannabe wrestlers.",/review/rw1943205/?ref_=tt_urv
14 August 2010,planktonrules,8," Painful to watch...
","This film is, at times, very painful to watch. The wrestling scenes are brutally violent and bloody--with some of the action real and hard to see. Reportedly, the staples and several other body-scarring scenes were real! You can't say that Mickey Rourke wasn't willing to suffer for his art! Plus, when you see the post-match Rourke barely able to move or function, it's hard to watch--and you want to avert your eyes. It's definitely a no holds barred sort of movie.",/review/rw1943205/?ref_=tt_urv
21 November 2008,preda01,10," Powerful Performance by Mickey Rourke
","The authenticity is the hallmark of this movie combined with vivid cinematography and set design. An amazing career-best performance from Mickey Rourke and outstanding work by Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood, the film is very powerful and emotional. Again, an exceptional achievement by a true artist-Rourke. His performance is so penetrating, wise, and authentic that it deserves the Oscar. Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson was the biggest wrestler in the world, back in the 80s. Now it's 2008 and while things have changed, in his head he's stuck back in good old days. He's still wrestling, even though the money and his audiences are long gone. His aging body can no longer take the punishment. Aronofsky really captures the magic in Mickey's performance. It is the true essence of method acting. He is ""The Ram"".",/review/rw1943205/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2009,anhedonia,6," Terrific performances, but the story is pretty formulaic
","There is no denying that Darren Aronofsky's ""The Wrestler features two tremendous performances by Mickey Rourke and Marisa Tomei. But there's also no denying that former The Onion editor Robert Siegel's screenplay is rather conventional, plot-wise. And that does hamper this film.",/review/rw1943205/?ref_=tt_urv
8 September 2008,kurt-haider,10," Wow!!!
","I saw the movie at the world premiere in Venice and Mickey Rourke, Darren Aronofsky and other crew members were also in the audience. When the credits began, people were jumping out of their seats (including me) applauding and cheering for more than 15 minutes. It was really amazing. I have been a Rourke fan for 10 years now and to me Darren Aronofsky is one of the greatest directors of the last ten years. So when I entered the cinema my expectations were as high as never before. But this 40 Euro ticket was worth every cent. I never saw such a moving performance by ""Sir Eddie Cook"" who played Randy ""the Ram"" with such authenticity that I was paralyzed for almost two hours. And that's because Rourke isn't just playing ""Ram"", he IS ""Ram"", at least a part of him (there are many parallels to his real troubled past). Aronofsky really did a great job and really pushed the actors to their limits. It is amazing to see how a good director can turn such a simple story into one of the greatest movies I have ever seen (and I watch hundreds of movies). So everybody who grew up in the 80's with wrestling, hard rock and Nintendo or just loves movies should see this - at least ten times. God bless you Darren, Mickey and all the other crew members for the best cinema experience I have ever had. no doubt about it.",/review/rw1943205/?ref_=tt_urv
