9 December 2013,Kicino,9," Masterpiece in sex research/education based on real life pioneers
","I started to watch it out of curiosity but it turned out to be way over my expectation: it is educational and eye-opening, but also reflecting and entertaining on a subject we are all intrigued with: sex - and its relation with love, marriage, family and work in a scientific way. What makes this series fascinating is that it is based on a true story which makes me respect the real characters even more.",/review/rw2984271/?ref_=tt_urv
1 January 2018,SnoopyStyle,8," great acting and intriguing subject

Eventually, she joins him as his partner in groundbreaking sex research.",/review/rw2984271/?ref_=tt_urv
5 January 2020,AngelHonesty,6," Not That Great
","The show started out really good, but by the second season it lost its allure. If the show would have continued to focus on the research of sex it would have been good, but instead the focus of the show shifted to the personal lives of the main characters making the show exhausting to watch.",/review/rw2984271/?ref_=tt_urv
26 September 2013,andi_cristian,," Great
","While Masters of Sex might not be a great show as yet, viewed strictly in terms of giving consumers something worth paying it's the equivalent of a master class in pay-TV development :) There's a lot of humor here, but it's more innocent than leering. And there's also a great deal of understandable awkwardness that seems as pertinent to 2013 to the '50s. It's an absorbing, beautifully acted story about science, emerging feminism and American culture. But it's also a gamble on the idea that great TV drama can involve stakes that are not sharpened to pointy tips. It was comforting to see that Masters of Sex has depth of vision and plenty of dramatic material to delve into without taking the easy way out with a nipple and a romp every 10 minutes :)",/review/rw2984271/?ref_=tt_urv

11 October 2013,sitanshugreat,9," So Far So Good
","Afer finishing up with Breaking Bad, I switched to Master of Sex. Because it was something different, something that has caught my imagination. I have seen two episodes so far, and I'm impressed. The series has an interesting premise and it definitely looks great on the television.",/review/rw2984271/?ref_=tt_urv
17 January 2017,realtvhrdbfq-1,7," Too Many Unnecessary Distractions
","Masters of Sex was one of rare TV shows that had a refreshing approach towards human sexuality. I can even argue that it was somewhat educational even if we assume that it merely pushed people to read the books of Masters & Johnson. It did more than that but gradually the refreshing approach was bogged down by so many irrelevant, uninteresting, outright abysmal side characters and their awful story arcs.",/review/rw2984271/?ref_=tt_urv
27 September 2013,emmanuel-mg-87,8," 8 over 10
","There's not much to review to this series, the background story its not new but very interesting, kind of unknown and accurate about the research of sexology by the gynecologist William Howell Masters, i have the chance to read 1 of his books long time ago in the school ""Human Sexual Response"" its good to learn about his work in this very different and entertaining way.

29 September 2015,maria-ricci-1983,6," Promising 1st season, Poorer 2nd, Disastrous 3rd... Ouch, ground zero!
","Everything interesting was shown and said in the first season, which was quite innovative, rich and well-paced. The gist of the series was the ground-breaking research of Masters and Johnson, how both characters met, started their collaboration, and the vast array of difficulties which frayed their work in an evoking and well-recreated American social setting.",/review/rw2984271/?ref_=tt_urv
17 October 2013,kumar-pratik,8," Sheen takes it to a whole new level
","Masters of Sex is unique in the way it begins to grow on you even though you never thought it would. And, it is typified by none other than the lead character, Masters. ",/review/rw2984271/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2021,ashleybmed,9," Informative, entertaining, and deep
","The show focuses on sex researchers Dr. William ""Bill"" Masters and Virginia ""Gini"" Johnson. While much of it is fictionalized, it does have some facts about their lives and the research. The show tries to remain true to the time it takes place. There are some episodes and storylines that are counterproductive to what is at the heart of the show, but it doesn't change how great it truly ends. Additionally, the show stays true to its mission by the fourth (and, sadly, final) season. To the end, it remains to be about the study of sex and the psychology of sex and relationships. Definitely an amazing show!",/review/rw2984271/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2013,nish-h-reddy,9," Best show of 2013
","The title ""Masters of Sex"" works on many levels and the creators of the show are well aware of the attention that this title will draw. This show is about the first scientific research in the area of sex based on the Masters and Johnson studies, who are the protagonists of the story set to the backdrop of the late 1950's at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. The set design is just about right and it very accurately represents the theme and ideology of the time. The characters are sketched out perfectly and there is no dearth of good acting performances with Michael Sheen stealing the show for his portrayal of the incredibly complex William Masters. The main part of the show is of course the study of human sexual response which implies a lot of mature content. These scenes, however tastefully done, may be a little too strong for the average viewer but if one can get over the explicit content, one can see their relevance to the plot. The story still seems a little empty at certain times but can be expected to fill up as it progresses with the introduction of new characters. All in all, a very well presented and unique show.",/review/rw2984271/?ref_=tt_urv

1 August 2016,ferdinand1932,5," Douglas Sirk's shadow
","The first season has a solid trajectory and the combination of characters, the circumstances and the recreations of 1950s are all intriguing with that added element of truth. Apparently. Sure, there are compromises to tell a story but even Primo Levi did that with his memoir of Auschwitz. The curious relationship of Masters and Johnson and their quest, her maverick confidence as much as anything, are quite attractive. ",/review/rw2984271/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2020,swordsnare,8," No Renewal for a Fifth Season.
","It was a shame they didn't renew for a fifth season as the left many unresolved issues by Season 4 finale. I enjoyed this series for the most part, but the main criticism would be that the pacing was little off at times. Some episodes would be a slow-burn, as some would say and yet whole years would pass in-between episodes without any context.",/review/rw2984271/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2014,bjarias,8," .. three seasons and gets better each one... keep it going...
","M&J truly achieved what they set out to do... as there are not many couples having the societal impact these two individuals implanted on the world. This production is not a documentary, and doesn't pretend to be, as a result lots of the interactive dramas played out on screen are what Hollywood might dream up.. but overall it is exceptionally good entertainment. Now deep into its' third season and it just keeps getting better. It's infidelity on steroids.. everyone is going different ways.. where it winds up bet ya the writers don't even know right now. And that's a great accomplishment, and a credit to all involved... with some very impressive writing and outstanding acting performances to match.. Lizzy Caplan is dazzling (this series has made her a bona-fide star). We all know where the real life story goes (just look it up on wiki), but this version could wind up anywhere.. and still appears it's going to remain continually enticing and impressive irregardless. Not many shows get an 8+ rating.. this one well deserves it !!",/review/rw2984271/?ref_=tt_urv
8 May 2015,whatithinkis,1," Not masters of film-making that's for sure
","Once I understood that the actual storyline was not factual I could no longer overlook my nausea at the images of Mrs. Johnson's sexual interaction with the totally disgusting Dr. Masters. The whole thing from that point on began to seem pointless. His marriage in reality was, in fact, different from what was portrayed in the series. They had children . . . so what was the point? As fiction, this seemed simply silly meandering. I stopped after fast-forwarding through much of the second half of the season (1). Michael Sheen did too good a job of being a horridly little hypocrite and Lizzy Caplan too good a job of being a capable, smart woman for the coming together of the two to be anything but disgusting.

6 January 2014,brian_dines,4," Not up to par
","I'm not sure where the train went off the tracks with this show. The cast is potentially great and there's certainly enough material there to work with, but Masters falls short of what it could and should have been.",/review/rw2984271/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2015,hjames-97822,1," Dreadful and Dragging
","What they have spent nearly 24 hours on so far could have easily been done in 6. Preachy, dull, dragging and clinical with some side sex and so called characters thrown in like extender in cheap hamburger. Most of the so called sex scenes are reasonably tasteful but in the end repetitive and tiresome for the most part.",/review/rw2984271/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2013,annstuckey,10," Brilliance Abounds
","What a relief! A breath of fresh air, such a welcome televisual event after the utter toot that generally circulates at the moment. The five episodes skittered by, delivering substance, great acting, and characters who tugged at the brain chords. Meaning that you think about the program long after the credits. I missed the 'live' screenings and so opted for 4OD, and watched all episodes back to back. The final scene of episode five when Dr Masters finally gives way to emotion and cracks whilst holding Ginnie's hand... well, I'd swap you that for all five million trashy episodes of X Factor that's for sure!

22 March 2014,halhcb808,10," No Shortcomings to this Series
","I don't see what can be found wrong with this series, which is why I gave it a 10. I have to admit when I really like a show, I do fall in love with it. As far as I can see, the acting is great, the writing is great, the characters are great, and the time period is very realistically portrayed. This is the 1950's. It is a very conservative America. Not as much in the political sense as in the cultural sense. This was before all hell broke loose in 1964-65. The Civil Rights Movement was taking place and gaining ground in the South, but this is white upper class America we are seeing. A white hospital with white doctors and white secretaries. Because that is the way it was then.",/review/rw2984271/?ref_=tt_urv
