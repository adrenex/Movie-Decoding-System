7 April 2020,gbill-74877,8," The vicious cycle
","This film immerses us into the world of lower-class people in Florida who ironically are staying in a cheap hotel next to of Disneyworld, where a set of four magic band bracelet tickets goes for $1600. There are excellent performances all around, especially from Brooklynn Prince, who plays a tough, mouthy, and yet sweet little girl with an arresting honesty. The character is just six but in many ways seems older, growing up too quickly while left mostly on her own to roam around with her friends.",/review/rw4060519/?ref_=tt_urv

",A lady once told me in Orlando. Good ole Uncle Walt. He bought a piece of swamp in Florida and turned it into a tourist magnet. He must have done a deal with the devil as well. Disney World is the only bit round here that has never been directly hit by a hurricane.,/review/rw4060519/?ref_=tt_urv
18 October 2017,ferguson-6,8," More Baker brilliance
","Greetings again from the darkness. ""The Happiest Place on Earth"" has long been a Disney catchphrase. The irony for those living on the road to Disney World is the focus of the latest from ground-breaking filmmaker Sean Baker. Mr. Baker was the creative force behind the remarkable TANGERINE (shot entirely with iphones) a couple of years ago, and his most recent film solidifies his brilliance at bringing us the fringes of society â€“ those we don't typically see on screen. Beyond that, these are the folks many of us pay little attention to in real life.",/review/rw4060519/?ref_=tt_urv

24 March 2018,bob the moo,," Slow but engaging
","Many years ago I remember being in a shop where a rough-as-stones mother was there with a 5 or 6 year old girl who was so well spoken and friendly that I barely believed they were together. A bit snobbish of me, but at the time I felt for the child as I assumed her path was more or less chosen for her. Life is not as simple as that, and it wasn't fair of me to judge, but it is a memory recovered while watching this film. The Florida Project takes us into a motel mostly housed by those down on their luck (to say the least). We go there via the perspective of the child Moonee, who mostly runs around with other children while her mother Halley smokes and lies around. Money comes from stripping when she can, but mostly from selling knock-offs to tourists. For Moonee though, it is a world of wonder and color.",/review/rw4060519/?ref_=tt_urv
2 April 2018,lee_eisenberg,9," I bet that this happens a lot across the US
","I had heard a lot about ""The Florida Project"" before seeing it, so I wanted to see it for myself. Probably the main thing that a person should take from it is that throughout the US there are people struggling, even in the shadow of major attractions (in this case Disneyworld). While the adults try to make ends meet, the children often run around unsupervised, occasionally doing dangerous things.",/review/rw4060519/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2017,statuskuo,8," Under The Shadow Of Disney
","It's only fitting that in the shadow of the corporate mouse...a society of people who live on the fringe would exist. In Florida (specifically Orlando) the desperate existence thrives on people who go off the beaten path...and actually get lost. That is where Halley (newcomer Bria Vinaite) and her daughter Moonee (played by another newcomer Brooklynn Prince) exist. Halley...seems to be a club kid who got knocked up by a man who shortly abandoned her. In some tribal/white trash code of religion, it seems she thought having a child would make her grow up. Not quite. Because the princesses' castle is within reach, it's still a world away. And that is heartbreaking. Imagine being a person unable to grow up (like what Disney promotes). Those dreams withered and died, but the worst residual effects remained. Which is the Magic Castle. A hovel of a (what one unsuspecting tourist calls a ""gypsy project"") dump managed by Bobby, played wonderfully sympathetic character Willem Dafoe. Bobby patiently overlooks the ship of fools and sometimes, babysits, though by default. Most who live there have feral children who explore the grounds and beyond out of boredom. The residents here are...they are who you think should live there. Look, this film is about character. There is zero plot, so don't go looking for a story. The reality of the people who live here are brutal. Like...on edge scary where you're not entirely sure you want anyone to exist here. But they do. Moonee is a lovely little girl caught up in an adult world she doesn't fully comprehend, but is forced to deal with. Halley is obviously a broken toy herself. And in a very quiet effective scene, we see glimpses of Halley coming to terms with what the world requires of her as parent (""pepperoni costs money"").",/review/rw4060519/?ref_=tt_urv

","My wife and I watched this movie at home on DVD from our public library.

","Boy, did I hear some great things about this from film festivals and from critics I follow on social media. Trailer didn't blow me away but I knew there had to be something special about this film. I haven't seen Sean Baker's previous effort, Tangerine, so I didn't really have a barometer for what to expect. I can safely say the film works so well. It's incredibly well acted, and utilizes a charming and emotional script to convey an experience you won't soon forget.",/review/rw4060519/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2017,latinfineart,9," A brilliant character study, that blends a powerful story with great humor
","I really liked this film, as unorthodox as it was. The first hour was uproariously funny, before becoming a deep, and poignant study of the millions of lives of Americans who are living on the fringes of society, just barely surviving day to day. There is a shocking lack of cinema devoted to this underclass, and seeing this small film, was refreshing, enlightening, and surprising, and a refreshing contrast to the plutocracy we see all around us today.

16 June 2020,AlsExGal,6," Indie slice-of-life drama
","Set in Orlando, Florida, the story follows single mother Halley (Bria Vinaite) and her young daughter Moonee (Brooklynn KImberly Prince) as they struggle to survive. They live week-to-week in a tacky tourist hotel gone to seed managed by the compassionate Bobby (Willem Dafoe), who tries to help the various misfits and rejects that occupy the place. Things are looking bad for Halley, though, as she's lost her stripper job and her options are looking more and more limited, while the often-unsupervised Moonee gets into all sorts of trouble.",/review/rw4060519/?ref_=tt_urv
14 May 2018,blbl9093,9," A Floridian's take on The Florida Project.
","This is my first Sean Baker film and I was impressed with the realism that he projects. I live in the Orlando area and easily recognize a lot of the buildings. So many before me posted a synopsis of the movie, so I won't bore you with that - just a few thoughts from an area local. If you have Amazon Prime you can watch this for free and I highly recommend that you set aside a couple of hours to do that.
We watched it this weekend and were blown away by the genuine authenticity of the area surrounding Disney World that most ""tourists"" will never see. There is a lot of poverty in and around Disney and Orlando and a lot of people who live in these older motels that were once the main tourist hotels before Disney started isolating their guests by building Disney only hotels on property. What's so sad is that because they are hotels, the families that live there are technically considered homeless. Even worse, I have actually known families here just like this. While watching, I was wondering if they would address the problem of pedophilia and I'm glad that they didn't omit this from the movie, because it is a growing problem. In case you don't know, there are A LOT of pedophiles in Florida (not sorry tourism industry).
I really liked the way that Mr. Baker addressed the irony of the fact that Moonee and her mom were in such a struggle for sheer survival that, although they lived in the shadow of Disney World, they couldn't afford to go and enjoy it as so many can. Yet, Moonee didn't seem to mind - she never really seemed to ""feel"" poor.
It was cool to see all of the authenticity in this movie, from the Tastee Freeze building to the tourist helicopters. And the story itself was so well written and acted that you almost forget that it is just a movie.
And the ending? We're still analyzing the symbolism in the ending. Enjoy!",/review/rw4060519/?ref_=tt_urv

","Beautifully humane film that at times recalls Italian Neo-Realism, at other times the child-based films that are so popular in Iran.

",I had the privilege to catch an early viewing of this film along with a Q&A with writer/director/editor Sean Baker. Many know him from his breakout hit Tangerine (2015); I was sucked into his world since the release of Starlet (2012). Something that he never ceases to portray is the messed up realism that is hidden within our world and the Florida Project capture this in the most purest and colorful of ways.,/review/rw4060519/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2020,aidanratesmovies,8," A Unique and Important View of Poverty, with Some Good Performances Throughout
","A important look into the poor side of America, The Florida Project often uniquely conveys its emotions on poverty and growing up in it, though doesn't quite match the development of issues that it hopes to achieve. The film is quite lacking in plot, and at times can be a bit frustrating, but also provides a realistic view into the world Baker is trying to bring to life. The film can be a bit dull, as in result of the little plot, and it's these moments that I feel are the films biggest problem, especially when they had some much time to delve into deeper issues the film is withholding within. The acting is quite impressive, with Willem Dafoe, Bria Vinaite, and Brooklynn Prince being the obvious standouts. The cinematography provides a very amateur, but very moving view of the atmosphere it tries to convey, and does it quite well, and is perhaps my favorite thing about the film. In the end, The Florida Project can be a bit dull at time, but its an impressive work of cinema, that is certainly unique, and certainly an important experience that shows what it is truly like to live the lives of all those involved.

","A.K.A. Harmony Korine's SMALL CHANGE(?) Or a slice of Italian neo-realism if nearly everyone was unsympathetic. Or maybe a continuation of what Arnold was doing with American HONEY, a look at those who are white and poor and with nothing better to do than be walking, screaming examples of, frankly, why abortion should remain not simply legal but readily available if needed. Baker never passes judgment for a nano-second on anyone here - he probably realizes his audience may do that for themselves - and it creates a disturbing and yet extremely lively cinematic experience.",/review/rw4060519/?ref_=tt_urv

","I had been looking forward to seeing this new film directed by Sean Baker ever since reading the rave reviews for it that came out of Cannes and Toronto. While I can say that this film is beautifully filmed and features strong acting, it doesn't quite hit the mark.

14 September 2017,trublu215,5," DaFoe is utterly brilliant but the film leaves much to be desired.
","The Florida Project is the third feature film from writer-director Sean Baker and, while being an improvement over Tangerine and Starlet, The Florida Project is still missing the heart it needs to be an everlasting and impactful film. From his cinematic conception, Baker has had a knack for showing very dingy lifestyles bursting with a color palate that would make George Miller weep. But underneath the colorful array that he includes is a superficial mess of a film. One that thinks it is smarter and more heartfelt than it really is. ",/review/rw4060519/?ref_=tt_urv
