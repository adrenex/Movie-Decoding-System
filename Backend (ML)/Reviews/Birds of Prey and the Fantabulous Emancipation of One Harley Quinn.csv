5 November 2021,boblipton,10," Very Funny
","Sometimes, when you can't get the right woman, a man can do the job. While people complained with logic that there were no women directors, and no feminist movies,Paul Feig went along directing hilarious feminist tracts like this one.",/review/rw7520616/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2019,Flaviaj1991,9," What is the problem with all these 1 star reviews?
","You look at the reviews and they all give only 1 star. What the heck. In a movie that clearly never takes itself seriously, why are people taking it so seriously? I honestly loved this movie, and no, I'm not a teenager. It's a spy satire with great action scenes and a good rhythm. There were so many memorable moments in this movie for me, like Susan Cooper killing the guy unintentionally, Ford showing up in Cooper's hotel and bragging about all absurd things he's ever done, every scene that Ford appears, the airplane scene. And the Cooper's fight with the woman in the kitchen was totally badass.",/review/rw7520616/?ref_=tt_urv

11 July 2015,kosmasp,9," I guess we got a lot of paid reviews here
","That's according to one other reviewer who states that anyone who loves film would not rate this higher than one star. And while our taste in movies is different and comedy is something that will be viewed differently by anyone watching, I think it's a big mistake calling out people and suggesting things like that.",/review/rw7520616/?ref_=tt_urv

27 December 2017,cliftonofun,7," Familiar premise, fantastic execution
","This is hardly the first or last spy parody movie. Some nail it (Johnny English), and some miss badly (the Austin Powers sequels). This one was just plain perfect. There's nothing original, but every cast member - McCarthy especially - nails every part. Comedies like this work best with real characters and unreal plots. Paul Feig clearly gets that. I laughed. A lot.",/review/rw7520616/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2017,vsd324,8," A comedic American version of a James Bond movie.
","Spy is an action comedy starring the versatile and hilarious actress Melissa McCarthy. This movie is an American version of a James Bond movie, with added humor—but not in the manner of movies like Johnny English (2003) or Mordecai (2015). It's not a parody. The movie has a rather serious and complex plot complete with red herrings and twists. I wouldn't say it's completely realistic, but it's just enough to make it very funny without being too outlandish. It reminds me of one of my all time favorite action comedies ""True Lies"" (1994), where in both films unlikely people are thrust into CIA missions. Susan Cooper (McCartney) is a CIA agent who works as a guide for Bradley Fine (Jude Law). While Fine is doing field work, he is equipped with cameras. Cooper watches these cameras and alerts Fine of oncoming danger. During a mission to stop the transferring of a nuclear bomb, the cameras begin to malfunction, Cooper's images become unclear, and Fine is shot. The CIA chooses to put Cooper on the field to continue Fine's mission. Cooper has been at her desk her entire career, however Cooper is considered a CIA agent and therefore is considered qualified to take on the mission, although she is seemingly far from fit for the job in many ways. Being that Cooper has always worked at a desk, she is completely unknown to the enemies and can thus work well undercover. Having worked with Fine all these years, and having deeper feelings for Fine than even he knew, Cooper feels it is her duty to avenge Fine's death. She sets off to Europe jumping from one crazy circumstance to another. She quickly become more than meets the eye as her quick wit and even physical abilities are unleashed. This is a great comedy filled with witty banter, British satire, slapstick comedy and even some raunchy humor. Stay for the credits—even they're funny.",/review/rw7520616/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2017,matahari20-1,8," Light hearted action comedy
","I enjoyed this for some stress-relief. Yes, it is very vulgar quite often. But I adore Miranda Hart, Jude Law is some suave damn eye-candy, Melissa is funny as always and it was nice seeing her take on an action role. Stratham must have needed something as light relief from his usual British crime seriousness; he does idiot well, it turns out. And Rose Byrne was an adorable, lethal, spoilt brat.

12 June 2015,lnvicta,8," James Bond, Jane Bond, and Jason Statham - a lethal combo for laughter
","Kingsman: The Secret Service started a beautiful new wave of James Bond satire films. It's been done before but never quite as meta as it was in Kingsman, actively referencing how similar the plot and archetypes are to James Bond while still having a refreshing novelty factor and interesting characters of its own - creating this whole new world for the over-the-top James Bond-esque adventures to take place while the real James Bond canon continues its serious, grounded story arc.

23 August 2016,planktonrules,7," Better than I expected!
","I ever had any intention of watching this film but decided to after my oldest daughter convinced me to give it a try. After all, Melissa McCarthy has made a few films that just irritated me and I was not in the mood for more of the same. Fortunately, while the film is far from perfect, it surprised me and McCarthy didn't play just another buffoon.",/review/rw7520616/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2017,andrewjmarr,9," Verey funny spoof
","I loved this film. I didn't have high hopes when I chose it on Netflix but laughed more than I have done for ages. It's not Citizen Kane, OK, but it has more laughs. It is sweary, and a bit crude but it all works. Statham is superb, sending himself up and I even liked Jude Law. Miranda Hart does her usual thing, but again it works. My partner told me to say how nice it was to see an older, none thin women, in a leading role!",/review/rw7520616/?ref_=tt_urv
24 April 2017,davispittman,9," Hilarious McCarthy action comedy
","Melissa McCarthy and Paul Feig do it again! I swear when you get this director and this hilarious comedic actress together you just can't fail. The writing is really what makes this movie! When you compare the hilarious comedic script with such great actors that can deliver the lines well you just can't make a bad movie. Melissa is of course the perfect actress to play such a hilarious and many times endearing role, who can also be a pretty big badass when she needs to be. And one really important ingredient to this movies comedy is Miranda Hart, there wasn't a single scene where she was speaking that I wasn't doubled over laughing, she plays a very lovable best friend character to Melissa McCarthy. Jude Law and Jason Statham are also here playing side characters, and they're good in their roles, it's a very different role for Statham, he's never really done comedy, it's usually all hardcore action for him, but I thought he did pretty well even though he wasn't in his comfort zone. Rose Byrne is here, and I loved her comedic side shown in both neighbors and bridesmaid, she really is a very hilarious actress, and there's further proof of that statement here in Spy. The action is pretty good even though that's not what I watched it for. All in all, if you're expecting a well made hilarious Melissa McCarthy action comedy movie, then that's exactly what you're going to get. 9/10 for Spy.",/review/rw7520616/?ref_=tt_urv

","Wasn't sure about this film at first as I am not a big of Melissa McCarthy but glad I watched it! Haven't laughed so much watching comedy compared to this one. Melissa is a good actor and rather funny too. Jason Statham, Jude Law and Rose Byrne being in it was also an added bonus! ",/review/rw7520616/?ref_=tt_urv

12 November 2017,rebeccalucy,6," Good fun!
","Was a decent parody of typical spy films and has a few laughs. Jason Statham was definitely my favourite part, often making fun of characters he has played before. This genuinely made me laugh quite a few times.",/review/rw7520616/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2022,benjaminwest-242,8," A fun action-comedy
","Spy is a very entertaining film, albeit having some notable flaws. The highlight of the picture is undoubtedly its comedy. A few jokes do miss, although never completely. There is truly not a minute that passes without some sort of effective humor. The dialogue is simply brilliant, in addition to many funny moments of situational comedy. Leading this hilarity is McCarthy's fantastic lead performance, aided by a solid premise. The idea of the desk agent going to the field may be a sort of cliché, but the character is written so well that it is irrelevant. There is a great depth given to the role all throughout that transcends the comedy, allowing her arc to feel entirely complete and earned. Where the character is left at the film's close is quite satisfactory, then. Still, McCarthy's amazingly funny nature drives the role through the distinct aura she brings to any role. In support, both Law and Statham are great additions. Their portrayals of CIA agents are a blast to watch, each receiving a satisfactory close to the story. Byrne is very good, as well, making for a compelling and genuine antagonist. Every other minor character works nicely into either the comedy or plot. Hart's act is particularly enjoyable. Janney's deputy director role feels a bit out of place, but even has a couple good moments. Where the plot takes each character is satisfying, and even with a multitude of roles, the writers handled their individual presences largely well. Every motivation feels real, too. This being said, the story becomes mixed as a notable amount of impossible moments occur in addition to scenes that have the plot blatantly moving itself forward. The story is therefore less than seamless despite its continual intrigue and solid handling of its characters. On the technical side, the action is what should be expected of a comedy. There is an awesome mix of hilarity inside the average fight scenes, which makes them entertaining overall. The CGI is bad and the editing is too quick, but the choreography and situations are creative enough. Ultimately, Spy is a good watch for any fan of the comedy or spy movie genre.",/review/rw7520616/?ref_=tt_urv

It's been so long I never laugh till my stomach hurts. This movie is so much better than The Heat. All the characters here are funny, even the supporting characters.

12 January 2017,elenaphysics,9," Really funny
","After reading all those bad reviews , I decided to write my own review. The movie was excellent. It was really fun to watch, it made me laugh. It was the best spy comedy I have ever watched. The movie had a plot,it moved on fast, Melissa MC carthy was acting as she should. Nothing like her awful acting in the Heat. Jason Statham was really good at his role as a disastrous spy. I also liked the fact that the movie switched places fast, traveling through the beauty of European cities. it was very enjoyable. The reason I give 9/10 and not 10/10 , were 2 gruesome killings which could have been avoided. I mean ,they could have died without so much splatter. That would make the movie suitable for younger audience. But in general , the movie has an interesting plot, a great cast, a beautiful cinematography, I totally recommend it.",/review/rw7520616/?ref_=tt_urv
10 March 2019,rooprect,," Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant on crack. I'll explain in my review...
","In the late 1930s through early 1940s ('38-'40 to be precise), there was a barrage of slick comedies characterized by witty, cheeky, rapid-fire dialogues between characters without so much as a breath between jokes, let alone hold for audience reaction. To me, the pinnacle of this achievement was the pairing of Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant, both fast-talking sultans of sarcasm, in films like ""Bringing Up Baby"", ""Holiday"" and ""The Philadelphia Story"". Here, nearly a century later, we revisit that style but ramped up on crack, to the point where, after seeing the movie, I had to google the script to see what I missed while laughing my arse off--and laughing it off all over again.",/review/rw7520616/?ref_=tt_urv
