3 June 2022,FeastMode,3," Ugh
","This movie starts off so slow, taking forever before anything interesting or intriguing happens. Then when it finally does, we get our first dose of many idiotic decisions that make it difficult to care for the character. We see more annoying tropes and very little payoff in this slog of a movie. (1 viewing, opening Thursday 6/2/2022)",/review/rw8298960/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2022,drownsoda90,7," Nervy take on a well-worn concept
","""Watcher"" follows Julia, an American who moves to Bucharest with her husband, Francis. While Francis is fluent in the language--his mother is Romanian--Julia is not, and struggles with the language barrier. Even worse, she also finds herself being watched by a man in the adjacent apartment building, and comes to believe that not only is he stalking her, but that he is a serial killer.",/review/rw8298960/?ref_=tt_urv

","What would you do, some blokes looking out at you, in a place that you've just moved, leaves you a bit more than bemused, seems to follow you around, when you're wandering in town, you're keen not to lose your head, though it's making you see red.",/review/rw8298960/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2022,JoBloTheMovieCritic,5," Watcher
","5/10 - if you are able to enjoy a slow (and I mean slowwwww) burn then Watcher may be for you; otherwise, you may find yourself straining to not be bored for the 90 minute run time (all for a conclusion that isn't enough of a payoff to make it all worthwhile)",/review/rw8298960/?ref_=tt_urv

3 September 2022,arungeorge13,7," Neat little thriller that borrows from Hitchcock's works! [+67%]
","Having enjoyed Chloe Okuno's segment in V/H/S 94 to some extent, I was exciting for her feature debut. Watcher is a film that reminds you of some of Hitchcock's works, be it in building a slow-burn suspense drama set in a mysteriously new atmosphere and in the way the lead character is established. Chloe also extracts an excellent performance from Maika Monroe who portrays the ""fish out of water"" protagonist. The best thing about her portrayal is that she manages to induce the same levels of anxiety in audiences too. She effortlessly makes you step into her shoes - the confusion she feels by not fully grasping the local language, that feeling of loneliness when you're in a new place spending days mostly by yourself, the burgeoning dread of having a stalker - all conveyed remarkably well.",/review/rw8298960/?ref_=tt_urv
5 June 2022,sgriff22555,9," Excellent old school thriller
","My mind is kind of boggled at the people calling this film slow or saying that it's not scary. Sure this film isn't supernatural horror but as far as real life situations go this one is pretty terrifying. I also did not find this film slow at all. It expertly builds the tension (and your anxiety) and successfully puts you in the mindset of the main character. She spends her days completely alone in a new country and doesn't speak the language. Watching this you can feel her loneliness, isolation, and downward spiral that leaves us questioning what's real and what isn't. This film is also stylish and has a very traditional Hitchcock feel to it that makes it all the better. This is all complemented by incredible performances all around leading to an extremely effective psychological thriller.",/review/rw8298960/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2022,radhrh,6," They don't have curtains in Romania?
","Above average thriller about people looking out of windows. I wonder where I've seen that before? Of course the entire premise would fail if they'd only buy some curtains like normal people but they don't. Maika Monroe plays the damsel in distress but her character is a bit of a misery guts and spends most of the movie scowling, sulking or frowning. Burn Gorman is perfectly creepy. The movie itself is low key and by the numbers as if it was written and directed according to a check list but it's effective for all that. There's quite a lot of Romanian language so if you watch without subtitles you miss some dialogue but I'm not sure if you miss anything important.",/review/rw8298960/?ref_=tt_urv
6 June 2022,nicolasroop,7," Modernized Hitchcock done right
","This was a fantastic paranoia thriller. Maika Moore is fantastic as the lead actress and the villian was also perfectly cast, he was quite menacing. The story here is very well done, albeit derivitive and at times you must suspend some levels of your disbelief, but it provides just enough twists and turns throughout to keep it from getting stale. With that said, the movie can also be kind of slow in parts, but I feel like it was a slow burn done right. Hitchcock would be proud of this film. The ending does it right, however I would've enjoyed an extra five minutes just to know what ended up with these characters, but I think I got the jist of it, so I digress. If you're looking for a good paranoia horror/thriller, this would be a great choice and you could definitely do worse. I recommend to people who enjoy a go slow burn that leads up to creepy conclusion. 3.5 creepy creepertons out of.",/review/rw8298960/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2022,ontheis,8," An above average suspense slow burner
","This movie doesn't want you to get your hopes too high - it is what it is, a nice thriller/horror that is a bit slow, but not boring. Has that style of old Dario Argento movies, which I love. It is better than most of new films, and has that old school suspense style, which is refreshing in the sea of new movies that are trying too hard to let you know they are ""smart"".",/review/rw8298960/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2022,Neptune165,6," I loved this movie! The fact that you can step into her shoes, especially not understanding the language is brilliant in my opinion
","I don't know if this film just resonated with me differently but I found this film really, really terrifying. I didn't find the movie slow at all, I felt like it expertly built the tension and I could feel my anxiety building throughout. There wasn't a moment in it I was bored and I was very invested in the story. Completely agree it is very Hitchcock and simple and serious in its execution. You could also really feel her isolation and loneliness which contributed to the anxiety and ""chilled"" feeling I got while watching it (if that makes sense). I saw it in the theater and really loved it. One of the best horror films in recent memory for me. Most of the time, I watched your reviews first before watching the movie, so I was very intrigued by this film. I also gave it 7/10 because I felt this movie is missing something remarkable in order to give it a perfect score. I love Jules' character. She tries to survive to that sociopath by her own which is admirable because she was alone. I hate her husband, so selfish thinking about himself and his work. He didn't care about his wife at all pretending she was imaging everything. The watcher obviously is frustrated with his life. He has to take care about his old father which is something that bothers him a lot. It took me by surprise the end because I was 100% sure Jules would not make it, however, there is a clue when she is crawling on the floor she sees the drawer where Irina's gun is kept.",/review/rw8298960/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,8," An amazing B-film from a newb filmmaker.
","I'm amazed that newb filmmaker Chloe Okuno - making her first full length feature film debut (with a few prior short films) as writer and director, created this near perfect little gem. Aside from needing to better direct some of her cast, her camera work and non-stop tension filled story could put some seasoned filmmakers to shame from what they've put out lately. This wasn't Hollywood-ish, and that's fine by me, but still managed to hold your attention, create enough suspense, and throw in some clever red herrings and twists, that only big Hollywood productions can create. Sure it could've had some more action and energy, but it was just right at 91 mins with the spot-on pacing. The cinematography was perfection as was the score. This genre has been filled up for some time, and although somewhat predicable and typical, it was just done right, as best as any pro could create with what they have. Okuno is certainly a filmmaker to keep an eye out for. I applaud her for this amazing little gem we all thoroughly enjoyed. A well deserved 8/10 from me.",/review/rw8298960/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2022,wisemanfromtowne,2," An hour and a half of absolute nothingness.
","This film is so slow that you could start it, go shopping at Walmart, come back 45 mins later and still not miss anything from the story, I kid you not. It finally becomes literally watchable in the last 15 mins....smdh. A story that could've been told in 30 mins was boringly stretched out to pay homage (in my opinion) to Romania. An hour and a half of absolute nothingness.....unreal.",/review/rw8298960/?ref_=tt_urv
28 June 2022,haskel-72951,3," Critics loved THIS???
","Starts well, then descends into a slow moving exercise in generic thriller tropes. A Lifetime movie in all but name, there is absolutely nothing here you haven't seen many times before. As predictable as the contents of a fast food bag with none of the flavor.",/review/rw8298960/?ref_=tt_urv
2 June 2022,ferguson-6,7," cat and mouse
","Greetings again from the darkness. It's tough being the new kid. Moving to a new city with no friends is always a challenge. That's especially true for a grown-up when the new city is in a country where you don't speak the language - and you gave up your career to support your spouse who got a promotion to his home country. The first feature film from writer-director Chloe Okuno and co-writer Zack Ford is a bit of a throwback thriller that reminded me of some of Brian DePalma's work in the 1970's and 1980's, while also recalling other genre films.",/review/rw8298960/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2022,MovieCriticOnline,1," Too many problems..
","This was just poorly written. So everything you wouldn't do, the writer makes the characters do, just to force an action. When she first spots the watcher she doesn't tell her husband. And when she finally tells him we get the old he doesn't believe her.",/review/rw8298960/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2022,spiritgrave,6," A tense, slow burn
","I found this thriller pretty enjoyable. The acting was phenomenal, particulacy from Maika, our lead. Some of these sequences were so anxiety-inducing, even when our lead is just walking down the street I couldn't help but tense up.",/review/rw8298960/?ref_=tt_urv
3 June 2022,benjaminskylerhill,9," Not flashy. Purely, and compellingly, psychological.
","By merit of concept alone, there really isn't anything new here. It's the writing and character work that causes Watcher to soar above standard thriller genre fare.",/review/rw8298960/?ref_=tt_urv
21 June 2022,tulsi-das-khan,1," Overhyped
","I was pretty excited to watch this movie as I read some amazing reviews online. I'm still wondering what the hype was all about. The movie is overloaded with all kinds of cliches from beginning to the end. You name it all, this movie has it. Husband not believing what the wife says and thinks she's not well, someone following/watching the protagonist, slow build-ups which lead to nothing etc. Also you'll guess the ending of the movie by 30 minutes mark. Nothing new in this one, watch a Hitchcock movie instead.",/review/rw8298960/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2022,sauerkraut-96467,3," VERY predictable
","This movie is predictable almost from the opening scene in the taxicab. It is fairly well acted and directed, but the script is extremely weak. I would not recommend this, since I literally knew who done it, and how it was going to end WAY before it ever happened. Also, the main character, Julia, is a whimpy, cry baby almost from the beginning. Why can't someone write and make an Alfred Hitchcock kind of suspense movie any more?",/review/rw8298960/?ref_=tt_urv

30 July 2022,bangel3322,2," Slow burn that never really takes off
","This film dragged quite a lot and it kind of plays with the idea the protagonist is imagining what's happening to her, because to be honest not much happens at all. It's a slow film that maintains one speed throughout the course of the film and then just ends. Its quite boring without much background or information given. It's an adopted theme that takes a horror trope and just annihilates it. Terrible film. Just awful. My rating is because it did offer one or two tense scenes that worked.",/review/rw8298960/?ref_=tt_urv
31 August 2022,PedroPires90,8," Great
","Pretty good. Super tense, induces anxiety like the best in the genre, full of nice shots and angles (very European sometimes!) that make the action incredibly claustrophobic. Great job by Okuno - a director that we need to look very closely!",/review/rw8298960/?ref_=tt_urv
23 June 2022,easierlifeall,2," If you want to get yourself eliminated, act like her
","In addition to other types of work, I teach self-defense to women. I don't know what world Julia thinks she's living in, but she behaves as if it's the world she thinks it should be rather than the world that it actually is. (a) In the grocery store, she isolates herself in a store room instead of going toward other people. (b) Instead of being patient and waiting for a taxi, she goes underground to a dark, isolated subway platform. (c) She lingers alone near the apartment of the person who she believes is stalking her. (d) She leaves her apartment to go to another without locking her own door first. There are others...People have to live in the world that is, not the world that ""should be"".",/review/rw8298960/?ref_=tt_urv
4 July 2022,Luv2Spooge,2," Uninspiring Unoriginal
","This film was very promising from the start, but about half way through it became so predictable and you just lose interest. Perhaps it is just me, but I expect films of this genre to have some major twist and this film failed to deliver. In the inevitable end at the conclusion, we are left shaking our heads, ""I've seen this before.""",/review/rw8298960/?ref_=tt_urv
