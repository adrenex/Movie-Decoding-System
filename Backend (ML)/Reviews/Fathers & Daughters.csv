12 April 2019,RussHog,1," Worst Stephen King Adaption of All Time
","Imagine someone told all of Game of Thrones in one movie that was just an hour and a half, then cut out 99% of the story. :(",/review/rw6014454/?ref_=tt_urv
18 August 2020,Ruskington,2," Why even bother?
",Stephen King's Dark Tower novels may have their flaws but they are nonetheless a highly creative juggernaut that deserved either a fully committed TV adaptation or to be simply left alone.,/review/rw6014454/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2021,gbghykwg,1," I will forever deny this movie even existed.
","As far as I am concerned, there is no Dark Tower movie yet.",/review/rw6014454/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2017,Platypuschow,2," The Dark Tower: Weakest King adaptation by far
","Truth be told though not terrible I've never been a fan of The Dark Tower books, I've read 5/7 and though being a huge Stephen King fan I could never seem to get into them.",/review/rw6014454/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2017,TheLittleSongbird,5," The not so Dark Tower
","Stephen King is notoriously difficult to adapt, some of his work near-unfilmable or at least with parts that are (i.e. 'IT'). Which is why film/television adaptations are such a mixed bag.",/review/rw6014454/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2018,cryfenril-38465,1," This isn't The Dark Tower. Period.
","Yes, it has characters named after characters from the books. Yes, there is a Tower and a villain and a boy. And that's where ANY resemblance ends.",/review/rw6014454/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2019,rickbrightwell-399-560921,1," I was warned, but I didn't listen
","I was warned by trusted friends that, as a fan of the books, I would be sorely disappointed with this movie. I didn't listen",/review/rw6014454/?ref_=tt_urv
8 June 2018,lanycera,1," Please refrain of making any further movies or shows involving Arcel.
","If you have read the books, this movie is a major disappointment and you should not watch it. Honestly. If you have not read the books, this might be enjoyable somewhat. ",/review/rw6014454/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2020,BobSmo,2," So disappointing
",This is not the Dark Tower. Well maybe 0.0000009 percent or so.,/review/rw6014454/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2017,Matt_Layden,4," Generic action sequences, oversimplification of an epic story and shoddy effects are just some of the problems....
","This film, which was inspired, not adapted from the Stephen King novels of the same name, takes a sweeping epic, dumbs it down, loses the focus and lazily tries to make it look cool for a younger audience. This film is bad and I went in with an open mind, hoping to find some redeeming qualities about it. While there are some good ideas, I can't help but feel that this will be somewhat heartbreaking for fans of the books who were actually excited to see it. ",/review/rw6014454/?ref_=tt_urv
9 September 2017,s3276169,3," An abysmal failure......
",I have read a good number of the Dark Tower series of books by Stephen King and I'd rate them as some of his very best work.,/review/rw6014454/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2017,ericaharris1908,1," Why, Why, Why
","First off I an African-American female and I don't agree with the choice of Idris Elba in the lead role as the gunslinger. I have read the entire tower series since the very first book came out years ago and always imagined the gunslinger as a Clint Eastwood look alike, and this movie is just a slap in the face of all fans of the series. Why do they do Stephen King's books like this? The series has so much it is impossible to show it in one movie like this. Why did they bother calling it the Dark Tower. All they did was take a few names and then pieced together a story completely void off any real tension, any real sense of adventure, and completely butchered the story line. With the technology we have today they could have made an epic movie series like the Harry Potter movies, studios should know by now that if a movie series is good, people will watch 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...how ever many movies it takes to really tell the story. I understand that you can't include everything from the books, but to give this crap the name of the dark tower to trick fans of the book series to watch is atrocious. The dark tower is an epic story spanning hundreds of years across different dimensions and different times in history. All the build up to finding the actual tower is full of all kinds of awesome stories that would have made great long movie series. This was just a lazy attempt to cash in on another well know series. I really can't stand Hollywood. That is why I don't go to the movies anymore, why pay someone to waste hours of my life I can't get back. Hollywood puts out this stupid stuff because people watch it. As long as people still go and by tickets stupid movies like this will continue to be made. If you are fan of the series DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE or least wait until it comes on free TV, but don't pay 1 cent to watch this poor excuse for a movie.",/review/rw6014454/?ref_=tt_urv
28 August 2018,gottenkieny,1," They have forgotten the face of their fathers..
","Those who tried to turn The Dark Tower series by Stephen King into a movie, have forgotten the face of their fathers. They did not aim with their hearts..",/review/rw6014454/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2018,emp2687,1," Bad from any point of view.
",I figure i'll review this in levels of involvement. I believe it is bad on all the levels.,/review/rw6014454/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2017,ztigr,2," C'mon Really??
","You have Idris Elba, Matthew McConaughey 8 books of material, and you put together a 95 minute movie? I absolutely hate that critics have to hold their reviews on these movies so the public cannot be forewarned. Its like restaurant critics not being able to tell you the food is dog meat until after you place your order. Then there are those fans who loved the books, so they delude themselves into thinking the movie is good enough. Frankly the history of Stephen King material and film is a mixed bag. The Shining is obviously superior, but when's the last time you dug out Dreamcatcher? It just continues to shock me how inept some of these productions are.",/review/rw6014454/?ref_=tt_urv
4 October 2017,maliapac,3," Worst movie of the year.
","Worst film of the year in my personal opinion. You have MM and Elba, you have 8 - EIGHT - books of material, and you do a movie that is hour and a half long, you butcher the material, and after all, you don't make the Gunslinger the central character in the movie. ",/review/rw6014454/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2017,wileyschmitt,7," No Expectations = Enjoyable Experience
","I've been looking forward to seeing this movie for a few years, I've read all the books including the more recent one ('The Wind Thru the Keyhole') and other books that Walter appeared in. It's currently 2017, and anyone who hasn't learned the 'book to movie' lesson by now needs to finally learn it so that they can also enjoy movies what they are, which is an extra bonus for a book that is well liked by a lot of people. If the movie actually turns out good than all the better, but being more realistic about movies not having to live up to the books they're based on is best thing to do so you don't end up like the rest of these bitter people who leave the movie theater as quickly as possible just to come back home and write a 'nerd'tastic negative one starred review expressing all their deep down inner angst in the most pathetic form possible. Luckily I beat many of them to the punch before they tore this fun and entertaining movie apart, and I did find it entertaining thanx to having zero expectations about it, go ahead and try it next time you go to a similar movie, you'll at least temporarily enjoy yourself. Whining and complaining about trivial things isn't good for you or anyone else anyways.",/review/rw6014454/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2017,view_and_review,7," Now I Want to Read the Book
",I have to be careful not to overstate this movie's grade. I have been guilty of doing that a few times immediately after a movie. Maybe the theater ambiance got to me or maybe one good scene stuck with me so I rate the entire movie based upon that. I can still say that this movie is good. ,/review/rw6014454/?ref_=tt_urv
3 August 2017,garethvk,6," Not As Bad As You Hear But More ""Inpired By"" VS ""Based On""
","Adapting Stephen King stories for the screen has long been a difficult problem for Hollywood. For every ""Misery"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"", there are many others such as ""The Mangler"", ""Cell"", ""and Graveyard Shift"" and many more where things did not go as planned. The big issue is that King often creates detailed characters with complex backstories and puts then in fully developed worlds that despite their supernatural nature, often are easy for readers to relate to.",/review/rw6014454/?ref_=tt_urv
6 August 2017,roland9d,2," Dumbing down the Tower
","The Dark Tower by Stephen King is an expansive story that spans 7 books, telling Roland the Gunslinger's journey to the Tower; involving different genres, many characters, many worlds - a big lore. ",/review/rw6014454/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2018,paul_haakonsen,6," It could have, and should have, been so much more...
","Granted, I have not read the books from Stephen King, but I am familiar with them as I used to work in a bookstore. I was looking forward to watching the adaptation of the novels here, and was expecting quite the unique experience.",/review/rw6014454/?ref_=tt_urv

6 August 2017,gotmyorangecrush,4," Yet another weak Stephen King film!!
","This film reminds me of the situation surrounding the making of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. The film was turned down by one studio after another as none of the studios wanted to commit to making 3 films. One of the studios actually agreed to make it, but only if the script was condensed into a single film. Thankfully the people that had the rights and were pitching the films understood that the idea of translating the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy in a single film was a laughable proposition and the end result would have been a terrible film that would ultimately do no justice to the source material. They were willing to bring it down to 2 films instead of 3, but the studio wound up turning them down. ",/review/rw6014454/?ref_=tt_urv
27 April 2020,Tom-Collins76,2," Blasphemy to the book series
","Terrible 105 minute adaptation of the series that true fans have waited over 30 years for. They should really rethink this and fix the disaster that so many true fans think of it. They should make it a story worth watching (better than high school vampires and werewolves, and true fans will go to showings faster than Harry Potter could whip up a spell!)",/review/rw6014454/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 2020,aeongale,7," But what if you haven't read the books?
","It a great 90 min Sony Pictures action movie. Some alternate dimension stuff, bad guy with sweet powers and lots of pew pew. Elba and McConaughey are awesome. Fun times.",/review/rw6014454/?ref_=tt_urv
