1 June 2010,Wizard-8,," Delivers the goods
","With a movie from direct-to-DVD kings Nu Image/Millennium Pictures, you know that you'll at least get good production values. When one of their movies has Isaac Florentine as the director, you know you are going to get some spectacular action sequences. Needless to say, ""Undisputed III"" has both of those things. I will admit that the script is pretty standard for this kind of thing - we never really get into the head of the protagonist and learn what is driving him, the bad guys also have no real personality, and how a couple of the characters managed to get together in the last few minutes of the movie is never explained. But we don't watch movies like this primarily for the writing. We watch them because we want some good action, and this movie without doubt has that. The fights are really spectacular, with Florentine using a perfect combination of expert choreography, good direction (the camera steps back enough so we see all of the fighters in the fights), and occasional and effective use of slow motion. I've enjoyed all the ""Undisputed"" movies, and if they make a fourth entry in the series, I'll definitely be there.",/review/rw2702056/?ref_=tt_urv
23 May 2010,teo_adi_re,," Strong fighting movie with predictable plot but still good.
","Scott Adkins is bad ass here. This role gets him well, better then fancy good boy from Ninja. He is turned from the villain of the Undisputed II to the flawed and angry main character of this one. You will enjoy him and supporting actors; Mykel Shannon Jenkins aka Turbo and Mark Ivanir as Gaga.",/review/rw2702056/?ref_=tt_urv
22 May 2010,sdicker2,9," WOW action and decent acting
","So, let me start off by saying Scott Adkins is a pretty good actor and a damn good entertainer. He goes from being the partial pure fighting villain in the second to the star of the third. He copes with his hyper-extended knee very well might I say. Anyways, this movie was the best yet. The fight scenes were incredible and there was actually a decent plot. I hope there is a fourth and if there is Scott Adkins damn sure better be in it.",/review/rw2702056/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2020,MR-ODIN,," best fighting movie
","Unlike any other martial arts movie, this one pushs the style to the edge, from bad to good, from weak to strong, Boyka's character leaves no clues on Scott Adkins. As much as it is a simple idea as much as the adreline never stops in this movie. This movie left a mark in the history of martial arts movies, and yet it never gets old. ""this is the most complete mma movie in the world"".",/review/rw2702056/?ref_=tt_urv

",This movie was a complete entertainer; I haven't seen the first two parts but this part was surely something! No doubt the MMA fighting skills of the characters were real time and no strings attached; yes I mean no strings attached.,/review/rw2702056/?ref_=tt_urv
20 August 2017,ivo-cobra8,10," this movie is the only best martial artist tournament film in the Undisputed film series
",So the third film in the Undisputed film series is the best martial arts film flick in my opinion that was released in the last years. I am really not big fan of the Undisputed films. The first one I really don't care about Walter Hill and Wesley Snipes film that I don't care. The second one was about the same character from the first film George Chambers who was played by Ving Rhames but was then replaced by Michael Jai White. So anyway I got this movie on Blu-ray and I love this film to death. This is the only Undisputed film I have because of Scott Adkins I am a hug fan of the actor and I think Yuri Boyka is his best role. The reason I did not get Undisputed II: Last Man Standing on Blu-ray was because I did not like Scott Adkins a bad guy and he lost a fight on the end but still the second one was a really good movie.,/review/rw2702056/?ref_=tt_urv

28 May 2010,fortheimdbpro,10," It just keeps getting better and better..
","So, I'm here writing and deleting all the time because I can't find the words to express my enthusiasm over this film.. Yes, it's not your typical drama with an extraordinary plot or character development but for a movie that had a low budget and was so under the radar it delivered, and delivered really really really good.",/review/rw2702056/?ref_=tt_urv
29 July 2010,chad-lisa,9," Best of the 3, its all action from start to finish
","I didn't expect much from this movie being the third one and classed as a B movie, but i have to say if you like one and two and you love action/fighting movies this is top notch. The acting isn't the best in the world, but action movies never are, Boyka is awesome and this is my favourite action movie for a while by far.",/review/rw2702056/?ref_=tt_urv
4 June 2010,nickruns,9," Another Hit!
","Please don't dismiss this movie because it doesn't have some big name actor in it. Fans of the trilogy will surely tell you that Undisputed II and III are far better films than the first. Scott Adkins returns as Uri Boyka and his martial arts moves are top notch. The prison fights are intense and the acting credible. This movie is what you paid for, straight forward action with little filler. This is not your average direct to video action flick this is the real deal! Look out for Scott Adkins because he's definitely got some talent and he looks a little like Ben Affleck only with acting skills. Make sure you watch Undisputed II first for the full experience and to see Michael Jai White kick butt.",/review/rw2702056/?ref_=tt_urv

28 February 2012,maz4u61,9," You can not Dispute the franchise!!!!!!!! Better than before
","You can not dispute the franchise. It is getting better and better. If you are looking for a sensible and twisted plot then you should go somewhere else. This movie has a good story too. But it is predictable. But overall the story is good with some twist and turn. The only thing that stands out in this movie is the fighting scene. All the fighting scene in this movies are amazing. From the beginning till the end. The characters chosen are really good to. It suits their personality. But, the only character stands out in the movie is ""DOLOR"". This guy is freaking badass. He is lighting fast, and has a touch of innocence when he recites Biblical verses. I hope he gets a chance in the future to show his talents. I watched the fighting scene more than 10 times. The only time i did that when I watch IP Man (1&2). Then I changed my rating from 8 to 9. Cause the fighting scene are extraordinary.",/review/rw2702056/?ref_=tt_urv
13 January 2018,Leofwine_draca,7," Best of the series yet
","REDEMPTION is the third of the UNDISPUTED franchise and a straight-to-video martial arts flick that excels at what it does. The trend is to offer more of the same as we saw before, but there's more action than ever, more heart, and more arena fighting. The genius move is to have Scott Adkins return as Boyka, not as the villain (although he's as tough as ever), but as the hero this time around. The story follows through the usual prison elements: male bonding, punishment, escape, and plenty more besides, but the emphasis is always on the fighting in the ring. In the hands of experienced director Isaac Florentine the fight scenes are crisp and fluid, with near-impossible physicality and brutal moves captured in loving detail. Adkins is excellent, of course, as is an ultra-slimy Marko Zaror as the chief bad guy and other genre personalities including Lateef Crowder, Vernon Dobtcheff, and good old Robert Costanzo (the traffic cop from DIE HARD 2!). It's certainly the best of the series yet, and it leaves me looking forward to checking out part four.",/review/rw2702056/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2021,view_and_review,7," If We Forgive the Creative License
","In UD3 Boyka (Scott Adkins) is a broken shell of himself to start. His knee hasn't fully recovered from the blow it took from George Chambers (Michael Jai White) in part 2, but he's not going to let that stop him. He entered the prison fighting championship and he was determined to win, if only to prove that he is the most complete fighter in the world. He would have to defeat three contenders in the eight man tournament to prove it though. Among them are Turbo (Mykel Jenkins) the American much in the mold of George Chambers and Raul Quinones (Mark Zaror) the juiced up Colombian.",/review/rw2702056/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2021,automorphism,10," The defining movie of flashy martial arts
","There have been many greats before Scott Adkins, but Adkins brought a new style of martial arts to cinema. I would say Undisputed 3 is one of his greatest, and probably the greatest film he has made. For those that don't know, Scott Adkins martial arts is characterized by tricking, or fancy kicks that involve spinning in nearly unbelievable ways in the air to land deadly kicks on the faces of his opponents.",/review/rw2702056/?ref_=tt_urv

","In the follow-up movie to the cringe-worthy original movie and a gut-wrenching second part we have a change of hero. Here we follow Yuri Boyka (Scott Adkins of Barakapool and ""Ninja"" fame), the ultimate loser of the Undisputed final bout. With his leg injured he has been relegated to being a toilet cleaner, falling down the prison hierarchy to the very bottom. Despite his obvious weakness he never gives up and decides to reenter the ring. After beating the current prison champion it turns out that his next destination will be a world-wide tournament between inmates from several continents. Amongst them talkative American Turbo (Mykel Shannon Jenkins) and Colombian bad-ass Dolor (Marko Zaror, best known from the exquisite ""Mirageman"" movie).",/review/rw2702056/?ref_=tt_urv

10 November 2012,ragingbull_2005,6," The best part of the trilogy
","Adkins returns as Boyka, the prisoner who is an ace mixed martial arts fighter. He is nursing his knee which was broken by Michael Jay White at the end of the second part. He takes part in the local prison competition and predictably wins. Then he is send off for an ""inter prison MMA"" tournament wherein the winner will walk free. I must admit that this is the only part of the trilogy which I enjoyed. There is a modicum of effort which has gone on in the development of characters. True, the focus is still on the fight. However, there are scenes which show the development of camaraderie between Adkins and Jenkins who plays an American fighter. The fight sequences are choreographed superbly and are total value for money. The movie does not bore you. The ending is unintentionally laugh out loud. The acting and direction is above average. The background score is good. 3 out of 5 for the Undisputed 3. Watch it for Adkins and the action scenes. Some of the punches will take your breath away.",/review/rw2702056/?ref_=tt_urv
