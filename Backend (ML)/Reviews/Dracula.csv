","Austin Powers: Man of Mystery I'm embarrassed to admit this one-and-a-half hours of hedonistic humor was so enjoyable, but it was, and the two sequels weren't bad, either, but not as good as this one.",/review/rw0404697/?ref_=tt_urv
15 March 1999,Coxer99,8," The Finest Spoof...
","In this hilarious spoof of 60's spy flicks, a swinging secret agent is thawed out of his cryogenic state in order to combat his old nemesis. The laughs never stop as Myers entertains in two pivotal roles. Hurley is sexy as Austin's partner and love interest. Robert Wagner finds ways to make fun of his ""It Takes a Thief"" character and is very entertaining in the process. A quickly paced film that generates constant laughs with each viewing. A sequel is soon to be released...Yeah, baby!",/review/rw0404697/?ref_=tt_urv
19 August 2002,Anonymous_Maxine,8," This should have been done years ago!!
","In a time when we are almost constantly barraged with goofy spoof films, it's amazing that no one had come out with a spoof of the James Bond films until 1997. Those movies have been coming out and just BEGGING to be spoofed since the early 60s, and Mike Meyers is the one who finally steps forward to do what simply has to be done, and he does a wonderful job at it.",/review/rw0404697/?ref_=tt_urv

",Mike Myers brings his absurdist brand of funny to the secret agent genre. At his peak Myers delivered a highly stylized form of comedy in an Airplane sense that holds up even today. This is his peak.,/review/rw0404697/?ref_=tt_urv
12 February 2000,Xophianic,8," Destined to become a classic!
","When I first saw this movie advertised, I had no interest whatsoever in seeing it. I was a Mike Myers fan, but AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY looked like the stupidest and least creative movie of the year. But after hearing of a few of the hilarious scenes of the movie, I decided to test my faith in Myers and give it a try. It turned out to be one of the funniest movies I'd seen in a long time.",/review/rw0404697/?ref_=tt_urv
28 July 2002,Smells_Like_Cheese,8," Shagadelic, baby, yeah!
","When I saw ""Austin Powers"", I was on the floor laughing. This movie has every single memorable line you could possibly imagine. From ""Yeah, baby!"" to ""Riiiiiight"", Mike Myers is a genius when it comes to comedy! I think everyone could say that they laughed at least once to this film.",/review/rw0404697/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2019,ranblackman,8," Meta Humor, oh behave.
","Yeah, it's dumb, yeah it's goofy, but it knows it. Almost everyone in this movie is self-aware of the kind of tropes it is making fun of. It drags out its humor, to a degree that is almost irritating, but it works. It works because of the meta-humor, because of the acknowledgment of the insanity. That makes it that much more fun to watch and hilarious. It's pure laughs and clever writing all through.",/review/rw0404697/?ref_=tt_urv
9 March 2003,MovieAddict2016,8," `Austin Powers' has its hit and misses, but comes off with mostly hits...Perhaps the greatest thing about this film is that it is not directly geared towards Bond geeks...

8 July 2002,SmileysWorld,7," Raunchy humor,but a fun spoof
","Aside from it's overwhelmingly raunchy humor,I consider this to be a great spoof of the spy genre and 60's culture.Mike Myers has created yet two more endearing characters in Powers and his nemisis,Dr.Evil.When certain characters inspire imitation (and who hasn't at least heard imitations of these two,or perhaps even Robert Wagner's character, Number 2 and others),then you have done something right.This movie is good for it's amusing characters and good story line,but again I think it would have worked without so much vulgar humor.Worth a look.",/review/rw0404697/?ref_=tt_urv

","Can't believe it took over 20 yrs to completely watch the A.P. trilogy from beginning to end,, but all I can say is that it's GROOVY Baby!! Lol,, no. It's great comedy. I love it. And will watch until I can quote every line.",/review/rw0404697/?ref_=tt_urv
8 March 2004,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,8," Finally, a good Bond spoof
","This is really a funny parody of the Bond movies. This is the best thing to watch if you've seen a typical by-the-numbers Bond movie, one of the old ones, for example, and thought it was ridiculous, or at the very least something other than great. The plot is directly spoofing the old Bond movies, with an evil villain trying to take over the world. The acting is pretty good, for a spoof movie; the characters are mostly caricatures and stereotypes, to further parody the Bond movies, but they add to the humor of the film. Mike Myers is great in this movie, pretty much anyone who likes him will probably enjoy him in this. I loved how it was spoofing the Bond movies, sometimes even mentioning the ludicrousness of the characters actions in details. If you're into 60's stereotypes, crude sexual humor and some great Bond-spoof action, you'll most likely enjoy this. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys spoof movies, and who's seen at least one Bond movie and thought it was a bit ridiculous. It's filled to the brink with crude sexual innuendo and Bond-spoofing. 8/10",/review/rw0404697/?ref_=tt_urv
15 December 2009,bkoganbing,7," Yeah Baby,.Groovy
","When he made Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery Mike Myers aspired to comic greatness, the kind we had not seen on the screen since Peter Sellers. Only Sellers and Alec Guinness could create so many believable characters in the same film and make them work the way Myers does with Austin Powers and his perennial nemesis Doctor Evil.",/review/rw0404697/?ref_=tt_urv
3 July 2002,bob the moo,," Dirty, funny spoof if you're in the mood
","In the 1960's Austin Powers is one of the UK's best secret agents. He  works as an international playboy who also fights international  terrorists. However when Dr Evil tries fails to kill him, Dr Evil  escapes into space where he is frozen until a time when he can return.  Austin Powers also freezes himself to be defrosted later. In the late  90's Dr Evil returns to wreck havoc on the world and only a defrosted  Powers can stop him  if he can adapt to the new world order.  Mike Myers is very much an acquired taste but he did seem to hit it big  with this series of films. The original film set the tone with not very  basic jokes but certainly plenty of crude ones. The main film is split  between a fish out of water film, with Austin trying to come to terms  with the 90's, and also a James Bond spoof with Dr Evil as a more  frustrated Bond baddie (complete with cat and bald head). The fish out  of water stuff works well as Austin is a funny swinger and the 60's  stuff is cool, however the best bits for me all relate to Dr Evil   whether it be his relationship with his son or the asides where the see  the consequences of the death of his henchmen. The spoof on Bond movies  gets the best laughs from me.  Myers is good in both roles and clearly has fun with both. Hurley is OK  but a bit wooden as Vanessa while Robert Wagner is good as number one.  Michael York (whoooooo?) is good as control and there are some good  cameos  Rob Lowe is funny but I still don't understand why the whole  Christian Slater bit was put in the final cut?!  Overall it may be rude and slightly crude in places but there's still  plenty to enjoy. It's 90 minutes long but it's very funny and rushes  by. You may not remember much of the plot but at least you go away  chuckling.",/review/rw0404697/?ref_=tt_urv

23 March 2020,ricklb-43546,10," ""I swear baby it's not mine..""
","This is a classic spoof with laugh out loud scenes. Austin Powers delivers on the oh so obvious silliness of spy movies. (Mostly James Bond references) This movie also has a brilliant cast of funny people, along side of a plethora of gorgeous women, none that shine brighter than Elizabeth Hurley. It's clever, funny, sexy and groovy.",/review/rw0404697/?ref_=tt_urv
4 March 2020,ironhorse_iv,7," Yeah, Baby! Yeah! 'Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery' was indeed a smashing, groovy one million dollar experience. It was fun to watch.
","Influenced by 1966 British television series 'Adam Adamant Lives!' & original created by Mike Myers for the faux 1960s rock band 'Ming Tea' that Myers started with musicians Matthew Sweet and Susanna Hoffs following his Saturday Night Live stint in the early 1990s. The character found its way into movie production in early 1995. Parodying the James Bond & Harry Palmer's films of the late 1960s & early 1970s; this 1997 comedy tells the story of a swinging era British spy named Austin Powers (Mike Myers) having to cryogenically freeze himself in order to fight his nemesis Dr. Evil (Also played by Myers) sometime in the future. Hilarity arises when both men return in the late 1990s to find out that times has change and with that, their old ways of life. Teaming with fellow secret agent, Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley), Austin must now find out what Dr. Evil's next nefarious plan, while getting use to modern society norms. Without spoiling the movie too much, this spy genre flick from director Jay Roach got some mojo! Surprisingly most of the jokes in this flick still hold up to me. However, some of the deep followers of political correctness culture might think overwise. They will find the motion picture highly offensive and dated. It doesn't help that a then unknown convicted felon who torture women star in this movie as henchman Random Task. Even a joke about blackmailing the Royal family about an affair could be seen today as bad taste due to Princess Diana death later that year. Regardless, of all the controversial, this flick concept was much better than the film's two sequels 1999 'Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me' and 2002 'Austin Powers in Goldmember' where the movie's highly clichés annoying overused sexual crude and gross out toilet dialogue and visuals humor are much worst. At least, this movie's jokes aren't much of a turn off like the homing device scene or the Jerry Springer sequence in the sequel. I can't stand those. As for this movie, there are plenty of memorable moments, I truly love. My favorite happens to be Dr. Evil's therapist speech. Myers's acting as Dr. Evil is top notch with Myers as Austin being secondary alright and decent. I don't care if he stole the impression from fellow SNL castmate Dana Carvey. Any moment with the antagonist was truly an entertaining watch even if most of them felt like an out of place sketch comedy skit rather than part of the overall movie. After all, the film does feel like one with the intercut with the random dancing sequences between scenes often showing female dancers in bikini's and psychedelic artwork over their bodies like the television show 'Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In' (1967-1973). It can seem a bit jarring; much like the opening musical movie which is a random direct reference to The Beatles 1964's flick 'A Hard Day's Night' that has nothing to do with the rest of the moment. Nevertheless, overall those scenes feature here fits better than some of the other random sequences that modern home release videos edited back in. While somewhat funny, the theatrical version moment with the steamroller and the unnamed guard played by Michael McDonald was just enough time with its overly long gag. The added sequence with his wife and son reacting to his death kinda overdone it. Don't get me wrong that deeply disturbing and dark moment was still funny, but it would work better if shown in the after credits. Thank goodness, most DVDs have that moment back as a deleted scene along with the other security guard sequence and the two lightboat endings. Since most of the film's best dialogue like Dr. Evil's trying to quiet Scott (Seth Green) was improvise, hopefully one day we can see all the alternated takes or bloopers. Nevertheless, just don't worth this movie on television. Many of the jokes are censored or cut on broadcast TV. Despite where you watch it, the movie did make some of then-unknown comedians into bigger stars. One such example is Will Ferrell. His bit as the very injury Mustafa was downright unforgettable. He would later reprise his role in the sequels. As for the rest of the supporting cast. Robert Wagner, Clint Howard, Michael York and Mindy Sterling has their moments to shine. Even Elizabeth Hurley and Fabiana Udenio found themselves with a lot more depth than most love interests get in these types of spy movies. However, I hate what they did to Hurley's character in the sequel. That was awful and doesn't make sense with what happen in this movie. Plus, it was weird to see Austin not care about what happen to her. As for the cameos. I found Carrie Fischer and Tom Arnold great in the small roles they were given. Then there is costume design. For a very low budget movie, it had some very impressive wardrobes. I'm deeply surprise that this comedy wasn't nomination in that department at the 70th Academy Awards. It had a chance of winning. As for the music. ""Soul Bossa Nova"" by Quincy Jones was given new life. Before this movie, I never knew that this song was from an old Canadian game show called 'Definition' from the 1970s. The rest of the soundtrack by composter George Clinton was just as groovy baby! Overall: A fourth film entitled 'For Your Thighs Only' was announced in 2005 but so far, nothing has come of it yet. It doesn't help that Myers had two cinematic failures since then. The death of Verne Troyer's in 2018 from an alcohol poisoning makes this even less likely. But maybe one day it will come. Until then, we always have this movie to laugh at. It's one flick worth watching for sure.",/review/rw0404697/?ref_=tt_urv

","But this one is entertaining and has genuinely funny lines. The acting is over the line, but not too much to render it stupid.

5 May 2022,Tweetienator,7," Still Good Fun
","I like The Naked Gun a little better, but Mike Meyers aka Austin Powers still rocks comedy. The Austin Powers franchise of course hit me right in a weak spot, as Get Smart (the show) and The Avengers belong to my most beloved tv shows ever.",/review/rw0404697/?ref_=tt_urv
4 May 2010,TheLittleSongbird,9," Shagadelic, baby!
","Words cannot describe how wonderful this film was. The story is admittedly daft, but the film itself is witty, sophisticated and hysterically stupid, while being fast, furious and fun as well. The humour is hilarious to the point of sides splitting, from the mocking of the fashion and musical style of the Swinging Sixties period, to countless references to 007, Matt Helm and Our Man Flint. And Austin's catchphrases?... groovy! The film looks amazing, with bright colourful sets and great costumes, and the soundtrack is funky. Then we have Mike Myers brilliant as Austin Powers(better than he was in Cat in the Hat anyway, the less said about that travesty the better), and hysterically over-the-top as the arch-nemesis Dr Evil, and Elizabeth Hurley fabulously sexy as Vanessa Kensington. Overall, wonderful film, better than I thought it would be. Shagadelic, baby! 9/10 Bethany Cox",/review/rw0404697/?ref_=tt_urv

25 August 2013,johnnyboyz,6," Neat, blasé comedy which gets the little things right on top of being a fun, energetic experience.
","The humour at the centre of Austin Powers revolves around the stupidity of its two predominant characters, that is to say its eponymous hero and scheming chief villain. Neither character possess the requisite cans one needs to make up a six pack and yet in this film's mixed up universe, both of them have attained somewhat of a powerful position and the top of their respective fields. The pair, both of whom are depicted with ample relish by Mike Myers, embody a string of physical western traits often synonymous with fictitious heroes and villains, but with boundaries blurred in regards to their emotional states. In Austin Powers, the idea of the heroic cultural icon (who makes friends easily and exudes patriotism via his sports car decked out in the Union Jack) is cruelly undercut by distorted facial features and rampaging nymphomania. Likewise, his arch nemesis Dr. Evil is hideously hunched, scarred and intent on world domination - yet melts when he realises he possesses offspring. The pair of them are complete idiots, and they go about their business incompetently and badly - Powers just happens to always win because he is slightly less of an idiot.",/review/rw0404697/?ref_=tt_urv
10 August 2020,briancham1994,7," Fresh and funny
","Austin Powers is an outrageous and funny parody of old James Bond films and plays up the cheesy and retro factors up to eleven. It has all sorts of wacky moments and gags, along with memorable characters. At times it is a bit juvenile though.",/review/rw0404697/?ref_=tt_urv

","I remember seeing ""Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery"" in the theater (Fresh Meadows, NY). I thought it was great. I've seen it many times since and I still think it's great. Mike Myers and company hit the ball out of the park with one. It has one laugh-out-loud moment after another. The cast is great and the music is really cool (I bought the soundtrack after seeing this in the theater). ""Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery"" is so good it actually ruined the last twenty minutes of ""Dr. No"" for me.",/review/rw0404697/?ref_=tt_urv

","Austin Powers is Mike Myers best film yet. The character is a lot of fun to watch and they do a very good job of spoofing the James Bond pictures. The movie is well cast with Robert Wagner,Elizabeth Hurley,Michael York and Myers himself paying the role of Dr. Evil. The character of Dr. Evil is funny enough to have a movie of his own. This film was a lot of fun to watch and is very funny.",/review/rw0404697/?ref_=tt_urv
