28 January 2023,nikos_belitsis,1," Give us a break, please...!
","Another unimoprtant movie, a movie that had no reason to make it, let alone create the idea for this. What does the new director Eissenberg want to achieve? Convince us that he has concerns about the future of the planet? That he cares for the good of humanity? Want to scream for green growth? What happens to me? To irritate me with the chatter of his texts. Does he try to make the actors talk as fast as he does? Is it an experiment? Do you want to show us your deep talent? Don't make movies. Another family without cohesion. Characters indifferent. Result; Sleepiness! I like Julianne Moore and that was the reason for giving a try. Pity for Julianne, and pity for me.",/review/rw8814496/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2023,passthemictothea,2," Awful. Just Awful
","How many ways can I say how awful this is? It's as slow as a turtle, the characters have no redeeming value and the you wonder why anyone would write this. How was this financed? Who would watch this movie and think, I have to get this made. Julianne Moore's talent is wasted here. She plays a strange mother and wife, who's husband describes as a narcissist. She develops a crush on a new resident at here shelter for abused women. You would think that would make her more likable but the resident is a high school boy. The son, played by Finn Wolfhard, is even worse. He yells and curses at his parents like it's a normal day. And the ending does nothing to redeem anyone of them. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.",/review/rw8814496/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2023,kjproulx,4," This Film Does a Poor Job Making You Care
","This is usually my kind of film. A simplistic, low-budget drama that tells a human story. Many of those films are my favourites, so when I heard Jesse Eisenberg was tackling a movie like this for his first directorial feature I was intrigued. After watching it though, I have to admit I'm pretty disappointed. Not because Eisenberg is a bad filmmaker by any means, but due to the fact that I just didn't care about anything in this movie. Here's why, even though Eisenberg directs his first film well, you can probably avoid When You Finish Saving the World.",/review/rw8814496/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2023,fataltypixels,1," The whole family seems to be narcissistic,it was hard to watch till the end
",You have the son who cares only about being the most popular songwriter in the world. He's also really obsessed with some girl in school who he has nothing in common with.,/review/rw8814496/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2023,pontuss-41654,3," Finn Wolfhard, how does he get cast?
","The first big positive about this film is that Jesse Eisenberg decided to not be in it as an actor, just a director. Then they must have thought, if Jesse wont be acting how do we find an equally bad actor who can star in it. Then the answer is, Finn Wolfhard is pretty bad at acting let´s cast him. Finn Wolfhard is another of those hollywood actors/actresses that gets casted and you must wonder which wellconnected hollywood mogul he is related to, to get parts in any movie. The film itself is ok and Julianne Moore is great as always. Unfortunately a class actress in a lead role cant save a movie when the other main ""star"" just can´t act. A shame for Julianne, she deserved better.",/review/rw8814496/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2022,zackerman24,6," A Well-Told First Half, But Missing An Entire Second Act
","Caught this at this year's virtual Sundance Film Festival. Like any A24, the production value is good and the performances are great. Julianne and Finn both do an incredible job of playing infuriatingly cringe characters in a way that doesn't feel completely absurd, but is definitely uncomfortable.",/review/rw8814496/?ref_=tt_urv
5 February 2023,Impartial-Reviewer,," Do I Dare to Say What Most Can't?!
",The answer will be: I always do! A moment of honesty before anything...I'm not personally against Netflix casting the rejected and the weirdos! But fair is fair... Not because a certain show was a hit means its actors are!!!... The fact that Finn Wolfhard is still getting cast is a disaster on its own not to mention the flat 2D side characters that this movie represents.,/review/rw8814496/?ref_=tt_urv
20 April 2022,chenp-54708,7," Jesse Eisenberg's debut feature is flawed, but still engaging.

29 January 2023,saraludeman,1," A depressing film about generational narcissism
","One of the worst films I have sat all the way through in awhile. A long meandering film about a mother and sons inability to connect with not only each other, but the rest of the world. You would think towards the end they would manage to repair the connections that they seem to make worse with every interaction, but it never happens.. I kept hoping for redemption. It never arrived. The end of the film leaves you wondering why did I just waste 2 hours of my life watching this crap? Oh yeah because most of the actors in this film are good, its just the script that has no redeeming qualities. Do not bother.",/review/rw8814496/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2023,makayhart,6," I hate everyone in this movie
","When You Finish Saving The World is a movie I've been waiting to see since I first heard about it, and it was different than what I expected. Ziggy is a character who is just ceaselessly irritating. I think I would have genuinely lost my mind if he told someone how many followers he has one more time. Despite Ziggy probably being the character that the audience is probably intended to hate more, his mom was so much worse to me. The thing with Ziggy is that while he is irritating, he's still a teenager. Obviously he doesn't understand the world the same way his mom does, and she villainizes him for it instead of trying to be a mother and try to guide him in the right direction. She just would get mad and mock him or replace him with another vulnerable child. I think she really needed to step back because while I'm not entirely sure her going to school and seeking out Kyle was illegal, it felt like it should be. It was beyond weird. She cared more about this kid that she hardly knew more than the son that she was meant to be raising. She gets mad at Ziggy that he is not who she wants to be, but I really think it's because she doesn't know how to parent someone who is not entirely vulnerable. I couldn't find myself to sympathize with her at all honestly. It's not a horrible movie, I might watch it again if given the chance, I just don't like movies where nothing happens. The only times those movies are good is if they really make me think, but this one didn't. The only thing I could take away from this movie was that I hate the characters and I'm so glad I'm not a part of their family.",/review/rw8814496/?ref_=tt_urv

28 January 2023,franciscocb-96311,8," Life nowadays. Bad parenting and many other things
","It was quite a ride as a movie. Two people in their own bubbles, maybe narcissistic people. One won't listen, the other one won't see. At the end they are willing to listen, and therefore, speak. But it's basically part of the bad parenting that exists nowadays. Specially in USA/Canada. Mexico is a lot different, doesn't mean there are no bubbles. But USA is too shallow.",/review/rw8814496/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2023,patiencecrabstick,9," Excellent, smart, and under ninety minutes!
","This is a rare example of a small, intimate movie made by an insider that actually works. The performances, the writing, the hands-off direction, the music choices, the songwriting are all exactly on point. And Eisenberg sticks the landing - he knows when to cut away, he knows when to stop talking and let the screen go black. Julianne Moor and Finn Wolfhard are both terrific playing utterly self-obsessed characters - without the gentle and honest direction from Eisenberg and the endearing performances form the stars, this might've been a tough watch, but everyone has just enough self-awareness to make the narcissism play.",/review/rw8814496/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2023,danieljfarthing,7," Low-key, low-budget but certainly passable Jesse Eisenberg writer / director debut
","In low-key, low-budget, character-study drama ""When You Finish Saving The World"" uptight Julianne Moore (excellent) runs an Indiana shelter for domestic abuse victims who she seems to care more about (especially teen Billy Bryk) than her own wallflower hubbie Jay O Sanders & teen son Finn Wolfhard. The latter's a wannabe online musician struggling with issues of maturity (and a crush on Alisha Boe). Focussing (indirectly and at a distance) on the mother / son relationship this is absolutely not one for adrenaline junkies, but as Jesse Eisenberg's debut as writer / director it's a terrifically performed, quirky, interesting and certainly passable first offering.",/review/rw8814496/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2022,highlightsfootball-80235,10," A bitterly funny debut, with incredible performances from wolfhard and Moore
","It's everything you expect from a Jesse Eisenberg movie,finn wolfhard given amazing performance at that awkward teen who is obsessed with impressing his crush Lila and Julianne Moore was also impressive its quick-witted sharp and wry but may not be for everyone.",/review/rw8814496/?ref_=tt_urv
28 January 2023,ranaaglan,6," Good. Could have been so much better.
","Hesitated between a 4-6 rating. Some stops of the film convey the gist of the storytelling. Some are muddled, expected, and very naïve. Moore's pursuit of improving Kyle's life brushes off as a consequence to chasing off a romantic interest at some parts. Also, her performance is visibly dry at a lot of scenes. Glad to see how Finn has been shying away from Stranger Things shelter. However, his real-life personality has been shining through his acting since 2019 which requires a bit of attention. A great performance from his end nonetheless. Maybe a bit of coherence of characters' purpose would have been better.",/review/rw8814496/?ref_=tt_urv

21 January 2023,autumnmmagro,10," Honestly...just wow
","This movie captures a unique yet discomforting snapshot of mother and son, existing separately in a world searching for meaning. Both leads were flawed, funny, and authentic. The lofi soundtrack mixed with the cinematography created an atmosphere akin to Eternal Sunshine, in that it is bitterly sweet, but honest in its portrayal of characters that are everyday people, just like us. I appreciated the way Eisenberg didn't shy away from the humor that comes naturally in the social disconnect of everyday interaction. Overall, you leave this movie feeling part of something, and that's what matters.",/review/rw8814496/?ref_=tt_urv
