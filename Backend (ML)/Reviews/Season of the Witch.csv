","How did I go eleven years without watching this? I should hang my head in shame. I love portmanteau movies and stuff that gets really weird, so I have no real reason why I skipped this. Here's hoping everyone can find it in their heart to forgive me.",/review/rw2684013/?ref_=tt_urv

23 October 2009,claudio_carvalho,8," There Are Rules in Halloween
","In the Halloween night in Warren Valley, Ohio, Emma (Leslie Bibb) blows out a Jack-o-Lantern in front of her home despite the remark of her husband Henry (Tahmoh Penikett); sooner she has a tragic surprise. Earlier, the virgin Laurie (Anna Paquin) buys a Little Red Riding Hood costume with her sister and two girlfriends and they invite some guys for a party. Meanwhile, the glutton Charlie (Bret Kelly) destroys many Jack-o-Lanterns on the street. When he arrives at the house of the high- school principal Steven (Dylan Baker), the boy discovers how much the disturbed man respects the dead and the traditions of Halloween. Meanwhile four teenagers invite the outcast Rhonda (Sam Todd) to join them in their journey to an abandoned rock quarry where a tragic accident with the school bus with eight troubled children happened thirty years ago. They play a prank with Rhonda but when the mean Marcy (Britt McKillip) blows out the last Jack-o-Lantern in the spot, they need the support of Rhonda to escape from the damned place. Laurie sees a stalker that follows her; while walking through the woods to the party, she is attacked and she finally has her initiation. Earlier, the lonely Mr. Kreeg (Brian Cox) lives alone with his dog Spite and is visited by a scary trick-or-treating creature.",/review/rw2684013/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2022,pughspencer,8," Fun horror mandatory for the Halloween season
","Trick r Treat was the perfect movie horror fans needed for the Halloween season. An anthology film but with stories interconnected and told almost like a comic book panel. It's an obvious throwback to the classic EC Comics in almost the same vein Creepshow was. It's a movie that just oozes and screams the Halloween season with an orange color palette, beautiful Autumn cinematography, and jack-o-lanterns in almost every frame. There's four stories happening & each one gives you a different variety. There's a insane killer principle, a group of ghost children, some girls heading to a party with an outrageous twist, and finally a grumpy old strooge who hates the tradition. They're all accompanied by the spirit of Halloween himself Sam who's already become a horror icon despite only being in one movie. With his burlap sack mask, orange pajamas, and psycho but childlike nature he's the perfect embodiment of the Halloween season the same way Santa Claus is to Christmas.",/review/rw2684013/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2018,a_chinn,9," The ultimate Halloween movie is Norman Rockwell Americana by way of Stephen King
","Back when I first watched this film, it really surprised me how good it was for a direct-to-video horror film, and over the years it's grown into probably my favorite Halloween movie. ""Trick 'R Treat"" is a darkly comic horror anthology film, telling four intertwined stories that all take place one Halloween night. A spooky diminutive child-sized character named Sam (you know, like Samhain, the pagan festival of the dead), with a gunnysack mask with button eyes makes an appearance in all four stories. One story involves a homicidal principal (character actor Dylan Baker), another involves a cruel Halloween prank gone wrong, the next involves virginal Anna Paquin being set up by her more experienced gal pals, and the last story stars Sam, where he teaches a mean old man (Brian Cox) a lesson about the true meaning of Halloween. The spirit of Halloween and sticking to the rules of Halloween is what motives Sam and links the four stories. Mixing comedy and horror is a tough nut to crack, but writer/director Michael Dougherty (""X-Men 2"" ""Superman Returns"" ""Krampus"") and produced by Bryan Singer (""The Usual Suspects"" ""Valkyrie"" ""Bohemian Rhapsody"") absolutely nail it. ""Trick 'R Treat"" manages to be scary, funny, and always entertaining. The film carries a light tone, but the level of violence is definitely not for the kids. The film is something of a Halloweenophile's dream, depicting a small-town that appears to put on the most elaborate town square Halloween party you've ever seen, is filled with the most amazing front yard displays you've ever laid eyes on, and depicts a town populated by more people super into Halloween than you ever thought existed. It's timeless Norman Rockwell Americana by way of Stephen King (how can you resist that!). Since its initial inauspicious debut direct-to-video, ""Trick 'R Treat"" has developed a sizable and well deserved cult following, so, if you're looking for one film to get you in the mood for Halloween, you should check this one out.",/review/rw2684013/?ref_=tt_urv
20 November 2009,Superunknovvn,7," Very charming, lots of fun
","""Trick 'r Treat"" is probably what they intended ""Halloween III"" to be: A fun little horror movie that takes place at and revolves around Halloween. The episodic structure of the movie and the comic book background are reminiscent of George A. Romero's ""Creepshow"" and ""Tales From The Crypt"".",/review/rw2684013/?ref_=tt_urv
9 June 2009,Jim-D,10," The BEST Halloween-themed movie ever made
","Before anyone cries foul over my statement that TRICK 'R TREAT is the single best Halloween-themed movie ever made, allow me to back up the statement. While 1978's HALLOWEEN is a masterful, amazing thriller that truly has no equal in the horror genre, TRICK 'R TREAT is something wonderfully different. Its a movie that IS Halloween.",/review/rw2684013/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2009,Craig_McPherson,9," Like giving poisoned candy to a baby - only the baby wants more!
","Just when it looked like the anthology movie was dead, along comes Director/Writer Michael Dougherty's Trick 'r Treat to not only breathe new life into this overlooked format, but also firmly establish itself as one of the best films to keep on the shelf and revisit each Halloween – if the folks at Warner Bros. ever decide to release it, either in theaters or to DVD.",/review/rw2684013/?ref_=tt_urv

27 October 2012,Woodyanders,8," Superior Halloween-themed horror anthology winner
","Four horror stories centering on October 31st: Nerdy high school principal Steven (a pleasingly creepy turn by Dylan Baker) moonlights as a vicious serial killer; sweet young virgin Laurie (an excellent and appealing performance by the lovely Anna Paquin) tries to find Mr. Right with gruesome results; a group of teens pull a cruel prank on a strange girl with disastrous consequences; and cranky old coot Mr. Kreeg (a marvelously cantankerous portrayal by Brian Cox) receives a special home visit from mischievous trick-or-treating demon Sam (the adorable Quinn Lord). Writer/director Michael Dougherty relates the entertaining segments at a brisk pace, delivers a handy helping of gore, offers several inspired moments of wickedly funny pitch-black humor, and caps off each vignette with a dandy ghoulish surprise twist. Moreover, Dougherty not only vividly captures the fun spooky ooga-booga midnight-in-the-graveyard spirit of the Halloween season, but also manages to make all the tales overlap and interconnect in a clever and enjoyable way that gives this film an extra satisfying cohesion that a fair share of omnibus fright features tend to lack. Glen MacPherson's crisp widescreen cinematography provides a strikingly sumptuous look. The shivery score by Douglas Pipes hits the stirring spine-tingling spot. A total treat.",/review/rw2684013/?ref_=tt_urv
13 February 2010,cchase,8," It's Not The Tale - It's How It's Told That Counts!!!
","TRICK 'R' TREAT sat by my DVD player for a good little while before I finally popped it in. The most recent mainstream horror offerings have been such letdowns of late, that I proceed with caution on almost anything I see that's not a remake. (And don't get me started on remakes!)

21 August 2009,gregsrants,8," What a treat. Best Halloween film ever produced. BRAVO!
","Over the past 12 months, I have heard countless good things about the horror film, Trick 'r Treat. How it was scary. How it was going to be a huge hit and the most talked about horror film since a hockey masked serial killer started stalking Camp Crystal Lake. How it won the Audience Award at Screamfest and how anyone who has seen the film on the festival circuit has wondered why the hell the film hasn't been recognized with a major distribution deal.",/review/rw2684013/?ref_=tt_urv

","TRICK 'R TREAT (2009) *** Dylan Baker, Anna Paquin, Brian Cox, Leslie Bibb. Devilishly horrific anthology throwback to CREEPSHOW and ""TALES FROM THE DARKSIDE"" in this finely crafted string of interconnected vignettes set on All Hollow's Eve involving werewolves, serial killers, vengeance seeking ghosts and a malevolent spirit all making a heady, cinematic witches' brew perfectly fitful viewing for the holiday or a dark, dank spooky moonlit evening thanks to filmmaker Michael Dougherty's valentine to '80s era horror with enough tongue-thru-cheek humor and genuine dread combining to keep one on the edge of their seats.",/review/rw2684013/?ref_=tt_urv

16 August 2012,rus_ty,8," I wasn't tricked, I was treated!
","Nowadays, there are so many horror films out there that are packed full of mindless gore, repetitive jump scares and little plot. The many sequels of Saw relied on all gore and no story, the Hostel Trilogy is plain sick, (even though the first one was just about OK) and many many others that probably couldn't satisfy the sickest minds. Which brings us the difference between Trick R Treat and all those other terrible horror films out there. ",/review/rw2684013/?ref_=tt_urv
11 October 2008,islandclaws,9," How can a film this good be sitting on the shelf for so long?
","Ah, Halloween my favorite time of the year. It isn't so much the festivities taking place that excites me as it's the feeling in the air once October comes. That palpable sensation you get seeing jack-o-lanterns grimly lit faces, kids trick-or-treating in the streets and the aesthetics of fall surrounding you slowly giving way to winter. I think it must hold a special place in everyone, if for nothing else but purely nostalgic reasons. Mike Dougherty is certainly one of those people, as is evidenced by his incredible horror anthology Trick 'r Treat. For a holiday that revels in films of a horrific nature, there sure are a scant few of them that take place on the actual day itself. Dougherty's film is the celluloid embodiment of that je ne sais quoi that has made Halloween such an alluring holiday for generations of kids (and adults) alike.",/review/rw2684013/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2009,kosmasp,8," Tales from the (Halloween) Crypt
","Well there is not actually a crypt, but the movie that has several story lines, that will keep you on the edge, has a very familiar feeling. And still manages to be fresh and cool. You have really good actors (not only Brian Cox, who's storyline I liked the most), but also a script that can hold all those story lines together, without giving away too much.",/review/rw2684013/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2018,Darth_Osmosis,9," Perfect movie for a Halloween watchlist!
","A wonderful little Halloween movie. There is something almost whimsical about this, but make no mistake it's still a horror movie, albeit a rather strange and unique one! Several different stories intertwine and make up this fine piece of horror. Some stories are stronger than others, but there is no real weak link, they all have their own charm. The atmosphere, humor and just the right amount of horror make it a must watch!",/review/rw2684013/?ref_=tt_urv

1 November 2019,jackmeat,8," Where has this movie been hiding?
","My quick rating 7,5/10. How in the world did this movie sit unwatched by myself for this long? This is an instant classic for Halloween viewing for sure. The flick is an anthology movie of sorts. Each story flows within the context of the whole movie, which is all tied together throughout in such a masterful way, it is near genius. Every bit of scary stories any child in the USA has grown up hearing is reflected in the shorts of this, be it razor blades in candy, or the bus of kids off the cliff, werewolves, vampires, anything that goes bump in the night is all fair game in this film. Michael Dougherty helms the whole shabang and does an incredible job. Each story in its isolation is instantly tied into the story as a whole in a unique way. Much to be said for the editing and continuity department on keeping this all inline. Wonderful shots of decorated homes, great casting including the ever talented Anna Paquin and all the kids really. So much great stuff to be had in this flick. If you haven't seen it, make this top priority on your list for the next All Hallows Eve, as this movie isn't just around the Halloween holiday, but embodies everything Halloween, the day/night is. If this wasn't just an everyday review, I would get into how this movie could be the single best Halloween film ever made just because it is Halloween, whereas the movie ""Halloween"" could be any other day of the year, and still be a masterpiece. ""Trick 'r Treat is Halloween all the way through.",/review/rw2684013/?ref_=tt_urv
5 October 2012,Hey_Sweden,8," Happy Halloween.
","Woe to those that don't keep the spirit of Halloween close to their hearts. That's the lesson learned in this horror omnibus from director Michael Dougherty, who'd written such things as ""X2"", ""Urban Legends: Bloody Mary"", and ""Superman Returns"". He weaves together separate stories that take place on Halloween night, and for Mr. Dougherty and company, it's all about having fun, and delighting in all of the trappings of this time of year. Aided and abetted by a great cast and crew, he's crafted something here that deserves to take its place among other cinematic standards of the season, especially when it comes to his potentially iconic, cute / creepy character, Sam. He doesn't keep this going on any longer than it really should (note the short running time of 83 minutes), and packs his 2.35:1 picture with as many visual delights as possible.",/review/rw2684013/?ref_=tt_urv
