6 March 2008,Mightyzebra,8," TV films like this should really be more well-known.
",This is a TV film based on the book Ballet Shoes. It is about three adopted girls just after the First World War who all have different ambitions for the future.,/review/rw1984202/?ref_=tt_urv
3 February 2008,bondgirl6781,9," Sweet and Charming Little Film
","It is a rare treat to view a film like ""Ballet Shoes."" It's one of the those films where everyone has a piece of the cake of a happy ending but more importantly the film steers away from fluffy clich√©s and mushiness. The story takes place during the 1930s in a small house in London. Sylvia Brown (the luminous Emilia Fox), the niece of eccentric, traveling paleotolongist Great Uncle Matthew aka ""Gum"" who brings along from his travels three orphaned baby girls and it is Sylvia and her plucky Nana (Victoria Wood) that raise the three girls who grow up into fine young ladies with dreams and aspirations. The eldest is Pauline (Emma Watson aka ""Hermoine Granger"") dreams and aspires to be an actress, Petrova (Yasmin Paige) is the tomboyish one of the three and wants to become an aviator, and finally, Posy, the youngest and boldest one of the three has ambitions to become a ballet dancer. But this small family are facing harsh financial times and set their house for room and board. Enter the tenants that impact the girls' and Sylvia's lives: Mr. Simpson (the expressive Marc Warren), a man with a tragic past but a keen interest in cars and airplanes. He is someone Petrova can talk to; The retired scholarly professors Drs. Jakes and Smith (Gemma Jones and Harriet Walter) who take on the task of tutoring the girls; Theo Dane (Lucy Cohu), a professional dancer and actress, who makes the most profound influences on Pauline and Posy. The film tells how the girls struggle with Sylvia to save their home and at the same time pursue their dreams. To add to their struggles, Sylvia is ill and the girls do all they can to provide for her as well. The words I have to describe this little gem are charming and smart. With a wonderful cast delivering equally endearing performances. Emilia Watson is as always lovely and sweet as Sylvia a woman who selflessly gives and gives without ever once asking for repayment with Victoria Wood as Nana providing as a strong front for her and the household. The girls are wonderful: Emma Watson as Pauline is wonderful. She proved me wrong that she really can act and she definitely is more than the Harry Potter franchise. This is a performance that will hopefully carry her even further. Yasmin Paige as the big hearted and adventurous Petrova is a star in the making. Every scene she conveys such honesty and most of all she is real. Lucy Boynton as Posy is very lovely. She brings her character to life as the bold and daring young lady with such grace and maturity. Her scenes with Eileen Atkins, who plays Madame Fidolia a Russian dance instructor and head of a prestigious dance school, are wonderfully done and acted together. The film is sweet, smart, wonderfully acted and written without the added fluff and mumbo jumbo of made for TV films. The only tragedy was that this film wasn't released in the U.S.A theatrically or at least on HBO. This is a little gem I hope to own on DVD.",/review/rw1984202/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2007,julieinbrittany,9," A joy to watch
","This reminded me of the Sunday afternoon dramas that the BBC used to show when I was young. There was nothing to dislike about this; it had charm, an improbable story, over-the-top characters and a real feel of the period it was set in - the thirties.",/review/rw1984202/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2007,GonzoBarbossa,8," Another quality BBC production.
","I'm an American and I always enjoy the productions that the BBC plays. I was really excited about Ballet Shoes. I read the book when I was younger, my copy was destroyed in Katrina so I didn't have time to re-read it. So this review will be short and sweet and about the film itself. The film itself was well done, very seamless and didn't seem to leave any big gaps of unexplained information. The music really help set the mood. Tchaikovsky's Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairies set the mood for all the dancing, which as a dancer was pretty impressive for the three leads, especially Lucy Boyton. And Gershwin Along with Theo's radio help send in the time period (loved Theo!). The costumes and the sets were great. The acting was also fantastic. I don't remember a lot of the book, but I loved Madame Fidolia and Eileen Atkins was superb. I also loved Emilia Fox who is completely lovable and does a great job of bringing Sylvia alive. Richard Griffiths was adorable (horrible word choice, but that's how I feel) in an eccentric paleontologist way. I especially loved Theo and the Dr.'s, they were brought to life and very fun to watch.",/review/rw1984202/?ref_=tt_urv
6 January 2008,Igenlode Wordsmith,5," Stage school becomes soap opera
","It's hard for me to judge how this would go down as a drama in its own right to someone who hadn't read the book; as an adaptation it's heavily 'sexed-up' in several senses at once, and I'm afraid thoroughly irritated me by the end.",/review/rw1984202/?ref_=tt_urv
26 December 2007,mamarieken,8," Three adopted sisters try to achieve their goals with hard work and endurance
","One of my favourite books ever, having trained as a dancer and having children training as dancers we were glued to the box this evening, even though it was boxing day. Not exactly following the story of the book I loved it, and what is more, my adolescent children, cynical and critical, also loved it. Emma Watson is great, as are her 'adopted sisters', not one personage is out of place, and it filmed with loads of love and an eye for beauty and respect to Noel Streatfeild. I still slightly remember the 1975 series and this was just as sweet and nice. The dancing scenes are well executed, the dilemma's the girls are facing as well as those of Narnie are depicted in a good way. As in the book it is very much done with a slight tongue in cheek, never exaggerated feeling of love and harmony. Can't wait for the release of the DVD.",/review/rw1984202/?ref_=tt_urv
8 January 2018,ianlouisiana,8," A good family film.It really should be shown at Christmas.
","Back in the day when we were all reckoned to be ""New Elizabethans"",Noel Streafield's ""Ballet Shoes"" was serialised in an upmarket children's magazine despite being over 15 years old.
With atmospheric illustrations,you could almost smell the plush and velvet,the rosin and the wooden floors of the ballet school.
Principally aimed at teenage girls who today apparently prefer to send indiscreet photos to their boyfriends rather than dream of being ballerinas,this story of three step - sisters living in genteel poverty in a posh part of London touched a chord in many a boy and girl who was taken to the theatre by kindly relatives and had been seduced by the roar of the greasepaint and the smell of the crowd.
This latest incarnation features a cast of TV favourites hamming happily away and letting the young ones have their head.
Particularly notable for me were Miss L.Cohu and Miss E.Atkins but everybody 
pulled their weight and gave every appearance of enjoyment.
On the ""Drama"" channel last night it ensured I went to bed smiling and ever so slightly reassured about human nature.",/review/rw1984202/?ref_=tt_urv
16 February 2008,robert-temple-1,7," Charming and delightful fantasy
","Noel Streatfeild's book 'Ballet Shoes' was read by nearly every English girl who is now a woman over fifty. It was filmed in 1975 and here it is again. If you don't mind the fact that the plot will not stand a close examination (one character disappears for twelve years without explanation, before returning, but no one finds that odd), and if you are willing to watch a film for its fairtytale qualities and sparkle, then you will find this most enjoyable and well done. Most viewers will be female, either women delightfully reminiscing, or young girls still innocent enough to dream (if there are any left who are not already binge-drinking and having sex at the age of ten). Heidi Thomas's script doesn't even try to make sense of the implausible plot, but just gets on with the fun. The film has been very well directed by Sandra Goldbacher, now we hope rescued from the world of television advertising. The story concerns three orphan girls living in a big house whose owner is absent. They are played with tremendous youthful energy and verve by Emma Watson, Yasmin Paige, and Lucy Boynton. They are 'running out of money' and cannot afford dresses, despite the fact that they live in a huge mansion (see page 94), but let's not worry about that inconsistency. One wants to act, one wants to be a ballet dancer, and one wants to be an airplane pilot. Well, why not? They struggle and have vicissitudes, as one must do to succeed, and manage to earn enough money to keep the bailiffs from the door. They are looked after by Emilia Fox, who coughs and becomes increasingly frail and wan but never quite gets the TB that is hinted at, and she falls in love, and is broken-hearted and desolate, but ... well, I ain't sayin' what happens there. Comedienne Victoria Wood is a kind of super-nanny to all, showing her warm heart straight off the AGA, Richard Griffiths is as jolly as ever when he is around, and that is very jolly indeed. Everybody has a great time, and so do we.",/review/rw1984202/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2016,SnoopyStyle,6," nice work by the girls
","Sylvia Brown (Emilia Fox) was a young orphan when she came to live with her paleontologist uncle 'Gum' Great Uncle Matthew. On his many travels, he rescued three baby girls and give them their names. Pauline Fossil (Emma Watson) is rescued from a lifeboat. Petrova Fossil (Yasmin Paige) is a Russian baby. Posy Fossil (Lucy Boynton) is left by her mother with ballet shoes, necklaces, and some money. The girls vow to be in the history books. They take in boarders. The girls get to train in Madame Fidolia's dance school.",/review/rw1984202/?ref_=tt_urv
2 February 2008,Nightgaunt,6," Ooooh so that's what it is
","The reason why I actually saw this movie is cause a girlfriend of mine is a die-hard Harry Potter fan, loves the movies and will look every movie the cast of HP has a part in. So watching this one with her, I had no expectations cause I didn't know what this film was about and to be honest, when it was over I still had no clue whatsoever what this was supposed to be. A drama, a comedy, a vehicle to boost some young talents careers? I had no clue. So after 90 minutes of twists and turns, unlikely coincidences and a kind of rushed happy end I was sitting there uttering the words ""now this is bogus!"". It's not that it was a bad movie per se, we have a very unlikely story, a very good but also very very stereotypically cast set of actors that act over the top, a weird storyline and lots of dancing. So I didn't have the feeling that it was a bad movie, but I still had no idea what this was supposed to be. The only thing I really took from it was that whoever is to direct the next film starring Emma Watson has to botox her forehead back to the stoneage cause her eyebrows have to stop moving when she is acting. I mean I ended up staring at them cause even though there is lots of dancing in the film her eyebrows are the things that move the most. On the other hand, it has been worse in the HP movies. However, it wasn't until I spoke with another friend of mine - another Harry Potter fan and mom of 4 kids - and complained about this film that I was told that this is an adaption of a child book classic. I suppose this was the godmother of all ""duuuuh"" moments someone can have, especially after I was lectured for a solid 15 minutes about how great the book is how her kids love it how much they can learn about the importance of hard work and taking care of each other and yadda yadda yadda plus just cause I'm a guy and not into the Harry Potter stuff I still have no right to badmouth the girl playing Hermione cause it's her fave character in the books. So, knowing that it's a kids book the stereotypical characters make sense and with that in mind the actors casted for the roles actually fit perfect. Richard Griffiths is befuddled and funny as always, Marc Warren can be the shy guy once more just to name a few. And so finally, the twist and turns and the happy end make sense too, so does the fact that I couldn't understand the story, cause it's made for little girls in the 1930s. I guess I really dodged a bullet there, for a few days I thought I was just stupid.",/review/rw1984202/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2008,aura772,8," ~*-It's not just Watson-*~
","Yes, I wanted to watch this movie because of Emma Watson. She is a few month older than I am and I've liked Harry Potter since the first movie came out. Well... Now I'm 17 and I'm not really interested in Harry Potter anymore, but I'll still watch the other movies after they come out.",/review/rw1984202/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2007,didi-5,8," a charming adaptation if not strictly true to the book
","By giving Sylvia a romance by way of deleting Mrs Simpson from the story, this 'Ballet Shoes' is not really that true to the original book. However, in the casting of the three girls (Emma Watson, Yasmin Paige, Lucy Boynton), and scaling up their ages accordingly, it proves a success. With Theo Dane bringing a hint of the 20s flapper to the heart of London, and Eileen Atkins' starched Madame wishing for former glories, it manages to give some poise and heart to the world of the theatre, while retaining some fun and cynicism through Victoria Wood's Nana.",/review/rw1984202/?ref_=tt_urv
11 July 2009,treeline1,," Misses the mark
","The story opens in London in the 1930s, as an eccentric explorer (Richard Griffiths) returns from his adventures with three orphaned baby girls to be raised by his niece (Emilia Fox), while he goes off on another long trip. As the girls become teenagers, they enroll in a theatrical school hoping to earn enough money to support themselves: Posy wants to be a ballerina and Pauline (Emma Watson) wants to be an actress, but Petrova just wants to fly airplanes.",/review/rw1984202/?ref_=tt_urv
27 March 2012,TxMike,," Three orphaned girls in 1930s London grow up to different paths in life.
","I was able to see this on Netflix streaming movies. I was interested mainly because Emma Watson is in it, right in the middle of the many Harry Potter movies. I was curious to see how she acted in a quite different role, and she did very well.",/review/rw1984202/?ref_=tt_urv
1 November 2008,sweet_ophelia16,10," Pleasantly surprised
","Having loved the book growing up, I was bound to see this. I had bought the 1975 BBC version and found it to be absolutely terrible, as it completely mishandled the adaptation. What is surprising is that the 1975 version ran longer and could be argued as being more faithful to the book. Having said that, this version of Ballet Shoes captures the spirit of the story much better. I loved Emilia Fox's Sylvia and the entire cast did very well. I had been a little apprehensive of Emma Watson as Pauline since I'd never seen her as anything but Hermione from the Harry Potter series, but I was pretty happy with the performance after all.

1 July 2009,TheLittleSongbird,9," Charming and well acted, if not strictly true to the book!
","I will confess I haven't read the book for a while, but I do remember it was a wonderful read, with great characters and a sweet story. The TV adaptation was just as charming as the book. The only real thing that undermines it is the changes to the story, so some scenes didn't seem as developed as others, though I will say I am not the sort of person who criticises a film or TV drama on its unfaithfulness to the source material. The adaptation does look lovely, with some stunning costumes and some nice locations. The direction mayn't be the best ever in a TV drama, but I have seen worse in films alone. Remember the incompetent direction in that abomination Home Alone 4? Anyway, back to Ballet Shoes; I thought the acting was excellent. Emma Watson, Yasmin Page and Lucy Boynton are very charming as three ambitious young girls, and they are solidly supported by Emilia Fox(the actress Joanna David's daughter), Gemma Jones, Eileen Atkins and Harriet Walter, and even Richard Griffiths is subdued to a secondary role. The actors are aided by a well written script, and some bits are even touching; I did feel sorry for Petrova when her dancing mentor had a stroke during the ballet performance. I thought that Ballet Shoes was a charming adaptation of an excellent book, but I don't think it is the best TV drama ever made; one truly remarkable TV drama of recent times that does spring to mind is the recent Occupation. 9/10 Bethany Cox.",/review/rw1984202/?ref_=tt_urv

19 September 2008,sashalakeside,10," My New Favorite Movie
","This is such a wonderful movie. I really wasn't sure if i was going to like this movie from just seeing the trailers. Let me tell you if you like films in the Disney type genre you will love this movie , too. The acting is so brilliant. Emma Watson really breaks out of the Hermione role and is magnificent in Ballet Shoes as Pauline Fossy , really wonderful. Lucy Boynton, who plays Posy Fossil the ballet prodigy is spot on with all her lines and delivers two really big laughs. Too funny. Yasmin Paige , the third fossil 'sister' is very good at the intellectual role playing and no doubt we will see her and Boynton on the big screen again very soon. ",/review/rw1984202/?ref_=tt_urv
4 August 2014,maddelise,6," Mixed feelings - good elements, and others not so good
","This was a fairly enjoyable adaptation of Streatfeild's Ballet Shoes. In the beginning there were a few minor details that strayed from the novel, which didn't bother me too much, as they made little difference to the plot overall. However, as the film progressed there were more little things, and a couple of big things that differed from the plot that bothered me.",/review/rw1984202/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2008,richuk-3,6," It is what it is
","It is obvious that this film was made for a younger audience, and as such it is a perfectly good film with a good story and interesting characters that were well acted. Although not being in the targeted age group I enjoyed the film very much too, and it reminded me of the sort of children's drama I enjoyed as a child, it has an innocence and charm which unfortunately could be lost on a modern audience. It was good to see Emma Watson in a film other than the Potter films and I feel it is certain that her career as an actress will give her great success for decades to come. I always find that Emilia Fox gives a credible performance and with the inclusion of Richard Griffiths ,Marc Warren, Lucy Coho and Victoria Wood I would recommend this film to all.",/review/rw1984202/?ref_=tt_urv
7 January 2008,chriseldridge,1," A Shocking, Horrific Debacle - A Disgrace to the Medium
","I tuned in with anticipation to what had been billed as the all-star centrepiece to BBC England's Christmas schedule. Listings names such as Emilia Fox and Richard Griffiths as well as British stage stalwarts, the programme instantly glared of lazy and pretentious direction. The start was tenuous, almost ridiculous, and descended into the depths with wooden acting - the cameo from Victoria Wood must go down as one of the worst performances in living memory. I read about six months ago that Emma Watson had turned down handfuls of roles for the chance to perform in this tripe, and did herself no favours with a supposed sympathetic role of burdened orphan that came across as nothing more than an arrogant, sycophantic spoilt brat. Just when you thought the film was building up to a resurrecting finale, it just faded out - perhaps reflecting the team equally saw how horrific this was and just gave up. This wasn't bad, it was a disgrace.",/review/rw1984202/?ref_=tt_urv

26 September 2017,nurafifahw,6," Ballet Shoes is a 2007 film, directed by Sandra Goldbacher. It is about three girls trying to achieve their dreams.
","At first, Harry Potter's star Emma Watson arguably stands out among the cast. She plays with different type of genre, which is fantasy as she used to play in Harry Potter or Beauty and The Beast. However, as the film progresses, all the cast begins to blend nicely one another, creating a complete narrative of Ballet Shoes as a whole. The visual of the film is enchanting enough, for although Ballet Shoes is set on the Great Depression, the scenes take place on lovely settings: a ballet studio, a theater, a small wood and clearing, a screening of film. The scene of this film also illustrates the situation in London during 20th century with vintage costumes, house, car and even the make-up itself. It may not be the most pleasing film for senses, but it is appealing enough with its British qualities presented through the characters' costumes, for example. ",/review/rw1984202/?ref_=tt_urv

The plot wasn't very good either. It's just not eventful enough. allow me to rephrase that. it wasn't interesting enough.that's it.
