27 February 2022,cahidi,8," A Beautiful Masterpiece Born In Our Era
","I didn't know that this movie is based on a novel. But then again most masterpieces are. The story is really beautiful, the acting is superb, the plot is well executed, the moral of the story is really shown perfectly, the visual is stunning, and the time setting is consistent. There's not many movies made in our time which holds such qualities. I'm glad to have watched this masterpiece. The director, the actors, and the crews deserve standing ovation. Bravo! Keep up the good work!",/review/rw7790183/?ref_=tt_urv

","In any other world, Abigail Cowen would be nominated for an Oscar. It is a lot to ask for a young person to go from broken flower to lady.",/review/rw7790183/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2022,demetriocoffman,9," Here's a movie that is as good as the book.
","I went to end not knowing how the movie would compare to the amazing book. But I was astounded by how well this movie was done. All the characters were perfect, the scenery was amazing and the message of love, forgiveness, faith, and more forgiveness came through. This is a true love story of love stories. Not too often do you get the audience in the theater to clap and to yell out on certain scenes, but in this one they did. I would say this movie is almost perfect.",/review/rw7790183/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2022,ilovefoodcoma,8," Beautifully done

23 January 2022,tsroque,10," Should Have Been a Mini Series!
",This book was too good for a 2-hr film. I absolutely loved it and I saw it with tissues in one hand and popcorn in the other. But there was so much more to each of these characters and their back stories. Like Paul and the shop owner. I was already in love with Tom Lewis from Gentleman Jack. This movie showed he has the charm and swagger of Matthew McConaughey! The actress that played a young Angel was just stunning! She did a fantastic job! Abigail Cowen looks like a young Nicole Kidman and I'm sure we'll be seeing more of her soon.,/review/rw7790183/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2022,sabae12102-186-590341,10," Redeeming Masterpiece
","Have you read the book of Hosea? It's not a Pollyanna fairytale. It's about a prostitute. Prostitution is risqu√©, scandalous and nothing short of moral bankruptcy and impurity. Ironically, this is a picture of us... you and me. We are impure, unfaithful and forever returning to our old patterns and lifestyles. That's why we need God's redemption! God chose the analogy of a prostitute to help us see the immense contrast between our brokenness and His love and redemption.",/review/rw7790183/?ref_=tt_urv
4 April 2022,ebenbanban,9," God's Love in a humans' story
","This is the most inspirational movie that has such a huge impact on me. When you watch it in a shallow view, it's just a love story, but the message is so deep that even though we sin and run away too many times, God's love never change and is still waiting for us.",/review/rw7790183/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2022,kristoffe-brodeur,10," cinematic and engaging
","I really went in after seeing the trailer knowing the cinematic abilities were already going to shine, and I wasn't disappointed with the acting or story line. It was a very dramatic and hard to watch piece at times, and wonderful in others. Even seeing a sunset is a shining moment in this.",/review/rw7790183/?ref_=tt_urv
6 May 2022,traceyleem,10," Powerful and Moving Story
","This is about overcoming things that are not always in your control, you were thrown into them and you were strong enough to come out on top. Even if great people come into your life you have to know you are worthy of their love. I won't overshare but I will just say there were alot of points in this movie that hit hard for me.",/review/rw7790183/?ref_=tt_urv
10 February 2022,Misss25,8," True love does exist
","I'm not a romantic genre lover. However,I loved it. I could just watch the movie all the day. This is so soothing. Machel love for Angel made me believe ''True love actually exists''. It doesn't count on where we come from, what we are? True love means loving selflessly without thinking about getting it back from the person you loved.",/review/rw7790183/?ref_=tt_urv

",A powerful story of true love and redemption based on the best-selling novel of the same title by Francine Rivers.,/review/rw7790183/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2022,tepack,10," Beautifully and Powerfully Inspiring!
",I went with limited expectation. I had read the first edition of redeeming love before it was revised for publication in the Christian genre. That book impacted me In a powerful way! I closed the last page with a deep knowing of God's Love. To my great surprise- Redeeming Love the movie packs the same impact-Well Done!,/review/rw7790183/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2022,salonzoperez,9," love, redeemed
","To start with, I don't really wanna call it a ""Christian film"" due to the elements infused by Hollywood. Calling it such would only raise it as controversial. But the message is strong symbolizing God's love to a repentant sinner. Though, we really couldn't compare it to anything else in this world, the idea was presented well in this story. Thus, personally, I was able to appreciate the whole redemption picture. I really love the film as it is. I fully get the message as to why the cringey scenes were included. Wonderful cast too, they're very convincing. I think they really did a good job.",/review/rw7790183/?ref_=tt_urv
20 February 2022,alex_wiky,10," Powerful!
","Honestly I had doubts before starting the movie. But I must say it was amazing!!! Powerful acting by the cast and love the cinematography. Abigail and Tom did a great job as leads (can't wait to see their future work!)
Thank you youtube for recommending me the trailer <3.",/review/rw7790183/?ref_=tt_urv
29 January 2022,john-570-355877,8," The Book of Hosea
","Excellent modern spin on how God loves us unconditionally. Abigail Cowen was very believably and brought a realism to her role. The story is powerful. Especially the moments that reminded me how much God loves us; when. Michael said, ""You can't change the life you had but you can choose the life you want"". And when Michael didn't go after. Angel, because he wanted her to use her freewill to come back on her own. This is a perfect picture of how God feels about it. Inspiring movie.",/review/rw7790183/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2022,TxMike,," Based on the biblical Book of Hosea, using an 1840s and 1850s old west story.
","Hosea was a minor prophet, in his book the worship of false gods is denounced, metaphorically comparing Israel's abandonment of Yahweh to a woman being unfaithful to her husband. The main character here is Michael Hosea and his wife is Sarah but until the very end only known as Angel. It is a story of hope and redemption. As others urged Michael to forceably bring Angel home he stood steadfast, it has to be her decision to return.",/review/rw7790183/?ref_=tt_urv
22 January 2022,biggerheart,7," time is up
","The romance is good and easy to enjoy. It seems since the COVID pandemic over two years ago, there have been few romantic movies while there should have been more. After all, not everyone is a superhero to save the world but almost anyone can use more warmth from love.",/review/rw7790183/?ref_=tt_urv

30 January 2022,sammig-47718,10," This is what movies are supposed to be.
","Let me start by saying that I don't normally like the romance movies genre (I find it extremely unrealistic). So, I don't want to get all corny here, but I believe this movie will be remembered right alongside ""The Notebook"" as one of the best in the genre. It is an epic love story that every girl dreams of...finding a man that loves her despite her past, and/or her faults. It was gripping from start to finish...not a dull moment over the 2+ hours I watched it in the theater. And that says a lot, as I have an EXTREME case of ADD (which has not been helped by COVID, where I can watch most any movie at home). üòÇ",/review/rw7790183/?ref_=tt_urv
4 February 2022,sagetwo,3," Christian Hallmark movie
","Redeeming Love is built on the hallmark signature; all about cheesy romance and togetherness, but with a dose of christianity. God tells Michael Hosea to marry Angel and he obeys, or how Angel took time to feel worthy of love by God, or the man she was ""assigned."" Angel needs saving, and afterall, she is the most sought-after prostitute. But at the same time, I understand that it can seen as erotic by some devout christians. As an atheist, I also don't like it but for the knight and damsel narrative.",/review/rw7790183/?ref_=tt_urv
24 January 2022,conkat6,7," Good movie better book
","Most readers will agree that books are better than movies and that is the case here. If you didn't read the book and just went to see the movie, you would get a movie for the time and the money. If you read the book, like I did, you will feel cheated of some of the most crucial moments from the book. I don't feel that there were any needless parts in the movie. I can't even tell you how you could've added more. But I do feel like this would've thrived better if it would've been a mini series. There is literally no time to develop character relationships. It also lacked a lot of the faith and the connectivity to the Bible that it's famous for.",/review/rw7790183/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2022,asmith-24280,5," A Guy's Review - 50 Shades of Hypocrisy
","A went to this movie with my wife because she absolutely loves the book. My take is going to be simple. If you're afraid that you're going to see a ""Christian"" movie, fear not. This isn't one. If you're wanting to see a ""Christian"" movie, you'll be disappointed. And don't bring your adolescent kids as the sex and near-nudity are ridiculous and gratuitous.",/review/rw7790183/?ref_=tt_urv
