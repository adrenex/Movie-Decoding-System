8 July 2020,masonsaul,8," Great comedy sequel
","Whilst the plot is basically the same as it's predecessor, The Hangover Part II is still a great comedy sequel. Once again, Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis are all great with really good chemistry and Ken Jeong is also great. Todd Philips' direction is fantastic and it's extremely well filmed and well paced. It's consistently really funny. The soundtrack is great and the music by Christophe Beck is good.",/review/rw2878740/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2011,ferguson-6,6," It' Happened Again ... And Again
","Greetings again from the darkness. Two years ago, director Todd Phillips presented a highly creative, hilarious, raunchy, unique film comedy called The Hangover. And now, he does it again. He presents that SAME film again. I am unsure whether this is a sequel or remake. The only substantial change is the setting ... Bangkok instead of Vegas.",/review/rw2878740/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2011,Smells_Like_Cheese,4," Copy and Paste
","2009 wasn't exactly the best year for movies, but out of that year we did get a comedy that will last for years to come, The Hangover. When I heard that there was going to be a sequel, I was telling my friends that I had a feeling that this was being made for the money. After all, The Hangover made over 200 million dollars world wide, they are going to milk it for everything that it's worth. Plus what made the first Hangover so great was that as crazy as their night was and outrageous, in some strange way it was believable where we've been so drunk we couldn't remember the night before and somehow did the most insane things. How is this supposed to happen again and be believable? But I loved the first Hangover so much that I went into this just hoping it was going to be a good time and sadly, it was exactly as I feared, this was made for money because it was nothing but copy and paste.",/review/rw2878740/?ref_=tt_urv
7 July 2011,garrettthebeast7,9," Hilarious! A worthy sequel to a comedy classic!
","After seeing The Hangover in 2009, I could not wait for Part II to be released and it was worth it. I really don't get why people are saying this movie sucks because it has the same plot. What do they expect? Of course Todd Phillips is gonna use the same formula as the original but it works with this one. I can honestly say while Phillips did take this one a step up with how crude and nasty the jokes are, it still made me fall out of my seat laughing, especially Alan's new attitude in this. To me, the only thing that would make The Hangover Part II a failure is if Alan was the one the trio ended up losing the night before. Without him, The Hangover movies would suck! Sure, we got Phil's sarcasm and the craziness of Ed Helms but Alan is the one with it all. Overall, I give it a 9/10.",/review/rw2878740/?ref_=tt_urv
26 May 2011,diac228,6," A raunchy, funny roller coaster you've already ridden before
","Select All. Cut. Open New Document. Paste. Thesaurus. Print. I can nearly guarantee you this was the process in writing the sequel to the most successful R-rated comedy of all-time. In one of the craziest and most blatant filmmaking moments of carbon copying an earlier installment I have ever witnessed Hangover II paces, moves, and delivers in the exact same method, style and speed as the original. The musical transitions are the same, some of the set-ups are the same, some of the conflicts and revelations were eerily alike and worst of all, the entire third act felt like the original----and they are thousands of miles from the United States. Every strength in this movie is deterred by the fact that Todd Phillips and company put no effort in trying to change things up a little aside from setting.",/review/rw2878740/?ref_=tt_urv
18 February 2021,eldreddsouza,9," Bangkok!!!!
","What crazy fun this movie was. I don't know if the people giving it bad reviews are those who this film wasn't intended for or what, but yeah this film is completely wild and crazy. Bangkok, you beauty! Todd Philips did an excellent job showing around the craziness that goes down in this city and making perfect use of its notoriety. I have lost count of the number of times I have watched this beautiful film. I guess it's just the spectacular Bangkok scenery I watch it for half the times, idk, but yeah each time it's just as much fun as the last.",/review/rw2878740/?ref_=tt_urv

Doug is back at the resort, but Lauren's brother Teddy is missing. There's a monkey with a severed finger, Alan's head is shaved, Stu has a tattoo on his face, and they can't remember any of it.

28 May 2011,gregeichelberger,3," Even Alka-Seltzer won't cure this 'Hangover'
","In a classic case of going to the well just once too often, ""Hangover, Part II"" should be a lesson to all directors and screenwriters that what sets a successful sequel apart is SOME kind of divergence from the original movie's plot.",/review/rw2878740/?ref_=tt_urv
2 November 2012,lesleyharris30,8," A Good Sequel, despite borrowing Too Much from the Original,
","The Hangover Part II is a great movie with a well written plot and a terrific comedic cast. As far as sequels go, I found it to be a very solid one that lives up to the fun and mayhem of its predecessor, taking the characters to new heights and higher risks. It had me in stitches, as well as enthralled by this adventure. ",/review/rw2878740/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2011,KnightsofNi11,6," Funny, but don't expect the original
","Remember that one movie that came out in 2009 called The Hangover? Of course you do. It was only one of the most talked about films of the summer, surprising everyone as one of the funniest comedies in a long time. Two years later it was only fitting that a sequel be made so that we could relive the original Hangover fervor and kick off summer 2011 with a bang. Well, the basic rule of thumb for a sequel is that it either a) needs to be a continuation of the story from the first film or b) tell a new story with the same characters. The Hangover Part II decided to invent their own option c) which is to tell the exact same story all over again, but just changing a few details.",/review/rw2878740/?ref_=tt_urv
27 May 2011,treeskier802,6," Unfortunately Predictable Relying On Same Gags
","What made The Hangover fun and entertaining unfortunately leads to predicatability in The Hangover II. The only reason I got any enjoyment out of this movie at all was because I liked the characters in the first movie. I wish they had tried to do something fresh with the story and the characters, but it was the same old gags.",/review/rw2878740/?ref_=tt_urv
27 June 2011,bernierb,9," Still fun and a good time to have to
","This movie was a lot of fun to watch. The cast is funny as always and the story is very good. For those complaining just don't watch it, simple as that. A comedy is probably the hardest type of movie to write because it has to be ""funny"" and it hard nowadays to write something funny because most of everything funny has been done over and over.That being said, you can go different ways in your comedy but this movie is the type of comedy i like,it has a plot, is mature and it not a brain dead mishmash of stupid things or stunts or language that a lot of younger kids like. It is old fashion comedy and i hope they do more of this series.",/review/rw2878740/?ref_=tt_urv

16 February 2013,g-bodyl,9," Predictable But Hilarious!
","The second installment in the Hangover franchise is very predictable since it almost exactly follows the plot line from the first film, but for some whatever odd reason, I laughed more in this film and thought the gags were a little better. The first film is a comedy classic, but this is just the film you wouldn't want to take too seriously. My favorite character in this film was the capuchin monkey because he was adorable and funny.",/review/rw2878740/?ref_=tt_urv
1 June 2011,george.schmidt,9," Hysterically funny follow-up to the out-of-nowhere blockbuster comedy keeps the 'Wolfpack' back for action
","THE HANGOVER PART II (2011) ***1/2 Ed Helms, Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, Justin Bartha, Ken Jeong, Paul Giamatti, Jamie Chung, Mason Lee, Jeffrey Tambor, Sasha Barrese, Gillian Vigman, Nick Cassavetes, Crystal The Monkey (cameo as himself: Mike Tyson) Hysterically funny follow-up to the out-of-nowhere blockbuster comedy keeps the 'Wolfpack' back for action along the same lines except instead of Las Vegas they head to Bangkok for more of the same in their fractured-memory evening of debauchery with groom-to-be, mild-mannered dentist Stu (Helms); Abbott & Costello (ah, Cooper and Galifianakis) and his future-brother-in-law (Lee, son of filmmaker Ang Lee) MIA; a very angry gangster (Giamatti having fun); a return visit from Mr. Chow (hilarious Jeong) and the scene-stealing, chain-smoking, drug-dealing monkey (Crystal) all attempting to fit the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle of their lives. Director Todd Phillips – who co-wrote with Craig Mazin & Scot Armstrong – gets in touch with his inner Harold Ramis (a good thing!) – mixing the numbskull slapstick with some emotions and going decidedly darker (a severed finger; a trip to a he/she strip joint and the 'death' of a character) fuel the fires of familiarity yet on the whole it's still gut-bustingly FUNNY and rapid fire in sight gags/zingers and one-liners that requires several trips to get them all in !",/review/rw2878740/?ref_=tt_urv
28 May 2011,pauljraab,4," Predictable to the point of boredom
","I had modest expectations, they weren't met. This is Hollywood milking a successful movie with a contrived followup. This is the same movie. The jokes are the same, just dirtier and more low-brow to get shock reaction. This is like the joke ""the Aristocrats"". Same joke as before, just dirtier and more disgusting. Drug overdoses, kidnapping and hiding bodies as a premise for a comedy isn't entertainment, it's desperation to go ""over the top"" without originality. The interaction with the lady-boys was obvious and a cliché for Bangkok humor. It's the Heather Graham joke from the first movie with a little sodomy mixed into it. The inappropriate observations and comments by Alan that made the first movie clever just push the envelope but don't even feel awkward anymore. If your brand of humor falls along the lines of ""the more disgusting and grotesque the better"" than this is your movie. If you want some creativity and originality for your money, don't bother. I gave it a 4 instead of a 3 only because of the monkey.",/review/rw2878740/?ref_=tt_urv

","I recently caught up with Hangover II during an early press screening held in Tel Aviv, Israel, and it was by far one of the best films I've seen all year - and most definitely the best comedy. After being horribly disappointed by The Dilemma, grinned occasionally at Hall Pass and Just Go With It (but not really carried away by either), it was about time we got a decent 2011 comedy - and here it is.",/review/rw2878740/?ref_=tt_urv

29 May 2011,lolabeningfield,5," Re-hashing of Old Material
","I was really optimistic going into the theatre, I didn't expect it to as great as the original, but I thought it would still be good movie. But most of the material was stuff taken from the original only tweaked, and I hate to say it but I was actually bored for a good part of the movie. Some of the jokes/scenes dragged to long, to the point where I didn't find them funny anymore. There were some good moments, but the truly outrageous/original scenes that made the original so great were too few and far between. Some of the scenes were more outrageous in the sense that there was some full frontal nudity, but I'm not someone who finds that super entertaining. Overall it felt to me like a re-hash of stuff that had already been done with some naked people thrown in, and it just wasn't enjoyable like the first movie.",/review/rw2878740/?ref_=tt_urv
29 May 2011,lisa-629,5," How much lazier can Hollywood get?
","If you loved the original, then you will love this one. The reason being is that part II is the carbon copy of its predecessor, and reinforces the idea that laziness is running rampant throughout Hollywood. Lets rundown the similarities, shall we: 1-Movie starts out with Stu's wedding in Thailand. 2-The men wake up and don't remember a thing. 3-Stu hasn't lost a tooth this time, he has a face tattoo. 4-No baby, but an adorable coke snorting, cigarette smoking monkey. 5-Doug isn't missing, but the bride's younger brother Teddy. 6-No missing tooth this time, but a missing finger, which just so happens to belong to Teddy. 7-Follow a hot lead to find Teddy, but it turns out to be a Buddhist monk (black Doug reference). 8-In order to piece together the previous night, the guys head to a strip club run by the very same guy that ran the Wedding Chapel from part one. 9-It is also at the strip club, like the chapel in part one, that we learn that Stu is cheating on his fiancé-part one was a stripper, this time a stripper with a weiner! 10-Then the return of Teddy lays in the hands of Mr Chow and him transferring money to a Russian mobster who supposedly has custody of Teddy, just as Mr. Chow supposedly had custody of Doug in the original, with neither having custody of their supposed missing friends. 11-The phone call from Phil claiming they had F*&*ed up. 12-Just as in the original, Stu has an epiphany and figures out where Teddy is, stuck in the hotel elevator. 13-The guys make it to the wedding just in time. 14-The guys end the film sitting together when Teddy finds his phone and all the pictures that they are going to all look at once, but then delete. Its funny, sure, but it's really just embarrassing to come to terms with the knowledge that these writers think that the viewers of this movie are so stupid that they won't mind the similarities. I say similarities, but it's just down right the same movie in a different city. My response to the writers and to the director Todd Philips is, How dare you?! Didn't you make a butt load of money? Didn't this movie get nominated for a ton of awards? You couldn't afford some real writers? Or did you just not care enough about your viewers to give us something different?",/review/rw2878740/?ref_=tt_urv

4 January 2012,kosmasp,7," Same mayhem, different city
","Of course the premise is more or less the same. But it's not like all the jokes that were funny in the first Hangover get repeated here. It's in the same style and if you didn't like the first one (yes indeed there are quite a few who didn't enjoy the first Hangover), then you will not like this one either.",/review/rw2878740/?ref_=tt_urv
30 September 2013,callanvass,4," A lazy rehash of the original, without the laughter or fun
","I'm a big fan of the first Hangover. It was hilariously raunchy, but this sequel is the epitome of laziness. Like most movies that are brilliant, they make sequels and somewhat tarnish the impact of the original. There is no passion, and the only purpose this movie serves is to cash in on the original's tremendous success. In many ways, it's the very same movie as the original, only it takes place in Bangkok. I didn't catch myself laughing. I did chuckle a couple times, but that's it. The trio of Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis is as reliable as ever, but I don't understand the appeal of Ken Jeong. He is so obnoxious, and he's not even funny. Giving him as much screen time as they did was a huge mistake in my view. ",/review/rw2878740/?ref_=tt_urv
