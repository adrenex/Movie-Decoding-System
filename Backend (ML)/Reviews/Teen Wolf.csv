17 March 1999,Stephen-12,10," A slow burner, a fine achievement
","Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.",/review/rw5562204/?ref_=tt_urv
13 October 2011,TheLittleSongbird,10," Incredible
","I don't think I have been this moved by a movie in a while. Good Will Hunting is an incredible movie and if I had to say what I think is Gus Van Sant's best film, this would be it. It is a slow-burner, but I think this was purposefully done and it added to the film's poignancy and psychological aspect.",/review/rw5562204/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2001,rondine,10," This movie has a brilliant script...
","It appears the jury is hung... many people either loved or hated this movie. I can tell you why I loved it. First of all the script. I think it had a real slice of life, and brilliance in it. Sorry, but some people do use 4 letter words to express themselves. And no, it doesn't mean that's because they lack intelligence to use anything else. I can rise to the occasion any time I need w/out profanity. But it is how I think & speak in my day to day life. The language shouldn't even be an issue. If that's all you heard, you weren't listening! The brilliance in it is everywhere. For example, William's character putting Damon's character in place by noting that he sneers at things that he has no real life experience with. I know people like that. Then moments when he (William's character) says gems like, ""I'll save you the suspense sport- she isn't perfect & neither are you- the question is whether you are perfect for each other."" I'm paraphrasing of course. The question of relationships, and life career decisions- the courage to risk and overcoming whatever your background is, are all a part of real life. This isn't supposed to be about genius or some ""white trash"" as someone else said (some people might say the kids in this movie aren't trash, just normal hard working, middle class guys) - it's about love, life and courage- courage to ante up & try again, no matter how many times life knocks us around. The acting, direction and script are wonderful. They definitely deserved the Oscar for this. It has soul. It has meaning & I am sad for the people that didn't get it. As the movie ""American Beauty"" said... LOOK CLOSER.",/review/rw5562204/?ref_=tt_urv
3 September 2008,bkoganbing,10," The Genius In Our Midst
","So many personal projects of our best players never come out quite right. The vision they have somehow doesn't translate to the screen, or it's not box office subject matter, or maybe the actors aren't gifted with writing or directing talent. That's certainly not the case with Good Will Hunting which was not only the breakthrough film for Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, but it will probably remain their most personal endeavor.

29 October 2008,RedRoadster,9," ""I had to go see about a girl""
","This is one of those films that you cant help walking away from without being touched in some way. All of the central themes to adult life are explored and exposed by a very good cast. Friendship, love, pain, the past holding back who we could be in the present, acceptance (or not) of our place in society.",/review/rw5562204/?ref_=tt_urv
18 June 2000,Eight Two,," The Real Best Picture of 1997
","While everyone took sides with L.A. Confidential (for it's Old Hollywood flair and tight-as-a-girdle plot arc) or Titanic (for it's generally inescapable, juggernaut-like aura) as the Best Picture of 1997, it seems that too many people overlook Good Will Hunting for what it was:  a timeless little opus that managed to make South Boston look romantic and happened to make Ben Affleck and Matt Damon some of the most deserving superstars in recent memory.",/review/rw5562204/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2000,harry-76,8," Two Pals Make Good in Hollywood
","Matt Damon and Ben Affleck scored quite a success with their interesting and entertaining script.  The introduction and exposition sections are enormously engrossing, after which script peaks and rather coasts along the rest of the way.  Yet, the casting is so well done, and the acting at such good level, that interest is nicely maintained.",/review/rw5562204/?ref_=tt_urv
22 June 2017,Bored_Dragon,9," Beautiful
","I return to this movie from time to time for the last two decades. I do not like Damon and Affleck, but this is their lifetime achievement and the most deserved Oscar they will ever win. Beautiful drama about finding yourself, finding a balance between the essence of life and its everyday appearance, about love and friendship. Realistic, unpretentiously philosophical and warm movie about life. Two main trumps of this movie are its perfect script and brilliant Robin Williams, the actor that adds warmth and love in everything he does. I can not say it's a masterpiece of cinematography, but it surely is beautiful, intelligent and it never gets old.",/review/rw5562204/?ref_=tt_urv

28 December 2016,Hitchcoc,10," A Sensitive, Remarkable Look at Genius
","Matt Damon's Will Hunting couldn't be more complex. He is an utter genius. Unfortunately, he has enough baggage to send him around the world. Will is a brilliant mathematician, smarter than many of the professors at MIT. However, he is depressed and self destructive. He gives up the minute things get hard. He can't relate to others, especially women. After many failures to help him, he hooks up with a man who respects him (but who also fears his insights) played by Robin Williams in one of his finer dramatic roles. He pushes Will and Will pushes back. The interaction between two imperfect, but brilliant, human beings is the core of this movie. Created by Damon and Ben Affleck, this was probably the best movie of the year. Will Hunting is searching for happiness, as are we all, but others have decided what that happiness looks like. He is indeed ""hunting"" for joy in his life. Excellent performances all around.",/review/rw5562204/?ref_=tt_urv
21 January 2019,minister_of_silly_walks,10," Thought provoking classic
",One of the movies which turned Robin Williams into a legend! He proved in this movie that he is as good in his dramatic roles as in his comedic routines. Pair that with a great performance from Matt Damon as the tittle character and an inspiring story built upon the everyday struggle of the characters and you got yourself a 90's cinematic classic.,/review/rw5562204/?ref_=tt_urv
29 September 2019,jrarichards,10," Inspired genius ABSOLUTELY worth revisiting in 2019 - COMPULSORY for first-timers
","This is a stunningly good bit of Damon-Affleck co-writing from an astonishing 22 years ago), directed by Gus Van Sant and offering outstanding roles, not only to the aforementioned pair (who absolutely shine together), but also to Minnie Driver, plus Stellan Sktarsgard and Robin Williams (another amazing pairing).",/review/rw5562204/?ref_=tt_urv

27 February 2018,Pjtaylor-96-138044,8," Its central performances are phenomenal and its inevitable emotional release is truly powerful.
","The genius of 'Good Will Hunting (1997)' isn't in its plotting or its resolution or even its character arcs per say (which are all a little formulaic or clichéd to an extent), but rather in the nuanced and realistic journey that that these almost fully-formed people take to reach the conclusions you know they eventually will. The two central performances are nothing short of phenomenal. Williams' subtly wise and humorous demeanour exudes fatherly knowledge as a man of experience and Damon's frustratingly yet understandably closed-off defensiveness makes his inevitable emotional release truly powerful. The writing rounds them off in ways which make them feel honest, imperfect and, most importantly, real. 8/10",/review/rw5562204/?ref_=tt_urv
15 November 2017,classicsoncall,10," ""So what do you really wanna do?""
","For a couple of guys in their Twenties, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck brought a lot of insight into their screenplay treatment for ""Good Will Hunting"". Especially good is the dialog that occurs between Will (Damon) and therapist Sean (Robin Williams) in their various exchanges that span the confrontational to the healing. You have to wonder where those nuggets of wisdom came from for the characters to deal with each other in such a credible fashion.",/review/rw5562204/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is a screenplay, whose script was written by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon and sold for $ 600,000. (They split the proceeds)I love this movie. I have seen it several times, and I still want more at the end (Isn't that what good movies do to you?) The subplots make for mini-movies of their own, especially the interplay between Robin Williams' character and Stellan Skarsgard's character.",/review/rw5562204/?ref_=tt_urv

","Will Hunting (Matt Damon) and Chuckie Sullivan (Ben Affleck) are best friends and ruffians from south Boston. MIT Prof. Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgård) always puts a challenging problem outside his class for his students. Will is on parole, given a janitorial job and solves the problem. Lambeau is surprised that nobody claims the solution and puts another problem up. He catches the janitor doing the solution and helps him in his trial for hitting a cop. Will is a mess. He's an orphan who suffered as a foster child. He meets Skylar (Minnie Driver) but can't quite open up to her until he starts seeing Dr. Sean Maguire (Robin Williams). Maguire is Lambeau's last resort. They were college roommates and he is suffering from the lost of his wife.",/review/rw5562204/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2021,RonellSowes,8," Thoughtful Warm Film
","For the longest period of time I never understood the title of this film. Was it about someone on some Diogenes style quest? Or was was it about someone who scowers thrift stores? Well, it has nothing to do with good will or Goodwill, it's about a young man called Will Hunting. He's a(somewhat unrealistic)genius who can solve math problems that baffle the world's greatest minds and knows twice as much on any subject covered in a Harvard class...yet he works as a janitor. A professor at MIT stumbles across and sets him up with a therapist, who tries to counsel Will while drilling to the core of his problems.",/review/rw5562204/?ref_=tt_urv
5 July 2019,heisenberg12,8," Good but overrated and overhyped
","It's a good movie; the premise is its best point, as well as the human connection between friends and relationships, but so many reviews on here calling this a masterpiece or one of the best movies ever made are way unwarranted and over the top. It's a good low budget movie with some depth and a famous role for Robin WIlliams, who won the best supporting actor Oscar. The script is good, but not great, the directing is slightly above average, it drags at times, and some little aspects of it are unrealistic. It's definitely good and worth a watch, but it's not one of the greats of all time.",/review/rw5562204/?ref_=tt_urv

","A film growing up in yourself. It is so simple to say about it be great, admirable, profound touching or remarkable. But ,in obvious manner, it is more than a film. The reasons are many and few from them are only emotions. A beautiful script as the impressive job of two young actors, A magnificent Robin Williams and a seductive end. At the first sigh, a film in which you recognize yourself. But it is more, nuanced, precise and inspired portrait of potential, help, life meaning , love and the most profound truth defining yourself and your world.",/review/rw5562204/?ref_=tt_urv
23 October 2017,clacura,10," A Movie About Men: The Internal Fight Club
","Why another review? Well, for the few that might read this, I find this movie very accurate about the state of seeing a counselor. It is also very accurate about a man who carries deep toxic shame within keeping him from intimacy with others and living with massive defense mechanisms. Because of this, I understand why some do not like this movie, it taps a part of themselves they are still running from, and that is why this movie is so powerful.",/review/rw5562204/?ref_=tt_urv
