6 June 2019,view_and_review,3," Another Classic Ruined
","I guess the main question is why. Why did they make this sequel? Why was the story so bad? Why were the characters so bad? Why did they take a classic movie and dump on it? More importantly, why did I watch it?",/review/rw6469310/?ref_=tt_urv

23 September 2018,antant-13838,2," CGI predator. No thanks.
","Completely took the beauty away from this graceful monster. In a nutshell, it's so confused. Is it a marvel film is it a kids film or is it a genre film. The script is horrendous even though I did laugh, but that just made me sad. The characters are just, well pointless. There's zero suspense. There is some good ideas in there but nothing to redeem it. Why are studios so scared to just slow down and make a descent horror film. It's the predator fgs how can you screw this up, And a cgi predator that's just the worst way to go. If your not a fan don't bother if you are a fan definitely don't bother. Very very disappointing.",/review/rw6469310/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2019,BA_Harrison,1," Black and Dekker: they've got the tools, but this is a bodge job.
","Having written and directed 1986 horror classic Night of the Creeps, Fred Dekker teamed up with Shane Black the following year to give us enjoyable kids monster movie The Monster Squad. Black would go on to write action classics Lethal Weapon, The Last Boy Scout, and The Long Kiss Goodnight. With these guys behind this reboot of the Predator franchise, I figured fans were in for a real treat.",/review/rw6469310/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2018,zogarreal,2," The Death of a Franchise
","This has to be the biggest pile of garbage I have seen in a long time. Shane Black has just killed the Predator franchise. The plot makes no sense. The tone is all over the place. A genetic scientist suddenly becomes a super soldier. A vicious alien dog becomes friends with the good guys playing fetch (I'm serious). The super predator looks like a pissed off wrestler with bad CGI. The harvesting human DNA plot is handled ridiculously. The fact that an autistic kid can read predator language and is wanted by both predators is bloody bizarre. The jokes are constant and irritating that it's more of a comedy than a sci-fi thriller, actually it doesn't knoe what it is. Ugh bloody awful, good fun if you're 7 years old I suppose. Don't go near this nonsense. AvP Requiem is a masterpiece compared to this tripe.",/review/rw6469310/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2018,TheLittleSongbird,4," Predator evolution
","The 'Predator' film series is a mixed bag, with the best being the 1987 film (a great film on its own) and its follow-up, the only great ones from personal opinion. Was actually really intrigued into seeing 'The Predator', despite hearing numerous bad things about it, and saw it anyway with an open mind. Just to make that clear in answer to the condescending accusations made by those defending the film without taking into account that those who didn't did see the film and simply didn't like it legitimately.",/review/rw6469310/?ref_=tt_urv
13 September 2018,letande,1," The New Bottom
","Like everybody else back in 1987, I was really impressed by Predator. It was pretty simple and straightforward movie, but it introduced a pretty neat and unique concept and, well, there was something special about the atmosphere. ""...the jungle... it just came alive and took him."" It was awesome. Unfortunately, sequel suffered from some seriously poor writing, while Aliens versus Predator franchise turned out to be a complete disaster. Everybody knows that and everybody wanted Predator franchise to return to its former glory one day. That's why I had some hope for this one. I seriously did. That's why I bought a ticket and went to see it the day one. I really expected to see a good Predator movie. I mean, there was no way they'll make a bad movie after all those big expectations, right? RIGHT? Well... I was naÃ¯ve...",/review/rw6469310/?ref_=tt_urv
23 February 2020,mckinleybrooksmorton,2," Its like it was made for 12 year olds
","Not a good film by any stretch. A lot of nonsensical action set pieces that are laughably implausible, strung together by a story that really diminished the groundwork set down in Predator. No one, despite massive amounts of money, seems capable of getting close to the trills, scares, and rich tone of the original film. Doesn't really feel like anyone is trying for more than dollar bills at the boxoffice.",/review/rw6469310/?ref_=tt_urv

17 September 2018,MpGrill,1," The predatory comedy reboot movie
",Instead of a predator movie all we got is to see a mediocre action comedy movie with the predator storyline being more of a side play instead of the main act. Less than a sixth ( 1/6 ) of the movie is based around the predator while the whole other parts center more around a bunch of two sentence characters fighting generic villain soldiers. The plot is ridiculous out of point and completely unrealistic. A franchise ruined.,/review/rw6469310/?ref_=tt_urv
22 August 2020,Jaggermaster,1," What....?
","Unbelievable $hit! Incredibly stupid movie! I'd rather watch Alien vs Predator from here to eternity if that'll make this movie ""disappear"". I can't believe it's the same guy who wrote Lethal Weapon and The last boyscout wrote this pos of a ""movie"".",/review/rw6469310/?ref_=tt_urv

","What a train wreck of a movie!! Absolute garbage. 
Dumbass story, crap actors, one stupid decision after another, really generic and bad background score. This was disrespectful of the predator franchise. Forget the first two movies (this isn't even on the same continent as far as quality is concerned), even the AVP series was better. 
And the jokes...OH MY GOD THE JOKES...totally forced and lameass. ",/review/rw6469310/?ref_=tt_urv
25 November 2018,ParallelFalchion,1," I made an imdb account to warn people
","This killed the Predator franchise. Completely.
Never have I watched a more awkward film.
Confusing plot.
F-bombs every thirty seconds.
A scientist suddenly able to run faster than Usain Bolt.
Some kid learns the Predator language in seconds.
1000 feet falls, yet no one breaks anything.
You get the point.
And this movie gave off so much awkward energy. I was watching with someone extremely close, and we normally make multiple jokes during movies, but none of us made a single one. I was itching to ask if they were okay with watching something else. No one said a word between the movie started, and an hour into the film. And if you're curious what those first words were... it was: ""Hi, can I have a large cheese pizza and medium hot wings?""
This film is unforgiving, and sadly, my least favorite movie. Ever.
Spare yourselves.
Please don't watch it.",/review/rw6469310/?ref_=tt_urv
18 September 2018,michaelmccann-1,2," Predacrap!
","It was like watching a sequel in a franchise when there's been 10 previous films and they were out of ideas. The location was wrong, the characters were wrong, the story was wrong, everything was wrong. It was very childish, every line in the film was trying to be funny. A kid had a major role...really? A kid? I thought I was watching a Disney film. The CGI was terrible, I felt I was watching a cheap TV series. It was funny at some points but it really is a bad film overall. The real Predator looked amazing, great suit and animatronics, but the CGI predahulk was terrible. I was gutted watching thisðŸ˜ªðŸ˜ª",/review/rw6469310/?ref_=tt_urv
7 June 2019,hitchcockthelegend,3," A crushing disappointment.
","The hopes were high for this latest Predator rebirth, not because Shane Black starred in the great first Predator film, so therefore he surely must care about the project? But because he's an excellent writer and director. Shane Black can count Lethal Weapon(S), The Last Boy Scout and The Long Kiss Goodnight on his CV, he was the man who put Iron Man back on track after the sag of part 2. Plus he is the creator of two of the best buddy buddy neo-noirs this millennium (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang/The Nice Guys), So how come The Predator stinks of lazy cash cow manure?",/review/rw6469310/?ref_=tt_urv
17 September 2018,hbreed99,1," AVP2: ""I'm the worst movie of the franchise!"" The Predator: ""Hold my beer""

13 September 2018,moviexclusive,3," Just when you thought you had seen the worst of the 'Predator' movies, along comes this relentlessly loud, hopelessly dumb and needlessly convoluted mess
","You've got to hand it to Shane Black - just when you thought that the 'Predator' series couldn't sink any lower than 2004's 'AVP: Alien vs. Predator', along comes his entry so aggressively determined to run the franchise to the ground. That is indeed ironic, considering just how much promise 'The Predator' once held. For one, it sure sounded like a good idea on paper to inject Black's signature brand of black humour into the original's blend of gory violence and souped-up machismo; for another, the cast comprising Sterling K. Brown, Trevante Rhodes, Jacob Tremblay, Olivia Munn, Boyd Holbrook and Keegan-Michael Key was an impressive ensemble to say the least. Yet by the end of a headache-inducing 107 minutes, you'd be struggling to understand how a Hollywood veteran like Black could screw up so  horribly.",/review/rw6469310/?ref_=tt_urv
