8 September 2015,bmck-1,10," Geraldine McEwan is outstanding!
","I read and enjoyed all the Agatha Christies when I was a teenager. Despite this I love these adaptions, and I enjoy the new twists we get in the screenplays.",/review/rw8842558/?ref_=tt_urv
30 December 2013,TheLittleSongbird,," Entertaining and interesting but not an easy series to rate
","As a big Agatha Christie fan, whenever a new Marple is on regardless of any initial dubiousness I never miss it. The ITV Marple series does have some good entertainment value and is not as bad as it has often been dismissed as, it is well made, has good acting on the whole and is fun. But it is also very difficult to rate, because the adaptations are a very mixed bag quality-wise. And this has little to do with infidelity to the books(which is the biggest and most common criticism of the series), even as a fan of Christie I have always been a firm believer of judging adaptations on their own terms as long as it doesn't feel dull and makes sense.",/review/rw8842558/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2015,Sleepin_Dragon,10," It's a wonderful series.
","I was absolutely gutted when the BBC regained the rights of Agatha Christie from ITV, there were still a few stories that could have been done to feature Miss M, The Seven dials mystery being one.",/review/rw8842558/?ref_=tt_urv

28 July 2016,grantss,7," Watchable, despite the blandness of the lead character
","A series of adaptations of Agatha Christie novels, with Miss Jane Marple as the central character. A seemingly innocuous elderly woman with no background in criminal investigation, she has a knack for solving crimes, particularly murder.",/review/rw8842558/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2015,Janet1612,1," Forget this, read the book or watch the Joan Hickson version
","I read the book some years ago and enjoyed it, even though it was a little scary. This fiasco is nothing like the story told by Ms Christie and makes a mockery of a decent book. Geraldine McKewen is awful as Marple ( but then wait until you see Julia McKenzie she's even worse). In this 3rd rate adaptation we have a band of actors who have no reason to be there. It seems the makers had budget problems and spent it on poor script writers and even poorer actors (Dawn French!) It should state that it is LOOSELY BASED on the novel. It's a gripping tale of a woman from New Zealand who comes to England with her husband.She was told she was born and raised Iin NZ, but on house hunting she is drawn to a particular house and buys it. As she decorates and makes changes to the house, lots of coincidences occur and memories of being in the house before..........Please buy the Hickson version. It's filmed in Sidmouth, Devon.",/review/rw8842558/?ref_=tt_urv
14 September 2020,squall41269-550-364332,1," Lesbians really?
","I watched this series to get away from the normal bs on TV. They added a pair of lesbians to the body in the library where they didn't need to be. Why was that needed? It wasn't. I'm gay, and that was uncalled for, they need to STOP ruining everything with modern things that were never in the novel to begin with.",/review/rw8842558/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2020,lowefreddy,10," One of my favourite television series of all time.
","'Agatha Christie's Marple' is a fantastically directed, wonderfully filmed, all-round SUPERB TV series that retains both the atmosphere and irresistible charm of the author's source material, even when it deviates from the strict plots. As Joanna Lumley says in the 'Behind the Scenes on Series 5', as long as people will read and enjoy things, they will read Agatha Christie, and as long as people watch things, they will enjoy productions of her work. She is one of the best authors to have ever lived. I think it's something of a shame that BBC have regained the rights to her work because ITV and Agatha Christie are a match made in heaven. They nailed it with David Suchet's Poirot and they nailed it with Miss Marple too.",/review/rw8842558/?ref_=tt_urv
23 April 2020,carmenjulianna,10," ""Geraldine McEwan"" Is by far the Greatest Miss Marple.!!!
","I too read the Agatha Christie books as a teenager, especially the ""Miss Marple"" books, and I can honestly say that Miss Geraldine McEwens version of Marple is the epitome of everything I envisaged Marples character to be. She is Fabulously Intriguing, Mystifying, and Spot-On.! I love her facial expressions when she is deliberating her calculations,queries and suspicions, it really does make one excited and intrigued...ðŸ¤” How any reviewer could ever state Geraldines version is not a Spot-On performance is in a daydream, and watching another channel or programme, or either they must be upside down...ðŸ˜¶
I was so disappointed when Geraldine left the series and was replaced by Julia McKenzie, it was a disappointment! Her version was so far less effective and an inferior outlook with regards to Miss McEwans, and her attire was confusing; a far cry to what Marple had been potrayed as previously (by Mckewan)
I know each actress likes to incorporate their own take on a character, but Julia McKenzies version of Marple is of a much more cold and disconnected Marple; not at all like the homely, warm and a comforting Marple character played by Geraldine McEwan. A less connective performance I would say. One would believe she had forgotten her lines mostly, due to each of her performances taking too long to materialise. Those unflattering suits were so unappealing and drab, and those awful hats...unlike McEwans lovely cardigans, cosy flowery hats and knitting bag; well, what more can you say...ðŸ˜Š I just didn't think McKenzies Marple worked. I really didn't enjoy the Marple series after Mckewan left, other than the episode ""Endless Night"" which was one of the better episodes of the last three series.
My favourite episodes are "" 'Bertrams Hotel' 'The Sittaford Mystery' 'Sleeping Murder' and 'By the Pricking of my thumbs'. loving the re-runs of 'Miss Marple' on Itv3, I never tire of watching them...ðŸ˜Š
I Recommend anyone and everyone who loves mystery and suspense, to watch at least the first three series of 'Marple' then follow-it-on until the end of the six series.. then, judge for yourself... you'll really enjoy them all and be in for a remarkable treat.!

4 January 2021,sherryzmezzo-21216,2," Worst Miss Marple ever
","Miss Marple, as written by Agatha Christie, was not proactive or aggressive. She was written to seem very fluffy-headed. Hercule Poirot had his ""little gray cells""; Miss Marple's ability came from her ability to see patterns in events and people's behavior. She did so while watching events from a distance.",/review/rw8842558/?ref_=tt_urv
1 July 2021,slabihoud,8," McEwan wins
","I have to disagree with one of the other reviewers comments on the actresses playing Ms. Marple. First of all, comparing it with the Poirot series featuring David Suchet is quite unfair since Suchet's character as a famous detective is always on the forefront of the stories, as in the books. Ms. Marple, on the other hand, is an amateur and an old lady, a more overlooked person who works in the background.",/review/rw8842558/?ref_=tt_urv
16 June 2014,pirslya,9," So enjoyable to watch!!
","well, I haven't really read any books of Agatha Christie (except The Death on the Nile) and as a viewer, I found this series so enjoyable! and my favorite Miss Marple is Geraldine McEwan because i thought she amused me kind of sad she didn't continue but it's understandable! when the plot was sometimes didn't really work on me, I thought it's something that made me want to watch it more and ended up wanting to watch more. It's one of the first British TV series that I watched, and it's something that I wouldn't regret. Ms. Marple is such an unique and authentic character, and it's kind of unfortunate she didn't as popular as Poirot.",/review/rw8842558/?ref_=tt_urv

5 July 2022,sarahwarner-09921,10," Worthy of 10
","I am an Agatha Christie scholar, who has researched her work for years. Does that make me a better viewer? Not necessarily, but a more attentive one. I can honestly say this is one of the best TV adaptations and definitely worth of 10 stars. It's got everything and more. Please give it a chance and stop comparing it against other productions.",/review/rw8842558/?ref_=tt_urv
24 July 2018,Kirpianuscus,," versions
","The key for taste this serie , in my case, was to ignore the portrait of Miss Marple created by Agatha Christie. because each actress in this role, gives her nuances and colors and accents to it. so, the war was between Geraldine Mc Ewan and Julia McKenzie. both are admirable. the difference - maybe the manner to define the character. in the case of lady McEwan , the good intention was the lead aspect. the hard try to give to her character consistence. the result was decent and honorable. Julia McKenzie propose, maybe, a more familiar version. more comfortable. and , at first sigh, more inspired.",/review/rw8842558/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2021,phlbrq58,8," Overall I dig this series. Viewers who opine through a political lens are annoying.
","Updating and altering A C is well warranted given this follows Joan Hickson's excellent Marple. So, great guest stars, well written adaptations with sensitivity to the original tone plus high production values make this easy to rewatch and enjoy. Lesbians! OMG. ""Political correctness has gone too""...oh please shut up! Review the entertainment, not your cliched social outrage. I'm a little less annoyed by AC devotees since theyve earned some proprietary rights and I'm interested in plot and character changes. But I think her creations are open to script and character exploration. Strict adherence to text....tiresome.",/review/rw8842558/?ref_=tt_urv
31 March 2012,benosler,2," Mediocre At Best
","Geraldine McEwan was a young looking 70-yr-old woman when she started making this series. For this part she was trying to be older which is all too obvious. She also speaks in a most peculiar and affected way; as though she is trying to put on a crusty accent but failing to do it without looking as though a great deal of effort is involved. It all adds up to terrible acting which could be forgiven were other actors pulling their weight. Unfortunately this is not the case. There are many ""guest actors"" (putting it politely) throughout the series who come from other backgrounds. Russ Abbot is a terrible comedian but a truly dismal actor and almost the same can be said for Dawn French. The whole series is rife with ""jobs for the boys"" (and girls) and this does Agatha Christie's stories a gross injustice. Don't bother with this series. It is absolutely abysmal. Yes, production techniques had improved by the noughties and yes... there are many lush flashback scenes that one doesn't find in earlier adaptations but this is not enough to make up for the sheer lack of any acting worth its salt. Instead of wasting time watching this series I'd urge anyone to watch the 1980s production instead with Joan Hickson playing the main part. It may be a bit dated but it's full of real actors who take a pride in their profession rather that egotists who are all trying to steal the limelight at the same time.",/review/rw8842558/?ref_=tt_urv
9 February 2019,filipemanuelneto,7," An impeccable series, that only loses by the little strength and charisma of the main character.
","This British television series adapted all the tales and novels where Agatha Christie included, as the main character, Miss Marple, an elderly lady, who never married, and who lives alone in a village house. She's particularly gifted as the subject is to solve complicated puzzles, which allows her to almost always solve crimes and find murderers when the police don't know what to do. I didn't do an exhaustive research to know, but I think there may be a connection between this series and ""Agatha Christie's Poirot"", which did the same work with novels of the same writer, but with another main character. It would not be something extraordinary.",/review/rw8842558/?ref_=tt_urv
23 January 2022,safenoe,8," Charming and sharp

3 August 2016,caviar1234,10," A very worthy series despite being controversial.
","As many negative reviews as this series has received for taking too much liberty of Dame Agatha Christie's original work, I must admit that I find it quite enjoyable to watch. I personally don't mind it changed some of Dame Agatha's below-average original novels, and find a few of these adaptions quite interesting and even can be said as an improvement of to the original, especially for her late work such as At Bertram's Hotel, By the Pricking of My Thumbs, Nemesis and so on. The only one in my opinion goes way too far is Murder Is Easy. The incest element in this story could have made a decent episode of Midsomer Murders, but it's never for Agatha Christie adaptions and never will be! As for the cast, I like the portray of both McEwan and McKenzie, but find the two actresses too much of a contrary to each other, especially for the same character in a consecutive TV series. As for regular writers, Kevin Elyot's scripts are always relatively faithful ones, but sometimes it makes the film feel rather dull, most notably being A Pocket Full of Rye. Stewart Harcourt could always do some interesting changes while keeping the core of the original stories, I like most of his work except for Ordeal By Innocence. Paul Rutman wrote two episodes with quite different styles: They Do It with Mirrors is a rather faithful adaption to the original story, while The Secret of Chimneys is a total rewrite! As for Stephen Churchett, he's the one that brings many of his own ideas to the source material, sometimes they work to me, such as Nemesis and The Sittaford Mystery, and sometimes they don't, most notably being Sleeping Murder and, of course, Murder Is Easy, due to their incest themes. But dare I say that as many people might criticize this series for its ""reinventing"" attempts, I still praise ITV's courage of trying to seek a new way to make Christie's work being accepted to the audience, despite the controversial feed backs.",/review/rw8842558/?ref_=tt_urv

3 September 2018,eireluvr-54089,8," Let Go of Your Expectations
","My best advice for viewers of this series, especially for diehard Christie fans? Let everything you know about Miss Marple GO. Let it go, forget what you've read, what you've watched. Give up on comparisons. Let the 30's become the 50's. Let the artistic liberties override the canon. Stop being the Christie aficionado, expert, fanatic.

","Agatha Christie is a marvel. One of her best her legacies, Marple will outlive us by far. In this new series, the suspension of disbelief wraps you until the the end. The actors are splendid. The plots are so well-developed, the acting so human yet precise, I feel as if I am there with them, more suspension of disbelief.

27 August 2021,mrgatlin,5," Ignore the remakes-stick with the new stories
","To me Joan Hickson will always be the definitive Jane Marple and those adaptations are much closer to the original Christie stories. I found all the films that remake those stories (and usually have changed the stories and characters for the worse) not worth the watching time. However the adaptations of stories that weren't originally Marple stories (The Sittaford Mystery, Towards Zero, Why Didn't They Ask Evans) we're enjoyable and didn't suffer in comparison.",/review/rw8842558/?ref_=tt_urv
31 January 2023,SunnyDaise,5," Looks stunning, well acted, but too much rewriting
","I absolutely love the look of this series and of course it is always great to see familiar faces from the acting world pop up, but I hate that the plots were rewritten so much. For many, Agatha Christie is the Godmother of crime-writing, so it just seems disrespectful to change the plot and even sometimes the killer for the sake of ... nothing important! I'll be going back to the Joan Hickson ones, even though I don't know so many of the cast. Such a shame these 2000s ones weren't up to Christie's standard - I hope the next reincarnation will be, as it is one of the few major roles for older actresses.",/review/rw8842558/?ref_=tt_urv
