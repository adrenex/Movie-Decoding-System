9 October 2014,agnabeya,10," I don't know why.....
","?..........But I love this new series. It's not a laugh out loud comedy, but it makes me smile throughout and the half hour episode is finished far too quickly. It's a gentle comedy based on the lives of a metal detectorist club and the characters in that club. There is a mad farmer with imaginary dogs who gives the two main characters permission to scan his fields, except the paddock. No one is ever to go near the paddock! I wonder why? His wife did disappear many years ago, but I have a feeling that will have nothing to do with his aversion to paddock diggers. The characters have been written so well and the direction, also by McKenzie Crook, are intriguingly watchable. Mr Crook is a talented man and after only two episodes I know this will be a favourite with me.",/review/rw3119061/?ref_=tt_urv
7 October 2015,LouieInLove,10," Unpretentious Exellence - Simple & Beautifully Delivered
","I have such high praise for this show. It is simple & heartfelt, beautifully delivered, devoid of pretence and PC twiddling (which is a near miracle to be seen on the BBC these days).",/review/rw3119061/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2014,plan99,10," Brilliant. The best comedy for years.
",As this has been tucked away on BBC4 at 10.00 pm on a Thursday night I have been recommending it to plenty of people who might have missed it.,/review/rw3119061/?ref_=tt_urv
9 November 2014,Jorgosch,9," Heartwarming
","Congratulations to Mr. Crook to have created something that I can only describe as love at first sight. The series takes a look at key situations that most adults have been through while putting them in a context that feels fresh. Mr. Crook may be guilty of a bit of viewer manipulation by depicting the main characters as meek and sometimes naive who face bullies and mocking. This is easily forgiven, though, because of the stellar cast that makes each and every persona feel real, believable and truly likable. Apart from that each character down to the smallest role has something unique that sets them apart. There is wisdom to be found here, and peace, if you have the patience. Sometimes life tosses you a gold coin and sometimes a ring pull - just go with it, it will balance out it in the end. A true dramedy gem. 9/10.",/review/rw3119061/?ref_=tt_urv
7 March 2016,poe-48833,10," Buried treasure(s)...
","DETECTORISTS qualifies at once as a very dramatic Drama as well an as outstanding (and often slyly subtle) Comedy; not an easy blend, not at all. That the Star of the show is also both Writer and Director is truly amazing: one would think that, given the surprisingly superior QUALITY of the entire series, that there must've been many MORE hands involved in their production. Crook is indeed a Triple Threat. I must admit that I felt somewhat schizophrenic watching DETECTORISTS, laughing out loud at one moment and crying like a baby the next. Without a doubt, one of the finest shows I've ever happened across. I highly recommend it.",/review/rw3119061/?ref_=tt_urv
12 August 2021,Tweekums,10," A great comedy with few obvious gags
","This gentle comedy is centred on Andy and Lance, two metal detectorists hoping to find items of historical value in the Essex countryside. They are part of a small club of likeminded individuals but tend to go detecting only with each other. The world of detecting is fairly quiet but some conflict is introduced through a pair of detectorists from a rival club dubbed 'Simon and Garfunkle' and the arrival of Sophie, a young woman who both men try to impress. Away from their hobby Andy is trying to make his relationship with Becky work while Lance is having difficulty getting over his ex-wife.",/review/rw3119061/?ref_=tt_urv

",I am adding this review so that anyone interested in the show knows not to read the Netflix Description they give a detailed summary of each entire episode - why ? I get that we kind of might want to know Something but do we want to know every single thing that's going to happen ? even the surprises ? No,/review/rw3119061/?ref_=tt_urv
8 November 2014,carson120,9," A diamond in the dross of TV sitcoms
","Andy and Lance live in a rural English backwater that on the surface seems boring and uneventful. Mackenzie Crook's genius is to show us the comic gold that lies beneath. I'm not talking of the Saxon gold that our two heroes are searching for, but the ups and downs they face on their journey through life. ",/review/rw3119061/?ref_=tt_urv

6 November 2014,jemwand,10," Dry, Intelligent and Endearing
","Mackenzie Crook's Detectorist's is not your average Sitcom, over the six episodes of the first series it delivers central characters who are desperately melancholy, yet intelligent. There are very few clich√©'s in this series. The story evolves, as do the characters with warmth and depth. The humour is dry and the belly laughs are few and far between, but what I found was a comedy of great sensitivity, with emotional depth and was ultimately deeply rewarding.I hope that if a second series is developed that it doesn't deviate from it's path because Detectorists (there's no apostrophe in Detectorists) really is gold. Detectorists is probably the most complete comedy sit com of all time, it's gentle humour really shines.",/review/rw3119061/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2021,suttonpeter,10," Golden
","How many comedies can also bring a tear to the eye? The genius of this show lies in it's glorious simplicity, a true celebration of the now, and the everyday. Down to earth, yet infinitely profound. The mockery of one another that has love in it's background. The inherent loving kindness of all of humanity is exposed somehow, with all of our struggles, in this dead-pan comedy. For some reason, I feel this is one of the most mystical programs I've ever watched, and it's not easy to say why. Perhaps it is the effortless wabi sabi, unhewn log, almost Buddhist feel?! Anyway, enjoy!",/review/rw3119061/?ref_=tt_urv
11 April 2017,vpck100-15-672657,," Metal Detecting IS and IS NOT what this show is all about
","Most people wouldn't even begin to watch this series due to the basic premise of this show. A couple of Brit buddies roaming around fields, looking for stuff with metal detectors. Truly, that is the LEAST of what this show is all about. The metal detector element, just enhances what is truly great TV.",/review/rw3119061/?ref_=tt_urv

18 August 2015,lionlake,10," Laugh out loud humor, adorable cast
","I found this series on Acorn.TV. I love British shows anyway, but this was exceptional. This is dead-pan humor at its finest. The two main characters were lovable, funny and real. The supporting cast was great as well. This is not your typical Hollywood ""Aren't we funny"" predictable comedy, where you can tell what is coming next and they have to point out the humor in case you are to dumb to get it. With this show, the humor is subtle and delivered ingeniously. The situation is very believable, but delightfully silly as well. I hope this comes out for a second year, but it is great as it is as well. Well done you!!",/review/rw3119061/?ref_=tt_urv
7 November 2014,pcs-153-85372,10," you don't have to be a male hobbyist but it helps....
","Having said that er indoors liked this series almost as much as I did. Utterly, totally and brilliantly observed and written , and if like me you're a lapsed detectorist, this will leave you wanting to get your kit out of the loft. It's the 'casual' details, eg: ""What you got ? "" .... pause.. "" Bikky foil ""pause... "" Viscount mint "" . Just so true. Only complaint is 30 minutes only so was over too soon. And the very last scene is sheer magic , don't miss any of it :0))) Oh and the reference to male hobbyists in the last episode, when did you last see a female trainspotter ? Never. I totally agree with above previous comments about the utter crap that poses as 'comedy', this series is in a completely different league.",/review/rw3119061/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2017,dickstroker-18028,10," Watch Detectorists! Charming funny and inspired
","We loved this, streaming both seasons of episodes from Netflix. So sad they didn't pick it up for a 3rd season and beyond. It's a bit like an understated version of Andy of Mayberry for the Brits, a slice of English country life with adorable quirky characters. Toby Jones and the rest of the cast are spot on. It made me want to go visit the English countryside again. This time with a metal detector. Doing some research, I see that they filmed in Framlingham. Framlingham's most famous attraction is its Norman castle, where Mary Tudor was proclaimed Queen of England in 1553. But the first Detectorists landmark is next door: the Scout Hall where Danebury Metal Detecting Club meet, better known to locals as St Michaels Rooms, which are available for hire if you'd like to host your own meeting (I just might do that).",/review/rw3119061/?ref_=tt_urv

8 February 2018,debi_casey,10," A perfect sitcom
","The problem with shows like this is they take them off the air. No nudity, no violence, no laugh track. A person has to actually just sit and enjoy it. You smile, you laugh, you cry. You are not hit over the head by moronic jokes. The acting is superb. Not overacted but perfectly done. Quiet, subtle, honest. Please, someone out there take pity on the mature audience. Not everyone likes the 3 Stooges. Thank you for giving us this show. Don't take it away.",/review/rw3119061/?ref_=tt_urv
