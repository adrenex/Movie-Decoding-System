","After performing a tough mission in The Suicide Squad, Peacemaker takes on a new mission with a new team.",/review/rw7825943/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2023,Supermanfan-13,9," Really Enjoyed It!
","Peacemaker was every bit as good as I had hoped for. I'm case you were wondering this takes place immediately after The Suicide Squad and much like The Suicide Squad, this is absolutely a show for adults with all the violence, language, etc and I loved every second of it. John Cena has come so far as an actor, he continues to get better and has followed The Rock to be another A list actor from the wrestling world! Gunn definitely put his stamp on this having written all 8 episodes and directing 5. If you're looking for a great action Superhero show that will make you laugh out loud then this is the show for you!",/review/rw7825943/?ref_=tt_urv
30 January 2023,DiCaprioFan13,9," Terrific!!
","I can't believe how much I loved Peacemaker! I've been looking forward to this ever since I first heard about it. I actually binged the entire first season over the a weekend. John Cena is a bonafide star now. He's so good in this, even better than he was in Suicide Squad. James Gunn has hit another home run with Peacemaker. It seems that every single thing Gunn touches is great. I read that he's taken over as the co head of DC studios. That's the best news to happen to DC in a long time. I'm sure he'll do a great job. Peacemaker has everything you want in a good superhero show...it has action, drama, comedy, twists, etc. I can not recommend this show enough!",/review/rw7825943/?ref_=tt_urv
3 April 2022,cherold,9," A wild, hilarious ride
","I loved 2021's Suicide Squad, but if you'd asked me who from the movie I would give their own series, Peacemaker would probably have been my last choice. Not that John Cena wasn't good, but who'd want to be stuck with that guy week after week?",/review/rw7825943/?ref_=tt_urv

",Violent and Hilarious ride,/review/rw7825943/?ref_=tt_urv
27 December 2022,OceanGirl941,8," It's as entertaining as Gunn's interviews
","Just as Gunn pulls no punches when explaining his creations in interviews, the writing for this show also doesn't hold back. It's The Boys level of shock and awe. I remember thinking that on my first watch through.",/review/rw7825943/?ref_=tt_urv
25 February 2022,Top_Dawg_Critic,9," This series is so juvenile, absurd, ridiculous, obnoxious, profane, raunchy, ludacris, sociopathic, outlandish... and I LOVE IT!
","This show is right up there with my favorite superhero film series of all time, Guardians of the Galaxy, coincidently also written and directed by the brilliant and crazy like-minded James Gunn. But what makes this show so addictively watchable and entertaining, is the award-worthy insanely funny and perfect performance by Cena. I can't see anyone else pulling this off as well as he did. This guy legit is a skilled actor, whether it's his action performances, emotional displays, or his perfect comedic timing and deadpan delivery. I mean wow, I'm hooked!",/review/rw7825943/?ref_=tt_urv
29 December 2022,redx1708,10," This is HUGE !!!
","Hands down, this is the greatest superhero show I've watched for a long time if ever.",/review/rw7825943/?ref_=tt_urv
19 December 2022,Woozywoowoo,9," Finally something good besides the boys
","This has everything, the humor is exactly what I like, kind of raunchy in a funny way, the action was great, I didn't get bored and it kept me wanting more. I definitely would say this is a hit in my book.",/review/rw7825943/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2022,GomezAddams666,9," I cherish peace with all of my heart.
","There's nothing worse than lying to yourself, and I am honest with myself and everyone else when I say I have a twisted sense of humor, specially when enjoyed every second of this violent and irreverent series.",/review/rw7825943/?ref_=tt_urv
16 January 2022,stevebondi,8," Loads of fun and laughs like The Suicide Squad! :-)
",A great dysfunctional set of characters with a cool eagle and cool visuals! :-) Hilarious irreverent humor delivered perfectly by John Cena! :-) It also has a good set of supporting cast!,/review/rw7825943/?ref_=tt_urv
26 August 2022,loganschainker,9," Surprisingly Good
","I was expecting Peacemaker to be awful, and it wound up having a lot of heart. James Gunn does it again with taking an obscure comic-book character (or characters) and making them household names.",/review/rw7825943/?ref_=tt_urv
18 January 2022,UniqueParticle,10," I love Peacemaker so far I don't know understand the hate!
","Maybe cause I'm a huge James Gunn fan and loved The Suicide Squad movie I appreciate this series for what it is. I don't get the complains about the writing it's pretty solid maybe to much profanity otherwise it's brilliant and flows well! The music, cinematography, and humor and exciting vibes is all superb at least I'm excited for more; plus I crave anything woke I never understand the ones that bash brilliant/bold shows or movies.",/review/rw7825943/?ref_=tt_urv
12 November 2022,Jonathanb-97,8," DC at its best
","John Cena was great in the suicide squad movie and was very funny and really wanted too see what he would be like in his own show. I thought every episode of this season was amazing the humour,action,suspense and violet/sexual scenes were amazing and there was not a character in the show that I did not like and there is definitely a cliffhanger at the end of the show and honestly I could not stop watching it as it was so good and funny. I really hope they make a season 2 and there is a lot to explore and James Gunn the director of both peacemaker and the suicide squad and guardians of the galaxy movie series was a right choice as he is going to be the future of dc and can't wait too see what he does and what he does with this show peacemaker especially. Solid 8/10.",/review/rw7825943/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2022,skip-98756,9," Some Incredibly Good Writing and Loveable Characters!
","Wow! I was Not expecting This! John Cena just blew me away with his likeability and just some of the funniest
comedy I have seen since I can remember in such a show..The only other with such irreverant, side splitting ,raunchy laughs is The Boys.",/review/rw7825943/?ref_=tt_urv
5 November 2022,john-87402,8," I wish Marvel had balls like this:
",After rewatching a few DC movies and Peacemaker for the first time I believe with Gunn and company in charge of the DCU they are in a potentially good place.,/review/rw7825943/?ref_=tt_urv

13 January 2022,travis-a-greene,8," DC is starting to find its film universe lane
","DC is finding its lane as the anti, non family friendly, comedically dark (or just dark dark) alternative to Marvel and I'm here for it. Gunn continues on his raunchy, goofy take on super heroes and while I guarantee it won't be everyone's cup of tea I believe it will be a smart move in the long run to go full on with the dark, more adult adaption of comics to contrast with Marvels increasingly Disneyfied approach.",/review/rw7825943/?ref_=tt_urv
14 January 2022,terrylarosa,9," Laughed from beginning to end
",Terrific first ep. I didn't like his character at all in the movie but Cena shines here. Some really funny stuff and a spectacular fight at the end. The other characters including Eagly are immensely entertaining to watch. Hats off to all involved. Looking forward to the rest of eps.,/review/rw7825943/?ref_=tt_urv
19 February 2022,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,8," Bravo James Gunn !
","My favorite character in ""The Suicide Squad"" was ""Peacemaker"", but when I heard that the Series was going to be made, I wasn't very enthusiastic, but I watched it anyway and said ""wow"". It was a 4 times better series than I expected. The acting was perfect. Black comedy, action, music, I liked this series very much. I'm happy to season 2.",/review/rw7825943/?ref_=tt_urv
27 January 2023,Jei-Kuma,8," The way forward
","I put this series off for a while but eventually gave it a go, the overall presentation and the adult nature of this show make it a breath of fresh air for the DC franchise. It has the same tone as The Boys and the usual James Gunn feel to it. With Gunn now heading up DC hopefully this will be a new direction for the franchise. Unlike Marvel, DC's approach to TV shows could be what it needs if they follow this formula. Hopefully this universe is expanded on in the future with more shows like it.",/review/rw7825943/?ref_=tt_urv
22 February 2022,bertrandma,8," Off-beat super-antics
","I vaguely recall watching Suicide Squad and I vaguely recall it being extremely bad. Possibly I was high, but overall it can't be that memorable. Nonetheless (and although I'm a superhero skeptic) I ventured into this one, because of the American flag on the poster, and the vague 'Vertigo Comics' feel of it all. Well it's not gritty, in fact it's downright goofy, but it's a lot of fun - similar to The Boys for its take on superheroes, but less centred on (a rather generic) worldbuilding, and more focused on characterisation. The mixture of grotesque patriotism, extreme brutality, glam rock and testosterone-toilet humour was hard to pull off and Gunn generally succeedd, helped by a good performance of John Cena, and by some very catchy dialogues. The action is also quite good, low on digital effects and high on unexpected violence. I look forward to more.",/review/rw7825943/?ref_=tt_urv

2 February 2022,ksf-2,8," good stuff... cena and the crew
","From the world of dc comics, john cena is chris smith, self proclaimed peacemaker. He's strong enough to bail from the hospital, so he's back on the job. This opens with a quick summary of what came before. His mission, his jail sentence. And of course, the chip in his head that they can pop if he doesn't obey. So much cussing. And the violence. Not for the kiddies. When a one night stand goes very wrong, he realizes he's already caught up in a new mission. With harcourt and the crew to back him up, he's off to fight the butterflies. Lots of silly banter. Showing on hbomax. Good stuff! A new team member too. Written (and some episodes directed) by james gunn. Also did a whole lot of guardians of the galaxy.",/review/rw7825943/?ref_=tt_urv
