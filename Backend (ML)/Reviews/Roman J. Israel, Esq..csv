10 December 2017,juneebuggy,6," More of the same Bourne...but not in a good way
","This was a big letdown, I'd had been looking foreword to it for ages too but for the most part this was boring, the story line was... nothing... a same ole Bourne is trying to find out about his past, people in an office looking at computers trying to find him. Just flat, predictable and redundant.",/review/rw3513982/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2016,themadmovieman,7," As an action movie, it's great. As a true Bourne-like thriller, not so much.
","The original Bourne trilogy of Identity, Supremacy and Ultimatum were brilliant displays in effective storytelling and great action. Jason Bourne, however, isn't quite as proficient in both of those areas. On the one hand, it's action-packed to the brim, and provides for a hugely entertaining watch, but on the other, it's a disappointment as far as bringing yet another intriguing and truly thrilling mystery to life is concerned.",/review/rw3513982/?ref_=tt_urv

21 June 2017,TheLittleSongbird,5," Better than expected but even more pointless than 'The Bourne Legacy'

30 July 2016,goodtime-336-74081,4," Lack of intelligence in the intelligence community
","Greengrass returns to the Bourne franchise and brings with him the same cameraman with Parkinsons that he has used all to often in the past. The shaky camera thing is so old that it ruins what is an already pretty average movie. As with all previous Bourne movies this one suffers from credibility gaps but even more so than in the past. Even the Jeremy Renner version was better than this effort. The biggest problem I have with this offering is that even though Bourne and Nicky Parsons are portrayed as sharp as tacks and well versed in all aspects of covert ops and computer surveillance, especially facial recognition capabilities, they still run around with faces uncovered and wonder why the bad guys keep catching up with them. They keep making rookie mistakes all through the move. The first half was agony to sit through. Unless you are an intellectual midget with no eye for detail I'd save my bucks and wait for the free to air TV showing if you must see it!",/review/rw3513982/?ref_=tt_urv

","I've seen the other reviews of Jason Bourne and I am starting to question my own judgement, maybe I am too biased to write a review for this title. But I can't help it as I absolutely hated the movie. And I hated it after I had low expectations for the latest title, since I heard Tony Gilroy wasn't involved in the script.

30 July 2016,elboy,4," What a shame, Just plain boring. (my review doesn't give any plot away)
","How do you make Bourne boring? The original film is probably one of my favourite films. This one however, I just found myself rolling my eyes every few minutes especially during the first 30 minutes. After about 1.5 hours I had given up and was just waiting for it to finish.",/review/rw3513982/?ref_=tt_urv
4 September 2016,claudio_carvalho,7," Does not Disappoint the Fans
","In Reykjav√≠k, Iceland, Nicky Parsons (Julia Siles) hacks the CIA system to get secret programs. However, the efficient and ambitious Heather Lee (Alicia Vikander) from the computer system division inputs a malware to locate the files. Meanwhile, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) survives participating in illegal fights. Nicky travels to Greece to tell Jason Bourne that she got files from his recruitment in the Treadstone program. However, they are tracked down by the CIA and Director Robert Dewey (Tommy Lee Jones) sends the cold blood CIA assassin Asset (Vincent Cassel) to hunt them down since he is afraid that Bourne and Nicky will upload the files in Internet. Nicky is murdered by Asset but gives the key to a locker where the information is to Bourne that succeeds to escape. Bourne travels to Berlin where he meets Christian Dassault (Vinzenz Kiefer), who worked with Nicky. Bourne deciphers the files and finds that his father was the creator of the Treadstone program. However, they are located by the malware and Dewey sends a CIA team to hunt them down while Heather remotely deletes the files using Bourne's cellphone. However Bourne flees again but Christian dies. Bourne contacts the retired agent Malcolm Smith (Bill Camp) from the Treadstone and schedules a meeting with him in London trying to get more information. Meanwhile Heaher convinces Dewey to let her go to London to meet Bourne but he also sends Asset secretly to eliminate Heather's team and to kill Bourne. He succeeds to encounter Smith and learns the truth about who killed his father. His further investigation discloses Dewey's secret agenda and he travels to Las Vegas to stop Dewey, who is participating in a convention with the genius CEO of the Deep Dream Corporation.

6 September 2016,Cinemaniac1984,7," Jason Bourne makes a welcome return, although this movie is not in the same league as the Bourne trilogy.
","Jason Bourne makes a welcome return in the self titled Jason Bourne, although this movie is not in the same league as The Bourne Identity (2002), The Bourne Supremacy (2004), and The Bourne Ultimatum (2007). The Bourne Legacy (2012) saw the movie go in another direction with Jeremy Renner in the lead instead of Matt Damon however this was met with disappointing results. Jason Bourne sees Matt Damon slip back into one of his famous roles albeit some time has since passed.",/review/rw3513982/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2016,gigs1541,1," Jason Bourne walks for 2 hours
","This movie made me want to leave after one hour, and kill myself after 2 hours. I am a huge Bourne fan I was very exited for Matt Damons return to the Bourne franchise. Also there was fresh face of Alicia Vikander and not so fresh face of Tommy Lee Jones and Vincent Cassel as the bad guy so what can go wrong? Well it turns out if you have a horrible script, plot that only a person who wears helmet indoors can consider exiting you are left with the biggest disappointment in the cinema this year.",/review/rw3513982/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2016,sunznc,1," Tired and stale

2 August 2016,Rendanlovell,5," Most bland Bourne movie yet
","After nine years of waiting, Matt Damon is back in the role that really put him on the map. If you ask someone about him and what movies he was in then they will most likely talk about one of these. So when this was announced the hype was real. Not only did they get their star back but they got their director back. Aside from 'Identity' Paul Greengrass directed the three films that star our titular character. Like the others, this film revolves around Bourne trying to figure out aspects of his life. Instead of trying to piece together what happened to him, he is now attempting to figure out why it happened in the first place. Considering these films, this is the kind of story we really didn't need.",/review/rw3513982/?ref_=tt_urv
7 August 2016,matthewssilverhammer,2," Fittingly Forgettable
","While watching Jason Bourne, I glanced at my watch. Over an hour in, our hero had yet to do anything but broodily walk, until he finally did something (they thought was) cool: set off a bunch of fire alarms. Yep. This is how the almost-super-human spy agent uses his abilities in this latest installment. That lackluster thinking makes this film feel more like Greengrass and Damon's Green Zone than their Bourne films. Don't remember Green Zone? Exactly. Stultifying, sullen, and characterless, this should've been called Jason Boring. Much like the other amnesiatic spy's adventures, this film is basically just two worlds cut together: corrupt agents staring at computers and having charismaless conversations, and Bourne running around broodingly beating people up. Greengrass takes his refusal to keep the camera still to frustrating heights, as the camera is so close and incomprehensibly shaky, it's like what's happening in the combat and chase scenes is none of our business. Outside the terrible action, there's corny computer-hacking secondhand; a dizzying amount of location jumping; dispassionately convenient flashbacks; and a generic, drum-based action-thriller score Its biggest problem is it serves zero purpose within the Bourne franchise, or within movies at large, that we can get better of elsewhere. The other Bourne films and even the recent Captain America franchise have covered similar themes of governmental oversight and privacy to much stronger effect. What we're left with is a Jason Bourne who is now more angsty than he is awesome. So while some may be happy to revisit this series, I'm getting sick of watching Damon wear brown clothes and a one-shoulder-backpack walk around exotic cities with a sad look on his face.",/review/rw3513982/?ref_=tt_urv
30 July 2016,samuelrduncan,4," Worst Bourne Yet
",This was the worst Bourne flick yet and there is no way I will watch another one.,/review/rw3513982/?ref_=tt_urv
31 July 2016,dev_alok,5," Not a great Bourne movie
","To me Bourne movies changed the face of a genre. After the Bourne movies James Bond couldn't remain the same and had to morph to meet the new standards. In this movie, I found that there was nothing new. Head of agency is again evil. Him and the asset that is going against Bourne are conveniently the ones who also killed his father. Female lead was not well developed. We are not sure what her motives are and where she is coming from. Chases and fights were stale and we have seen those in previous Bourne movies. Overall this will not be a movie that will live up the reputation of other Bourne movies. It feels like a movie that was made in haste to cash the reputation of this series.",/review/rw3513982/?ref_=tt_urv
8 August 2016,mrudinec,1," The worst Bourne movie.

31 July 2016,AlejandroFCC,6," Surgeon's warning: Don't watch this from the first row
","The last Borne entry is just OK. Summer entertainment movie, no more, no less. On the bad side: The script is pointless and tricky, Alicia Vikander sounds really like a bad actress and the fist fights are poorly staged. But the worst problem here is the direction: one gets really tired of that shaky camera. I watched the movie from the 5th row of the Multiplex (escaping form the pop'corn munchies) and 5 minutes into the movie I was feeling dizzy alright. I cannot imagine what could be the effect of watching it from the first or second row.",/review/rw3513982/?ref_=tt_urv
22 July 2016,Cinefil_Original,7," Not as good as the ""Bourne"" trilogy but a good action movie!
","The Bourne franchise started with ""The Bourne Identity"" back in 2002, continued with ""The Bourne Supremacy"" in 2004 followed by ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" in 2007. I do not consider ""The Bourne Legacy""(2012) part of this franchise because Matt Damon didn't take part in it and because it has much lower quality in script and filming. ""The Bourne Identity""was one of the best action movies I had seen at the time and it really made an impression on me. The sequels were almost as good as the original, although they didn't have the same vibe. I will not go into details about this year's film since I don't want to spoil your fun. If you enjoyed the previous ""Bourne"" movies you will find ""Jason Bourne"" at least entertaining.",/review/rw3513982/?ref_=tt_urv
25 August 2016,Luigi Di Pilla,8," Great action and entertainment
",I could only say wow after I have seen it with one of my best friends in the theater. The car chases were amazing here. Seeing these scenes on the large screen is a great experience. The shaky hand camera didn't disturb so far as written so often in these reviews. The story is simply told with some little flaws that didn't influence the high pace and the perfect timed entertainment. At the end even a sequel could be possible. To the actors I can say that they all delivered a credibly top performance. Matt Damon especially is for me one of the best actors. Vincent Cassell was interesting to see in his villain role. Give this movie a chance and enjoy it. For all these reasons it merits 8/10.,/review/rw3513982/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2016,TheMovieDiorama,6," Not only a good sequel, but finally great action not dependent on CGI.
","Matt Damon returns to the franchise that made him an action star, Jason Bourne follows the eponymous character on a revenge flick where he discovers something personal about his life that lead him to the man he is today. Let me get this out of the way first, I love the Bourne trilogy...it is literally perfection (especially The Bourne Supremacy) so my expectations were sky high. Many will be comparing this to other films, in which case you might be slightly disappointed with the story. But, if you view this as just an action film without even acknowledging the previous films, you will be in for a treat as this is absolutely entertaining. I'm glad Matt Damon is back and director Paul Greengrass, the directing style is very realistic and even though he uses 'shaky cam' it is done extremely well that it is not disorientating. The supporting cast of Alicia Vikander, Tommy Lee Jones and Vincent Cassel were great, playing very professional yet broken characters. The action though, is just flawless. In an age where action films rely heavily on CGI, it is refreshing to see real stunts and real car chases. Sure the main car chase sequence set in Las Vegas is no where near as good as Supremacy's Moscow chase (which in my opinion, is the best chase scene ever), it is still energetic, fast-paced and will keep you on the edge of your seat. The story feels very suited to today's news stories with hacking and cyber security, the only problem is with have seen it all before in Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation and Spectre. Overall, this is a solid sequel that expands the character's tainted history with great action, a good realistic story and plenty of suspense. Ignore the critics on this one and you will not be disappointed.",/review/rw3513982/?ref_=tt_urv
