","It is not surprising that this film is tanking at the box office since it is much too long and slow paced for the average movie goer's attention span. Indeed parts of it, like the agonizingly protracted opening scene where a New Yorker magazine music critic interviews the title character about her classical music esthetics, seem designed by writer/director Tod Field as a boredom experiment wherein if you can survive it without running and screaming into the night out of sheer and utter ennui then you are worthy to see the rest of his ""masterpiece"".",/review/rw8829312/?ref_=tt_urv
20 October 2022,ferguson-6,8," the right note ... for a specific audience
","Greetings again from the darkness. I seriously doubt that I'll ever skip a Cate Blanchett movie. She's won two Oscars and has been nominated six times. She's consistently the best part of her movies, and often the best in a full year of movies. Here she stars in the first film in 16 years from the remarkable writer-director Todd Field. His two previous films, LITTLE CHILDREN (2006) and IN THE BEDROOM (2001) combined for eight Oscar nominations, and more importantly, established Mr. Field as a rare and unique filmmaker of great depth. Having Field reappear and cast Blanchett generated a heap of excitement from this film nerd.",/review/rw8829312/?ref_=tt_urv
25 October 2022,evanston_dad,9," All Hail Queen Blanchett
","I believe that people in positions of authority should be held accountable for their actions. I believe that terrible people can make miraculous art. I believe that people studying an art form have an obligation to understand and engage with the full history of that art form, even when it's made by people who identify very differently from them. I believe that 99% of people accused of misdeeds are guilty to some extent of those misdeeds. I believe that there are many people who seek to avoid engaging with complex ideas and perspectives that challenge them and make them uncomfortable. I believe that everyone is guilty at times of making sweeping generalizations about others. I believe that there are positive things we can learn from people who might be terrible in other ways. I believe that both people participating voluntarily in a transactional relationship bear responsibility for the outcomes of that relationship. I believe that people are incredibly complex and can be many things at once. I believe we live in a social media world that more and more doesn't want to acknowledge that and wants to be able to smack an easy meme and label on everything.",/review/rw8829312/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2023,garethcrook,7," Powerful stuff. Blanchett is incredible.
","Tár is a dense film. Thick with dialogue and emotional power. It's also a bit tricky to get in to and might be a bit much for the casual viewer. That's a shame though as it's great. Lydia Tár (Cate Blanchett) is a renowned concert conductor. An opening montage leads us into a live interview with the New Yorker, introducing her achievements to date. Let's just say it's a stellar CV. Right from the off, Tár is a force. Confident and assertive, but there are hints of the smallest of cracks. People will often misunderstand the role of a conductor, reducing it to something almost needless. Director and writer Todd Field knows this and lets that opening interview roll, as a device it not only introduces us to Tár, but the world of classical orchestration and her interpretation of it. Like I said, dense. At the top of her game, there's plenty of admirers, both publicly and professionally. Like Elliot Kaplan (Mark Strong) with a fantastic wig, who's told ""There's no glory for a robot, do your own thing"". Or a room full of nervous students at Juilliard, who also feel the wrath of Tár's uncompromising views. She's putting a lot of herself out there, is she as certain of herself as she appears though and when everything appears so perfect and controlled, what aren't we seeing. Those potential cracks show themselves through Francesca (Noémie Merlant), she's the assistant. Seemingly subordinate, she's clearly privy to some weakness, could be the weakness, or quite the opposite. Tár's partner Sharon (Nina Hoss) too. She has a fragility and brings out a tenderness in Tár, but there's something else. It's clear that Tár intends on retaining her position, status, power. Ruthlessly if required. These personal moments though really help the flow of this film. Although slightly bleak, they're a breath of fresh air in Tár's austere world. It's a beautiful world though. Rooms vast with modernist lines and understated grandeur. I find myself lost in these spaces as Tár too begins to ebb. I can imagine that classical music students might lap the opening acts up, it feels important. Is it though, or is it an impenetrable pretentious three hour indulgence. I'd say it's neither. It's a slow burning drama. That doesn't so much as unfold as gently slides into a darkness as Tár's facade crumbles. Accelerated by the arrival Olga (Sophie Kauer) a no nonsense Russian cellist, brought in to help a live performance recording of Mahler's Symphony No.5... but is anything but a stabilising presence. It demands your attention. Blanchett is incredible. It's an explosive performance. Utterly captivating. A singular pivotal presence. ""It's not a democracy"". She needs to be too. At not far off 3 hours, it's an intense experience. Be prepared to be patient, but you will be rewarded.",/review/rw8829312/?ref_=tt_urv

22 October 2022,levybob,5," How can a first hour seem like a year?

4 December 2022,Radu_A,6," great performances, weak storytelling
","Everybody writing about this mock biopic focuses on Cate Blanchett's knock-it-out-of-the-park performance, but when compared to Field's ""Little Children"" (2006), ""Tár"" lacks the storytelling and editing skills which make the earlier film a masterpiece of human relations, whereas the latter is an interesting character study that somehow collapses under its own weight.",/review/rw8829312/?ref_=tt_urv

","During the first minute of this film, Cate Blanchett shows what an extraordinary actress she is. Her character, star conductor Lydia Tár, is waiting to go onstage. There is no dialogue, only body language. But even without words, Blanchett shows what Tár thinks and feels.",/review/rw8829312/?ref_=tt_urv
29 October 2022,edb-5,4," Really disappointing.
","I went to this movie with great anticipation. As a classical music devotee, I was also anxious to see how it figured into the narrative. Yes, Cate Blanchett is fantastic in an Oscar-worthy performance, and other actors are fine as well. But good acting in a bad film isn't enough. The film is a tedious, pretentious mess, and worse, for the first two hours, it's boring. (For someone who knows or cares little about classical music, it must be painful.) Short scenes interspersed within the narrative are neither meaningful nor symbolic-- they just go nowhere and feel like self-indulgent artsiness. We learn much about Tár's ascendency to the top tier of her profession (as if someone is reading her Wikipedia page to us) but learn nothing about why Tár is the miserable human being she is. If it's simply meant to be a portrait of an unlikeable, imperious, narcissistic, and cruel personality, it generally succeeds. If it's a commentary of ""me-too"" and cancel culture, it's superficial at best. If we're supposed to care about her or her life, it fails. James Levine--been there, done that.",/review/rw8829312/?ref_=tt_urv

","This film uses the conventions of a documentary to explore its subject.

28 October 2022,UniqueParticle,9," Cate Blanchett deserves awards for her masterclass performance
","An orchestra legend Lydia Tar is a wife, mother, music teacher, and masterful leader! Thoroughly enjoyable film in the bulk of it except slow at times otherwise incredible directing by Todd Field. The sounds are so damn good throughout, nominations for sound and acting is riveting should be an essential part of Oscar's! Lydia was selfish at times and remarkable at being professional; at the same time she heard random sounds at night or during a run I believe her work consumed her Cate Blanchett extraordinary for everything. I really like too how Cate did her own stunt work at least with driving. Incredible experience all around highly recommend to most anyone.",/review/rw8829312/?ref_=tt_urv

","Todd Fields made one of the best directing debuts ever in 2001 with ""In the Bedroom"". His latest feature doesn't quite live up to those standards, but the stylistic undercurrent is still there.

","From Little Children to TÁR, Todd Field's first film in 16 years didn't disappoint. A slow-paced drama with a powerful performance from Cate Blanchett is a good watch.
