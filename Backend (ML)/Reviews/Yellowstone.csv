10 July 2008,neil-476,10," Utterly joyous
","I like, but don't love, musicals - my DVD shelves contain a selection, but the stuff there is pretty obvious: Singing in the Rain, King and I, Wizard of Oz, Moulin Rouge etc.. I'm not a Meryl Streep fan - I admire her craft, but mostly haven't liked the parts she's played. Conversely, I've always liked Abba's music. So that's my starting point when considering this movie which I have just been to see with my 80-year old mother.",/review/rw1904880/?ref_=tt_urv
18 November 2008,bob the moo,," If you think you'll love/hate it then you probably will  for the same reasons as those that feel the opposite way
","The critical and audience reactions to this film seemed to suggest that it was very much a Marmite of a film, with people either loving it or hating it. By the time I thought I should check it out, the ""biggest film of the year"" had become a sing-a-long classic and I decided to wait for the DVD. Watching it myself I can totally understand why this reaction was forthcoming and it is not really down to the film so much as it is the viewers. See, those that hate it will do so for the same reasons as those that love it. Mamma Mia is a film version of a stage-show but it is not an adaptation in that it has been made into a film so much as it is a stage musical made into a film. What I mean by this clunky sentence is that all the standards of the cheesy musical have been left in  from ""big"" action, colour and simple dumb cheer.",/review/rw1904880/?ref_=tt_urv
20 July 2008,Smells_Like_Cheese,8," Good light hearted fun for the summer
","With this big opening weekend either you're going to see the darker film The Dark Knight or you are going to see something more light hearted like Mamma Mia! Now I work at a movie theater, a lot of people were just assuming that everyone was going to see The Dark Knight, yesterday someone came up disappointed saying ""my show sold out""... I looked at her with a smiling face and said ""oh, yeah, dark knight, I know""... she said ""no, mamma mia"", I looked up all surprised, Mamma Mia sold out as well, people were really looking forward to this movie as well. I did see this movie on Saturday and really enjoyed it, as cheesy as it was, I do enjoy musicals, I think the only thing is that this this is the happiest musical that I have ever seen. So it was nice to just sit there and be happy with these characters and you can't help but laugh at the predicaments that they get themselves into.",/review/rw1904880/?ref_=tt_urv
13 July 2008,didi-5,7," A strong soundtrack, casting against type, and a few laughs
","As a musical, pure and simple, 'Mamma Mia' has the briefest and silliest of stories, backed up by a large selection of Abba songs (Super Trouper, SOS, Voulez Vous, Gimme Gimme Gimme, Money Money Money, Dancing Queen, The Winner Takes It All, Lay All Your Love On Me, Our Last Summer, Mamma Mia, etc.).",/review/rw1904880/?ref_=tt_urv

14 April 2022,Laura_Ratings,7," mamma mia!
","I didn't use to like this movie, but as I got older I started to love the movie more. It's definitely a cheesy movie and far from perfect, but it's a fun watch with catchy songs (duh, it's ABBA). It's not too long nor too short, so it's a perfect movie to watch when you're feeling down or to watch with friends on a movie-night.",/review/rw1904880/?ref_=tt_urv
17 July 2008,MOscarbradley,10," I'm Coming Out ... the year's guiltiest pleasure.
","I have a confession to make that could land me in serious trouble here. I love this movie with a love bordering on the unnatural. Of course, I hear you saying, that can only mean one thing; you're a gay man of a certain age and if you haven't come out of the closet already. you're coming out now, and wearing sequins at the same time. No straight man, I hear you say, could love this movie with this kind of unbridled passion, so if you have aspirations to being a 100% red-blooded heterosexual male, (is there such a thing?), then keep any fondness for ""Mama Mia"" to yourself; you will automatically be suspect. Of course, I could just as easily be a teenage girl, (it's a chick flick, after all), and be in equally serious difficulties with my peers, for loving ""Mama Mia"" would then mean I had already turned into my mother, for this is a chick flick for the older chick and no mistake.",/review/rw1904880/?ref_=tt_urv
19 July 2008,Buddy-51,5," Whose idea was it to make a musical where no one can sing or dance?
","Armed with irresistible hooks, soaring melodies and near-celestial vocal stylings, the Swedish pop group ABBA churned out a body of insanely catchy and superbly crafted tunes - ""Waterloo,"" ""SOS,"" ""Fernando,"" ""Dancing Queen,"" ""The Winner Takes it All,"" etc. - that made it the world's top-selling musical act of the 1970's and early 1980's. Several decades later, ABBA's music became the basis for a hit stage musical entitled ""Mamma Mia!"" in which a simple narrative was deftly woven around many of the quartet's songs. Now, the much-ballyhooed movie version of ""Mamma Mia!,"" written by Catherine Johnson and directed by Phyllida Lloyd, has arrived on the scene.",/review/rw1904880/?ref_=tt_urv

5 July 2008,sofie-17,9," Surprisingly good
","Went to see Mamma Mia without particularly high expectations. Not being a big connoisseur (or even fan) of musicals, I didn't really know what to expect. Though I adore ABBA, I never bothered to watch the stage production of Mamma Mia. But having a cinema membership, I didn't have much to lose (no money, at least), so I went for it. And boy, am I glad that I did! I can safely say that I enjoyed every second of it. And I'm not even ashamed to admit it!",/review/rw1904880/?ref_=tt_urv
10 July 2008,rayclister,7," James Bond needs singing lessons!
","I did enjoy this romp in the Greek Islands and was surprised at how well Meryl Streep sang. It's light, full of froth and bubble and perhaps has some aspects of Grease and Bollywood in it. The reason the music works I feel is that they haven't really messed with the arrangements of the songs keeping them generally faithful to the Abba originals. But Pierce Brosnan's vocal efforts were abysmal, almost laughable. Perhaps it was meant to be a send up of the original songs all the way through but he really did manage to mangle the vocals in my opinion. If you have seen the musical on stage you will know what to expect and there are some funny moments in the film and the Greek islands are as always a superb backdrop for the action.",/review/rw1904880/?ref_=tt_urv
22 October 2008,paudie,8," Very Enjoyable But Meryl is a Bit Scary!
","First a short summary. This film is a musical that uses the songs of Abba as a backdrop to a story about a girl who invites 3 men, one of whom is her father, to her wedding on a Greek island. She doesn't tell her mother this so needless to say much fun ensues before the inevitable happy ending. How could it fail? Thankfully it doesn't! ",/review/rw1904880/?ref_=tt_urv
19 June 2008,Blotkey,10," Wonderful
","I didn't know what to expect when going into watch ""Mamma Mia"", was this gonna be another Hairspray or Across the Universe or Rent? This was a lighthearted, quite enjoyable movie of its own style, Meryl Strep blew the entire audience away with her comedic persona in this movie. After seeing her in Devil Wears Prada, you are shaken momentarily after seeing her climb on top a roof singing ""Mamma Mia!"" and swoon and the dance teenage giddy girl dance. You'll love this movie for trio of older woman characters, they were all so funny. Mr. James Bond's character and singing was such a hilarious delight for the audience, we couldn't believe this was the man who played a top secret spy agent.",/review/rw1904880/?ref_=tt_urv

20 July 2008,moutonbear25,6," Super Pooper
","Let me tell you. Just because I've been listening to ABBA almost non-stop since I saw MAMMA MIA! two days ago does not mean I enjoyed the film all that much. It's just the Swedish pop super group's music is so darn infectious. You would think that energy would translate to feel-great good time at the movies but sadly this is not the case. First time feature filmmaker, Phyllida Lloyd, spends far too much time dragging her feet when they should be dancing up and down the beach and no matter how many shots of the moonlight shimmering against the waves there are, the film is still a clunker instead of a stunner.",/review/rw1904880/?ref_=tt_urv
8 July 2008,arichmondfwc,4," A Pretty Missfire
","Relentless like one of those loud action movies. The entire cast seems to be on speed. I didn't quite get the director's intentions if any. I wonder if she's ever seen a Stanley Donen, Vincent Minnelli or even a George Sidney musical. Structure, please! This is one hell of a mess and I loved Abba. The costumes the unflattering photography - unflattering towards the actors but loving towards the locations) The one thing that makes the whole thing bearable is the sight of Meryl Streep making a fool of herself. No chemistry with her friends (Christine Baranski and Julie Walters) think of Streep with Lily Tomlyn in the Altman film and you'll understand what I was hoping for. I was embarrassed in particular by Pierce Brosnam and Colin Firth. The audience, however, seemed to enjoy it so it probably it's just me.",/review/rw1904880/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie is two hours of music and happiness. This movie is an easy 11/10 method of being happy and one of my all time favourites. There is no ingenious plot or thought provoking question, and that's fine. Just sing along and enjoy.",/review/rw1904880/?ref_=tt_urv
17 December 2008,ametaphysicalshark,," Mamma Mia!
","So you meet a girl and you start talking, things are going really well, you share a lot of common interests. You're especially attracted to her because she loves both ""Mulholland Dr."" and ""Lifeforce"" and can discuss the minutest details of labyrinthine television giant ""Lost"". Another common interest is a shared, unabashed love of ABBA. You ask her if she's seen ""Mamma Mia!"", she says she hasn't but probably wants to at some point though it looks cheesy. The DVD's out a couple of days from the conversation, so she suggests watching it together. Now it's Wednesday, the DVD was out yesterday, but knowing that she has a thing for aging, over-the-hill action stars and the movies they are involved in you attempt, after watching the sugary-sweet trailer for ""Mamma Mia!"" again, to avoid it by suggesting that you rent ""Rambo"" instead (she doesn't know that you rented ""Mamma Mia!"" the night before this phone call). To your surprise she expresses relief, and you watch Stallone destroy what seems like the entire Burmese military force. The movie's dark and grim, more so than you expected, and not very good, but you have fun and everything goes great. Now you're confronted with the choice of either wasting your ""Mamma Mia!"" rental or sitting through it alone.",/review/rw1904880/?ref_=tt_urv

22 November 2009,meeza,1," Do not take a chance on this one!
","ABBA, Abbacadraba, I want to reach out and grab you! Why? In vengeance for the cinematic torture you put me through in experiencing the film adaption of the ABBA inspired musical ""Mamma Mia"". This asinine film stars Meryl Streep as Donna Sheridan, a rundown Greek hotel owner whose daughter Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is planning her upcoming nuptials in the Greek island. The primary ""Who is my real Pappa?"" premise of this film is that Sophie was never informed by Mamadonna who her real father is, even though there are three main candidates who Mamadonna went over the sexual borderline with twenty years ago. Sophie's choice then is to invite all three to the wedding so she can finally have ""faith"" to know the ""father figure"" truth. These Sophie Daddy nominees are the ""I still love Donna even though I dumped her after I did her"" Sam, the former hippie but now stable banker Harry, and the free spirit boat-aficionado Bill. Along for the wedding ride are also Donna's best friends: the lunatic Rosie, and the middle-aged lush Tanya. Throughout all this ""Who is your daddy?"" humdrum plot there are spurts of these characters singing away to ABBA tunes. All I can say is, to quote a classic ABBA hit- ""Gimme Gimme Gimme"" less of these ridiculous musical scenes; even though Meryl Streep's pipes were not as bad as I thought coming from a seasoned actress. I cannot say the same for The Three Dads who were Pierce Brosnan as Sam, Colin Firth as Harry, and Stellan Skarsgard as Bill. Brosnan was the main singing daddy here and his musical voice was undoubtedly both shaken & stirred. Let's just say that Brosnan's singing was ""The Matador"" to my ears. The ensemble acting of ""Mamma Mia"" was appalling but the ""main weapons of acting destruction"" were found in the performances of Julie Walters as Rosie and Christine Baranski as Tanya. Catherine Johnson's screenplay of ""Mamma Mia"" was dreary & wearisome, and Phyllida Lloyd's direction was as clumsy as direction can get. Harris Zambarloukos' unauthentic cinematography seemed like he used a Greece Photoshop software program for the film's look. So to cap this monstrosity of a film in musical fashion, I will use an ABBA tune: Do not ""take a chance"" on the musical horror of ""Mamma Mia"". *Failure",/review/rw1904880/?ref_=tt_urv

2 January 2009,badajoz-1,1," Sorry but where have all your critical faculties gone?
","Having avoided seeing the movie in the cinema, but buying the DVD for my wife for Xmas, I had to watch it. I did not expect much, which usually means I get more than I bargained for. But 'Mamma Mia' - utter, utter cr**. I like ABBA, I like the songs, I have the old LPs. But this film is just terrible. The stage show looks like a bit of a musical, but this races along with songs hurriedly following one another, no characterisation, the dance numbers (which were heavily choreographed according to the extras on the DVD) are just thrown away with only half the bodies ever on screen, the dance chorus of north Europeans appear on a small Greek island at will, while the set and set up of numbers would have disgraced Cliff Richard's musicals in the sixties!Meryl (see me I'm acting)Streep can't even make her usual mugging effective in an over-the-top musical! Her grand piece - 'The Winner Takes It All' - is Meryl at the Met! Note to director - it should have been shot in stillness with the camera gradually showing distance growing between Streep and Brosnan! Some of the singing is awful karaoke on amateur night. The camera cannot stop moving like bad MTV. One can never settle down and just enjoy the music, enthusiasm and characters. But what is even worse is how this botched piece of excre**** has become the highest grossing film in the UK and the best selling DVD to boot? Blair, Campbell and New Labour really have reduced the UK to zombies - critical faculties anyone???",/review/rw1904880/?ref_=tt_urv

","Went to an open theater last night here in Athens-Greece and all the audience was laughing their hearts out! Who cares about showing a bit of grotesque concerning ""modern Greece,"" i wish the real Greece was as shown in Mamma Mia--all dancing and singing. Awesome! It might look a bit too much of a comedy, but that's the whole point. Just enjoy it,laugh your heart outs, don't' even think about criticizing it and just have a wonderful night with it. Entertaining at its best! When will you ever get a chance to travel to an ideal Greek island with Meryl Streep, Peter Brosnan, Julie Waters etc, all dancing and singing with super high comedy involved.
