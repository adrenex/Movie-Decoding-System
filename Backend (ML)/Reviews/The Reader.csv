19 December 2001,alastair_m,10," A hilarious, warm movie in a world all its own.
","Not a lot of movies create their own sort of universe. Some that come to mind include ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""American Beauty"" and ""Vertigo."" These movies are so distinct and original that they seem to have created there own spot in the universe, untouchable by anything else. You can add ""le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"" to that list.",/review/rw0672392/?ref_=tt_urv
2 January 2003,mucronate,10," She makes ME fall in love too!
","To start off with, I heard a lot of good things about this movie when it was on the big screens but never got around to see it before it disappeared. Sitting here, long after in the aftermath, I might never forgive myself for missing that opportunity. Eventually I did get around to see it, though a small TV never does a film the same justice a theater does, and being a bit sceptic about the small hype this movie caused made me prejudice about it, but I must say I have never been so wrong before. And I am happy saying it.",/review/rw0672392/?ref_=tt_urv

27 March 2005,ztruk2001,10," Audrey Tautou is magical
","Amelie is a film that struck a certain chord with me. Every now and then movies come along that speak out to you and emotionally touch you in some way. Amelie is one such film for me. I related to its innocent charm and delightfully shy protagonist played by French sensation Audrey Tautou, the way very few films have. Part of the reason we watch movies is to learn something about ourselves or recognize characters that are remarkably similar to us and the way we are in real life. For all of us shy, introverted, quirky, and odd-ball eccentrics out there who have trouble relating to ""normal"" people, Audrey Tautou in this film is our personal hero. Instead of going into much detail about why the film works, I'll instead try to explain what it meant to me personally. Sure I guess this means I have to open up maybe more than I'd like to about myself, but oh well. The way Amelie's childhood was presented is similar to my own. I am an only child to divorced parents and very rarely had friends as I was and still am very much a loner. As a child much of my time was spent alone so I entertained myself in all kinds of silly ways. Just like Amelie does in the film. Of course I gained my fixation with films at an extremely early age, but also did stupid things like give my stuffed animals personalities and have conversations with them, draw pictures and create stories to go along with them, and laid in bed listening to the radio with the windows open on a lazy summer day imagining creatures out of the cloud formations. Apparently there are legions of us out there. Even today I enjoy solitude far more than the company of most people and still use my imagination to think of stupid little things. Amelie did an amazing job in capturing what the world is like through the eyes of a person who doesn't really fit in, but finds joy in the simple things in life. Like the fresh spring breeze on your face, the sound of the rain, the chirping of birds, the touch of fur, and popping bubble wrap. Actually popping bubble wrap was always an exciting and rare treat during my youth. Jean-Pierre Jeunet's film also has a marvelously fun nifty view of sex. For Amelie sex is not something that is intimidating, temptingly desirable, sinful, adult, or lustful. It's just another of the many silly things that people do in this world that make us human. Two people taking off their cloths and rubbing up against one another. How sweet! In fact many people have insulted the film for it's unique view and open attitude towards sex. For shame really. Sure there's a lot of it actually. Amelie's first sexual encounter, the orgasms, the object of her affection working in a porn shop with a stripper and putting price tags on didoes. But it's all in good fun and filmed with the naivety that a character like Amelie would view sex as. Anyways the movie really works. Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel does an excellent job in filming Jeunet's crazy vision and Audrey Tautou with her funky hairdo, wide brown eyes, and whimsical voice and kitten like mannerisms and shyness brings the movie to life. As I said I relate to this movie and understand the character the way I do with few other movies simply because it is frighteningly very much like I tend to be in real life.

9 January 2017,Hitchcoc,10," She. Captivates Us All
","There seems to be a movement afoot to diminish ratings on films, even if they are reasonably good. So someone looks at the 250 best films list and rather than actually review and give any sort of subjective review, they give it a one so they can sabotage the rating. This is a charming movie. It's not for everyone, but it is creative and kind and has a wonderful love story. Criticize a away, but to call a person with a desire to do good, even if she invades the spaces of people, a psychopath! Really. I guess that's the curse of the public forum. For those actually interested in the movie, it involves a young woman who has been sheltered by her parents. When the mother is killed by a falling body, she is left to her own designs. Her father is cold and disinterested and she must fend for herself. She becomes an observer of life and begins to formulate her own being. Her decision making is based on her personal journey and, in some cases, a lack of real education. She is a waif but only wants to do good. One of the most creative and loving movies ever produced.",/review/rw0672392/?ref_=tt_urv

","Waiting for `Amelie' to begin in a theater fraught with noisy college students drinking cheap beer, I wasn't expecting anything more than an over-hyped flick from our friends in France.  I slowly began to realize as I watched Amelie skip stones in the canal that for the very first time, a film deserved all of hype it had been accorded and more, and I felt so blessed to be a part of this revelation.",/review/rw0672392/?ref_=tt_urv
24 December 2015,Kirpianuscus,," the splendid grace
","the grace is the fundamental virtue of film. a grace as result of humor, childhood's crumbs, profound faith and love and joy and an actress who explores in wise manner each part from her character. a film who remains adorable for its deep force of freedom, high art and translation of every day reality in the right language who preserves the tools of fairy tale. a film about life as miracle. useful . charming. extraordinary. because it discover and not propose. because it is a crazy, magnificent trip in the essence of things. because it has not a specific genre. because it seems be only one of beautiful spring mornings.",/review/rw0672392/?ref_=tt_urv

8 January 2003,smatysia,6," Quintessential quirky French cinema
","Amelie is the quirky main character, who seems to go on a binge of ""random acts of kindness"" except that they aren't so random, and some are kind of mean. It is reasonably enjoyable, and probably worth a rental. I cannot fathom its ranking, though. I think that films should maybe be a few years old before being eligible for the top films of all times lists, like the top 250. I looked through that list and there are some new films which will be utterly forgotten in 20 years. I fear that ""Amelie"" will be among them. Grade: C",/review/rw0672392/?ref_=tt_urv

17 November 2009,kenjha,4," Annoying
","A smug-faced Parisian pixie with a tenuous grasp of reality decides she is going to influence other people's lives whether they like it or not. Amelie has got to be one of the most annoying characters in recent cinema. She is mousy, meddlesome, mean, and manipulative - and these characteristics are supposed to make her lovable. The film operates under the concept that quirky equals charming. The narration is supposed to be cute and funny, but is grating instead. The plot rambles on pointlessly. The director repeatedly uses zooms and weird sound effects to convey some sort of whimsical film-making but manages to simply be distracting. It's unbelievable that this won an Oscar.",/review/rw0672392/?ref_=tt_urv

","I loved the style of it. This film is very colourful, the editing is interesting, the music and camera work is great.
For the story I'm not too fond. The protagonist girl is playing with other characters, to some she sets traps, to some she plays with their feelings and minds, to some he gives clues and mystery. It's all a game for her.

","There are no complaints when watching ""Amelie."" It is pleasant enough, and it even displays a bit of depth that is the hallmark of better romantic and ""feel good"" comedies. However--- it isn't a great movie. It is no masterpiece. The foppish poseurs who drool over this light fare as if there were beholding some amazing jewel is getting a bit annoying. In the artsy theater in our town, I could hear the forced and hollow ""salon chuckles"" of the local cognoscente wannabes, as if displaying to us all that they, too, ""get it."" Humbug!
